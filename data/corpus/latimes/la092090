TROLLEY SERVICES AND $90 MILLION FOR HIGHWAY PROJECTS.

Doling out the rewards of an increased gasoline tax, the California 
Transportation Commission on Wednesday approved $5.4 billion in new road and 
rail projects designed to unclog streets and freeways and nudge motorists out 
of their cars and into mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, the gubernatorial commission followed the recommendations 
of its staff in voting to give the bulk of the money to projects in urban areas 
like Los Angeles and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
In the state's population centers, the commission allotted as much money for 
commuter, urban and intercity rail projects as it did for road programs. Los 
Angeles County alone was slated to get $1.4 billion in rail projects. "This 
year's program is a very heavy rail program. We've never had anything like it 
before," said Peter Hathaway, the commission's deputy director for finance and 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County fared nearly as well, winning approval for $40 million to set 
up commuter rail service between Oceanside and San Diego, and $325 million for 
extensions and improvements to the San Diego Trolley. 
</P>
<P>
The only highway projects approved in San Diego County were a $90-million 
project to complete Interstate 15 along 40th Street, and $25 million to help 
build the California 125 freeway through Lemon Grove. However, the commission 
rejected $35 million to extend Route 125 north of La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
It also denied $120 million for a controversial interchange linking Interstates 
5 and 805 to a new east-west Route 56, which is a proposed freeway connecting 
Interstate 15 to I-5. The 5-805-56 interchange was also designed to widen the 
congested intersection of 5 and 805 to 24 lanes. It was approved by the 
California Coastal Commission just last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside rail link that did win funding is expected to have diesel-powered 
engines pulling at least 2,000 passengers daily aboard double-decker rail cars 
beginning in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Future improvements to the San Diego Trolley line include expanding the East 
Line from El Cajon to Santee, and the North Line from the Santa Fe Depot to Old 
Town. 
</P>
<P>
Other rail projects funded by the commission Wednesday included $500 million to 
help extend Metro Rail from the North Hollywood station to Sepulveda Boulevard 
in Van Nuys and $123 million for computer rail improvements for lines from Los 
Angeles to San Bernardino, Los Angeles to Ventura and from Fullerton to Redondo 
Junction. Another $105 million was alloted for construction of a light rail 
line from Norwalk-El Segundo to Westchester via Los Angeles International 
Airport and $350 million to construct a 13.6 mile light rail line from Sierra 
Madre Villa in eastern Pasadenea to Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
Both road and rail projects were spread out over seven years in a State 
Transportation Improvement Program, which set a tentative date for construction 
to begin and the total amount the state was willing to devote to each project. 
Even though the dollars for each project stacked up into the millions, few were 
given full funding. In most cases, commissioners expect local officials either 
to come back in later years for more money or to match the state dollars with 
local dollars. 
</P>
<P>
While money for the projects came from a variety of revenue sources, a gasoline 
tax increase and a $1 billion bond issue for rail transit approved by the 
voters in June enabled the commissioners to endorse hundreds of projects that 
had been delayed for years because of lack of funds. Motorists began paying a 
five-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase Aug 1. The tax will go up another 
penny each January for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a milestone State Transportation Improvement Program because there is 
finally some money," said Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the 
Senate Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners offered one note of caution, however, pointing out that their 
funding program counted on voters approving two more $1 billion bond issues for 
rail transit. If the two issues are either voted down or withdrawn from the 
ballot, Hathaway said there would have to be drastic cuts in the rail transit 
program. 
</P>
<P>
While projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars easily won commission 
approval, it was one of the smallest projects -- $5 million to begin purchasing 
right-of-way for closing the gap in the Long Beach Freeway -- that drew the 
most controversy. Although the money moves the project forward, no specific 
route has been designated. That awaits an environmental impact study. 
</P>
<P>
For decades South Pasadena officials have objected to the construction of a 
freeway through their city. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will take a final vote on the transportation improvement program 
today, but it is not expected to change its position on any of the projects 
approved Wednesday.

TRANSPORTATION: THE BULK OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO UNCLOG 
FREEWAYS AND INDUCE COMMUTERS TO USE RAPID TRANSIT IN URBAN AREAS.

Doling out the rewards of an increased gasoline tax, the California 
Transportation Commission on Wednesday approved $5.4 billion in new road and 
rail projects designed to unclog streets and freeways and nudge motorists out 
of their cars and into mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions the gubernatorial commission followed the recommendations 
of its staff in voting to give the bulk of the money to projects in urban areas 
like Los Angeles County where freeway congestion has become as much of a daily 
irritant as smog and crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the state's population centers, the commission allotted as much money for 
commuter, urban and intercity rail projects as it did for road programs. Los 
Angeles County alone was slated to get $1.4 billion in rail projects. "This 
year's program is a very heavy rail program. We've never had anything like it 
before," said Peter Hathaway, the commission's deputy director for finance and 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
The rail projects included $500 million to help extend Metro Rail from the 
North Hollywood station to Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys and $123 million for 
computer rail improvements for lines from Los Angeles to San Bernardino, Los 
Angeles to Ventura and from Fullerton to Redondo Junction. Another $105 million 
was alloted for construction of a light rail line from Norwalk-El Segundo to 
Westchester via Los Angeles International Airport and $350 million to construct 
a 13.6-mile light rail line from Sierra Madre Villa in eastern Pasadena to 
Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
Both road and rail projects were spread out over seven years in a State 
Transportation Improvement Program, which set a tentative date for construction 
to begin and the total amount the state was willing to devote to each project. 
Even though the dollars for each project stacked up into the millions, few were 
given full funding. In most cases, commissioners expect local officials either 
to come back in later years for more money or to match the state dollars with 
local dollars. 
</P>
<P>
While money for the projects came from a variety of revenue sources, a gasoline 
tax increase and a $1-billion bond issue for rail transit approved by the 
voters in June enabled the commissioners to endorse hundreds of projects that 
had been delayed for years because of lack of funds. Motorists began paying a 
5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase Aug 1. The tax will go up another penny 
each January for the next four years. 
</P>

Senate Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>

most controversy. Although the money moves the project forward, no specific 
route has been designated. That awaits an environmental impact study. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Rossmann, an attorney for South Pasadena, appealed to the commission to 
delete the project -- arguing that the money could be better used for other, 
more popular, road programs. For decades South Pasadena officials have objected 
to the construction of a freeway through their city. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the project a "casualty" of years of controversy, Commissioner Bruce 
Nestande urged the panel to abandon it. Nestande was outvoted, however, after 
Commissioner Joe Levy called the project "the most important in the state of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The commission will take a final vote on the transportation improvement program 
today, but it is not expected to change its position on any of the projects 
approved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The only matter left unresolved by Wednesday's vote was an attempt by the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission to add more projects. Commissioners 
said they would consider approving the additional projects if the local 
officials would agree to take funds from other projects to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
Among those the Los Angeles officials wanted included in the program were 
projects to widen California 126 through Santa Clarita and to widen the 
intersection and replace a railroad crossing at Rosecrans Boulevard and 
Aviation Boulevard.

ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<P>
Welcome to L.A.: 
</P>
<P>
During President Bush's campaign appearance at the Bonaventure the other night, 
four people were arrested after several limousines parked outside were 
spray-painted. Bush's limo apparently was not among those decorated. The 
vandals were said to be members of the Revolutionary Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Haven't they heard? 
</P>
<P>
The incident calls to mind another L.A.-type surprise that greeted members of 
the press covering the Michael Dukakis presidential campaign two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters had been given red and blue bandannas during a stop in Texas. 
When the campaign came to Southern California later in the day, Secret Service 
agents asked the news hounds to remove the scarves because the colors were the 
same as those worn by L.A. street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Here's Murphy's Law, as it applied to one CHP officer in downtown L.A. (see 
photo): When does your motorcycle choose to refuse to start? When you're riding 
in a presidential motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the nation, as we all know, loves to hear about L.A.'s offbeat 
characters. The latest to gain some attention is Long Beach merchant Al 
Greenwood, who wears a crown and bills himself as The Bedspread King. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood, who inserts a brief commentary into each of his weekly newspaper 
ads, recently was quoted in the Chicago Tribune's Metro column, which is called 
INC. (apparently "Only in Chicago" isn't a common expression). He suggested the 
dispatch to Saudi Arabia of "a valuable strike force that our country has never 
utilized before: Our L.A. gang member street brigade." 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood, who recently wrote that people who refrain from bathing have strong 
sex appeal, revealed that he has a mailing list of more than 100 people for his 
pearls of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
He said he's also being considered by a local TV station as a commentator -- "a 
poor man's Andy Rooney." A spokesman for the unwashed. 
</P>
<P>
That 825,000-square-foot structure under construction at 3rd and Spring streets 
will one day be the state office building. It's been named in honor of Ronald 
Reagan. And the press routinely refers to it, quite naturally, as the Ronald 
Reagan State Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
But when it opens, signs will identify it simply as the Ronald Reagan Building. 
Officials were reportedly worried that the longer name might give rise to 
unfortunate abbreviations involving the "S.O.B." initials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
While presidential visits to L.A. may seem routine now, they weren't always. 
L.A. was 99 years old before the first American President -- Rutherford B. 
Hayes -- dared set foot in the wild little pueblo. The year was 1880.

NO QUICK RULING DUE ON REDISTRICTING PACT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE SAYS HE'LL NEED UNTIL AT LEAST NOVEMBER TO DECIDE IF A 
SETTLEMENT ENDING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY IS LEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A final decision on the legality of a settlement ending a Latino voting rights 
lawsuit against the city of San Diego won't be made until November at the 
earliest, the federal judge hearing the case indicated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, U.S. District Judge John Rhoades said in a written order 
issued late Wednesday that the settlement is "legally binding" on the city and 
those who filed the class-action lawsuit, represented by the Chicano Federation 
of San Diego County Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicano Federation and a five-member majority of the City Council agreed 
last week to the settlement. The agreement included a redrawing of council 
district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the redistricting, District 8 was given a majority of Latino 
voters. The Chicano Federation believes the ethnic composition of the district, 
which stretches from downtown to the South Bay, will greatly enhance the 
opportunity for a Latino to be elected to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
No Latino has served on the council without first having been appointed to the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
While the settlement satisfied the Chicano Federation and the City Council 
majority, a vocal minority on the council, led by Mayor Maureen O'Connor, 
maintain the new district boundaries in other parts of the city, mainly those 
north of Interstate 8, were gerrymandered as a way to punish the majority's 
political enemies on the council and in the process split neighborhoods and 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and the others allege that many elements and boundaries of the 
settlement map were products of an earlier redistricting map crafted in secret 
by the five-member majority in violation of state open meeting laws and then 
approved by them last month, though the new agreement scuttles that approval. 
</P>
<P>
Through their lawyers, the mayor and council members Ron Roberts, Bruce 
Henderson and Judy McCarty want the class-action lawsuit to continue so that 
depositions of the council majority and their aides are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
The depositions had been scheduled by the Chicano Federation, which also 
alleged improprieties on the part of the majority, but on the eve of the sworn 
interrogations, the settlement was reached. Members of the five-member majority 
are Bob Filner, Linda Bernhardt, Wes Pratt, John Hartley and Abbe Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Rhoades, however, said last week that he wanted the various lawyers in 
the case to submit arguments about, among other things, whether the council 
minority had legal standing to pursue its cause through the voting rights 
lawsuit. Wednesday's order by Rhoades sets out those questions in more detail 
as well as a timetable for their resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said in his order that the scope of the court's authority "is limited 
to whether the agreement is fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable" to 
those members of the Latino and black class which filed the lawsuit. As part of 
that inquiry, "the court must consider whether the settlement agreement is 
illegal or contrary to public policy." 
</P>
<P>
"If the settlement agreement and the redistricting plan as adopted meet the 
standards of being fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable, properly 
protects the rights of members of the plaintiff class, and is not illegal or 
contrary to public policy, then the court cannot and shall not decide what are 
basically political questions as to how and in what manner the district 
boundaries are drawn," the judge's order said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicano Federation attorney Michael Aguirre said in a telephone interview from 
New Mexico that he considers the order as putting "us one more step closer" to 
a final resolution. The key to the federation, he said, is that the judge has 
declared the agreement legally binding and enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
"This allows everything to continue forward," Aguirre said. "The burden is now 
on those opposing it to set it aside." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from asking the lawyers to submit written argument, the order sets out a 
number of deadlines, beginning with next Monday, when a hearing before 
Magistrate Harry McCue is to be scheduled. McCue has handled most of the 
settlement negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of the settlement agreement must file their arguments with 
Rhoades by Oct. 4, followed by those opposed to the agreement on Oct. 18. On 
Nov. 6, Rhoades said he will hold a hearing specifically to determine McCue's 
exact role in overseeing approval of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that, unless he is convinced otherwise, he will review McCue's 
findings and recommendations and then determine himself whether to approve the 
settlement. Rhoades's order said he expects to have McCue's findings and 
recommendations by mid-November. The order did not say how long Rhoades would 
then take to issue a final decision.

COURT BARS DIET CLINICS' ADVERTISING CLAIMS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: SAN DIEGO-BASED CHAIN, PACIFIC MEDICAL CLINICS MANAGEMENT INC., AND 
TWO OF ITS EXECUTIVES FACE FEDERAL CHARGES FOR ALLEGEDLY DECEIVING CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Federal authorities have charged a San Diego-based weight-loss clinic chain, 
Pacific Medical Clinics Management Inc., and two executives with deceptive 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission says the firm misled consumers with broadcast and 
print ads saying they could lose 1 1/2 pounds a day -- without exercise -- with 
a "medically safe" program. 
</P>
<P>
Karin Lynn Norred and James Norman Wells are the company officers named in the 
Sept. 17 civil complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in San Diego. Judge 
Gordon Thompson Jr. has granted a temporary restraining order against the firm, 
barring it from continuing to make those claims and freezing all of its assets 
pending a Sept. 27 hearing, the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells also is under indictment in Texas for conspiracy and racketeering in 
connection with a prostitution ring, according to Marjorie Erickson, assistant 
regional director for the FTC in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, 54, who moved to San Diego two years ago, previously ran 
hair-restoration centers and five nude-modeling studios in the Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint lists as Wells' aliases Johnny Norman Wells, Duke Wells and John 
Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the firm claimed that its programs worked by raising the 
dieter's metabolism using an amino acid tablet supplement known as Growth 
Hormone Releaser (GHR), protein supplements in the form of powdered puddings 
and drinks, a potassium supplement, and a daily multivitamin. 
</P>
<P>
"None of these methods achieve an increase in the metabolic rate or a 
significant loss of weight," FTC attorney John Jacobs said at a press 
conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't, in fact, give the consumers what they represent to," he said. "If 
it sounds too good be true, it probably is." 
</P>
<P>
FTC also said the thyroid hormone drug Synthroid has been used in connection 
with the clinics. But according to the complaint, the federal Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) requires that Synthroid's labeling contain a warning 
against the drug's use as a treatment for obesity. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA says use of the drug by people with normal thyroid glands is -- 
depending on the dose -- unsafe or ineffective for weight reduction. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC said the firm operates Medical Clinics Inc. in Las Vegas and Vienna, 
Va.; Georgia Medical Clinics Inc., which has two offices in Atlanta; and 
American Medical Clinics Inc., which is based in Houston and has four clinics 
there and one in Austin and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC complaint says the firm's headquarters at 3500 Estudillo Street also 
serves as one of the two San Diego weight-loss clinics. The California 
Secretary of State's office said the firm also runs an office in the 3400 block 
of Kearny Villa Road. 
</P>
<P>
FTC officials estimate that since late 1987, the firm has had revenues of $20 
million, but the agency does not have an estimate of the number of customers. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Medical Clinics Management was incorporated in California on Oct. 16, 
1987, according to the Secretary of State's office, but its corporate status 
was suspended by the state franchise tax board on March 1 for failing to file a 
1988 state corporate income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated phone messages left at the business were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Records in San Diego County Superior Court do not show any record of criminal 
or civil cases filed against the firm, Norred, Wells, or any of Wells' aliases. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office in San Diego said it did not know if it 
would be investigating the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC said this is the first case they've filed against a diet clinic chain 
"in recent years," although they have filed complaints against diet pills and 
products.

AL MARTINEZ: THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I think about Allan Adler, I think of him standing at the bow of his 
76-foot ketch, squinting into the sun, sprays of silver foam splashing up on 
either side of him. 
</P>
<P>
Bronzed and shirtless, he seems painted into the foreground, a man still 
vigorous at 75, his face lined and weathered, his thin, blonde hair turning 
gray, his eyes as blue as the sea. 
</P>
<P>
I think about him now because Adler represents those traits I admire in a man 
and because his stance at the bow of the Shawnee, showered by silver spray and 
wearing silver in his hair, creates its own metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
The man, you see, is a silversmith, an artist whose hands have caressed God 
knows how many bars of shiny metal over the last 60 years and transformed them 
into things of exquisite beauty. 
</P>
<P>
He designs and forges flatware of simple elegance and jewelry of puzzling 
intricacy, in a shop tucked away in a corner of Pacoima that gleams with the 
silver dust of infinite scrappings. 
</P>
<P>
He takes what nature gives and gives it back, retooled by an artist's vision to 
fit the emotional needs of those who seek his creations. 
</P>
<P>
Adler is the last of a breed. There aren't any more individual silversmiths in 
America, and only a few in the world. It's quicker and cheaper to mass produce 
spoons on a machine than to shape them one at a time by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Demand grinds down individualism. Art and commercial expediency have never been 
compatible. 
</P>
<P>
I met Adler for the first time when I boarded the Shawnee, anchored off Santa 
Catalina Island. My first impression was that of a sailor, not a silversmith. 
</P>
<P>
All he wanted to talk about was his creaky old sailing ship, but that was OK, 
because it too represents the last of a line, with its polished brass and 
varnished teak gleaming in the long rays of a fading day. 
</P>
<P>
The Shawnee was built in 1916 for Mark Fontana, one of the founders of the Bank 
of America, and was dying in the water 38 years later in San Francisco when 
Adler bought it. 
</P>
<P>
He can't even guess at how much time and money he and his wife have put into 
restoring the ship, but it shows. Like Adler's masterpieces of silver, the 
Shawnee today represents an artist's dream. 
</P>
<P>
A single night aboard at anchor in Moonstone Cove refines one's own vision of 
what untroubled sleep ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
The Shawnee rocks in the easy swells like a ghost ship, its old bones creaking 
history, the thump of waves at its hull articulating the rhythms of an ocean 
night song. 
</P>
<P>
I go into kind of a daze when I'm on water, more inclined to glory in the sea 
than to do a journalist's work. The feeling persisted the next day, when we 
headed for home 26 miles east, with me at the helm most of the way, playing 
iron man on a wooden ship. 
</P>
<P>
But my purpose for the trip was Adler, not the Shawnee, although, as I said, 
their separate lives seem intricately entwined. 
</P>
<P>
Adler was a building contractor when he gave it up to learn silversmithing from 
a master, his father-in-law, Porter Blanchard. After that, like a sailor 
emerging from a storm, he never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
He has fashioned buckles, earrings, cups, goblets, trays, rings, bracelets and 
necklaces over the last six decades for everyone from Eleanor Roosevelt to 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
An Adler pin went into space with the nation's first seven astronauts and its 
design continues to serve as a cosmic logo in front of NASA headquarters in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
His stuff isn't cheap. The man's flatware sells for $1,200 a place setting, and 
a tea set inspired by Paul Revere, America's first silversmith, sold at auction 
recently for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fame, in this case, goes along with wealth. The Smithsonian has honored him for 
his unique contribution to design, and has documented his techniques on 
videotape for future generations to know how a master silversmith worked. 
</P>
<P>
So now at 75, he ought to be taking it easy but, like the Shawnee, he continues 
to sail into the wind, wearing his own patina of time as handsomely as aging 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
Days after our trip from Catalina, I visited Adler in his shop and watched him 
pound a spoon into shape from a thin piece of silver, each blow leaving the 
kind of imprint a painter makes with a brush. 
</P>
<P>
"Machines pound out a hundred of these in an hour," he said. "It takes me 12 
hours to make 8 of them. Once I had 24 craftsmen working for me. Now I have 7. 
I do not exaggerate when I say silversmithing is a lost art. It died in my 
lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
That may be true. I have no way of verifying it. But I do know that 
machine-produced kitchenware will never replace an Adler spoon, anymore than a 
fiberglass boat will replace the Shawnee. 
</P>
<P>
They both have a special place in art and on the sea.

Your editorial overlooks a compelling argument for massive investment in 
freeways and highways as a solution to regional transportation needs. 
</P>
<P>
Automobiles, replaced every few years, are a "renewable resource." They can 
quickly accommodate future technical breakthroughs in energy-efficient and 
low-pollution power plants. The flexibility and productivity provided by the 
automobile-based personal rapid transit system is thus preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Huge investments in mass transit sufficient to reduce automobile travel will 
forever lock us into slow inflexible transportation, causing unacceptable 
losses in productivity and quality of social life.

<P>
I'm afraid you gave a very misleading and false impression of electric cars in 
your editorial. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the facts: 
</P>
<P>
1) Although Detroit may not be producing electric cars, our small company is 
currently producing and selling them! 
</P>
<P>
2) Our electric cars are not cumbersome, quite the contrary, they're fun to 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
3) Our electric cars can easily run up freeway ramps and even maintain freeway 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
4) 90% of all second-car driving is under 21 miles per day, making today's 
electrics feasible for about half of all driving needs. 
</P>
<P>
5) Our cars are affordable ($10,000 to $15,000) and available for purchase now.

In response to "Deukmejian Gets Dunce Cap for Spiking Innovative School 
Assessment Program," Opinion, Aug. 19: 
</P>
<P>
I was both amazed and annoyed by this article. To read it, one would think that 
the California Assessment Program was the best thing since sliced salami. 
</P>
<P>
It was not. It was a waste of time for students, a waste of energy for teachers 
and a waste of taxpayers' money. 
</P>

Since no student's name was on the test, students were not accountable, so they 
took a "who-cares" attitude. No teacher saw the results of his students' tests, 
so they were not diagnostic.

CAP was sold to us by Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig as the 
accountability for the extra millions of dollars that Gov. Deukmejian poured 
into public schools by signing SB 813. When teachers and administrators heard 
that Deukmejian cut CAP, they were dancing in the halls.

A CHOICE 'TWIXT FRYING PAN OR FIRE;

<P>
THE RADICAL ECONOMIC PLAN NOW BEING DEBATED MAY BE GORBACHEV'S RUIN, WHETHER HE 
OPPOSES OR SUPPORTS IT.

Policy Development at Brown University and a fellow of Harvard's Russian 
Research Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
The debate over economic reform in the Soviet Union has entered its climactic 
phase. It is likely that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will have to accept 
some version of the radical program devised by his top economic advisers, 
despite his dimming enthusiasm for it. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, named after its author, Stanislav Shatalin, is now being debated in 
the Soviet Parliament. It calls for dismantling the Soviet economic system and 
a rapid transition to a free-market economy. The timetable for the plan -- 500 
days -- is probably unrealistic, and many components of the program could 
eventually be derailed, leading to uncertainty and turmoil. Nevertheless, there 
is no question that the Shatalin plan, if adopted, will mark a decisive break 
with 60 years of highly centralized Soviet economic planning. 
</P>
<P>
After seeming to endorse Shatalin's plan last week, Gorbachev is now backing 
away. He has called for a popular referendum on one key component of the 
program, the private ownership of land by peasants. This could delay the 
500-day plan by several months. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's attitude is understandable. Whatever the plan's economic merits, 
the resulting changes would have far-reaching political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of the plan would certainly lead to the resignation of the Soviet 
prime minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, who wants a more gradual program retaining 
many of the existing state controls. He has come under attack by crowds of 
demonstrators shouting outside the Kremlin for his government to step down, 
something Ryzhkov has vowed will happen if the plan passes. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a loyal prime minister for the last five years, and has often 
served as a lightning rod to deflect criticism from Gorbachev. There are no 
obvious candidates for the job among Gorbachev's allies (except Eduard 
Shevardnadze, whom Gorbachev wants to keep as foreign minister). A new prime 
minister might be far less willing to look out for Gorbachev's political 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Even more worrisome for Gorbachev is the boost that the 500-day plan would give 
to the political fortunes of his chief rival, Boris Yeltsin, the president of 
the Russian Republic. Yeltsin has supported the radical program from the 
outset, and it is as much his plan as it is Shatalin's. The Legislature in the 
Russian Republic has already approved the plan, at Yeltsin's urging. If 
Gorbachev now embraces the 500-day program, he will strengthen the political 
clout of the one man who has a realistic chance of dislodging him. 
</P>
<P>
But if Gorbachev tries to push the Supreme Soviet to vote for a more gradual 
program, the political costs may be even greater. The Russian Republic, by far 
the largest and wealthiest of the 15 Soviet republics, will be able to 
accomplish a good deal on its own, regardless of what the central Soviet 
government wants. Moreover, most of the non-Russian republics seem likely to 
follow Russia's example in pursuing radical economic reform. Thus, if Gorbachev 
were to hold out against the 500-day plan, he would merely expose how weak the 
central government has become. 
</P>
<P>
This points to the broader political effect of the Shatalin plan on the 
political cohesion of the Soviet state. Political and economic decision-making 
has long been concentrated in the hands of a small group of officials in 
Moscow. Under the 500-day program, political and economic power would be 
rapidly transferred from the central government to the republics and local 
governments as well as to newly privatized companies. 
</P>
<P>
This will hasten the dissolution of the Soviet Union in its current form. Some 
proponents of the 500-day plan, such as Yeltsin, have argued that the program 
would help hold the Soviet Union together by satisfying the republics' demands 
for control over their own economic affairs. But it seems improbable that most 
of the non-Russian republics will be content to remain part of the Soviet Union 
once they have gained dominance over economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-day plan may also encourage violent social unrest stemming from 
economic discontent. Popular expectations of economic improvement will rise 
once the highly publicized program has been adopted. It is questionable whether 
the public will be willing to put up with the austerity and hardships that will 
be necessary for many years to bring about genuine economic revitalization. 
Pressures are likely to build for immediate tangible benefits, which may skew 
or undercut the whole reform program. 
</P>
<P>
It is true, of course, that in Poland the government has been able to impose a 
radical program of austerity without provoking violent unrest. But Poland has a 
government that enjoys genuine popular support. Poles are willing to put up 
with hardships and economic upheaval because they have faith in their 
democratically elected government. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who has made sure he faces no popular vote before 1995, does not 
have full-fledged legitimacy in the eyes of many Soviets. This may prevent him 
from being able to enact the kinds of measures that the democratic government 
in Poland is pursuing and that are envisaged in the 500-day plan. It also may 
create an opportunity for Yeltsin, who enjoys great popular support, to move 
against Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In short, when Gorbachev contemplates the political implications of radical 
economic reform, he finds almost nothing positive. Even if he remains in 
office, he may eventually find himself with few powers other than in foreign 
policy, and there his authority could weaken with the breakup of the Soviet 
state. 
</P>
<P>
It is little wonder, then, that Gorbachev would think hard before embarking on 
a path whose economic benefits are at best uncertain, but whose political costs 
seem all too clear. The adoption of the 500-day plan now seems inevitable, but 
that is because "life itself," to use Gorbachev's phrase, is forcing the issue.

Pacific Bell and serves on the state Industrial Education Council. He commented 
on the quality of education in California and its impact on business: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I say business involvement, we've got to move beyond that old feel-good 
partnership, where we went in and spoke to a group of kids, or we adopted a 
school. We left those buildings feeling like, boy, we've really done our job. 
The reality is we left them far short. There are 364 other days to contend 
with. 
</P>
<P>
We need to get involved for the long term and for the maximum extent 
economically possible. We can't take over the cost of education in the state, 
but we do need to get significantly involved. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980 I probably had a fail rate on our tests of 40% to 50%. There were an 
awful lot more entry-level individuals available. We could be rather selective; 
we brought into the business very qualified people. 
</P>
<P>
Today, I'll probably have to process 400 to 500 (job applications) to get 50. 
We have an absolute solid decline in the entry-level population. All of the 
companies that we work with are suffering from an exceptionally increased cost 
per placement. You want to add to that drug screens and such, you'll lose 
another 20% after you've screened them for ability to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
When we get them in the door, I will say that they're in approximately the same 
quality level that we had in the '80s, in the '70s. But it is getting more 
difficult to find them. You'll find people in business who will say, they can't 
even read their diplomas. That's a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
There are people who have very great difficulty in reading, people who are 
functionally illiterate. Those numbers are mounting because of the high dropout 
rate in our system. But what we get into our business, we're happy with. The 
problem is, what happens to the other 80 or so percent? 
</P>
<P>
That worries me. What do we do with them? Where do they go? Who do they work 
for? Will they ever find meaningful employment? Will they ever have a career 
path? Will they be able to survive in the California economy? 
</P>
<P>
We have to contend with that. We can't just say, "We rejected them, who 
cares.?"

PIANIST MICHEL CAMILO SMOKES AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following Michel Camilo's hourlong opening set at Catalina Bar and Grill in 
Hollywood Tuesday evening, it was difficult to tell whether the pianist or the 
piano needed a rest more. 
</P>
<P>
From his opening rendition of John Coltrane's "Impressions" to his closing "On 
Fire," the Dominican Republic-born Camilo brought his firebrand style of jazz 
to exuberant life. One could easily imagine smoke pouring from the piano in 
response to the demands Camilo made of it. 
</P>
<P>
Camilo, a pleasant young man with an ingratiating, gap-toothed smile, rarely 
relaxed his formidable chops during the six-tune opening set. Even during solo 
moments by bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond, the pianist could 
not resist the urge to noodle -- his poking at inventive melody, his sudden 
blasts of richly voiced chords lending additional urgency and fury to the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Though a certain spontaneity was lost due to the tightly arranged repertoire of 
the band, there was no shortage of individual expression within the rigid 
formatting of each tune. Bassist Bowie, whose support role was performed 
meticulously, had particularly fine outings on Dizzy Gillespie's "Birk's 
Works," a bluesy, easygoing tune that had Camilo at his most economical, and on 
the leader's own "This Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Almond showed himself a masterful technician who managed effortlessly 
to support the rhythmic rage of his leader. His solos came in the form of short 
bursts of descending rhythm patterns that lent a welcome musicality. 
</P>
<P>
Camilo's talents as a composer are considerable. "Uptown Manhattan," "This Way 
Out" and "On Fire," each with a hint of his Latin roots, proved to be pieces 
worthy of jazz exploration, their harmonic structures quite capable of 
supporting melodic invention. 
</P>
<P>
The only real disappointment of the evening came from Camilo's too few 
inclusions of songs that made fewer demands on energy. Though "Uptown 
Manhattan" was an easily paced swing tune -- but only after a blast-off intro 
-- there were no ballads. Jaco Pastorius' "City of the Angels" came closest, 
with its sense of tranquility, but not close enough. Camilo's technique and 
musicality are significant and it would have been curious to have heard him 
play something a bit more relaxed. A. JAMES LISKA

CAN 'BAD INFLUENCE' OVERTAKE 'DAISY'?

Who's going to drive "Driving Miss Daisy" out of the top spot of the Billboard 
magazine rental chart? Maybe it will be "Bad Influence," the sordid thriller 
starring Rob Lowe and James Spader, which is the hottest new video to hit the 
market since "Miss Daisy" cruised in back in early August. "Miss Daisy" has 
been so strong that it's kept "Born on the Fourth of July" -- which has been 
doing big rental business -- in second place. 
</P>
<P>
Zany "Nuns on the Run" sprinted from No. 21 to No. 14 and is a good bet to 
crack the Top 10. So far, renters haven't been that mad about "Madhouse," the 
madcap Kristie Alley comedy, which moved up just one notch to No. 17 in its 
second chart week. Debuts: the hip-hop movie "House Party" (No. 23) and 
"Nightbreed," which could be a big Halloween title. 
</P>
<P>
* This remake of a famed 1937 tear-jerker wasn't quite as big as expected in 
theaters, though the gross -- $20 million -- was respectable. But it could be a 
big home video hit, thanks to the drawing power of stars Bette Midler and John 
Goodman. In its second chart week, "Stella" jumped from No. 12 to No. 8.

"I first had this pie at someone's home kitchen in Kansas City about 20 years 
ago," said Don Ernstein, owner of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods. "After 
that there was no other apple pie for me." 
</P>
<P>
One bite and I knew what he meant. I loved this true Midwestern pie. And so did 
most of the tasters at The Times Test Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
It's an all-brown pie, with a dark streusel topping. You cut through it to 
reveal the pale green of the Granny Smiths. The filling is generous, yet it 
doesn't collapse when the pie is sliced. The pastry -- beautifully perfumed 
with cinnamon -- is flaky but holds it shape. 
</P>
<P>
I like the pie's variety of textures, but what I like best is its wonderful 
range of sweetness, tanginess and creaminess. Warm or cold, this pie is a real 
winner.

<P>
There was a time in my life when I got up every Saturday morning and baked 20 
pies. It was part of the way I earned my living. 
</P>
<P>
I learned a lot. I learned that the quality of the crust depends upon the flour 
and the weather (which is why I stopped measuring and started doing everything 
by feel and scent). I learned that the type of shortening is important (I like 
a mixture of butter and Crisco). I also learned that the temperature of the 
oven matters -- and where you put the pie in the oven matters even more. 
</P>
<P>
I already knew, even before I started my career, that timing is everything in 
pie baking. Second-day pie is not really worth eating, for no pie is as good 
the day after it is made as it is on the day it is made. And no pie is ever 
better than it is when it has been out of the oven for about an hour. This is 
just long enough so the crust is cool enough to cut, the filling no longer 
burns your tongue and the whole thing is still warm enough to gently melt the 
whipped cream that you put on top. (The whipped cream, of course, should not be 
sweetened.) 
</P>
<P>
During the course of my "pie career" I found out that fresh apricot pie is the 
easiest (you don't even need to peel the fruit), lemon meringue is the hardest 
-- and apple is somewhere in between. Apple pie is easy if you have good apples 
(I've found Rome Beauties are just about the easiest because they hold their 
shape), and almost impossible if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Since I've given up baking pies for a living, I've discovered something else: 
If you don't do it very often, you lose your touch. Which is why I am 
constantly out there looking for a truly great pie. 
</P>
<P>
I can't say I come across one very often. And while the pie at Flora Kitchen 
didn't end my search, I wouldn't be embarrassed to claim it as my own.

APPLE-RAISIN PIE FROM FLORA KITCHEN 
</P>
<P>
1 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
7 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and quartered 
</P>
<P>
2 cups granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
Pastry 
</P>
<P>
1 egg, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon sugar 
</P>
<P>
Use 2 large, deep skillets or Dutch oven to accommodate apples. Melt butter in 
pan until just beginning to brown. Add apples and saute 7 to 8 minutes, or 
until juices stop releasing. Mix sugar and cinnamon and add to apples. Place on 
high heat and cook about 8 minutes, gently stirring occasionally. Add whipping 
cream and sour cream. Reduce until thickened, stirring occasionally. Remove 
from heat. Add raisins and toss. Turn into tray and let cool to room 
temperature. Chill until cold. 
</P>
<P>
Pile apples into pastry shell. Cover with top pastry, trim edges and flute rim. 
Brush top with beaten egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to taste. Bake at 
350 degrees 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 1 (10-inch) pie. 
</P>
<P>
Pastry 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup shortening, very cold 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter, very cold 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup or less ice-cold water 
</P>
<P>
Mix flour and salt together. Cut in shortening and butter. Slowly add water. 
Mix until dough just comes together. Knead 30 seconds. Chill 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Roll out into 2 circles that would fit 
10-inch pie plate, one for bottom and another for top crust. Cut vents in top 
pastry. Makes 1 double-crust pastry. RUTH REICHL

Every afternoon, in the days during World War II when my father operated a 
diner in Greenwich Village, my sister and I would walk from school on 12th 
Street to Al's Diner on Perry Street. We went there to, as one customer put it, 
"eat up the profits." Our daily snack: apple pie a la mode. A huge wedge of the 
pie, oozing with velvety vanilla ice cream over syrupy apples, had a crust that 
dissolved between my teeth. It was a perfect diner pie. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Philippe the Original makes a diner-style apple pie that I 
think is as good as the ones I ate in New York. Philippe's pies are hearty, 
he-man apple pies with a rather soft, chewy crust and an even softer filling. 
They are the kind you imagine being eaten by a lone diner in some wee-hour dive 
lit by the glow of a street lamp. 
</P>
<P>
Martino's Bakery in Burbank makes the pies for Philippe's. It also bakes apple 
pies for Southland colleges, hospitals, other restaurants and the Meals on 
Wheels trays delivered to the elderly by St. Vincent's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Philippe's serves a high-crust version of the Martino pie that has a more 
imposing look about it than the humble apple pie I remember from my father's 
diner. But the taste is unmistakably the same. "The apples are red shiny apples 
in the morning and pie in the afternoon," says Dave Van Laar, Martino's general 
manager. "We cook them the same day we deliver. No canned, no candied and no 
frozen." 
</P>
<P>
And no cholesterol either. Unlike the larded diner pies from long ago, 
Martino's pie crust contains only vegetable oils. The texture, says Van Laar, 
has not been affected, nor has the taste. I hope so. 
</P>

To be honest, as far as I'm concerned if it isn't chocolate, it isn't dessert. 
Although I've tasted a couple of tartes tatin that caught my fancy, I can't 
even fathom ordering a piece of apple pie if anything chocolate is on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
This admittedly biased opinion made it impossible for me to proclaim any apple 
pie as my favorite. I opted, instead, to present one from the Apple Pan, a Los 
Angeles institution since 1947, for tasting by our panel. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Gamble, daughter of Ellen and Alan Baker, who established the 
restaurant, said the apple pie recipe was developed by her mother and 
grandmother and has been virtually unchanged in the past 43 years. Ninety pies 
are baked fresh daily on the premises; 55 of them are apple. "It's definitely 
our biggest seller," Gamble said. Pippin apples are preferred for the filling, 
but when Pippins are unavailable, Granny Smith apples are substituted. 
Vegetable shortening is used in the crust. 
</P>
<P>
In the restaurant, the pie is served warm, with spiced apple juice poured over 
at the last minute. The sauce is packaged separately for take-out orders, with 
instructions to warm both the juice and the pie before serving. Our tasters 
applauded the pie's not-too-sweet flavor, but judged the filling as slightly 
bland. The crust was superior to all of those from pie stores and the frozen 
varieties, but it was not as flaky as some tasted. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of tasters summed it up this way: "This seems to be one of those pies 
that just tastes better when you eat it right in the restaurant."

Apple picking is under way in Oak Glen, Southern California's largest 
apple-growing region. This year's crop, however, is slightly delayed by the hot 
weather, says David (Robie) Robertson, president of the Oak Glen Apple Growers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Golden and Standard Delicious and Glen Seedlings, which are similar to pippins, 
are ready now, and more varieties are due in October. Fresh cider and apple 
juice are also for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Ranches open for picking are Los Rios Rancho, Riley's Farm and Orchard and 
Four-Oaks Ranch. Apples from the new crop are on sale at Parrish Pioneer Ranch 
and Law's Cider Mill &amp; Ranch. Pickers can check locations through brochures 
available at local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend is an especially good time to go because Oak Glen is staging a 
two-day harvest celebration. Events include pie eating and cider drinking 
contests, an arts and crafts fair, country and Western music shows, a benefit 
pancake breakfast, hay rides and pony rides. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Oak Glen from Los Angeles, take the San Bernardino Freeway 12 miles 
past San Bernardino to the Yucaipa Boulevard off-ramp. Turn left at the top of 
the ramp and go to the third signal, which is Oak Glen Boulevard. Turn left 
again and continue six miles to Oak Glen. 
</P>
<P>
Certified organically grown apples are yours for the picking and a price of $13 
a bushel at the De Vera Ranch, 22500 Highway 202, Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through November. This week, Red 
and Golden Delicious, Early Blaze, Gala and Rome Beauty varieties are ready for 
harvest, says Dante De Vera. The ranch provides pickers with facilities for 
pressing fresh apple juice. Other attractions include a private lake for 
fishing, horseback riding, an animal petting area and a store selling souvenirs 
and snacks. Picnic tables are available too, and there's a campground nearby. 
</P>
<P>
For further information, call (213) 254-1766, (818) 993-0752 or (805) 822-1120. 
Tehachapi is 108 miles from Los Angeles. Take the Antelope Valley Freeway to 
Highway 58 and head west to the third Tehachapi exit, marked "Highway 202 
Correctional Institution." Turn right on Tucker Road, then right on Highway 202 
and continue for about four miles to the ranch. BARBARA HANSEN

RECIPES: CAMPANILE AND PATINA RESTAURANTS HAVE RISEN TO THE WASHINGTON STATE 
APPLE COMMISSION'S CHALLENGE TO CREATE ALL-APPLE MENUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurant chefs are always being asked to put together special "theme" menus. 
Wine dinners are the most common -- the idea is to create dishes that flatter 
some visiting wine-maker's product. When truffles are in season, chefs often 
build a meal around them. (Ken Frank of La Toque went so far as serving truffle 
ice cream -- it sounded weird, tasted swell.) All-garlic menus are frequently 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes special meals are put together for promotional purposes. If, say, 
the Potato Board is about to launch a new TV campaign, you'll find some chef 
somewhere tossing potatoes into every course, from delicate hors d'oeuvres to 
dessert (potato brownies aren't bad at all). One of the strangest of these was 
a lunch Michel Richard of Citrus did for the French soda pop, Orangina. Anyone 
for Orangina beurre blanc? 
</P>
<P>
 A relatively more reasonable request was made recently by the Washington State 
Apple Commission. Chefs around the country are being asked to create all-apple 
menus. In Los Angeles, Campanile and Patina accepted the challenge. Here are 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
Campanile Apple Menu 
</P>
<P>
Duck consomme with apple brunoise and potato Gorgonzola ravioli, Foie gras with 
apple spaghetti, Roasted Squab With Applesauce and Polenta, Buckwheat Crepes

create linear marks, if desired. Roast at 500 degrees 8 to 10 minutes. Detach 
breast from squab and slice thinly. Leave legs whole. 
</P>
<P>
For each serving, put some Applesauce on each plate, place 2 Polenta triangles 
on top. Arrange sliced squab over with legs. Spoon Apple Brandy Sauce and more 
Applesauce over. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
This apple dessert is a bit time-consuming to make but well worth the effort. 
It tastes amazingly rich to be so low in calories and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to this "great impostor" is using melted vanilla ice milk as the 
sauce instead of a classic creme anglaise, which is made with egg yolks. 
</P>
<P>
BAKED APPLE CUPS 
</P>
<P>
4 Golden Delicious apples, cored and halved lengthwise 
</P>
<P>
Julienned zest and juice of 2 large lemons 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and julienned 
</P>
<P>
2 cups vanilla ice milk, melted 
</P>
<P>
Place Golden Delicious apples in baking dish, cut side up. Bake at 350 degrees 
30 to 40 minutes or until easily pierced with fork. Remove from oven and cool 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Place lemon zest in saucepan, cover with water and bring to boil. Boil 2 
minutes then drain. Combine lemon juice with sugar and mix well. Add lemon zest 
and julienned apples. Mix well and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Make apple cups by carefully removing all but about 1/4 inch of pulp from skin 
of cooled apple halves. (Be careful not to tear skin.) Cut pulp in thin 
match-sized strips and combine with apple-lemon mixture and mix well. 
</P>
<P>
Fill each apple cup with 1/2 cup apple mixture and pour any remaining juice 
evenly over each serving. Return to 350-degree oven 20 minutes, then place 
apple cups on large plate to cool. Pour any pan juices evenly over each 
serving. When cool, cover and refrigerate until cold. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, place each apple cup on plate. Pour 1/4 cup melted ice milk over top 
of each cup. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains approximately 130 calories; 5 mg cholesterol; 2 gm fat; 
28 mg sodium.

The choice in apples used to be limited to Delicious, Golden Delicious and 
McIntosh, with perhaps a handful of local varieties. Granny Smith, an 
Australian import, joined the Big 3 about 15 years ago. These four apples still 
account for more than two-thirds of the country's commercial crop. But other 
varieties are coming on strong. Most weren't on the market 10 years ago. And 
some -- Liberty, Gala, Criterion, Fuji, Akane -- you may never have even heard 
of. 
</P>
<P>
While Red Delicious apples were selling at below cost last year because of a 
countrywide oversupply, Fuji and other new varieties were commanding top 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
One beautiful apple just isn't enough any more. Consumers are demanding quality 
apples and they want variety. "It's a diverse market," says Dr. Bruce H. 
Barritt, horticulturist at the Washington State University Tree Fruit Research 
Center in Wenatchee, Wash. "Don't try to tell a consumer which apple has the 
best flavor." 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy consumer and grower demand, plant breeders here and abroad have been 
working on disease-resistant apples that taste better, are easier to grow and 
keep longer. The development process is a lengthy one, taking from 22 to 40 
years or more from the initial cross to the introduction of a new variety. 
</P>
<P>
An important breakthrough was the development of new disease-resistant strains. 
Liberty, a crisp apple now widely accepted in New England, was crossed at 
Cornell University's New York State Agricultural Research Station at Geneva, 
N.Y., in 1955 and introduced in 1978. Freedom was introduced four years later, 
but it is still not yet widely available. 
</P>
<P>
New apples are starting to replace McIntosh, a variety that will not ripen 
uniformly without Alar. Empire, also developed at the New York State 
Agricultural Research Station, is the most widely planted variety in the 
Northeast. "It eats extremely well," says Ralph J. Baldasaro, head of the New 
York and New England Apple Institute. "Empire has the tang of a Mac and the 
sweetness of a Delicious." Not too surprising, since it is a cross between 
McIntosh and Red Delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Other McIntosh-type apples are gaining popularity: Jonamac in the East, and 
Spartan, which was developed in British Columbia, in the West. Jonagold, a 
Golden Delicious and Jonathan cross, was introduced by the New York Station in 
1968 and is now the most widely planted apple in Europe. A large, yellow-red 
apple with a rich flavor, it is excellent for cooking as well as eating 
out-of-hand. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji, the best-selling apple in Japan, may become the apple of the '90s in the 
United States. Fuji does not look like much, but appearance is secondary to its 
firm, crisp texture and sweet flavor. And this apple, better than any other so 
far, retains its crispness after several months in a home refrigerator. 
Grower-packer R.C. Greg McPherson and many of his neighbors in Wenatchee are 
grafting Fuji onto Red Delicious stock. "You can knock them around," he says, 
"and they keep forever." 
</P>
<P>
Another Japanese import is Akane (pronounced ah-CON-nay). It has been dubbed 
the "lunch box apple" because, says Kris Merritt of Merritt Orchards near 
Bellingham in Western Washington, "It ripens right in the first part of 
September, just in time for school." Old-timers come to Merritt's for the Akane 
too; it reminds them of the old-fashioned snow apple known as Fameuse. 
</P>
<P>
Mutsu is a Golden Delicious crossed with Indo, a Japanese variety. It is called 
Crispin in Britain and parts of the Northeast, where it is grown extensively. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it the Christmas apple," says Tom Berry, referring to the Mutsus he 
grows along with 40 other new and unusual varieties at his Canyon Park Orchard, 
north of Seattle. Mutsus can be eaten immediately, but Berry also hordes them: 
He wraps them in newspaper and stores them out in a shed, his own version of 
cold storage, where they yellow and sweeten as they mature. 
</P>
<P>
Not all apples come from carefully controlled breeding programs. Criterion, a 
large apple with a sprightly flavor, was found in an orchard near Wapato, in 
Yakima Valley, Wash. It is thought to be a cross between Red and Golden 
Delicious or Red Delicious and Winter Banana. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Gold is another so-called chance seedling. Clyde H. Harvey, a Virginia 
apple grower, came across a small tree uprooted by Hurricane Camille in 1962. 
He replanted it and it bore its first fruit in 1975. Ginger Duncan-Harvey, 
Clyde's wife, describes Ginger Gold as crisp and very juicy. "It looks too good 
to be true, just like a wax apple," she says, "but the taste is real, a 
distinct sweet-tart flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Apples are often divided into two groups: dessert apples, which are eaten 
fresh, and cooking apples. A few varieties are good for both. There are three 
kinds of cooking apples: apples such as Empire, that get mushy when cooked, and 
hence make good applesauce; firm-fleshed apples that hold together, and are 
good for pies and tarts (Jonagold); and tender-skin varieties that hold their 
shape when baked (Melrose). 
</P>
<P>
Here are some recipes that chefs have developed to use these new varieties of 
apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Marcel DeSaulniers, of the Trellis Restaurant at Colonial Williamsburg, 
Va., recommends using two kinds of apples for this moist loaf cake. It makes a 
good take-along for a fall picnic; it keeps well. 
</P>
<P>

HARBOR DEPT. SCALES BACK BUILDING PLANS FOR SAN PEDRO; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HARBOR COMMISSIONERS WILL CONSIDER $25-MILLION PROPOSAL FOR TWO 
PORT-OWNED LOTS AT A MEETING WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Department has dramatically scaled back plans for 
developing two port-owned lots in downtown San Pedro, convinced that a proposed 
$57-million office and retail complex is too costly and could sit largely 
vacant for years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the department is recommending a $25-million development that would 
provide additional office space for port staff but would eliminate several key 
elements of the previous plan. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, which will go before harbor commissioners next Wednesday, has 
renewed debate in San Pedro over the port's commitment to the community's 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new plan has been met with a wait-and-see attitude by many 
merchants and officials, including Harbor Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, one 
San Pedro business leader has complained that the port's staff is shortchanging 
the community by indefinitely delaying the large and long-promised commercial 
development adjacent to its headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're being so shortsighted it's ridiculous," said Rick Gaydos, 
president of the San Pedro Revitalization Corp. "Not only have they been land 
banking the parcels for years, but they have been unwilling to develop that 
area in a way that benefits San Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
But port officials, with qualified support from the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber 
of Commerce, insist that reducing the project's size is the only prudent course 
at a time when commercial office buildings in the community, and throughout the 
region, are begging for tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan represents the latest proposal for developing the last two parcels 
in the Community Redevelopment Agency's Beacon Street project, an endeavor that 
began in 1969 and has transformed San Pedro's downtown business district with 
new offices, hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that project, the port not only built its new headquarters building 
at 425 Palos Verdes St., but entered into an agreement with the CRA in 1983 to 
develop two parcels between Harbor Boulevard and Palos Verdes Street. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the port had proposed that its parcels, including one purchased 
for $4.3 million from the CRA, include a mix of development. An existing 
warehouse on Harbor Boulevard was to be replaced by an 11-story office tower. 
The 200,000-square-foot building was to accommodate the port's administrative 
staff and provide seven stories of offices for lease, as well as 12,000 square 
feet of retail shops. In addition, the port proposed a 6,000-square-foot 
visitors' center between its headquarters and the office tower. 
</P>
<P>
But those plans, which were viewed as too ambitious by several harbor 
commissioners last December, have now been abandoned by the port's staff. 
"There was a concern over costs and a concern that the market demand just isn't 
there for that much office space," said Dwayne Lee, the port's deputy executive 
director of development. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Lee said, the port's staff proposes a six-story office building on the 
vacant lot directly across from the department's headquarters. The 
100,000-square-foot building would be used by the port and would be linked to 
the headquarters by an elevated walkway above Palos Verdes Street. In addition, 
the port has proposed refurbishing the 29,000-square-foot warehouse on Harbor 
Boulevard for, among other things, a 4,000-square-foot day-care facility open 
to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal does not include any retail space or a visitors' center, 
although port officials say some sort of tourist facility is still a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
A 200,000-square-foot office tower also could be built on the warehouse site 
but only if the demand for offices in San Pedro increases enough to justify 
that project, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the new plan was developed after a recent consultant's report 
concluded that leasing the 11-story office tower could take from five to 25 
years. "It just wouldn't generate revenues for us. So it made sense to reduce 
the project and our costs," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, however, the port has already been told by the CRA that the agency 
expects the quality of the new proposal to match what the department earlier 
planned for the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to discuss the size of the project, and we'll be willing to 
support a scaled-down version," said Len Betz, the CRA's project manager for 
the Beacon Street redevelopment area. "But we will be looking for the same 
quality of project and by that I mean the look of the project, the type of 
construction and the public benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Betz said in a Sept. 14 letter to the port, the CRA wants the new 
proposed development to address the issues of retail space, future office 
development, and completing the project, which has been debated and delayed for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the port's new plan, the project would be finished by June, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
That completion date is key to the Chamber of Commerce's qualified support for 
the port's new plan, according to chamber Director Leron Gubler. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have preferred to see a larger development," Gubler said. "But it's 
our feeling that it's in the best interest of the community to get this project 
moving, to keep the development momentum going in San Pedro, rather than having 
the land vacant for another five to six years." 
</P>
<P>
Although one recent area transportation study suggests that significant 
commercial development will occur in San Pedro over the next 20 years, Gubler 
cautioned that the report does not pinpoint when the forecasted demand for 
nearly 1 million more square feet of office space will occur. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree we have a bright future," Gubler said, "but the current climate for 
commercial office space is not the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gubler warned that pressing the port to immediately build a 
200,000-square-foot office tower when the market is soft may inadvertently slow 
other commercial development in San Pedro, most notably the second phase of 
Pacific Place, a 7th Street redevelopment project that could add as much as 
300,000 square feet of office space to downtown San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Flores said the councilwoman has not taken a position on the port's 
new plan, because she is awaiting some of the details that will be presented at 
next week's Harbor Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we want to make sure that the port planners look at 
everything," said Flores' spokeswoman, Karen Constine. "We understand that 
today's market is not the best for new office buildings. But we also hope the 
port is looking at what may happen five years from now.

GROUP TO SEEK HELP IN BLOCKING 2 PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: HEAD OF ENVIRONMENTAL BODY SAYS SHE WILL ASK COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR 
SUPPORT IN FIGHTING HOUSING PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The head of a local environmental group said this week that she plans to seek 
help from Malibu's unofficial City Council in a bid to block approval of two 
massive housing projects in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
A development proposed for the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch, owned by entertainer 
Bob Hope, and the larger Ahmanson Ranch development both could create 
disastrous drainage problems for Malibu Creek and Malibu Lagoon State Beach, 
said Ellen Stern Harris, executive director of the Fund for the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to believe these projects pose an overwhelming negative 
impact on the quality of water and therefore the quality of recreation in the 
coastal zone near Malibu," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
An official with Ahmanson Land Co. dismissed the idea that the company's 
project would harm the creek and lagoon. "We're planning an on-site treatment 
plant and perhaps a storage reservoir on the property for reclaimed water, and 
we think those measures will go a long way toward alleviating any drainage 
problems," senior project manager Guy Gniadek said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option to buy 
Jordan Ranch from Hope, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the projects, in southeast Ventura County, are more than 10 miles from 
Malibu, they are within the Malibu Creek watershed, which drains into the ocean 
at the lagoon. Surfers, swimmers, environmentalists and residents often 
complain that pollution generated elsewhere and drained by the creek threatens 
to ruin the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said she will ask the Malibu council to push for an independent study to 
be presented to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to explore the possible 
effects the developments might have on the creek and lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu council members were elected in June at the same time voters 
overwhelmingly approved cityhood for the community. Although legal obstacles 
have delayed incorporation, the council has been holding weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the Ahmanson development would include more than 3,000 houses, 3 
million square feet of office space, two hotels and two golf courses on nearly 
2,000 of its 5,477 acres. About 3,000 acres are to be left in open space or 
used for community recreational facilities. Jordan Ranch would contain 750 
residences and a tournament golf course just south of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Draft environmental impact reports prepared for Ventura County last month said 
the projects would have "unavoidable, significant" impacts on air quality, 
traffic and the rural environment in the nearest areas. 
</P>
<P>
Harris contends that the environmental reports did not adequately consider 
possible adverse effects on the creek and the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
"If growth can be accommodated" in the area nearest the projects, "that is one 
thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if there are going to be adverse consequences" for others outside the 
immediate area, "these developments shouldn't be allowed to unleash their 
problems on the rest of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The creek and lagoon have been the focus of increased attention in Malibu in 
recent months, with some residents accusing a municipal water district that 
serves the west San Fernando Valley -- and whose reclamation plant next to the 
creek spews into it effluent that ends up in the coastal lagoon -- of making 
conditions in these areas worse. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials have denied that effluent from the plant, which they 
say is suitable for body contact, has negatively affected the creek or the 
lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
They say that the creek collects drainage from 150 square miles, and insist 
that the plant's effluent is one of the few good things that goes into it.

MONORAIL SYSTEM COULD SHRINK BURBANK'S GRIDLOCK, STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC TRANSIT: AS ENVISIONED, THE $158-MILLION PROJECT WOULD LINK UP WITH 
OTHER RAIL PLANS. 
</P>

<P>
A $158-million monorail system connecting Universal City with downtown Burbank 
could relieve its congested traffic, especially in the bustling Media District, 
according to a study exploring alternative transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The study says a monorail system similar to the one at Walt Disney World in 
Orlando, Fla., could eventually connect Burbank's three major employment 
districts and reduce cross-town and commuter traffic by providing an 
alternative to surface streets that already are near gridlock in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed system would intersect with other transportation projects planned 
for the area, such as the Metro Rail extension through the San Fernando Valley 
and commuter rail lines operating on Southern Pacific tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The study was commissioned by the city of Burbank and Los Angeles County. 
Edward C. Friedrichs, vice president of Gensler and Associates, the Los Angeles 
architectural firm that prepared the study, said the monorail system would 
depend heavily on other forms of public transportation to provide passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, which would take about three years to build, 
would connect Universal City with downtown Burbank via the Media District, 
where nearly half the stops would be located. The 6.5-mile route would follow 
raised tracks built on existing street medians. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of public and private funds would pay for the monorail. 
Friedrichs suggested that as other construction projects are approved, 
developers be required to contribute to the monorail rather than to more common 
traffic mitigation projects -- for instance, street widening or additional stop 
lights. The project would be supervised by officials from Burbank and perhaps 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Steve Helvey said the study was commissioned after 
discussions with Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a supporter of monorails. Helvey 
was unaware of any similar joint studies and said the county's role in the 
project has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Future phases would include a four-mile leg connecting downtown to Burbank 
Airport, which would cost $95 million, and a three-mile section linking the 
airport with the Media District, cost unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Friedrichs said, commuters would begin their trips on the system at 
collector stations in Universal City, downtown and at the airport, all of which 
would have access to other rail lines and ride-sharing pools. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters who share rides would leave their cars at the station instead of 
driving them to work. Friedrichs said the system would encourage ride sharing 
because it would allow mobility during the day. 
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the system could carry 10,368 passengers an hour. There are no 
monorail projects in the United States built for public use, but Friedrichs 
said similar systems operate in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project is still in the preliminary stages, Friedrichs said his 
firm has encouraged city and county staffs to complete preliminary work -- such 
as environmental impact reports and traffic studies -- to move ahead with the 
plan within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
At separate presentations Tuesday, the monorail proposal got mixed reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank City Council generally reacted favorably to the idea and is 
expected to decide its next move later this year. Some county supervisors 
expressed skepticism about the technology involved in the project, but 
Antonovich praised the work done to date and urged the board to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
"An aesthetically pleasing monorail is smog-free and enhances an area," he 
said.

REDONDO RESIDENTS BLAST EDISON PLAN TO CONTROL POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Modern pollution-control equipment that Southern California Edison wants to 
install at its Redondo Beach power plant drew fire Tuesday night from residents 
and some council members who fear that the ammonia it would use to neutralize 
pollutants could pose severe health risks. 
</P>
<P>
Its opponents cited that safety issue Tuesday as yet another reason to oppose 
the proposed merger between Edison and the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week decided to prosecute Edison for allegedly violating the 
local noise ordinance. Although the council was to take a position on the 
controversial merger Tuesday night, it postponed making a decision until next 
Tuesday, when it expects to have more information about how the merger would 
affect the area's level of noise and its marine life. 
</P>
<P>
The merger, which would result in the shifting of electricity generation from 
older San Diego power plants to more efficient Edison stations in Redondo Beach 
and El Segundo, among other cities, is being opposed by many residents who say 
it would mean more air and noise pollution in South Bay cities. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has approved the merger, saying 
overall air quality would not suffer in the Los Angeles Basin because 
stationary diesel and gas engines could be replaced by electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is now before the California Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour hearing in Redondo Beach Tuesday was dominated by concern about 
the safety of the pollution-fighting method that Edison wants to use in the 
city. The process requires the power plant to store 20,000 gallons of anhydrous 
ammonia, a toxic form of the household agent that can cause burns or 
suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has already received permits from the AQMD to install the equipment, but 
has not yet received a city building permit to begin construction on the 
ammonia storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment operates in a manner similar to a catalytic converter in a car by 
mixing ammonia with noxious power plant emissions to break them down into 
harmless compounds, said Edison's environmental regulation manager, Nader 
Mansour. 
</P>
<P>
Edison District Manager Sebastian Nola assured the council that the equipment 
would be operated in accordance with all federal and state requirements 
regarding the handling of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
The ammonia method, which was developed in Germany but has never been used in 
the United States, is the only pollution-fighting equipment that will allow the 
utility to meet air quality requirements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But several residents said they are concerned about the possible health risks 
associated with the transportation and storage of anhydrous ammonia and 
criticized the utility for not considering safer anti-pollution methods. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach resident Tom O'Leary, 75, a retired management analyst who has 
lobbied the council for years to crack down on pollution from the utility, said 
the company should not be experimenting with such a novel process in a 
populated area such as Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step in making Redondo Beach a utilities industry guinea 
pig," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Gloria Gould, who lives with her husband in a new condominium 
complex near the power plant, said: "If it (ammonia) were to escape into the 
atmosphere, and given our proximity to the plant, I am really worried that we 
and our neighbors would be the first to be affected by it and harmed by it and 
possibly . . . to die from it." 
</P>
<P>
Added William Benko, who also lives near the station: "I'm 500 feet from where 
the unit would be, and I'm just hoping I can outrun the ammonia cloud." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the merger, the AQMD has required Edison to fit all its power 
generators with some kind of pollution-fighting equipment and to slash by 77% 
its air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The council, however, decided to postpone a decision on granting a building 
permit for the time being and met with its lawyer to discuss Edison's request. 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger, the Redondo Beach plant would supply about 16% more power 
over the next 10 years, and El Segundo's production would increase by about 
44%, according to Edison officials.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
An apparently drug-related shooting left one man dead and another man injured 
in Southeast San Diego, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Just before 8 p.m. Tuesday, police were dispatched to 29th Street and Imperial 
Avenue, where they found a man shot in the head lying dead in a gutter, Lt. Dan 
Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Frank Eli Heard, 24, of Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of a block away, another man was found with gunshot wounds to 
his chest and leg. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Corder, 26, also of Southeast San Diego underwent surgery and was listed 
in stable condition Wednesday at UC San Diego Medical Center, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Three men apparently confronted the two, who were standing next to a car on 
29th just north of Imperial and got into an argument, Berglund said. The three 
drew guns and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Corder, wounded, ran down the street. The three men beat up Heard before 
shooting him in the head while he was on the ground, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
No drugs were found at the scene and the three assailants scattered in 
different directions after the incident.

GANG MEMBER GETS 13 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: A MAN PLEADS NO CONTEST IN A SLAYING IN WHICH A DEPUTY ANSWERING 
EMERGENCY CALLS SAID, 'HAVE A NICE DAY' AND HUNG UP. 
</P>

<P>
A San Fernando gang member whose deadly attack on another gang member last year 
was discounted when reported to a 911 emergency dispatcher pleaded no contest 
Wednesday to a voluntary manslaughter charge and agreed to a prison sentence of 
13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Jim Greene's handling of a frantic phone call to the Santa Clarita 
sheriff's station reporting the Jan. 20 shooting triggered criticism from 
Sheriff Sherman Block and led to a series of safeguards to prevent similar 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Greene told caller Jim Finnila, who was trying to report his discovery of the 
victim's bloody body, to "Have a nice day" and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Block said Greene did not believe the emergency was authentic. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, a 26-year veteran with the Sheriff's Department, remains assigned to 
the Santa Clarita station but is no longer handling emergency calls, Sgt. Lynda 
Edmonds, a department spokeswoman, said Wednesday. After an internal 
investigation of the incident, sheriff's officials changed their procedures to 
ensure closer supervision of the 15 emergency phone operators at the Santa 
Clarita station, said Capt. Robert Spierer, station commander. 
</P>
<P>
Also, watch deputies, who oversee the front-desk operation at the station, no 
longer are responsible for dispatching squad cars, giving them more time to 
monitor emergency calls, Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had charged Alfonso Tapia, 20, with murder but on Wednesday agreed 
to reduce the charge to voluntary manslaughter because the victim, Miguel 
Jiminez, 15, of San Fernando might have started the fight that resulted in his 
death, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea agreement, Tapia is expected to receive the maximum term 
for voluntary manslaughter -- 13 years -- when he is sentenced Oct. 10 in San 
Fernando Superior Court, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Nison said the shooting occurred after a car carrying Tapia and several friends 
chased a car in which Jiminez and others were passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Jiminez and his friends stopped their car on San Fernando Road and waited for 
Tapia, who then shot Jiminez when he saw that the youth and the others were 
holding golf clubs and a tire iron, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Finnila, a bystander, dialed 911 from a pay phone near the shooting scene and 
told Greene: "There's someone laying here on San Fernando, there's a gunshot on 
8th and San Fernando . . . " Greene hung up although Finnila expressed fear for 
his life, saying: "I'm going to get killed! There's blood everywhere! There's 
blood from his head! Oh, damn. Get a deputy." 
</P>
<P>
Greene apparently believed that the call was coming from a bar near the 
shooting scene and was a hoax, Block said after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
A squad car was nevertheless dispatched by another deputy who took a call from 
another witness, Block said.

<P>
Jury selection in the murder case of Stacy Butler, accused of killing a San 
Diego police officer, will begin Oct. 19, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, 27, of San Diego, is charged in the slaying of Officer Jerry Hartless, 
24, who was shot in the forehead in Southeast San Diego on Jan. 9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He died three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Kennedy set the trial date for Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
One of Butler's attorneys, William Nimmo, said jury selection may last two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has filed special circumstances allegations 
against Butler, and he could receive the death penalty if convicted of 
first-degree murder. The special circumstances allege that Hartless was killed 
while in the performance of his police duties.

This state is most populous in the nation. If California were an independent 
nation, it would rank in the top 20 financially. 
</P>
<P>
Yet we have politicians who year after year hold our children as pawns in their 
schemes to get back at one another. The recent statements and actions of our 
leaders in Sacramento are those of spoiled brats, schoolyard bullies, and they 
would not be tolerated in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian proudly stated that during his Administration education 
spending has risen 65%. This use of figures to cloud the issue again reflects 
his true commitment to education. How does the governor answer these simple 
yes/no questions: Does the state spend 65% more per student now than it did 
eight years ago? Has the state allocated funds to allow schools to keep pace 
with the rising costs of textbooks, supplies, fuel, etc.? There are many other 
simple questions which could be asked, but the answer to all is no.

CLUES SOUGHT IN DISAPPEARANCE OF VISTA BOY, 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Department investigators are baffled by the disappearance of a 
12-year-old Vista boy who has been missing for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're unable to explain his disappearance and we have no leads as to his 
current whereabouts," Sgt. Glenn Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Noe Ortega-Cervantes has been missing since Sept. 4 and investigators 
don't know if he was abducted or went to Tijuana where his father lives, Revell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron, who is called Noe by his family, is about 4 feet tall, weighs 85 pounds, 
and has black hair and brown eyes. He also has a small scar over his right eye 
and a scar on his right temple. He was last seen wearing a blue T-shirt, pink 
shorts and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 4, the day he disappeared, investigators discovered that Aaron didn't 
show up for class at Lincoln Middle School in the 100 block of Escondido Avenue 
as he had promised his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron had been shy about going to school because he speaks only Spanish, Revell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators think Aaron spent the day in a nearby park before returning home 
at 3:30 p.m., when he left the house again to go out and play. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an unconfirmed sighting of Aaron later that afternoon on 
Escondido Avenue just south of the school, Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
He was apparently walking behind a woman about 30 years old who was carrying a 
baby and walking with another boy who was about 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron and his mother had been living near other relatives in a Vista 
neighborhood for about three months, Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual to us that this child would leave. One of the complaints in the 
past was that he missed his cousins," Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
Some family members have gone back to Tijuana to find the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 940-4547 
or Crime Stoppers at 235-TIPS.

BURBANK LURES A BULLOCK'S; 
</P>
<P>
MALLS: THROUGH CREATIVE FINANCING, THE CITY WILL ALSO PAY CONSTRUCTION COSTS 
WITH INCREASED TAX REVENUES AND RENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 10 years of trying to woo an upscale department store to 
Burbank, the City Council on Tuesday cleared the way for construction of a 
Bullock's in the city's downtown mall. 
</P>
<P>
Council members unanimously approved minor changes to the original plan for the 
41-acre Media City Mall project that will allow inclusion of the three-level, 
240,000-square-foot department store. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have long believed an upscale store such as Bullock's was needed 
to round out the mall, which is viewed as the cornerstone of revitalization of 
downtown Burbank. The developers of the mall, convinced that they could attract 
such a store to the site, left space for it and included it in the project's 
environmental analyses. 
</P>
<P>
Had no store been wooed to the center, the space would have been used for an 
office tower. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock's announced its intention to locate a store in the mall earlier this 
year, but because the company wanted it to be larger than had been planned, the 
City Council was required to amend the project's original plan. The changes 
include reconfiguring an adjacent parking structure and enlarging the project 
by 115,354 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Through some creative financing, the city will end up paying Bullock's 
construction costs with increased tax revenues and rental payments. 
</P>
<P>
According to city documents, Bullock's will build the store at its own expense 
but will sell it to the Haagen Co., the mall's developer, for no more than $33 
million, the expected cost to Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
The city in turn will acquire the store from Haagen in return for a $33-million 
promissory note that will be paid with a combination of rent from Bullock's, 
sales tax revenues from a portion of the mall and a portion of increased 
property taxes on the mall. If the city still owes money to Haagen in 2016, all 
debts will be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will pay for an $18.5-million parking structure with 
increased tax revenues from the project. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Steven Helvey said such deals are not uncommon.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORCYCLIST DIES AFTER HITTING SEMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Newhall man was killed Wednesday when his motorcycle plowed into 
the back of a parked semitrailer in Newhall, sheriff's deputies reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at Circle J Ranch Road and San Fernando Road shortly 
after 4 p.m., Deputy Robert Norlemann said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's name was not released because his relatives had not been notified. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the motorcyclist was riding north on San Fernando "passing 
vehicles on the right and weaving in and out of traffic." Accelerating around a 
pickup truck, he hit the rear of the semitrailer, Norlemann said.

PAULINE BYRNS HUDSON; RETIRED SINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pauline Byrns Hudson, who recorded such hits as "Lullaby of Broadway" and 
"Gloomy Sunday," has died in Sherman Oaks. She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Hudson died Tuesday of cancer, said her husband, Howard G. Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Missouri, she won a singing contest in Washington at the age of 17 
and went on the road performing with a band. During the late 1930s and early 
1940s, she recorded "Lullaby of Broadway" with the Dave Rose Orchestra, her 
husband said. She also recorded "Gloomy Sunday" and "Don't Fall Asleep" with 
the Artie Shaw Orchestra, under the name of Pauline Byrns, according to a 
reference work on Big Bands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, she moved to the San Fernando Valley and joined a singing group called 
Six Hits And A Miss, which performed on radio's "The Bob Hope Show," Hudson 
said. She later became lead singer of the Starlighters group,which also 
performed on radio. She retired from singing when her son was born in 1947. She 
was a longtime resident of Encino and had moved to Tarzana two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her husband of 41 years; son Tim Hudson of Rohnert Park, 
Calif.; stepson Howard Gerald Hudson of Albuquerque, N.M.; sister, Mary Rovig 
of Yakima, Wash.; two grandchildren and a step-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
At her request, no services are planned and the Neptune Society in Burbank is 
handling the arrangements. Donations can be made in Mrs. Hudson's name to the 
American Cancer Society, San Fernando Valley unit.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG MEMBERS HURT IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities say two gang members from Carson were wounded Sunday night when 
rival gang members from Harbor City sprayed a restaurant's parking lot with 
gunfire. No one else was injured in the 8:30 shooting in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have turned into a real gun battle," Los Angeles Police Detective Kim 
Wierman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wierman said Romeo Anos, 19, and Alexander Jacinto, 20, both identified as gang 
members, were felled by gunfire as they left the Beef Bowl restaurant at 1111 
W. Pacific Coast Highway. The shooting occurred minutes after one of the men 
had crossed out the name of a Harbor City gang from the men's room wall at the 
restaurant, Wierman said. 
</P>
<P>
Anos was hit in the back by one of 10 to 15 bullets fired in the incident. The 
bullet passed through his chest and lodged in his chin, police said. He was 
listed in stable condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jacinto, shot in the right ankle and hip, was treated for his wound at the 
medical center, Wierman said. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects are in custody.

Systems Co. in Palmdale, moving airplanes between hangars and runways. 
</P>
<P>
Folzman enjoyed writing poetry and young adult fiction, in addition to painting 
with acrylics and gardening. 
</P>
<P>

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL REJECTS CHARTER CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously against changing the City 
Charter, despite assertions by the Torrance League of Women Voters that reform 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, council members said, the city attorney's office could 
review the charter to assure that it is up to date and does not contain 
outmoded sections. 
</P>
<P>
The league proposed in June that the city conduct a thorough review of the 
charter. It recommended limiting council members to two four-year terms and 
said the current method of paying council members is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the City Council's seven members has expressed much interest in the 
league's proposals. A council committee voted 3-0 in late August against 
recommending a charter review, and the full council concurred Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
League President Lynitta Schaffer said in an interview after the vote that the 
league will probably contact local groups, such as homeowners' associations, to 
discuss charter reform and gauge their interest in the issue.

INNOVATION: COVER OF DARKNESS ILL BECOMES THOSE WHO WOULD SHED LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your career depended on it, would you have the courage and confidence to 
attach your name to your beliefs? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the world's most brilliant and innovative scientists in physics, 
chemistry, molecular biology and medicine do not. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that these scientists are gutless. It's that the cynical wardrobe of 
scientific "tradition" allows them to cloak their opinions in masks of 
anonymity. When a scientist submits a research paper to a prestigious journal 
for publication, that paper is usually given to another scientist to critique. 
That's called "peer review." 
</P>
<P>
These critiques frequently determine how the paper has to be rewritten and, 
indeed, if the paper should be published at all. Almost overwhelmingly, these 
"referees" prefer to remain anonymous. Their comments could be helpful, 
insightful or insulting -- but the researcher may never know who wrote them. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because journal editors equate anonymity with honesty. They fear that 
reviewers would censor themselves if they knew their identities would be 
revealed. Named reviews, they argue, would thus undermine the quality of 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"It would absolutely collapse the whole system," asserts Daniel Koshland, 
editor of Science, America's most important research publication. "People would 
not be as honest as they should be." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in favor of anonymous referees because I don't believe that known referees 
can produce fair opinions when the authors are people who know them and have 
relationships that are influential or otherwise," agrees Dr. Arnold Relman, who 
is retiring as editor of the influential New England Journal of Medicine. "It 
defies human nature to expect that a junior researcher will say exactly what he 
thinks about a senior person with power. It just won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the reviews we get from anonymous reviewers are vastly better," says 
Dr. George D. Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's always easier to criticize anonymously -- but is it really 
better? Often, knowing the source of a criticism can be as valuable as the 
criticism itself. Precisely because science is a very human endeavor, 
researchers should know who critiqued their work. It's ironic that science -- 
which prides itself on the free flow of knowledge and moral courage of a 
Galileo and a Sakharov -- feels that its quality control mechanism works best 
in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Would science sputter with uncertainty and grind to a halt if scientists 
actually, yes, signed their work? Or might it just be possible that anonymity 
is a convenience that editors and reviewers are reluctant to let go? Given that 
the role of a referee is to challenge the hypotheses and methodologies -- not 
the character -- of the researcher, isn't it just possible that signed reviews 
would be more likely to change the tone -- and not the content -- of the 
critique? 
</P>
<P>
"There are occasions where anonymity allows a kind of vituperativeness that is 
unfair," acknowledges Dr. Edward Huth, the recently retired editor of Annals of 
Internal Medicine. "I think Koshland and Relman are being a little extreme . . 
. most of us work on some premises of peer review that really haven't been 
adequately tested. This policy, which is very much entrenched in journal 
reviews, is based on opinions rather than any evidence. A fair case might be 
made for testing whether there would be some kind of shift in quality if 
reviews were signed." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what evidence exists seems to suggest that scientists are not quite as 
craven about their critiques as some people think. Lundberg's JAMA published a 
research paper on peer review earlier this year indicating that "there was no 
association between signing and quality" of review. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the whole question of peer review has been drawing more scrutiny from 
journal editors recently. Next month, for example, there will be a meeting of 
journal editors sponsored by the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md., 
to set up an agenda on how best to explore some of the critical issues 
surrounding peer review. 
</P>
<P>
Drs. Robert H. and Suzanne W. Fletcher, who have succeeded Huth at the Annals 
of Internal Medicine, plan to use their journal to experiment more aggressively 
with signed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a fair chance it would run better than Koshland and Relman 
might think," asserts Robert Fletcher. "On the other hand, I'm not sure about 
that. . . . I guess we come out of a more pragmatic tradition: Would we get 
better reviews? I think it ought to be tested. The concern for principles is 
secondary." 
</P>
<P>
My concern for principles is primary. I think it's bad not to attach your name 
to your critique. It would be professionally unacceptable for a theater critic 
or a movie reviewer to shield their names. Who doesn't become a bit warier of a 
story that quotes an anonymous "source"? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, scientists are human with all the weaknesses that implies. But it also 
implies strength -- and one of those strengths is the willingness to have the 
courage of one's convictions and expertise. Indeed, it should be the editor's 
role to assure that the reviewer's criticisms are constructive. That's their 
job. The very existence of anonymity makes people feel that they are gravely at 
risk if they choose to be both open and honest. 
</P>
<P>
Peer review should not be a star chamber. On the other hand, people shouldn't 
be compelled to disclose who they are if they don't want to. I do have a 
suggestion, though: reward openness. Give funding preference to scientists who 
have the courage to attach their names to their work. 
</P>
<P>
Science should literally put its money where its mouth is and support the 
values of an open, energetic and honest exchange of ideas. Those exchanges are 
where great breakthroughs come from. You'll never have them if some of the most 
important participants are wearing masks.

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission adopted on Wednesday new pricing 
regulations for the nation's eight largest regional phone companies that it 
says could reduce long-distance charges by billions of dollars during the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, effective Jan. 1, will reduce the rates that the seven Baby Bell 
phone companies and General Telephone are allowed to charge long-distance 
carriers for interstate services. These services include connecting 
long-distance companies with the local phone network.

Lower charges to the long-distance companies should result in reduced charges 
for long-distance customers, the FCC said. But while the FCC said the action 
could save long-distance callers "billions" of dollars during the next four 
years, no firm estimates of the savings were available, and no immediate 
savings were forecast. 
</P>
<P>
However, an executive with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the nation's 
largest long-distance carrier, said the new price policies would result in a 5% 
rate cut by 1995 when contrasted with what the rate might have been without the 
new policies. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules will have no direct effect on the rates charged for local service 
provided by General Telephone and the seven Bell telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC also voted to lower the rate of return that local telephone companies 
can earn on their long-distance services to 11.25% from 12%, a move widely 
decried by local telephone companies. However, the decrease is expected to 
result in an immediate $317-million cut in fees the local phone companies can 
charge long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The new pricing policies for the local phone companies -- similar to those 
adopted by the commission a year ago for AT&amp;T -- allow the FCC to regulate 
the long-distance prices charged by the local telephone companies, not the 
profits generated by those charges. Similar policies governing local service 
rates charged to California telephone customers were adopted last year by the 
state Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the new policies is the philosophy -- still highly controversial -- that 
if regulators focus on the prices phone companies charge, rather than their 
profits, the companies will have an incentive to lower their own costs or 
increase their revenues. By lowering costs or raising sales, the argument goes, 
phone companies would be able to increase their profits beyond what they could 
earn if their profits were controlled by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new FCC order, local phone companies will be allowed to raise their 
long-distance prices at the rate of inflation, minus a "productivity factor" 
designed to account for the lower costs of producing phone service. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC assured that the complicated formula would result in real price 
reductions to telephone company customers. In addition, local carriers will be 
required to share with customers any profits beyond a specified upper limit. If 
the company gets too profitable, it would have to return all its profits to 
customers.

Mustang Ranch Seized: The Mustang Ranch, one of the world's best-known 
brothels, has been seized by the Internal Revenue Service and may soon be 
operated by a federal bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
After years of negotiations over millions in unpaid taxes owed by owner Joe 
Conforte, the IRS obtained an order from the bankruptcy court in Reno to begin 
liquidating the 105-room brothel. Jerri Coppa, the bankruptcy trustee assigned 
by the court to sell the property, said she planned to supervise the operation 
of the business until it could be sold. Coppa said when she arrived at the 
ranch, which is located about six miles east of Reno, she found the 
establishment closed and the employees scattered.

CHEVRON'S SUIT AGAINST PENNZOIL IS DISMISSED;

<P>
A federal judge Wednesday dismissed Chevron Corp.'s lawsuit charging that 
Pennzoil Co. illegally purchased nearly 9% of Chevron's stock, a Pennzoil 
lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti ruled that the suit was without merit after 
most of the charges had already been dismissed, Pennzoil attorney Stephen Bomse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Conti cited sworn declarations by Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke, who said 
Pennzoil had two priorities for investing the Texaco proceeds: achieving 
maximum long-term value for Pennzoil's shareholders and, if possible, a tax 
deferral on the settlement proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Liedtke statement also disclosed that Pennzoil had considered buying 
smaller oil companies outright but decided that they were either fully priced 
or unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Pennzoil considered buying British Petroleum PLC shares but was 
outbid by BP itself. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron said late Wednesday that it would review the possibility of appealing 
Conti's ruling. "We're disappointed with the outcome," said Chevron Chairman 
and Chief Executive Kenneth T. Derr, "and we're looking at the merits of an 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Chevron, a San Francisco-based oil company long haunted by takeover rumors, 
last December filed the lawsuit when Pennzoil, a much smaller rival, disclosed 
that it had bought about 31.5 million Chevron shares. 
</P>
<P>
William Edlund, Chevron's lead counsel in the case, said he had not seen the 
judge's 23-page ruling but was disappointed that the suit had been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, speaking as the lawyer but not for the company, I see some errors in 
it," Edlund said of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron argued that Pennzoil was seeking an active management role but said the 
company failed to disclose that in its filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry analysts have taken Chevron's point of view. "A company the size 
of Pennzoil is not going to take a position in a company the size of Chevron 
and be passive," said oil industry analyst Craig Schwerdt at Drake Capital 
Securities in Santa Monica. "They are in the same business. Pennzoil might try 
to get a board seat or two. And Chevron would not want somebody looking over 
its shoulder, especially if it's a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Schwerdt speculated that Pennzoil eventually might try to swap its Chevron 
stake for company assets, such as oil reserves.

SONY EXPANDS LINE OF DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDERS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTRONICS: THE FIRM WANTS TO ESTABLISH A MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE A 
SUIT SEEKING TO BAN THEIR IMPORTATION COMES TO COURT.

Under pressure to establish digital audio tape recorders in the U.S. market 
after a recent lawsuit challenging their importation, Sony Corp. on Wednesday 
introduced portable and car DAT machines to boost consumer interest in the 
costly and controversial products. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of Sony's $1,100 car DAT player and the $850 Walkman portable DAT 
recorder comes two months after Los Angeles songwriter Sammy Cahn and four 
others filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to block U.S. sales of Sony's 
digital audiotape recorders. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs, who filed the lawsuit July 9 on behalf of 40,000 American 
songwriters and music publishers, accused Sony of infringing their music 
copyrights because DAT recorders are able to make near-perfect copies of 
recorded material. 
</P>
<P>
DAT players, which achieve high-quality sound with digital technology similar 
to that of compact discs, have long been available for cars from companies such 
as Kenwood and Clarion. But so far only Sony has braved objections from 
composers and offered DAT recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Michael S. Oberman, lawyer for the songwriter plaintiffs, said Wednesday that 
the lawsuit was not ready for trial. But several experts said Sony's decision 
to quickly expand its lineup of digital audiotape machines was made to improve 
its chances for fighting the case. 
</P>
<P>
"A judge is more likely to grant an injunction (barring sales of DAT recorders) 
before Sony has made a big investment in DAT," said Paul Gluckman, managing 
editor of Audioweek, an industry trade publication. "Plus, I think the company 
wants to get other suppliers off the fence" regarding the introduction of DAT 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable Sony spokesman could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But 
in a prepared statement, the company said brisk sales of its two home DAT 
recorders prompted it to accelerate its plans to market car and portable units 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Sony's move drew praise from competitor Technics, the Secaucus, N.J.-based 
consumer electronics arm of Japan's Matsushita Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good and healthy for the market; I wish we did it first," said 
Paul Foschino, assistant general manager of Technics, which plans to introduce 
a $900 home DAT recorder later this month. "But regardless of who introduces 
them first, the idea of having more DAT players is increasing enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Sony reached agreement with Ford Motor Co. more than 18 months ago 
to offer DAT players as an option on selected Ford and Lincoln/Mercury cars. 
But the auto maker later dropped plans to offer the players. 
</P>
<P>
"DAT players were virtually useless because there were no (prerecorded) tapes 
available," said Rex Greenslade, spokesman for Ford's automotive component 
group. "Certainly the technology is very promising, and we remain interested if 
and when DAT becomes a viable market."

NEW TYPE OF SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIAL FOUND; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: HITACHI SAYS ITS NON-COPPER MEDIUM MAY BE CHEAPER TO PRODUCE THAN 
OTHER METHODS UNDER CONSIDERATION.

<P>
Five researchers at a Hitachi Ltd. laboratory just outside Tokyo have 
discovered a new class of superconductor materials that could help bring the 
revolutionary technology closer to commercial production, the company announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new material, a ceramic that includes vanadium and strontium, would 
probably be cheaper to produce and use than copper-based materials being 
researched, said Shinpei Matsuda, head of Hitachi's superconductor research 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Superconductors, which transmit energy without resistance, have the potential 
for opening the door to a new generation of products ranging from 
super-efficient generators to levitating trains. 
</P>
<P>
But for most applications, the material must first be converted to wire at a 
reasonable cost. Laboratories around the world are spending hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year to overcome that obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
It's no simple task. Most new classes of superconductors are ceramics and too 
brittle to be turned directly into wire. Because the copper in the compounds 
reacts with lesser metals, the ceramic must be sheathed in silver to be given 
the malleability of wire. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi solved that problem by eliminating copper from the compound. The 
resulting material can be packed into hollow copper wire, offering the 
potential for vastly reducing the cost of the wire. 
</P>
<P>
The new material also has the advantage of operating at a higher temperature. 
It becomes a superconductor after being cooled to minus 143 degrees Celsius. 
The best superconductors developed to date must be cooled to a temperature of 
minus 151 degrees Celsius before the electricity passes without resistance, 
Hitachi said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoji Tanaka, director of a government-backed superconductivity research 
consortium, called Hitachi's announcement "premature." 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to have seen them establish their data a little better 
before publishing their results," Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi's research results, which were submitted Tuesday to the Japanese 
Journal of Applied Physics for publication, are preliminary, Matsuda admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a runner on first. We need several hits before we can bring him home," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has been able to manufacture the substance only in small 
quantities. Consequently, Matsuda said, the company has been unable to 
determine either the exact chemical composition of the material or the size of 
the current it can carry. 
</P>
<P>
Inability to carry a sizable current would make the material impractical for 
most commercial applications. Even if the material proves too difficult to 
manufacture in large quantities, Matsuda said, the discovery would help 
scientists unravel the mysteries surrounding why certain materials act as 
superconductors by providing a whole new set of data. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda said the company's new materials team tested thousands of materials for 
superconducting properties before discovering the new compound. 
</P>
<P>
The team is part of a larger, 48-man group formed in 1987 soon after 
International Business Machines reignited interest in superconductors by 
announcing that it had discovered materials that become superconductors at far 
higher temperatures than previously thought possible.

Using a facsimile machine is as easy as using a copy machine. But you can also 
use your personal computer as a fax machine or turn your laser printer into a 
fax receiver. 
</P>
<P>
IBM PC and Macintosh users have several options. A fax modem allows you to send 
and receive. A regular data modem, along with a subscription to an electronic 
mail service, allows you to send text-only faxes. Another device turns your 
laser printer into a plain paper fax receiver. 
</P>
<P>
* Fax modem. This device, also known as a fax board, allows your PC to send and 
receive fax messages. Several are on the market, and nearly all come with 
software that lets you automate sending computer-generated documents to just 
about any fax machine in the world. Prices range from less than $200 to more 
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some fax modems are external and plug into your PC or Macintosh serial port; 
others are on circuit boards that plug into an expansion slot on an IBM 
compatible PC. Some fax modems operate at full speed -- 9,600 bits per second 
(bps) -- while others work at only 4,800 bps. 
</P>
<P>
What are the advantages of using a fax modem to send computer-generated 
documents? To begin with, computer-generated outgoing faxes are a lot better 
looking than the ones sent via regular fax machines. That's because the image 
doesn't have to go through the degradation of the fax machine's scanner. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage is that computer-generated faxes can be more easily 
automated. Most of the fax modems come with software that allows you to create 
directories of people you send faxes to. To send a fax, you just select the 
recipient(s) from a menu and press a key. What's more, you can schedule the 
faxes to go out at any time of day or night, such as when phone rates are 
lowest. You can also use your software to generate junk fax mail -- just what 
the world needs! 
</P>
<P>
Confidentiality is another advantage. Incoming faxes wind up on the recipient's 
hard disk instead of the fax machine's tray. Sending a confidential fax from 
your PC eliminates the need to stand guard over the company fax machine as you 
wait for it to be scanned. 
</P>
<P>
Fax modems also save paper and laser printer supplies by eliminating the need 
to print a copy. 
</P>
<P>
But there are disadvantages. First, it's more work than using a fax machine. 
You'll have to fool around with plug-in cards, cables, software and 
configuration files. Instead of walking up to the fax machine to insert a sheet 
of paper, you get to load in memory-resident software, configure special modem 
drivers and figure out how to get the fax software to work with all the other 
programs on your machine. 
</P>
<P>
And when it's time to receive a fax, you have to make sure your PC is on and be 
certain that the fax software is running either as your primary program or in 
the background. 
</P>
<P>
If you receive an incoming fax, you have to read it on your screen or print it 
out. If you want to send a copy of a brochure, newspaper article or other 
document that's not in your computer, you'll have to scan it first. Add another 
piece of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, if you decide to try a fax modem, you can choose from a wide range 
of systems. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best deals for users of IBM compatible systems is the Fax96 from 
Fremont Communications of Fremont, Calif. This product, which plugs into a PC, 
costs only $195 and comes with basic fax software that allows you to send and 
receive faxes in the background, add an optional cover sheet, broadcast 
multiple faxes or send at a delayed time. It also logs incoming and outgoing 
faxes and allows you to print or view incoming faxes on screen. For an extra 
$100, you can upgrade the fax modem so that you're able to call your home or 
office PC while traveling and have faxes forwarded to wherever you are. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont Communications can be reached at (415) 438-5000. Fax: (415) 490-2315. 
</P>
<P>
For portability, consider Touchbase Systems' $699 WorldPort. This pocket-sized 
fax and data modem runs on batteries and plugs into the serial port of a laptop 
or desktop PC. The company, in Northport, N.Y., is at (516) 261-0423. 
</P>
<P>
Macintosh users should consider Abaton Technology's $599 InterFax, which serves 
as a 2,400-bps data modem and a 9,600-bps fax modem. It sends and receives in 
the background and lets you use the regular Macintosh print commands to "print" 
your document to a fax machine, anywhere. Abaton, a division of Fremont, 
Calif.-based Everex, is at (800) 444-5321. 
</P>
<P>
* Regular data modem. As it turns out, you don't even need a special fax modem 
to send text messages from your PC. If you have a regular data modem, you can 
connect to MCI Mail, CompuServe or AT&amp;T Mail and use those services to send 
faxes. It's relatively inexpensive. MCI Mail, for example, charges 50 cents for 
the first half page plus 30 cents for each additional half page within the 
United States. Overseas prices are higher, but still within reach. A fax to 
England, for example, costs $1.50 for the first half page and 45 cents for each 
additional half page. I use MCI Mail or CompuServe to send faxes to my wife and 
children when I'm traveling with my laptop. For information about MCI Mail call 
(800) 444-6245. CompuServe can be reached at (800) 848-8199. 
</P>
<P>
* Plain paper fax receiver. The Fax-O-Matic from Tall Tree Systems of Palo Alto 
is a little $399 box that turns a Hewlett-Packard compatible laser printer into 
a plain paper fax receiver. It doesn't send faxes, but it does allow your laser 
printer to print them. That eliminates that smelly and expensive thermal fax 
paper. You plug the laser printer into the device, which comes with an extra 
parallel cable that allows your PC to continue to print to the laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need to turn on your computer, nor do you need to load or run 
software. The unit can store up to 32 pages of incoming faxes in case the 
printer is off or is busy. Fax-O-Matic is a good companion product for people 
who use a fax modem to send documents but don't want to go through the hassle 
of using their PC to receive faxes. 
</P>
<P>
Faxes are printed at 150 dots per inch. That's not quite as good as the 
standard 200-dots-per-inch resolution that you get with regular fax machines, 
but it is still quite readable. Legal and other oversized pages are 
automatically reduced to 8 1/2 by 11 inches to accommodate the paper generally 
used in laser printers. 
</P>
<P>
Tall Tree Systems can be reached at (415) 493-1980. Fax: (415) 493-7639.

ART BUCHWALD: WE SHOULDN'T BANK ON GERMAN SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The secret is out: Germany is now the most reluctant of dragons when it comes 
to supporting the Western Allies in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
I asked a German acquaintance, Otto Kraus, why Germany has refused to help the 
United States in its battle with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
With tears in his eyes, Otto replied: "We don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
"Come off it, Otto. What do you mean Germany doesn't have any money?" 
</P>
<P>
He explained: "Iraq won't pay us for all the poison gas equipment and the 
biological weapons we sent them. They won't even pay for the nuclear machinery 
we delivered. We're stuck with so many bills Germany can't afford to get into a 
quarrel with Iraq at this time." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because Saddam Hussein has been one of our best customers. We are unable to 
sell him anything now. However, once the embargo is lifted, we want Iraq to 
remember us with kindness." 
</P>
<P>
"That's fair, and yet don't you feel an obligation to the U.N. countries who 
are spitting mad that Iraq annexed Kuwait?" 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like it, but you must remember that Germany annexed a lot of 
territory at the beginning of World War II, so we're not in a position to 
criticize anybody else. It is unreasonable that we should be singled out 
because we won't send troops to Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
"Does this have anything to do with your constitution?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's because it's too hot there. German troops hate the heat, that's why 
we never did well in North Africa." 
</P>
<P>
"Otto, you owe it to the United States. We helped rebuild your nation out of 
the rubble. We initiated the Berlin airlift to protect you from the Russians. 
We bought every camera Germany could make. Now that the chips are down, your 
people should reciprocate and come to our aid." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we should, but that means sending troops to the desert. Are you sure 
you want us to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sure. After all, the oil in Kuwait is your oil as well as ours." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows this, but we are in fact assisting the United States in the 
Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
"How?" 
</P>
<P>
"We are supplying stereo equipment to U.S. PXes. This is top-of-the-line stuff 
you don't even find in Crazy Eddie's." 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to tell you, Otto, but Germany is considered the 'cowardly lion' of the 
Western World." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter what the world thinks as long as we can get Iraq to pay its 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
"Once you had a reputation for being a bully; now everyone says you are a 
wimp." 
</P>
<P>
"What business is it of yours what we do?" Otto asked. 
</P>
<P>
I replied, "Because I have a vested interest in everything Germany does. I own 
a Mercedes-Benz." 
</P>
<P>
Otto defended himself: "All we have been doing in the Middle East is following 
orders." 
</P>
<P>
"Whose orders?" 
</P>
<P>
"The German Central Bank's."

YOUR WHEELS: RECORDS KEEP TRACK OF SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have just purchased a new car. Can you suggest what sorts of 
records I should keep? -- P.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Certain records will be helpful in maintaining the car, as well as 
selling it in the future. Many owners of cars keep every scrap of paper from 
their purchase and later service. You don't need to do all of that, but some 
basic record-keeping is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
The most important concern is to keep a log that includes mileage and dates of 
major service, including tuneups, oil changes, tire rotations, valve 
adjustments, coolant replacement and other fluid changes. It is difficult to 
keep all of this information in your memory and a slip could mean that vital 
fluids are allowed to drop too low or become too dirty. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a good idea to keep invoices or customer receipts of your major 
service, in case a part or service fails while it is still under warranty. This 
is especially important in the case of tires and other safety items. 
</P>
<P>
A small file at home should suffice for the service records. And a notebook in 
the glove compartment ought to be adequate for the maintenance log. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are also a computer buff, there is now available a computer software 
program that allows you to keep track of the service records for up to four 
automobiles. It tracks such expenses as fuel, oil, maintenance and repairs 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The software is produced by Oak Tree Systems of Palm Desert, which can be 
reached at (619) 341-1559. Michael Jones, Oak Tree president, said the software 
is best suited to a well-organized motorist who is willing to keep receipts, 
record mileage and post maintenance expenses on the computer system. 
</P>
<P>
Until now such software systems were available only for fleet operators and 
were quite costly. The Oak Tree system sells for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
To use the system, a motorist creates a file for each of his or her cars and 
then types in regular entries on gasoline purchases, oil changes, maintenance 
and repairs. The central location could conceivably keep records more organized 
than if separate logs were located in each car. The downside of the system is 
that instead of simply entering the data into a notebook in the car, it must be 
taken home and entered into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
One side benefit of the system is that it seems to greatly impress the Internal 
Revenue Service if the agency raises questions during an audit about taxpayer 
deductions for auto expenses, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does driving on hot pavement during the summer accelerate tire wear or is 
very cold weather harder on tires? 
</P>
<P>
A: All temperature extremes are hard on tires, but hot pavement will tend to 
accentuate tire wear. The rubber softens as it gets hotter and tends to wear 
out more quickly when it is soft. The only benefit is that the softer rubber 
has somewhat better traction. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 1986 Cadillac Sedan De Ville with a 4.1 liter engine. Is the 
transmission in that car one of GM's lemons? -- T.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: The Cadillac Sedan De Ville has a Model 200 transmission that is about on a 
par with the other GM transmissions, including the 125 and 400. The whole 
series of transmissions was a consumer nightmare, but GM has been working in 
the past two years to clean up its act. It may be too early to tell yet whether 
the new generation of transmissions has improved. You have to assume, though, 
that with all of the money GM is investing in new products and processes, it 
will eventually improve.

ERMA BOMBECK: SPECTATORS AT THEIR KIDS' STRUGGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK, Erma Bombeck is on vacation. She left a few of her favorite 
columns behind. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was supposed to have been the most wonderful period of my life. 
</P>
<P>
My grown kids are struggling for survival. All the advice I gave them and they 
ignored is coming back to haunt them. They are getting an opportunity to 
experience firsthand that man does not live by allowance alone. 
</P>
<P>
So how come I feel so lousy? 
</P>
<P>
All the time they were growing up, their father and I regaled them with 
wonderful stories about how broke and deprived we were. We told them how their 
father scrubbed post office floors at night to buy my engagement ring. We told 
them how we took eight years to pay off a secondhand shag rug and how we were 
married for five years before we owned a car. We made them sick they missed the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Every time they asked for help, we told them we couldn't possibly deny them the 
poverty they so richly deserved because it builds character. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric was easy. Sitting by and watching is the hard part. I hate it. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want them to sell velvet pictures from door to door. I don't want them 
to buy gasoline $2 at a time. I don't want them to eat cold tacos from a doggy 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
I want . . . I want the birth without the pain. I want the pride without the 
loneliness. I want the success without the sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
I want what I have no right to want. I want them to begin where we are ending 
without asking or even knowing the price it took to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I must sit like a spectator and watch the struggle they so desperately 
need. For they are finding out things about themselves they have to know to 
live out the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
It takes every bit of restraint I have to watch, say nothing, and remember . . 
. someone did it for me.

A PUZZLING SEARCH FOR A PROPHETIC DESTINY; 
</P>
<P>
THE HEALER BY AHARON APPELFELD TRANSLATED FROM HEBREW BY JEFFREY M. GREEN GROVE 
WEIDENFELD $16.95, 184 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
"In the autumn they arrived. The way had been long, exhausting, and toward the 
end it had been beyond the mother's strength." 
</P>
<P>
So begins Aharon Appelfeld's fable "The Healer," about the great sea change 
that overtook Central Europe's Jews in the 1930s; a tidal wave that would bear 
millions to death and others to salvation in Israel. It has an evident biblical 
cast. Oddly, what it suggests is the Nativity story, particularly as we read of 
a strangely distanced father and of the inn at which the family dismounts. 
</P>
<P>
It is a puzzle why this Christian echo should be sounded in a story of Viennese 
Jews, whose secure bourgeois status, attained after centuries of struggle, was 
shattered almost in a day. Appelfeld's story is full of such puzzles, and yet 
its gist is clear. If anything, it is too clear. Perhaps directness bordering 
on the obvious, in a writer of such artfulness, is its ultimate puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, a prosperous businessman, has arrived with his family, after a terrible 
three-day journey by train and cart, in a remote village in the Carpathian 
Mountains. It is inhabited entirely by Jews; its distinction is the presence of 
an old Talmudic scholar with a reputation as a healer. 
</P>
<P>
Felix is angry, and his anger masks a deep unsettlement. He is a believer in 
science, in Western civilization and -- like many European Jews at the time -- 
in the possibility of full integration. But his beloved daughter, Helga, a 
pianist, has fallen into a wasting depression that the doctors cannot cure. His 
wife, Henrietta, has heard of the healer and stands up out of her accustomed 
submissiveness to insist on visiting him. 
</P>
<P>
Felix acquiesces, but the journey and the months that he spends in the village 
are a kind of annihilation. In Vienna, he was the family's patriarchal center; 
here, as Henrietta and Helga patiently follow the healer's injunction to learn 
Hebrew and study the Bible, he feels irrelevant and estranged. 
</P>
<P>
More deeply, though, he feels the overthrow of all his Western values, of the 
civilized assimilation that is his life. "If a man leaves his home and journeys 
into the desert he is guilty," he protests, as they arrive in this very 
different Jewish world of peasants and foresters. And the recourse to a 
rabbinical healer is pure scandal to him, evoking an ancestral legacy that 
stands for separation from his European world. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not pray on orders," he objects. But neither his wife nor his daughter 
listens. They become remote, and Felix drifts into a kind of hallucinatory 
depression, one that colors the dreamlike tone, arbitrary jumps and disjointed 
connections with which the story is told. 
</P>
<P>
Such a style suggests, sometimes movingly, the imminent extinction of both a 
life and a way of life. Felix's confused perceptions, in their way, are a kind 
of "Death of Ivan Illich." But Appelfeld can be coarse and careless in his use 
of it; to write of disconnection requires the finest of fictional connections. 
Part of the coarseness may be due to an unappealing translation. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the thrust of Appelfeld's parable is plain and powerful. The 
family's exodus, the search for a prophetic destiny that is the contrary of 
assimilation, the village of Jews who work the soil -- all these prefigure the 
land of Israel as the alternative to destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Where Appelfeld shows his strength is in his avoidance of sentimentality. By 
centering the story in Felix's confused perception, he suggests that salvation 
has its own desolateness. The village, the healer, and Helga's and Henrietta's 
conversion have no particular allure. On the contrary, if there is any focus of 
sympathy, it is upon Felix's dying dream of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
That it is indeed dying is made clear in the book's last and best section. 
Traveling first-class on the train back to Vienna -- Helga and Henrietta remain 
in the village -- Felix is back in his European comforts. But the hospitable 
dining-car waitress makes anti-Semitic remarks as she serves an excellent meal, 
and a police inspector harasses him for being Jewish. There is nothing happy 
about salvation: All it does is save.

POP BEAT: BLASTS FROM '70S 'EARTH DOGS' ARE A BREED APART; 
</P>

THE TED NUGENT-LED DAMN YANKEES CRANK AND STRUT AT IRVINE MEADOWS, BUT THE 
GENERIC-SOUNDING BAD COMPANY IS BUT A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF.

<P>
Some earth dogs still can have their day. Others would be better off just 
rolling over and burying their bones. 
</P>
<P>
"Earth dog" was the term that radio programming consultants coined for arena 
bands of the '70s and early '80s whose rock was generally unimaginative, 
unambitious, but meaty and beaty enough to keep disco-hating middle-American 
consumers well-satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Damn Yankees, a conglomeration of earth dog all-stars built around mad mutt Ted 
Nugent, showed lots of bite if not a bit of brains during a fun, energized 
opening set Tuesday night at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Headliner Bad Company had moments when it replicated the solid, no-nonsense 
style of rock that it coined on a strong 1974 debut album. But the hollow husk 
of a band on stage had almost no legitimate link with that past, and its 
charmless, workaday set held out no promise for the future. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Damn Yankees is a calculated attempt to revive the flagging 
careers of Nugent, for whom the '80s were a long, dry spell; singer-guitarist 
Tommy Shaw, whose solo career sank after his old band, Styx, called it quits; 
and Jack Blades, former singer of Night Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
On Damn Yankees' successful debut album, the corporate slickness of Shaw and 
Blades often staunches Nugent's abundant animal spirits. But on stage, a nice 
symbiosis took place. Nugent's fire heated up his partners, while the melodic 
pop craftsmanship of Shaw and Blades provided structure that kept Nugent from 
firing off in every direction, as he is prone to when left on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Nugent is without a doubt one of the most obnoxious figures in rock, but he is 
also impossible to truly dislike. He reveled in the role of the flashy guitar 
hero, striking gladiatorial poses, casting wild-eyed looks. But unlike just 
about everybody else, Nugent's gleeful, macho antics are more endearing than 
affected. If he'd only been born with an ounce of smarts and reflectiveness to 
go with the wildness, Nugent could have been a real contender instead of an 
amusing sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
His playing was fleet and honed yet customarily unruly, too, as he whanged and 
danged with whammy bar screeches and feedback. He only misfired in a solo 
guitar spot intended as a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan: It offered little in 
the way of melodic ideas or dynamic buildup. 
</P>
<P>
The set avoided the slicker, more turgid songs on the "Damn Yankees" album and 
stuck to the spirited stuff. Nugent's solo hits "Free for All" and "Cat Scratch 
Fever" both were highlights, and one of Styx's more tolerable pomp-rockers 
filled out the set. Blades -- a tiny fellow dwarfed by the strapping Nugent -- 
frolicked about, showing more spirit than you'd expect from a Night Ranger 
alumnus. He and Shaw both sang with serviceable, husky yowls. 
</P>
<P>
Damn Yankees were best off sticking to songs about rampant hormones. Their 
other theme, rampant jingoism, is something we can all do without. Shaw and 
Nugent expressed their enthusiasm for our forces in Saudi Arabia by uttering 
ethnic slurs against Arabs -- or "towel-heads," as Shaw called them. If our 
Arab allies, or anyone else, would like to refer to Damn Yankees as 
"lunk-heads," or something similar, they would be right on target. 
</P>
<P>
The lunk-heads did have just enough wit for some enjoyable slapstick humor. 
Nugent grabbed Shaw's acoustic guitar after he strummed and crooned the 
introduction to Styx's treacly ballad "Babe" and smashed the offending 
instrument to bits. The show ended with Shaw and Blades dragging a 
still-soloing Nugent out by his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Company resembled one of those '50s or '60s nostalgia acts that play games 
with their audiences by touring under a famous name, playing the old hits while 
trying to disguise the fact that only the bassist or drummer actually remains 
from the original ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
On its current album, "Holy Water," guitarist Mick Ralphs and drummer Simon 
Kirke are holdovers from the original four-man Bad Company lineup -- enough, 
perhaps, to somewhat justify continued use of the name in the absence of 
original front man Paul Rodgers. But Ralphs is not on tour with the band (a 
spokeswoman for Atco Records said Ralphs remained in England because of family 
responsibilities -- a newborn child and the illness of his father). 
</P>
<P>
Kirke or singer Brian Howe should have played straight with the audience and 
announced what was up with Ralphs. Instead, they performed their 90-minute set 
with three supporting players who received no introduction. Geoffrey Whitehorn, 
a solid replacement lead guitarist for Ralphs, took solo after solo without 
ever getting the spotlight. Instead, it stayed perpetually on Howe, even when 
he was doing nothing and had his back turned. 
</P>
<P>
Howe did his best singing when echoing Rodgers' old parts, though he lacked 
that fine singer's depth of feeling and invention. Half of the 14 songs were 
drawn from Rodgers' era; the rest were from the three albums Bad Company has 
made since Kirke and Ralphs reformed the dormant band with Howe in 1986. On 
newer songs, most of them cliched, inflated corporate rock, Howe sounded 
generically husky -- a little Rod Stewart, some Eddie Money, and a whole lot of 
Foreigner's Lou Gramm. 
</P>
<P>
Howe's performing persona was as generic as his singing style. Lacking anything 
of substance to say, he cussed to be cool, claiming macho points for himself by 
threatening to beat to a pulp somebody who was throwing wads of paper at him 
(maybe they had "Where's Mick?" written on them). When he wasn't acting tough, 
Howe was making a beggar of himself, wheedling applause from the audience with 
cupped ear or outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Bad Company had its moments. The band showed off the old Bad 
Company's sinewy, lean style early on with "Movin' On" and "Rock and Roll 
Fantasy." Kirke, who is built like Conan the Barbarian, powered everything with 
thwacking that was concise, precise and mighty. He also took a spirited turn 
singing a solo acoustic guitar version of "Shooting Star" that he dedicated to 
Stevie Ray Vaughan. After that, the show settled into mid-tempo sameness from 
which it never recovered. Bad Company threatened to ignite when it finally 
launched into a fast rocker that included a smart, speeded-up quotation of the 
bass line from Free's "All Right Now." But the spark quickly fizzled into a 
by-the-numbers hard-rock drum solo. 
</P>
<P>
With Bad Company in decline, fans would do better to seek out some real riches 
in its ancestral past -- look for albums by Free, the excellent, bluesy British 
hard rock band of the late '60s and early '70s that featured Rodgers and Kirke.

JESUS JONES STIRS UP SLAM PIT AND SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Midway through Jesus Jones' show at Bogart's in Long Beach on Tuesday, singer 
Mike Edwards quieted down the din of his London-based band and, with spare 
instrumental backing, sang a wry welcome back to Queen Victoria and all she 
stands for. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone's looking for a '90s heir to Ray Davies, Edwards might be it. 
</P>
<P>
The song recalled the Kinks' artful social commentary and folksy, music-hall 
flavor, and the lanky Edwards has something of Davies' bemused intensity -- 
though he looks more like a skateboard thrasher than a rock 'n' roll dandy. 
</P>
<P>
That new song's subdued arrangement was hardly typical of the uproar and 
ferment that marked most of Jesus Jones' set, but it underscored a key point 
about the group, which is starting to draw attention with its debut album 
"Liquidizer": Though the band's press clips emphasize the sampling technology 
that thickens the textures on the album, Jesus Jones' strength is its songs, 
not the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the quintet's sound was superfluous at Bogart's. Replacing the 
record's electronic densities and mechanized beats with a leaner, looser, 
rhythm-oriented attack (the leanness might have had something to do with the 
equipment problems Edwards kept joking about), JJ stirred up both slam pit and 
spirits with its raging blend of thrash, funk and pop. The set-closing "Never 
Enough" -- with the taunting refrain of "so you want to be happy . . . don't 
you know happy is never enough" -- has the earmarks of a '90s anthem. And Jesus 
Jones looks like a band that can live up to the challenge of that standard.

ONE-ACTS ATTACK APARTHEID

<TEXT>
<P>
Two one-acts at West Coast Ensemble come out of South Africa's painful and 
mean-spirited adherence to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Fourie's "Big Boys," adapted and directed by Paul Van Zyl, contrasts 
two teen-age prisoners, one black and one white, with their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
When the play focuses on the youngsters, played with heartfelt earnestness by 
Philip Nawab Day and Randall Slavin, it says a lot about the darkness of South 
Africa's vision of itself. Clyde Talley II and Patrick Pankhurst as the older 
men just barely overcome the pamphleteering tone that saps the play's strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Still Born," by Van Zyl and Andrew Buckland, is a moving confrontational drama 
setting a bitter veteran against a younger man about to enter the army. Its 
power is in its simplicity as an anti-war play only peripherally about its 
specific locale. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Stafford as the vet and Rocco Vienhage as the innocent who sidesteps his 
assaults, give exceptional performances under Claudia Jaffee's sage direction. 
The vet's battle fantasy scene would be more frightening confined to center 
stage rather than meandering through the theater, but Jaffee has a firm grip on 
the text. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, Mondays through Wednesdays, 8 p.m.,

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A TASTE OF THE BIZARRE FROM MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: UCLA FILM ARCHIVE SCHEDULES A SERIES OF WORKS BY ARTURO RIPSTEIN AND 
JAIME HUMBERTO HERMOSILLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA Film Archive, the primary film programmer for the Los Angeles 
Festival, launches Saturday in Melnitz Theater "The Films of Arturo Ripstein 
and Jaime Humberto Hermosillo." Not only is the archive repeating films shown 
in the L.A. Festival, but adding many more by two of Mexico's finest directors. 
The influence of Luis Bunuel, long in Mexican exile, is probably inescapable 
for serious Mexican directors, yet Ripstein and Hermosillo have developed their 
own distinctive personalities while sharing with the Spanish master a taste for 
the bizarre and darkly humorous. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Ripstein first came to attention with "The Castle of Purity" 
(1972), which screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m., a film so off-putting that his 
subsequent achievements have come as a surprise. An allegory of relentless 
morbidity and tedium from a story by Octavio Paz, it stars Claudio Brook as a 
rat-poison manufacturer so disenchanted with the world that he attempts to seal 
it off entirely from his family, who when we meet them have been sequestered in 
their crumbling mansion for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, however, Ripstein came up with a vastly more impressive and 
imaginative fable, "A Place Without Limits" (screening Sunday at 7:30 p.m.). 
Spanning two generations of life in a seedy village falling increasingly into 
the grasp of an elderly politico, it tells of a drag-queen flamenco dancer 
(Roberto Cobo, who is remarkable with his sinewy physique at poignant odds with 
his effeminate mannerisms) seduced by the local madam (Ana Martin) on a bet in 
order that she win ownership of her bordello -- and of Cobo's later brave act 
of self-sacrifice to protect their beautiful daughter (Lucha Villa). 
</P>
<P>
The film emerges as an all-out attack on machismo, suggesting that it can often 
mask in a man a highly insecure sense of masculinity. "A Place Without Limits" 
is "La Cage aux Folles" played for tragedy; it has been reported that Manuel 
Puig contributed to the script without credit. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for "Dona Herlinda and Her Son," which has been called the first 
Mexican film to deal openly with homosexuality, Hermosillo is captivated by 
dominance and submission within relationships of people of bourgeois propriety. 
Subtle, languorous and sly, Hermosillo's 1974 "The Dog's Birthday," screening 
Sunday after a 2 p.m. presentation of Ripstein's "Time to Die," gradually 
reveals the full and unexpected impact upon a prosperous middle-aged tailor 
(Jorge Martinez de Hoyos) of the murder of a beautiful young woman (Diana 
Bracho) whose husband (Hector Bonilla), a handsome champion swimmer, was once 
in the tailor's employ. Hermosillo holds his cards until the last moment and 
then delivers a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
If you missed "Passion According to Bereneice" (1975), one of Hermosillo's best 
films, you will have another chance to see it when it screens Saturday 
following "The Castle of Purity." Hermosillo gracefully sets up a volatile 
attraction between a repressed young widow (Martha Navarro), her beauty 
scarcely marred by an intriguing scar, and a dashing young doctor (Pedro 
Armendariz Jr.). Full schedule and information: (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.

SHOW AIMS TO HELP REVIVE ALEX THEATRE; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYHOUSE: THE MUSICAL BEGINS WITH A RE-CREATION OF THE 1925 GRAND OPENING. THE 
SHOWCASE IS TOUTED AS A CIVIC ARTS CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the first time in more than five decades, dancers' feet bounded on the 
stage of the Alex Theatre on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for next week's Broadway-style musical, "Alex Extravaganza," 
aficionados of the 1925 theater pushed its giant movie screen back on rollers, 
giving access to a stage that hadn't been used for a live performance since the 
mid-1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the volunteer cast for the Alex fund-raising event began their 
first rehearsal in the 1,115-seat hall, where they will perform Wednesday and 
Thursday nights. Until Saturday, the troupe had rehearsed exclusively in a 
nearby dance studio. 
</P>
<P>
The show, written and directed by Glendale resident Paul Shipton, tells the 
story of the Alex from its inception in the vaudeville era to its years as a 
first-run movie house, where stars such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope came to see 
a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Both nights' events will begin at 7:30, with a re-creation of the theater's 
1925 grand opening in the forecourt. Actors dressed as stars of the day will 
arrive in limousines and, in some cases, will be accompanied by the actual 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
The performance will use film clips, slides and song-and-dance routines in 
period costume to recapture events in the Alex from the days when Orpheum 
vaudeville acts and Fanchon and Marco live musicals were seen to the erection 
of the 100-foot tower and street-side box office in the 1940s and the arrival 
of Elizabeth Taylor for the preview of "National Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
The event is being staged by the Alex Theatre Revitalization Project, a 
committee of the Glendale Historical Society. The group is raising money in 
hopes of restoring the Alex as a civic performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will be used to hire a theater consultant to prepare a business and 
marketing plan for a restored Alex, said Andrea Humberger, president of the 
Glendale Historical Society. The group sees the Alex as the focus of future 
development in the 200 block of North Brand Boulevard and hopes to persuade the 
Glendale City Council to designate the theater as the site for the performing 
arts center contemplated in the city's downtown redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 report, the society estimated that the Alex could be restored, 
improved technically and expanded with rehearsal and small audience spaces for 
about half the $20-million cost of building a new theater of similar size. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration would include reinstallation of about 1,000 seats, with 
restoration of the balcony, which remained closed after a 1948 fire. 
</P>
<P>
The society will offer tours of the theater Saturday while rehearsals for the 
show are in progress. The 30-minute tours will leave every 10 minutes between 
10 and 11 a.m. Tour tickets are $5. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for "Alex Extravaganza" will be sold at the theater Saturday from 10 
a.m. to noon. Tickets are also being sold by phone at (818) 507-5397. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are $15 for Wednesday's performance and $50 for Thursday's, which will 
be preceded by a champagne reception with Bob Hope, honorary chairman of the 
event.

JAWS '90 -- COYOTES DROP IN FOR MEALS; 
</P>
<P>
CANYONS: DROUGHT AND DEVELOPMENT DRIVE THE CANINES CLOSER TO HUMANS. RESIDENTS 
FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN AND PETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, Mandeville Canyon homeowner Randy Jacobs followed the morning 
ritual of sending his three Yorkshire terriers through a kitchen doggy door 
into the back yard. But awaiting their arrival was one wily coyote, who snapped 
one of the dogs up in its jaws and disappeared over a six-foot chain-link fence 
as Jacobs looked on helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Maureen Gratten watched the coyote scamper through her yard, where she 
plays with her month-old twins and two older children. After several other 
coyote sightings, she says, the older children are afraid to play outside and 
she and her husband fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to see dogs get killed, but my biggest concern is the children," 
said Gratten's husband, Claude Dorais. "To a coyote, a little baby and a little 
dog are the same. They're food." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Los Angeles hillside homeowners and coyotes have generally 
maintained a separateness despite their overlapping habitat. Lingering at the 
edge of the burgeoning city, coyotes remained invisible in the day, waiting 
until night to retake the brush-covered canyons. 
</P>
<P>
But that peace has been broken recently, as drought and development have forced 
coyotes away from their normal foraging patterns. And not just in Brentwood's 
Mandeville Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Miles away, in Laurel Canyon, residents have reported similar sightings. A 
coyote killed a macaw on the front porch of a hillside home, and another person 
said a neighborhood cat recently was snatched up by one of the wild canines. To 
get to the cat, the neighbor said, the coyote climbed more than 40 concrete 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers say they are not surprised by the surge. The coyote has 
long been considered among the smartest and most adaptable creatures on earth. 
Wildlife officials say the animals are just adjusting to the scarcity of food 
because of the drought and new developments that encroach on their natural 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, animal experts say, the urban coyote has become so accustomed to 
humans that it has lost its fear of his two-legged neighbor. Although coyotes 
in rural areas will rarely get close to people, Los Angeles residents routinely 
report that the animals sometimes stand within several feet of them without 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that there are more coyotes, but that there is just less room for 
them and less natural game," said Louis P. Dedeaux, wildlife specialist with 
the city Department of Animal Regulation. "When you have a drought condition, 
the litters of their natural prey dwindle and the coyotes become more active in 
the urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are definitely getting more brazen. They're probably the smartest 
animal in North America and they know what they can get away with. And if the 
opportunity (to grab a small animal) exists, they'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, several coyote sightings were reported on the highly developed 
flatlands of Beverly Hills. Residents reported several animals missing, and a 
few neighbors made some gruesome finds south of Santa Monica Boulevard: remains 
of cats and small dogs that had been unable to escape the coyotes' powerful 
jaws. 
</P>
<P>
Dedeaux said Westside animal control officers, who cover the area between the 
Hollywood Hills to the Pacific Ocean and from Mulholland Drive to El Segundo, 
expect to catch between 80 to 100 coyotes this year, an increase of about 25% 
over past years. Coyotes have been captured in the hilly enclaves of Pacific 
Palisades, Brentwood, Malibu, Bel-Air and even Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Dorais said that since he moved to Mandeville Canyon five years ago, he has 
rarely seen a coyote, although he can hear them outside his window at night. 
But so far this year, he said, he has spotted at least four coyotes in the 
daytime, including one that attacked his poodle before he was able to run it 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Dorais' concern prompted Dedeaux to put a coyote trap in the family's back 
yard, which can be done when there are repeated sightings in a single area. 
However, wildlife specialists say the best defense against coyotes is to remove 
food, water and garbage from areas accessible to the animals and to keep small 
pets inside, especially from dusk to dawn. Dedeaux said coyotes rarely attack 
humans and almost never attack anything larger than themselves. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jacobs is taking extra precautions and urging other canyon homeowners 
to do the same. He is building an outdoor cage for his dogs, saying that 
enclosing them is the only way to protect them from animals that can outrun any 
dog and have been known to scale 14-foot fences. 
</P>
<P>
"We know coyotes come with the neighborhood, but this is a serious problem," 
Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
Dedeaux said that as long as the drought persists, coyotes will continue to 
extend their boundaries. But he said that if homeowners take normal precations 
to protect their animals, they shouldn't experience problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that we need the coyotes to maintain (ecological) balance," he 
said. "They're good for rodent control. But when you look at the overall 
picture, with the drought and the development, it's only natural that you'd 
begin to see more of them. The situation just calls for them to be more 
visible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TALE OF THE COYOTE 
</P>
<P>
Adaptable, cautious and opportunistic, the coyote was historically an animal of 
the West. It has adapted far better than most large mammals to human 
encroachment, and now ranges from Alaska to New England to Costa Rica. Numbers 
continue to be generally on the rise in the West, with populations as high as 
six per square mile in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
Canis latrans, as it is known in scientific circles, is considered a species of 
wolf. It averages 4 to 4 1/2 feet in length (including tail). Most adult 
coyotes weigh between 30 and 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
They will eat almost anything, animal or vegetable, but rarely attack anything 
larger than themselves. They have no natural enemies, other than man. 
</P>
<P>
Despite attempts to the contrary, the consensus among wildlife experts is that 
coyotes cannot be domesticated.

BUILDING BAN OKD FOR FOOTHILL BOULEVARD; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: THE LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE COUNCIL HALTS CONSTRUCTION ON THE MAIN 
COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR FOR 45 DAYS. THE ACTION COULD BE EXTENDED FOR A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual show of unity, the La Canada Flintridge City Council on Monday 
adopted a strict moratorium on construction along the community's main corridor 
-- Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency ordinance, adopted unanimously, becomes effective immediately and 
prohibits almost all new development for 45 days, blocking at least half a 
dozen projects that were about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium could be extended for a year or more while the city develops a 
long-range planning guide for the 3.5-mile commercial strip of Foothill between 
Briggs Avenue and Oak Grove Drive, the entire length of the boulevard within 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The action applies to all commercial and residential construction, except for 
the Sport Chalet Shopping Village proposed for the intersection of Angeles 
Crest Highway and Foothill. The council earlier gave approval to the village 
project -- which will be the largest shopping center in the community -- after 
six years of extensive studies and debate. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium will block all other construction, including several office and 
retail developments that were about to get under way. The developers of those 
projects, however, may appeal to the City Council for an exemption. The 
moratorium does not affect projects that already have building permits. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise moratorium was adopted just one week after members of the city's 
Planning Commission warned council members at an informal breakfast of 
community leaders that construction along the booming commercial district has 
gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they have heard growing complaints from residents about 
the encroachment of high-density development in the affluent, suburban 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get back in control," said Councilwoman Joan C. Feehan, who called 
for the moratorium. "We need to take time to take a step back and look and see 
what's down there . . . to throw a net over everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're not going to be popular with a certain segment of the population, 
but I would rather be that than sitting back and doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The city has no figures on the amount of new commercial construction in the 
community, but officials said a change in the amount and type of development 
has become apparent during the last year or so. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, gas stations, shops, service businesses and older residences 
have been replaced by two-story commercial and office buildings, said Craig 
Ewing, the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
"When you replace a one-story building with a two-story building, it changes 
the bulk and intensity of development. That looks different and changes the 
perception of the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials have fretted that underground parking garages are out of 
character with the community and that higher-density development is beginning 
to cause traffic congestion, parking shortages and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Council members often are divided on city issues, but the five members said 
they thought the urgency moratorium was necessary to stop development while the 
city develops a master plan. However, several said they may allow exceptions to 
the building moratorium for projects that were about to be awarded building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires the city to conduct a public hearing within 45 days before 
the moratorium could be extended.

Bohdanius (Bo) Leon Jaworsky, owner of the Collectors Camelot nostalgia shop in 
Glendale, believes he has stepped into the "Twilight Zone," the often 
frightening fantasy world depicted in a poster on his wall. 
</P>
<P>
The former Sunday school teacher said he was arrested after Glendale police 
"manufactured" a case against him. Later, city officials refused to renew the 
secondhand sales permit he needs to continue selling used record albums, 
classic comic books and vintage baseball cards bearing images of Roy 
Campanella, Roger Maris and Satchell Paige. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendale police say there is nothing imaginary about the Jaworsky's 
troubles. They allege that he has dealt in stolen Nintendo video games, and 
they've urged city officials to shut down his business. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council was to decide Tuesday whether to hear Jaworsky's plea 
for a restoration of his permit. Instead, the council voted to await the 
outcome of his criminal trial, which begins Oct. 2 in Glendale Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The store owner has been charged with two misdemeanor counts of attempting to 
buy stolen property. Each is punishable by up to a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Jaworsky, a 43-year-old La Crescenta resident, said he borrowed on his life 
insurance, sold a valuable guitar and ran up large credit card bills to open 
his nostalgia shop in January, 1989. Since then, he said, he has had to cope 
with two burglaries, a smashed store window, the criminal arrest and the city's 
permit denial. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am struggling to start a business, and I'm having all these things 
happen to me," he said. "I feel like I'm being victimized from all sides. It 
boggles the mind." 
</P>
<P>
Jaworsky, who taught Sunday school three years ago at the First Baptist Church 
in La Crescenta, said he operates a wholesome, family-oriented shop at 200 E. 
Broadway and refuses to carry any X-rated magazines or videos. 
</P>
<P>
His shelves include a Tom Corbett Space Cadet lunch box from the 1950s and a 
1953 Van Nuys High School yearbook with photos of Robert Redford, Natalie Wood 
and Don Drysdale as students. 
</P>
<P>
The German-born store owner said he became a naturalized American during the 
Bicentennial celebration in 1976 and has strived to be a good citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a conservative law and order guy," he said. But in the wake 
of his recent legal problems, Jaworsky said, "It's like we walked into the 
Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
To Glendale police, the case against the shop owner is clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
In a police report, Glendale burglary investigator Steve Carey said he launched 
an undercover "sting" last March after an unnamed informant told his partner 
that Jaworsky was purchasing stolen Nintendo games. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Pete Michael said Glendale police have no set policy regarding when 
undercover ruses are used to crack a stolen goods case. But he said it is a 
popular investigative tool. 
</P>
<P>
"A sting operation gets you results right now," he said. "It's immediate, and 
you get definite results one way or another, showing the allegations are true 
or false. 
</P>
<P>
Carey said he entered the store several times wearing a suit and tie, 
displaying a Sears name badge and representing himself to Jaworsky as a store 
employee. Carey said he returned April 5 wearing a concealed microphone and 
talked to Jaworsky about getting video games illicitly from his workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo also hand-wrote a list of Nintendo products for me, showing titles he was 
looking for," Carey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said Sears security personnel loaned him three video games, with a 
combined retail value of $144.97. He said Jaworsky paid $50 for the games, 
which were still in shrink-wrapping and bore Sears price tags. 
</P>
<P>
Jaworsky was arrested April 26 after Carey returned and sold him four 
additional video games valued at $188.90 for $35, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The store owner says he believed the Sears employee was legitimately reselling 
slightly damaged goods. Jaworsky said he can be heard on one of the police 
tapes saying he wanted nothing to do with stolen merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview Tuesday, Carey said, "It is our contention that he 
knowingly received merchandise that he believed was stolen. I feel that actions 
speak louder than words." 
</P>
<P>
Mike T. Shannon, a Pasadena attorney who represents Jaworsky, said the store 
owner was not charged with receiving stolen property because the video games 
were not stolen but borrowed from Sears. The charge of attempting to receive 
stolen property requires a jury to find that Jaworsky believed Carey obtained 
the games illegally, Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you listen to the tapes, it's really ambiguous as to whether he told Mr. 
Jaworsky the games were stolen," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Independent of the criminal probe, Glendale police recommended that the city 
not renew Jaworsky's second-hand sales permit. Carey said the administrative 
decision, made Aug. 28 by the city staff, was based on the police department's 
belief that the business is not being operated in a legitimate manner. 
</P>
<P>
City Attorney Scott H. Howard said a second-hand permit is required at any 
store that sells used merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Jaworsky claims he cannot keep Collectors Camelot open without the permit. "It 
really blunts the whole purpose of this business, which is nostalgia and 
collectibles," he said. "I'd have to carry strictly new stuff. It would alter 
the character of the business, and the cost would be prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 3, Jaworsky filed an appeal, asking the City Council to overturn the 
permit denial. At Tuesday's meeting council members were to decide whether to 
schedule a hearing on Jaworsky's request or deny the appeal without a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager David Ramsay told council members they could also wait until 
Jaworsky's criminal trial is concluded, "at which time you'll have more 
information on which to base your decision." 
</P>
<P>
The council followed that suggestion and postponed the matter until Oct. 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bolstered by the success of recent fund-raisers, AIDS Project Los Angeles has 
announced it plans to expand its client services and give money to several 
smaller community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $570,000 brought in by the group's fund-raisers, $345,000 has been 
earmarked for hiring eight more employees for such tasks as managing cases, 
providing legal assistance and staffing Our House, the organization's 
residential facility. 
</P>
<P>
Also, grants ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 are to be given to nine local 
groups that provide education, counseling and other services to various 
segments of the gay population, people suffering from AIDS and those with the 
AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS Project Los Angeles, founded eight years ago and headquartered in 
Hollywood, provides services for about 70% of those in Los Angeles County 
diagnosed as having AIDS.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: TOO MUCH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By any account, it was much too much. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen days of art, dance, music and story from around the world. Simply the 
names in print made a kind of poetry that could expand one's cultural 
viewpoint: Woomera Mornington, Conjunto Jarocho Papaloapan, Zenshuji Zendeko, 
Na Pua Me Kealoha and Kulintang. 
</P>
<P>
They played gamelans, zithers, bamboo flutes, harps and virtuoso gongs. They 
did the dances of Australian aborigines and played tunes of ancient China and 
modern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, I am sorry to say, my lasting impression of the Los Angeles 
Festival is a feeling of guilt for not having suspended all other duties in 
life during those three weeks to rush back and forth across the city catching 
every one of those distant folk strains. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by news reports of poor attendance, the festival must have been as 
ill-timed for most of the city's fast-paced, overcommitted, worn-out working 
people as it was for me. 
</P>
<P>
My own participation in the festival turned out to be extremely parochial, but 
nonetheless rewarding. I decided to look in on some northeast Los Angeles 
artists, hoping to learn of the folk strains of home. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came from the Arroyo Arts Collective, an organization promoting the 
idea that the northeast communities have an inherent attraction to artists. To 
illustrate the point, which has raised some skepticism, the Collective arranged 
a self-guided tour of the homes and studios of 29 artists. 
</P>
<P>
I made it only to three, hardly a comprehensive survey, but still an 
afternoon's work. 
</P>
<P>
First was Susan Moss, a graduate of Otis, who has filled her large, skylighted 
York Boulevard studio -- once probably an auto repair shop -- with large, 
brightly abstract canvases. 
</P>
<P>
With promotional skills to match her artistic talent, Moss outlined the 
prestigious shows her paintings have been in and the prices they command, going 
well into four figures. She talked expectantly of moving up to Malibu someday. 
</P>
<P>
Not far up the street, a more truly indigenous artist named Gene Armstrong has 
filled a cottage near Avenue 56 with the images that keep her well. There's a 
voyeur's satisfaction in the intimate scenes she has caught in public -- two 
girls showering at the beach, an old woman sitting in a chair in a moving van, 
a woman leaning on her escort at an art gallery. Armstrong's naive style makes 
a quick psychological connection. 
</P>
<P>
She said she taught 17 years in an elementary school before going crazy -- 
literally. Not long after leaving the hospital, she did a portrait of her 
husband as van Gogh's peasant in a straw hat. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so much fun doing that that pretty soon I started painting in the 
evenings while I was watching TV," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In six months she had a show in Pasadena. This summer, she had four shows. 
She's even sold a few paintings. She needs the money, because her teacher's 
retirement fund is running dry. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has begun to study drawing, though it's not her natural form of 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's much more to painting than just drawing," she said. "I think 
it comes from inside first." 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of drawings were on display in Jesus Perez's comfortable stucco on 
Shasta Circle near Glendale. Since sketching a perfectly literal Humphrey 
Bogart in the mid-1950s, when he was a teen-ager living in Atwater, Perez has 
turned his fertile mind on everything the world put before him. In a matter of 
days, he'll sketch a hundred pages of human eyes, forks and spoons, electrical 
parts, disembodied thoughts, old people in hospital beds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more interested in painting what I experience and feel than what it looks 
like," Perez said. If the viewer doesn't get it right away, he's happy to give 
clues. 
</P>
<P>
A huge oil montage of dark and tumultuous images that hung in his living room 
came, he said, from his grandmother's recollections as a Revolucionaria in 
Pancho Villa's army. She would grab the tail of his grandfather's horse to get 
through patches of mud. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd see the horse's butt and the big sombrero, and she was so proud of him. 
She said, 'As long as I could hold onto that, I knew everything would be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
Through most of his life, Perez supported his family on the salary of a 
commercial graphic designer. At last, he feels ready to forsake a job for the 
life of a professional fine artist. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has created tens of thousands of images, Perez had never shown before 
Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once, a gallery suggested he try to project a consistent style. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't comply, since each painting derived its style from its subject. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for his coming out, Perez is answering the challenge by painting one 
subject in dozens of styles. 
</P>
<P>
He focused on the waitress, whose work struck him as the vestige of nurturing 
in public life. 
</P>
<P>
He's completed about 30 waitresses. Some are nude, some are in armor, some in 
the robes of gods. But each is handing out a plate and has three on the other 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know art, but I know an artist when I see one. Highland Park has at 
least a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps next year the L.A. Festival will be held on a weekday with a citywide 
holiday declared so that everyone will have a chance to spend a day inside an 
artist's life.

4 ARRESTED IN BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Hollywood sheriff's deputies have made four arrests and are seeking other 
suspects in connection with 11 burglaries that have taken place since May at 
antique, jewelry and secondhand stores in and near West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Maynard Davis said detectives from the West Hollywood sheriff's station 
have recovered two small truckloads of stolen merchandise, including 90 
antiques pieces, paintings and other collectibles and an assortment of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the burglaries, Davis said, have been committed at night when the shops 
were closed. In most cases, he said, the burglars smashed the front windows of 
the stores, grabbed loot that was readily at hand and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested and charged with the burglaries are John D. Garrett, 28, and Edward K. 
Douglas, 25, of West Hollywood. Glenn J. Spurbeck, 28, of West Hollywood, 
Terence L. Kienzle, 43, who gave no permanent address, were also arrested and 
charged with receiving stolen property. Deputies are seeking three additional 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The four arrests were made after deputies received a tip from a witness who 
said he saw Garrett smash the window of a store and steal several items inside, 
Davis said. Garrett and the others were traced to an apartment on North Fairfax 
Avenue, which deputies described as a "crash pad for street people." 
</P>
<P>
The recovered merchandise has been put on display at the sheriff's station. 
Merchants who have been burglarized and would like to view the recovered goods 
may contact Detective Arthur Lucas at the West Hollywood sheriff's station at 
(213) 855-8850.

</P>
<P>
The work is expected to be finished by the summer of 1992, he said. It marks 
the first major face lift of facilities at the popular Malibu beach in 45 
years. County officials said the beach attracted more than a million people a 
month during June, July and August.

ACTIVIST TEACHER DEVELOPS PLAN TO CONSERVE ENERGY, WATER AT SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: LARRY BRIM WORKED WITH THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER 
TO DEVELOP A HANDBOOK THAT INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS CAN USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1960s, Larry Brim was inspired by news stories about a mysterious 
environmental activist in northern Illinois who for years dumped dead fish in 
the offices of industries that polluted the Fox River. 
</P>
<P>
Brim, a science teacher at Irving Junior High in Atwater Village, still holds 
the activist, who was never identified, in high regard. And while his methods 
may not be as radical, Brim has designed a curriculum for Los Angeles schools 
that he hopes is just as successful in sparking passion about conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Through a privately funded fellowship, Brim worked this summer with the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power to develop a handbook for schools on 
saving water and energy. 
</P>
<P>
The book offers 11 lessons on conservation that teachers can use in their 
science and math courses, and tells how instructors can request speakers and 
plan field trips to enhance the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
It also encourages art and writing contests and student assemblies, plays and 
debates about conservation. And its main feature, according to Brim, is a 
series of checklists that students can use to audit water and energy use at 
their schools. 
</P>
<P>
If administrators cooperate, students can learn to read meters, test school 
pipes and sinks for leaks, survey campus landscaping and design programs for 
recycling -- all in an effort to make schools more efficient and 
energy-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is for schools to save water and energy. A lot of times schools are 
saving, but up to now there hasn't been a systematic way" to conserve, Brim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brim, 44, spent more than six weeks at the DWP's Hope Street headquarters, 
learning about low-energy lighting, meter reading and low-flow shower heads, 
and teaching utility officials how water conservation can best be taught to 
students and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of 35 fellows of the Industry Initiatives for Science and Math 
Education, which places teachers in businesses or industries as interns who 
then implement what they learned in their classrooms. The program is funded by 
the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a group that recruits private sector 
funds for public education projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a crisis mode and the fourth year of a drought," Walter Zeisl, 
supervisor of educational services for the DWP, said of the fellowship program. 
"This is a year that we've got to have a special emphasis on conservation, 
especially in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
Developing multidisciplinary courses is nothing new to Brim, a science teacher 
with a master's degree in history and a passion for philosophy. After serving 
as a Peace Corps volunteer in Liberia in the late 1960s, he returned to the 
West African country in 1976 as a science curriculum specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, Brim won a small grant to develop a course that uses art to 
teach the history of science. Today, another grant is helping Brim create a 
lesson that will blend philosophy, ecology and science. In that course, 
students will study the trials of Socrates, Galileo and John Scopes, and will 
write and produce a scenario in which earth is put on trial for committing 
"crimes," such as earthquakes, against man. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in the big questions, such as, 'What is man's role in nature?' 
" Brim said. "But it's a real challenge to interest students in those. What you 
can interest them in is things that affect them immediately and directly. If 
they learn to read meters at school, they can read them at home, and perhaps 
save their families some money." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP will distribute in October several copies of the handbook to all public 
and private schools in Los Angeles, and Brim said he already has scheduled 
student field trips to DWP facilities and begun incorporating ecology lessons 
into his science curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
But getting teachers and administrators interested in the handbook may be 
another challenge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The book suggests that a staff member be appointed at each school to oversee 
the use of an energy conservation curriculum. But Brim acknowledged that most 
teachers may not have time to assume that role or develop special classroom 
projects on conservation. 
</P>
<P>
So he is counting on financial incentives, among other things, to spark 
interest. The Los Angeles Unified School District's own Energy Incentive 
Program gives money to schools that reduce their water, gas and electricity use 
by at least 10%. And the DWP will provide water bottles and decal stickers to 
public and private schools that use Brim's handbook. 
</P>
<P>
"This can be helpful to save the environment," Brim said. "My feeling is that 
we can do something, and this is one small step."

FALL ENROLLMENT SLIGHTLY BELOW PREDICTED LEVEL; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE: DISTRICT SCHOOLS HAVE 25,343 STUDENTS INSTEAD OF 25,539. MORE ARE 
EXPECTED TO ARRIVE.

The Glendale Unified School District's fall enrollment of 25,343 is slightly 
lower than district projections, but more students are expected to arrive 
throughout the school year, officials reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators had predicted that enrollment would increase from about 24,100 
students last year to 25,539. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, after one week of school, there were 13,441 students at 19 
elementary schools, 5,346 at four junior high schools and 6,214 at three high 
schools and one continuation school. An additional 342 students were enrolled 
in special-education classes. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were presented to the Board of Education on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder today to be right on because we continue to get people moving into 
the community all year long," said Vic Pallos, a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Even though more than 210 students are being bused this year from crowded 
schools to less crowded ones, enrollments at the crowded schools were lower 
than expected. Six of the most crowded schools are scheduled to go year-round 
in 1991 because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least 50 seventh-graders are being transported from Toll Junior 
High School to Rosemont Junior High School because of crowding, Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
One area in which officials had under-projected new enrollment was at the 
district's Welcome Center, which serves students who speak little or no 
English. As of Monday, 1,100 students had come to the center during the summer, 
400 more than had been anticipated.

SUPERVISORS OK BAN ON BILLBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-month campaign by a La Crescenta man and his supporters to halt 
construction of large billboards in their semi-rural community has ended in 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last week unanimously created the 
largest billboard exclusion zone in the county in La Crescenta and Montrose, 
permanently prohibiting construction of new outdoor advertising signs along 
Foothill and Ocean View boulevards and Montrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
There are nine large signs along a 1.3-mile stretch of Foothill Boulevard, said 
Dave Cowardin, county staff planner. Those signs will remain but cannot be 
replaced or moved. All billboards in the isolated, unincorporated island of 
county territory will eventually be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard issue was the first taken up by the Crescenta Valley Town 
Council, formed in March, 1989, in a grass-roots effort by residents to gain a 
greater say over their community of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Beavers won his first bid for office campaigning against 
billboards, which he said constitute a visual blight. Beavers this week called 
the victory "absolutely fantastic for the people." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will work next to beautify Foothill Boulevard, the community's main 
commercial strip.

FIREHOUSE SOLD FOR $502,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Corona del Mar man bid $502,000 last week to buy the 66-year-old Fire Station 
56 in Silver Lake from the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy King, who owns a recording studio near the vacated station at 2838 Rowena 
Ave., said he plans to add to the building and use it for office space. 
</P>
<P>
In an auction last Friday at City Hall, King outlasted two other bidders who 
pushed the price well above the required minimum of $274,500. 
</P>
<P>
Before he can move in, King will be required to make the 1924 structure satisfy 
earthquake safety standards, and may have to remove asbestos and a 1,000-gallon 
underground gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
Any substantial changes in the appearance of the bungalow-style fire station 
would have to be approved by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission, which 
declared it a historic landmark in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The station was abandoned in February, 1989, when the Fire Department opened 
its new Station 56 a few blocks away -- at Rowena Avenue and Glendale 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate division of the city's Bureau of Engineering put the station up 
for sale after determining that no other city department wanted the property. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sale will be added to a fund that is to pay for the 
replacement of 16 fire stations deemed to be seismically unsafe.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUNK DRIVER GETS $1,500 FINE, PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale woman convicted of driving with a blood-alcohol level more than five 
times the legal definition of drunk was put on probation last week and fined 
about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Municipal Judge Barbara Lee Burke on Friday ordered Cathylynne Johnson 
to serve three years probation, pay fines and restitution and attend an 
Alcoholics Anonymous program. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 28, pleaded no contest last Wednesday to two misdemeanor charges of 
driving with a blood-alcohol level higher than 0.08% -- the state's legal 
definition of drunk -- and fleeing the scene of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested March 27 after she ran into another car on Verdugo Road near 
Towne Avenue and then left the scene.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY REJECTS STUDENTS' PLEA FOR PARKING HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Community College student leaders appealed to the City Council on 
Tuesday to remove parking restrictions on residential streets near the campus, 
but were told the city is not responsible for providing school parking. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Delaney, student body president, told council members that the city's 
decision in August to post two-hour parking signs on Sweetbriar and Swarthmore 
drives would worsen an already severe parking crisis at the college. 
</P>
<P>
The city restricted parking on the two streets, west of the Glendale Freeway 
and just south of the campus, after residents complained about students parking 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We were unaware that this was going to be in effect," said Delaney, who 
presented council members with a petition signed Tuesday by 220 students. 
"Although this may seem to be a solution for the residents of Swarthmore and 
Sweetbriar, it is merely putting a Band-Aid on an infected wound." 
</P>
<P>
But council members told Delaney and other students that the college should 
seek alternatives, such as car pools, before asking the city for help. 
</P>
<P>
The college, with enrollment expected to reach 14,000 by the end of this week, 
has up to 8,000 students on campus at any one time, said Michael Southerland, 
director of campus safety and security. The campus has only one parking lot for 
students, with 161 day and 260 evening parking spaces for students with 
permits. About five city-owned lots near the college provide nearly 1,000 
spaces, Southerland said.

A VIEW OF L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
ART: L.A. CITY PLANNER TURNS FROM ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS TO 
PHOTOGRAPHY THAT CAPTURES THE URBAN SCENE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gurdon Miller pulled out the large black-and-white photos that sometimes keep 
him up until 3 in the morning -- images of barren downtown streets, 
graffiti-loaded warehouses, telephone poles and parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's beautiful," he said of one image of an abandoned laundry 
building. His words poured out anxiously, rapidly: "I'm not kidding. I really 
think it's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
For Miller, 45, a Los Angeles city planner and Sierra Madre resident, the 
photos are the culmination of more than 25 years of exploring what he calls the 
"built environment," or the Earth as modified by human action. 
</P>
<P>
The photos also represent his entry into the world of art photography. In 
April, Miller was one of three photographers selected to display their work at 
the Los Angeles Arts Council's "Catch a Rising Artist" art auction at the Bel 
Age Hotel in West Hollywood. He hopes to parlay that exposure into 
representation at a gallery and recognition of the uniqueness of his vision and 
product. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm doing with a picture is sort of analogous to atonal structures (in 
music), in the sense that the structure is important and the composition is 
important," Miller said. "There aren't 10 photographers in Los Angeles who are 
taking better (pictures) than this in terms of the camera, film, development 
and knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
The urban emphasis of his photos seems paradoxical for Miller, with his hiker's 
attire of faded work shirts and khaki pants, his tree house-like home in Sierra 
Madre Canyon, his work on Sierra Madre's hillside development ordinance, and 
his memberships in the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is a natural outgrowth of artistic pursuits that began in his youth in 
the San Gabriel Valley. Miller grew up in El Monte and painted practically 
nonstop from childhood. So engrossed was he in painting, he said, that after 
his family had gone to bed at night, he would snap on his bedroom closet light 
and surreptitiously paint all night inside the closet. 
</P>
<P>
During his high school years, his realistic landscapes and watercolored 
pen-and-ink sketches sold easily "because they were pretty and people liked 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he saw the huge, Abstract Expressionist canvases of American artist 
Clyfford Still, he was overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the beginning of changing the way I see things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller studied Abstract Expressionism while obtaining an art degree at UC 
Berkeley and continued to paint abstract canvases while working as a city 
planner. But as he took photos for his planning jobs, he realized that he could 
create with photography the shapes he was abstracting from landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Why bother (with painting), when you can go straight to the source?" Miller 
said. "As a painter I was always trying to explain to people why I had no 
content or why the content was so rarefied." 
</P>
<P>
Largely self-taught as a photographer, Miller uses the zone system pioneered by 
Ansel Adams, in which different objects to be photographed are measured by a 
light meter to arrive at an exposure that will deliver the broadest range of 
lights and darks. But where Adams used the techniques to produce stunningly 
beautiful landscapes, Miller employs them to catch the sometimes ungainly 
shapes of the urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
A photo like "Friendship Store," taken in Little Tokyo, may seem to be a random 
shot of an empty street. But Miller explained that it is dense with 
compositional elements, such as the contrast of a white, square sign against 
the dark, recessed squares of the building's windows; the parallel shapes of 
windowpanes and glass brick, and the satisfyingly rough texture of brick. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as with an Abstract Expressionist painting, your eye dances around," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is equally passionate about the techniques he employs to produce his 
photos. For years, he used a 35-millimeter camera and took thousands of slides 
of buildings and city streets, incorporating some of them into slide shows that 
he occasionally presents to other city planners. 
</P>
<P>
But only rarely did he produce a photo that he considered aesthetically 
pleasing. So, he switched to the bulky view camera he now uses to obtain 
sharper images and produce large pictures, measuring up to 16 by 20 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Taking such photos is a painstaking process, Miller said. He will spend an hour 
setting up his camera on the tripod, finding the view he wants, metering the 
shot and, finally, waiting for the wind to stop blowing and the street to clear 
of people and cars so that he can snap the 15-second exposure. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of such activity, he will have about six photos, perhaps one of 
which he will find satisfactory. Next comes another six hours of developing his 
images in his bathroom/darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a compulsion," Miller admitted, adding that he couldn't continue without 
the emotional support of his wife and the income from his job as a planner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing it because finally, at the age of 45, I have sufficient belief in 
the worthiness of the work and the strength of character to pull it off," he 
said. "I don't have to make any compromises."

CHALK IT UP TO ARTISTIC FREEDOM; 
</P>
<P>
ART: SIDEWALK DRAWINGS DON'T LAST. THEY DON'T PAY. BUT THEY ALLOW THE CREATORS 
TO DO AS THEY PLEASE. 
</P>

<P>
The day after artists David Medore and Kenneth Gatewood spent six hours 
chalking James Dean onto Sunset Boulevard earlier this month, only a couple of 
smudges remained. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. For the two sidewalk artists, whose efforts are usually exhibited on 
the Venice boardwalk, the important thing is not how long their works last. Nor 
is money a factor -- at best, they are reimbursed for their expenses. Rather, 
what counts for the pair is the freedom of expression that their monthly 
collaborations provide, even though they literally fade from view within 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Said Medore: "Doing this is who I am." 
</P>
<P>
It has been two years since Medore, 26, started creating oversized -- albeit 
ephemeral -- sidewalk portraits of famous people after realizing that his 
commercial art career was paying his bills but not satisfying his soul. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Medore's commercial work had not been widely seen. He spent five 
years painting some of the city's largest billboards, including one 12 stories 
high in Hollywood that featured Rick Dees. A year ago, Medore moved on to 
pictorial art at Disneyland, touching up the cartoons that provide the 
backgrounds for amusement rides and doing backdrops for display windows. 
</P>
<P>
All of this work, however, was outlined in advance by someone else; none of it 
really felt like his own. 
</P>
<P>
And so, following the example of other artists he had seen intermittently in 
Venice, Medore began chalking his portraits on the Venice boardwalk. After two 
other partners decided that the resultant self-expression was not worth the 
monthly hassle, he hooked up with Gatewood. 
</P>
<P>
For Medore, the artistic "buzz" starts two weeks ahead of each project. He 
plans what to draw, goes through newspapers and magazines to get the best 
available photos of his subject and buys the proper colored chalks. His costs 
can reach as high as $50. 
</P>
<P>
Medore prefers chalk because that medium allows for splashier, more vivid 
colors. And, he said: "There's nothing to dry. Unlike with paint, you don't 
need all those other supplies like brushes, turpentine and thinner." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk is also strictly legal, earning only encouraging comments and nods of 
appreciation from pedestrians and passing police officers. Paint, he said, 
might bring him harsher attention. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk's relative simplicity, however, does not spare Medore the aching knees or 
a sore back that result from crouching over his work, nor does it prevent an 
occasional fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Medore remembers in particular his portrait last year of Peg Bundy, the 
money-hungry mother in the Fox television series, "Married With Children." 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't planned it out right; it was too complicated. We were trying to get 
her face and hair and her hands around the money; we were going for too much 
detail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than the usual six hours, Medore and former partner Mike Ashmore spent a 
full eight on Bundy. Not only did Bundy take the most effort and receive the 
fewest comments of any of the portraits -- Batman's "Joker" was his most 
popular effort, based on pedestrian comments -- it also prompted Ashmore to 
abandon sidewalk artistry for the relatively simple life of oil and canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Medore then teamed up with the 30-year-old Gatewood, whom he knew through art 
classes at Los Angeles Trade Technical College. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Medore's upper-middle-class background, Gatewood grew up in 
South-Central Los Angeles, where an appreciation for colors was necessary for 
survival among rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Gatewood's color consciousness, however, extended beyond that needed to avoid 
gangs. At 9, he received his first commission: painting a Christmas scene for a 
local podiatrist's office window. He promptly invested his $45 fee into more 
art supplies and has pursued an art career ever since. His works have been 
displayed in Las Vegas and San Diego galleries, where they sell for up to 
$6,500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Part of his motivation in drawing the sidewalk portraits is simple showmanship 
-- getting away from the solitary studio and socializing. 
</P>
<P>
But with several of his boyhood friends dead from violence or drug abuse, and 
three of his six brothers and sisters hooked on drugs, Gatewood said he has 
another reason for joining Medore. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between those who do and those who don't make it out (of his 
old neighborhood) is will and persistence. A lot of kids have the raw talent; 
all they need to do is to develop it. I wanted to show, as publicly as I can, 
that that's possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Medore-Gatewood work on Sunset near Highland Avenue came about after 
Venice resident Miriam More noticed their boardwalk portrait of Jim Henson. 
More, organizer of the annual Hollywood Art Affair, commissioned them to draw 
James Dean as part of the art show, reimbursing them for the price of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting the job, Medore and Gatewood discovered that Hollywood's attractions 
did not include the string bikinis and ocean breezes they had grown used to on 
the boardwalk. Regardless, the public response -- including phone numbers they 
collect from women who see Michelangelos in the making -- was worth the effort, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm never going to make money from this," Medore said. "But this is my own 
art, my thing." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I've gotten hooked on it."

6 GO ON TRIAL IN RECORD DRUG BUST IN SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A federal prosecutor disclosed Wednesday that a Sylmar warehouse which was the 
site a year ago of the country's biggest drug bust -- 21.4 tons of cocaine -- 
was a conduit for 77 tons of cocaine in a three-month period before the 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. James P. Walsh Jr., in opening remarks at the federal 
court trial of six alleged drug smugglers, called the seizure an "epic case" of 
law enforcement cracking a drug distribution ring of mammoth proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"These six men . . . were operating a business distributing (multi) 
ton-quantity amounts of cocaine," Walsh told jurors in what is expected to be a 
monthlong trial before U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
All of the defendants, four of whom are related, have pleaded not guilty. Their 
lawyers contended Wednesday that they had nothing to do with the drug seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney David Z. Chesnoff of Las Vegas, taking note of the notoriety 
of the case, said the jury should not be impressed by "the weight of the 
cocaine, but the weight of the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The raid on the 3,500-square-foot warehouse on Bradley Avenue in the San 
Fernando Valley community of Sylmar last Sept. 28 and 29 shocked even some 
veteran law enforcement officials and focused attention on the various routes 
Colombian drug lords were using to smuggle cocaine into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A citizen's tip to law enforcement exposed the Sylmar operation, where an 
import business operated as a front. In addition to thousands of one-kilo 
packages of cocaine stored in boxes found amid pinatas and velvet canvas 
paintings, police seized about $12 million in cash, mostly in $20 and $100 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
The wholesale value of the haul was estimated at about $6 billion and the U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration estimated that the seizure represented about 5% 
of the world's annual production of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The raid by DEA agents and local police underscored that Southern California 
had become the major narcotics distribution point for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Walsh said that ledgers confiscated at the warehouse, two of which 
he described as the "green book" and the "blue book," documented a cocaine 
operation of huge proportions. 
</P>
<P>
In a period of accelerated shipments during 89 days preceding the raid, 
approximately 154,000 pounds of cocaine -- or 77 tons -- passed through the 
warehouse, according to Walsh, chief of the U.S. attorney's major narcotics 
section in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he would present "a very straightforward case" of a sophisticated 
drug organization that utilized walkie-talkies, telephone beepers and driving 
techniques to avoid law enforcement detection. 
</P>
<P>
Code names were used for different brands of cocaine, such as "Coca-Cola" or 
"Bush," a reference to President Bush. Customers also had code names. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents said the cocaine seized in Sylmar had traveled about 3,500 miles 
between Colombia and Los Angeles along a route authorities call "the 
Trampoline," so named because the cocaine is "bounced" up into this country 
from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The case, Walsh said, represented "a tale of two cities" -- Los Angeles and El 
Paso, Tex. -- in that the huge amounts of cocaine were hauled from the Texas 
border city to Southern California in big-rig trucks with secret compartments. 
</P>
<P>
According to ledgers and documents seized in the Sylmar raid, the smuggling 
operation began in December, 1987. Records showed that from Mexico, the cocaine 
was shipped through El Paso on Interstate 25 to Albuquerque and then along 
Interstate 40 to California, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Over this "ribbon of concrete and asphalt," Walsh said, "traveled unimaginable 
amounts of cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said the mastermind of the operation was Rafael Munoz 
Talavera, 38, described as "a premier godfather" who has been responsible for 
the importation of multi-ton quantities of Colombian cocaine into the United 
States. He was captured by Mexican police last November and has been held in 
the Juarez area pending his trial, law enforcement sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of the six defendants is Carlos Tapia-Ponce, 69, of Chihuahua, 
Mexico, who is in ill health and whom Judge Hatter ordered checked today at a 
local hospital to see if he can stand the stress of the trial. According to 
court documents, Tapia-Ponce, along with his son, Hector Tapia-Anchondo, 39, 
who is also a defendant, were key lieutenants in the operation. The father 
rented the Sylmar warehouse, paying $1,700 a month in $20 bills. 
</P>
<P>
According to Walsh and his co-prosecutor, Special Asst. U.S. Atty. Susan 
Bryant-Deason, documents seized in Tapia-Anchondo's El Paso home contain data 
directly linking him to the Sylmar operation. 
</P>
<P>
A third defendant is James Romero McTague, 42, one of Tapia-Ponce's sons-in-law 
who is an El Paso resident and the only American-born defendant. McTague was 
described by Walsh as the warehouse manager. 
</P>
<P>
According to an October, 1989, affidavit filed in El Paso by a DEA agent in 
support of a search warrant, McTague had been "arranging the transportation of 
million-dollar cocaine shipments" between El Paso and Los Angeles 
"approximately three times per week." 
</P>
<P>
The three other defendants are Jose Ignacio Monroy, 37, another son-in-law of 
Tapia-Ponce; Hugo Castillon-Alvarez, 33, and Miguel Chavez, 34. 
</P>
<P>
All of the defendants except Chavez are charged with conspiracy and intent to 
distribute cocaine. Chavez is charged with possessing and intending to sell 
cocaine. They face sentences of up to life in prison, if convicted.

KATZ SAYS PACT IS NEAR ON DUMP EMISSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE 
CITY, NEIGHBORS AND AIR-QUALITY OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement has been worked out aimed at satisfying all three sides in the 
contentious Lopez Canyon Landfill dispute -- Los Angeles city administrators, 
state air-quality officials and dump neighbors sickened by methane gas 
emissions -- Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said that a daylong meeting he called behind closed doors Wednesday 
produced the framework of an agreement under which the city will bring the dump 
into compliance with state air-pollution laws by Dec. 15 and pay a $5,000 fine 
each time air-quality officials cite it for gas leakage violations after that 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The money would go into a fund to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods, said 
Katz, whose district includes the dump area. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty extraordinary in that I think we broke a stalemate" between city 
and regional air-quality officials and the dump's neighbors, Katz said. "This 
is an incredible breakthrough in its benefits to the neighborhood," because it 
"ensures the neighborhood can hold the city accountable," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hastily called meeting was attended by city Bureau of Sanitation 
officials, representatives of the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
enforcement staff and City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's office, as well as Rob 
Zapple -- a neighborhood leader in the fight against methane gas emissions, and 
Michael Magnuson, an attorney who represents a group of residents who live near 
the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said a meeting will be held Monday night, at a location to be determined, 
to inform the public of details of the agreement, which also must be approved 
by the City Council and an AQMD hearing board. The board has been holding 
hearings into noxious gas emissions from the landfill. Katz said more public 
comments will be taken at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said other highlights of the proposed agreement include: 
</P>
<P>
* A phased closure of the portion of the landfill that faces Kagel Canyon 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased monitoring of air by AQMD inspectors and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
* Public access to any city and state documents having to do with the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
* Formation of a task force of community members to advise the city and AQMD on 
landfill problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Appointment of a community member to a group of city and state officials that 
will meet once a month to discuss landfill problems. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the dump have complained for years of smelly and dangerous methane 
and other gases leaking from garbage decomposing underground. The AQMD last 
week cited the city for 28 violations of air-pollution laws for gas leaks, 
exposing the city to up to $700,000 in fines. The amount of the fine is being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday the City Council -- carrying out an agreement reached earlier with the 
AQMD -- approved spending $3.25 million to improve the dump's gas-collection 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The secrecy surrounding the meeting miffed some dump opponents and members of 
the South Coast Air Quality Management hearing board, which had to cancel its 
own scheduled hearing on the matter because its staff members were attending 
Katz's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to me that the district has been playing games with us," said board 
member Mark Abramowitz, when informed by an AQMD attorney that the staff was 
meeting with the public. 
</P>
<P>
Dump opponents Anson Burlingame of Shadow Hills and Phyllis Hines of the Lake 
View Terrace Improvement Assn. said they knew nothing of Katz's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Burlingame called the meeting "a real slap in the face. The thing that makes me 
angry is that Katz has been upset about back room agreements and then he sets 
this one up. I don't think this should have been a back room deal." 
</P>
<P>
Hines said she went to Katz's office after she learned of the meeting, was not 
invited to participate and left. However, she said, the proposal "sounds like 
it has some good points." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said participants were meant to be a "working group" to find solutions to 
the landfill problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no deals cut in this thing," Zapple said. "There were no solid 
agreements. There will be more public input." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the concepts in the agreement are "very good and very 
positive for the community. We're the ones who are suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Zapple said participants in the meeting were frustrated with the length of the 
board's hearings, which started in April. Nevertheless, he urged that the 
hearings continue.

$16 DEPARTURE TAX ADDS JOLT FOR VISITORS ON TIGHT BUDGET 
</P>

<P>
After a summer of sightseeing, visitor Erich Moritz had a few final words for 
Los Angeles: "Lemme outta here!" 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old German tourist had spent his vacation traveling by bicycle from 
Alaska to Acapulco. He had swatted mosquitoes in Canada, sweated in Mexico and 
slept next to roadsides on all but two nights during his three-month odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
His camera had been swiped in Anchorage on the first day of his trip. His tent 
had been stolen in San Francisco, halfway through the trek. Now he was 
wondering whether his pocket was about to be picked on his last day in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Moritz had the departure tax on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The tax is a $16 fee that is collected from Los Angeles International Airport 
passengers headed abroad. Six dollars goes to the federal Department of 
Transportation; the rest is split by the federal Customs and Immigration and 
Naturalization services -- although all three agencies waive the fee to 
passengers flying to areas of Mexico, Canada and some Caribbean islands. 
</P>
<P>
Most travelers pay the tax without knowing it after it is automatically added 
to the price of their airline ticket at the time of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of others are jolted each day to discover that their travel agent 
failed to include the tax in the air fare and they must fork over $16 before 
they can board their plane for home. 
</P>
<P>
That spells trouble for tourists who have spent their last $30 on a taxi ride 
to LAX or used up the last of their American currency at an airport souvenir 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Youthful visitors traveling on a shoestring -- those who have sought out 
cut-rate air fares to begin with and carefully budgeted their trips -- are the 
most common victims. People like Erich Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen dollars is a lot," said the student from Munich as he waited in the 
Alitalia Airlines check-in line. He was eager to claim a window seat and learn 
whether his $500 round-trip ticket included the tax. "I have just a few dollars 
left. They should warn people about this." 
</P>
<P>
Across LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal, visitors Linda Hollis, 21, and 
Mark Smith, 22, of Liverpool, England, mulled over the tax in front of the 
American Trans Air charter flight check-in counter. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent all we had on day trips and so forth," Hollis said. Added Smith: "I 
don't have a cent left." 
</P>
<P>
At the British Airways counter, Sven Schelo, 21, and Annemarie Vogelbusch, 20, 
of Dusseldorf, Germany, asked an airline agent whether their tickets included 
the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got $5.15 left. We spent the last of our money to fill the rental car up 
with gasoline," Schelo said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport ticket agents cringe when they have to collect the departure fee. 
Although the Customs and Immigration portions have been assessed for about the 
past two years, the $6 portion has only been collected since January. It 
replaced a $3 fee that was established in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a government tax. The government should collect it, not us," said the 
British Airways agent who examined Schelo's tickets and determined that the fee 
had indeed been prepaid. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens every flight," shrugged Khaleel Siddiqui, a ticket agent for KLM 
Royal Dutch Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Most carriers pay the tax for passengers who do not have the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Matz, an agent for Air New Zealand, said he collects the tax from reluctant 
travelers "all the time . . . every day." Some passengers claim they don't have 
the money, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually scare them. We take a picture of the passport and have them sign it 
and tell them the government is going to come after them. They'll say, 'The 
travel agent didn't tell me,' or 'I spent my last money on the cab.' But we 
usually collect it -- they have credit cards, and that's what we grab." 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines send passengers without cash to the Travelers Aid Society, which 
donates the $16 if an investigation verifies that the passengers have no money. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, it's a young person who's backpacking it and is down to his last 
dollar," said Susan Edelstein, who heads the LAX Travelers Aid office. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their return ticket. They know they're going to be fed on the plane 
and that someone is going to pick them up at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Back at the Alitalia counter, Moritz had four one-dollar bills left in the 
nylon money belt beneath his T-shirt after learning at the last minute that he 
was required to purchase a $16 shipping box for his bicycle. Happily, the 
coding on his ticket showed that he had prepaid the departure tax. 
</P>
<P>
With minutes to spare, Moritz boxed his bike and ran for his plane. "The window 
seats are taken. I've got one in the middle. And it's a 16-hour flight," he 
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
So long, L.A.

DRUGS NOT MAIN CAUSE FOR GANGS, SHERIFF SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: BLOCK SAYS IT'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT NARCOTICS SALES ARE THE BIGGEST 
REASON FOR STREET VIOLENCE. HE TELLS OF NEED TO FOCUS ON SELF-WORTH AND 
SELF-ESTEEM.

The misconception that the drug trade is the chief motivator for gang violence 
has hobbled efforts to solve an expanding problem that is killing more people 
across Los Angeles County every year, Sheriff Sherman Block told a gathering of 
600 educators in Downey on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The acknowledgment, echoed by numerous gang authorities at a gang symposium 
sponsored by the county Office of Education, represents a public departure from 
statements made by some law enforcement officials and politicians since Los 
Angeles' gang problems became a national story two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause for the majority of the violence is pure and simple: fascination and 
excitement, coupled with deep-seated hatred of one gang for another," Block 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although drug sales often constitute the means by which street thugs finance 
vehicles and sophisticated weaponry, Block said, "the time has come for the 
newly enlightened in our community to start looking at the gang situation 
realistically. 
</P>
<P>
"To effectively compete with gangs for the hearts, minds and bodies of 
potential gang members," Block said, "we must focus on enhancing their 
self-worth and self-esteem so that they do not seek out and need the gang to 
satisfy these most basic human needs." 
</P>
<P>
It is an attitude somewhat at variance with thinking among some law enforcement 
officials and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
As the spread of crack cocaine has ravaged neighborhood after neighborhood, 
police have routinely blamed most gang problems on drugs. Leading the assault 
against the so-called "gang-drug tie-in" has been Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, who once said local gangs had turned into "significant 
organized crime units" perfectly structured to be drug distribution networks. 
</P>
<P>
This theory, widely repeated in local and national news reports, holds that 
drive-by shootings and other attacks grew out of competition between street 
gangs for drug-selling turf or new markets. 
</P>
<P>
However, "the general impression put forth by the media today that gangs are 
fighting each other primarily over drug dealing turf is really an 
oversimplification of the problem," Block said. "Street gangs are really mortal 
enemies and will not hesitate to kill each other on sight whether drugs are an 
issue or not." 
</P>
<P>
County Juvenile Court Judge Jaime Corral agreed, saying, "It is too easy to say 
that drugs are fostering this gang violence. . . . It's a cop-out." 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs were here long before drugs," added Sheriff's Capt. Raymond Gott, who 
attended the symposium, "and if we excluded the drug problem today, the hatred 
of one gang for another would still be there." 
</P>
<P>
Many gang members and community-based organizations have long derided the 
notion that gang violence is directly related to the drug trade. In fact, they 
said, the two problems, while connected, were often separate. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the gang killing, they said, grew out of longtime rivalries shaped by 
the simple intrusion of one gang member into another's territory. An endless 
cycle of "payback" attacks, motivated by nothing more than revenge, ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of gangs composed primarily of older members who cared more 
about money than turf rivalries took their entrepreneurial skills and access to 
rock cocaine across the country. Los Angeles gang members showing up in cities 
from Seattle to Boston seemed to suggest that Los Angeles-based gangs were 
highly organized, almost "Mafia-like" drug dealing operations, gang authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates could not be reached for comment. But Police Cmdr. William Booth insisted 
that "drugs in our view are a major factor" in gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Police figures show that 55% of homicides are drug-related, "directly or 
indirectly," said Booth, and 38% of homicides are gang-related. "We think there 
is crossover there." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Valdivia, executive director of Community Youth Gang Services, however, 
argued, "The simple answer is to say these people use drugs." 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs are everywhere now, but they started in areas of high unemployment and 
welfare, poor schools and deteriorating neighborhoods," Valdivia said. "Add to 
that a government that did not address those issues, a government that saw it 
as a minority problem and not 'our problem,' meaning a white problem."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANDFILL'S DEAL WITH STATE ANGERS WATER 
AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Changes negotiated privately with state officials could allow the operator of 
an Azusa landfill to reclaim the $20.5 million it pledged to clean up San 
Gabriel Valley water pollution, officials of three water agencies charged 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The officials are angery about an agreement made final last month by the State 
Water Resources Control Board, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Board and 
Browning-Ferris Industries, whose subsidiary, the Azusa Land Reclamation Co., 
owns the Azusa landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Company and state officials deny any impropriety and say BFI only promised the 
$20.5 million with the expectation that it would be able to recoup the money 
from polluters. 
</P>
<P>
The escrow agreement means that the landfill company, not the state, can get 
back some or all of the $20.5 million if BFI can track down anyone responsible 
for the pollution.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR IN SEX CASE SUED BY STATE MEDICAL 
BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Medical Board of California filed suit Wednesday seeking to revoke the 
license of a Brentwood physician while he awaits trial on charges that he 
sexually assaulted at least four female patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yahya Joe Lavi was arrested in July for allegedly raping or molesting four 
women who had been referred to him for examinations related to Worker's 
Compensation benefits, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Nancy Ann Stoner. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old orthopedist "has sexually abused four of his patients, and he 
has falsely represented his qualifications in medical reports," said the 
lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lavi could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor has other offices in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Covina, Pasadena, 
Panorama City and Lancaster. The alleged sexual assaults occurred at offices in 
Panorama City and Los Angeles, authorities said.

<P>
Just hours before trial began for the accused killer of Los Angeles Police 
Officer Daniel Pratt, the slain officer's brother, who is also an LAPD officer, 
was shot at on the Long Beach Freeway while on his way home early Wednesday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators discounted the possibility that the freeway shooting was 
connected to the brother's death, however. "They're in no way connected," said 
Lt. Ken Lady, an LAPD investigator. "I think it was just a random shooting and 
they (the attackers) didn't know he was a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Brian Pratt, 27, was not injured in the 3:15 a.m. incident in the City 
of Commerce during which he exchanged several shots with passengers in a 1975 
Ford LTD that menacingly followed him for several miles on the freeway, Lady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was while being questioned about the freeway shooting that Brian Pratt 
remembered that a trial was scheduled to begin later that morning in Los 
Angeles Superior Court for Kirkton Phenor Moore, 29, who is accused of killing 
Officer Daniel Pratt, 30, in the wake of a gang drive-by shooting two years ago 
in the Hyde Park section of Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, it just dawned on him," Lady said. 
</P>
<P>
One co-worker at the LAPD's Southeast Division, where Brian Pratt is a 
uniformed patrol officer, agreed that the two incidents were not related, but 
he added: "It does make you stop and think, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pratt, who joined the force after his brother's death, was unavailable 
for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Moore and girlfriend Raylene Brooks, 19, were arrested about two months after 
Daniel Pratt was killed. Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the slain officer was 
the first Los Angeles policeman to die as a result of a gang-related drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was working undercover on the night of Sept. 4, 1988, when he and 
his partner, Veronica DeLao, heard gunfire and chased a car they saw leaving 
the scene of a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the car turned and bore down on Pratt and DeLao in a service 
station at the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Florence Avenue. During an 
exchange of gunfire, Pratt was shot in the face. DeLao was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two months after Daniel Pratt's death, Fox Television Network's 
"America's Most Wanted" did a segment on the shooting and the hunt for Moore 
and Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who had fled to Las Vegas with Brooks, saw the segment and agreed to 
give himself up to KTLA newsman Warren Wilson. Wilson and a Channel 5 cameraman 
met the pair in Las Vegas and drove them to the station's Hollywood studios, 
where they surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial that began about six hours after the freeway incident, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William Gravlin told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury that there 
was sufficient evidence to link Moore to the killing of Pratt, a six-year LAPD 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
He said in opening statements that Moore's fingerprints were found on the 
murder weapon and that DeLao identified Moore as the man who killed the 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who has maintained his innocence, sat quietly throughout the trial's 
opening statements and initial witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Rosen, one of Moore's defense attorneys, declined to discuss outside 
court why he believes that his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to come out piece by piece," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gravlin said he would seek the death penalty if Moore is convicted of 
first-degree murder.

SALVATION ARMY PAY; 
</P>
<P>
'BENEFICIARIES' MUST GET MINIMUM WAGE, U.S. RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Salvation Army may do the Lord's work, but the government says it must pay 
earthly wages to those required to labor as part of a residential 
rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Under a recent U.S. Department of Labor decision, the Salvation Army was 
ordered to pay the federal minimum wage to the men and women, mostly alcohol 
and drug abusers, who perform various jobs while getting help for their 
problems. The participants fill 11,000 slots in more than 115 centers around 
the country. Southern California has 1,000 beds at 10 centers. 
</P>
<P>
The work falls under the Fair Labor Standards Act because the goods produced by 
the workers end up in interstate commerce, said Labor Department spokesman Bob 
Cuccia in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Army's position is that participants in the program are "beneficiaries," 
not employees with work being a part of the treatment protocol, much the way 
movie stars at the Betty Ford Center must take out the garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army was founded in 1865 as a religious and charitable 
organization and is a branch of the Christian church that is run in a 
quasi-military fashion. The church affiliation is another argument for not 
having to pay wages to those in the rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army is appealing the ruling to a higher authority. The group, a 
national institution for more than 100 years, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District 
Court in Alexandria, Va., on Tuesday challenging the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The local organization is also appealing to the court of public opinion, 
inviting reporters on Wednesday to tour its 180-bed facility at 7th Street and 
Towne Avenue downtown. 
</P>
<P>
There, Salvation Army officials and the men at work unloading trucks, packing 
lunches and refinishing furniture for resale at the thrift stores, explained 
their philosophies and beliefs. Officials said the ruling by the Wage and Hour 
Division of the Department of Labor is disastrous to the organization's 
self-supporting program and the people it serves. 
</P>
<P>
The wage issue has been kicking around since the first term of the Reagan 
Administration, according to an official on an appointed Labor Department 
committee that recommended program workers be paid. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by the president of Goodwill Industries of America 
"urged us to take an enforcement stance," Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill, the Easter Seal Society and other similar organizations all pay wages 
to their disabled workers, Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
But Army officials counter that if wages were paid, needy substance abusers 
would be out on the street because the Army would have to charge for the 
treatment program and nearly all participants cannot afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army Lt. Col. David P. Riley said the program costs about $50 a day 
per person to run. The "beneficiaries" receive a stipend of up to $20 a month 
for candy and cigarettes. To give them more would be "a very damaging practice" 
because those with substance abuse problems would take the money and run, said 
Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Riley insisted that as long as the people are "working their treatment program" 
-- a combination of spiritualism, Tough Love for adults and an Alcoholics 
Anonymous-type 12-step program -- they are not being exploited. 
</P>
<P>
Several current residents interviewed while at work espoused a similar view. "I 
didn't come here to acquire a job. I came here to get myself back in society," 
said George Upsey as he popped packets of mustard into sack lunches. 
</P>
<P>
Upsey, 40, a college graduate who majored in biology and chemistry, said he is 
an alcoholic who would not be in the program if it cost money. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the loading dock, a 28-year-old self-described cocaine addict, Michael 
Lawrence, said a paycheck would be fair, but "it's not what I'm looking for. 
I'm looking for help." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Diviak, 51, who has been in the rehabilitation program more than once, 
was stripping the finish from a table as he explained he doesn't feel taking 
advantage of what he calls "work therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Riley puts it, they're learning the "work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with the Salvation's Army's approach. Retired Navy Rear 
Adm. David Cooney, president of Goodwill, said in a telephone interview that 
the "best way to get people adjusted is to give them a job and pay them for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Goodwill, Cooney said: "We don't say 'Gee, you're getting a lot of 
good out of this so you should work for nothing.' That's saying their work is 
worth nothing."

ADVISERS TELL SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT TO RETURN ANY BILLS FOR TAX COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County superintendent of schools has been advised by attorneys to 
send back the bill if county supervisors charge his office for collecting 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new state law, the County Board of Supervisors could charge school 
districts and the community college district a total of $3.1 million to collect 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from the Schools Legal Service of Bakersfield addressed to County 
Schools Supt. James F. Cowan said the law does not take effect until Jan. 1, 
1991, and any invoice received before then "should be returned to the county 
which generated it, along with a notation that there is no present legal 
authority for presentation of the invoice." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors will vote Tuesday on whether to charge such fees. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said the county superintendent's office is awaiting the board's vote 
before taking a position on whether to pay the bill, which would amount to an 
estimated $134,000 for the superintendent's office, which runs special 
education programs at several schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be doing a lot of research before we take any final position," Cowan 
said. "We don't know until we find out if they're going to charge us. Once they 
do that, we'll be deciding from there where we're going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys from Schools Legal Service have advised 100 school districts that it 
represents statewide to return bills for the fees. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said the fees are illegal because a state education statute 
prohibits counties from charging the fees. That law was not repealed or amended 
under the new legislation, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
But County Counsel James L. McBride said the county disagrees with the letter. 
McBride said that the intent of the legislation is to override previous laws 
and make the fees mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts will have to decide, if it comes to that, if the legislation takes 
precedence" over the previous law, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
Costs to individual districts would range from $1,446 for the 31-student Santa 
Clara Elementary School District to $555,204 for the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in other school districts, including Oxnard Elementary, have said 
they plan to return the invoices to the county if they are billed. 
</P>
<P>
The letter advised school districts to seek legal advice if a county withholds 
property tax revenues to cover the fees or if a county sues the district to 
collect the fees. 
</P>
<P>
The county counsel, which normally represents the superintendent of schools 
office in most legal matters, is representing the County Board of Supervisors 
on this issue, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen any of the legal information that the county has put 
together," Cowan said. "I would expect if there would be a lawsuit, a lot of 
districts statewide would be involved . . . but we're way aways from that."

OFFICIALS BLAME LEGISLATURE FOR COUNTY'S BUDGET PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local officials meeting in Oxnard united Wednesday in blaming state legislators 
for passing their budget problems on to Ventura County and its cities. 
</P>
<P>
The nine city and county representatives who met at the Financial Plaza Hilton 
were scheduled to discuss growth, but the only topic of agreement was their 
financial woes and who is to blame for them. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had criticized the Ventura County Board of Supervisors for 
passing on the $5.8 million in cuts that state lawmakers made in the county's 
$686-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, city and county officials aimed their criticism at state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Dorill B. Wright, mayor of Port Hueneme, was the most vociferous of the group 
when he blasted the state for "passing the buck to our county, which has no 
place to go but to the cities." 
</P>
<P>
"Something's got to be done," Camarillo Councilman Michael Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has said it has no choice but to pass on the 
cuts to the county's 10 cities, 22 school districts and numerous special 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have agreed to charge each city $120 for every prisoner booked 
at the Ventura County Jail. The supervisors are also considering charging 
cities, schools and tax districts for property tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Gregory Stratton said city and county representatives need to 
unite in voicing their displeasure with state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our citizens are mad and are not going to take it any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials offered no easy alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to be a lot more creative in addressing the problem," 
Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
But several speakers, including Supervisor Madge Schaefer and Oxnard Mayor Nao 
Takasugi, said planned growth can help provide financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said recent growth in the county has provided residents with a higher 
standard of living by bringing with it better streets, schools, hospitals and 
malls. "All of us, in one way or another, benefit from a growth-oriented 
economy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said tax revenue from new commercial development can help improve the 
county's financial future. "The county is heading for disaster, financially," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said tax revenues are increasing in Oxnard, which he said is "just now 
seeing the fruits of long-term growth planning." 
</P>
<P>
He rebutted accusations that Oxnard has rampant, uncontrolled growth, saying 
the pace in his city was recently ranked sixth among the county's 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have managed, responsible and balanced growth in Oxnard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of cities that have growth-limiting ordinances, such as Ventura 
and Camarillo, defended their stand. 
</P>
<P>
The panel discussion was sponsored by Ventura County National Bank and 
attracted about 300 business and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The panel members agreed that there is enough leadership and communication 
among city and county representatives to overcome countywide problems such as 
tight budgets, traffic and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schaefer said, "Often politics gets in the way of good government."

A MILLION YUKS -- FAR FEWER BUCKS; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: KMDY RADIO IS FOR LAUGHS. BUT ADVERTISING HAS BEEN HARDER TO 
COME BY THAN LISTENERS, AND FUNNY RECORDS AREN'T FREE. 
</P>

<P>
Gloria Arenson was stuck in a traffic jam on the Ventura Freeway, fed up with 
the "doom and gloom" on the morning news. 
</P>
<P>
So she flipped the radio dial, and between the nonstop talk shows she found 
vintage Bill Cosby on KMDY (850 AM) radio in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Instant jokes. Arenson laughed. And the drivers in the other cars stared at 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we just need to take our minds off the 'ain't it awful' parts of our 
lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the comedy radio station -- the only one of its kind on the West Coast -- 
has been faced with problems that are far from funny, station officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone loves comedy," said Jeff Elkins, program director of the station. "It 
is the most widely accepted format. But it hasn't been all that good for 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Station managers wanted to scrap the laughs for a more profitable news-talk 
format last spring, but the station was flooded with hundreds of letters and 
phone calls from listeners. A devoted following that spans from North Hollywood 
to Santa Barbara persuaded management to keep the all-comedy format. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very little in our lives that is pleasant in today's world," said 
Gene Schklair, 60, a Thousand Oaks artist and avid KMDY listener. "But comedy 
is important. It gets us through trying times. Laughter is healing." 
</P>
<P>
Ira Barmak, a Beverly Hills entertainment executive whose projects have 
included a remake of a classic war film and a horror movie about an ax-wielding 
Santa Claus, bought KMDY with nine other investors for about $750,000 in 1984, 
when its call letters were KGOE-AM. 
</P>
<P>
Barmak cut the station's syndicated talk-show format and started programming 
comedy bits, chiefly from the stand-up comics of the 1960s. Vintage Bill Cosby, 
Bob Newhart, Woody Allen, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin and others have been 
intermingled with classic comics, such as Jack Benny and Fibber McGee and 
Molly. 
</P>
<P>
Between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., and from 8 to 10 p.m. on weekdays, the station 
plays the classics. On Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings, they air 
interview shows with various comedians. The rest of the time they play 
comedians randomly from their repertoire of 1,000 records. 
</P>
<P>
According to evening disc jockey Brian Rumbaugh, the most requested artist is 
Bill Cosby. "He's like our Led Zeppelin." 
</P>
<P>
When the station started airing only comedy, it was one of three such stations 
in the country. But the other stations soon went under, and, until recently, 
KMDY was the only comedy radio station operating in the United States. About a 
month ago, another comedy station started in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
A major obstacle KMDY faced in the beginning was identifying its audience for 
its advertisers, said Peter J. Turpel, KMDY general manager. The station could 
not afford an elaborate market study of listeners, so it was virtually 
impossible to determine who was listening. 
</P>
<P>
But all that changed when Turpel threatened in March to change the format of 
the station. From the 1,000 phone calls and letters KMDY received urging the 
station to stay on the air, officials were finally able to put together the 
listener profile. 
</P>
<P>
The ages of the listeners who wrote in vary from 16 to 65 -- a far broader 
range than most stations. Many of the listeners are professionals who spend 
hours on the road each day. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the responses were clever. One listener cut out the station's logo of a 
laughing mouth and wrote: "Don't muffle the mouth." A youngster wrote on pink 
paper, "Keep us laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Several people, mostly from the Thousand Oaks area, circulated petitions in 
their neighborhoods to keep the station on the air. 
</P>
<P>
One listener said he rarely finds humor in some of the cuts the station plays 
but sent a letter in support of the station anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets so boring sometimes," Dave McGhee, owner of the Camarillo Heating and 
Air Conditioning Co., said in an interview. "I don't know why I wrote that 
letter. They're so amateurish. Sometimes there's just dead air on the station. 
They make fools of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, then added: "But they make my day. Every so often when I'm in the 
doldrums, I switch to comedy radio." 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of station officials, some psychologists and psychiatrists who 
were listening were actually suggesting the station as therapy for their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the station, several Thousand Oaks psychotherapists wrote: "We 
know and value the effects of humor in the healing process. Keep comedy radio 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Slutzky, a Santa Barbara psychiatrist, scrawled a message on a 
prescription slip and sent it to the station. It said: "Comedy 24 hrs/day . . . 
Keep it playing." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I'm in my car, I listen to the station," Slutzky said. "I even tell 
my patients jokes I hear. It's great to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the listeners' letter-writing campaign, advertising has 
increased by 20%. "Things are picking up," Elkins said. "But we're not 
millionaires. This is not big business." 
</P>
<P>
And there are other problems. Although the radio station can be heard from the 
San Fernando Valley to Santa Barbara during the day, it is barely audible 
outside the Thousand Oaks area at night. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said the station has applied to the Federal Communications Commission 
for a power boost, but it could be another year before a decision is made on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the average listener tunes in to the station for about 20 minutes at a 
time. "There is a major problem with the listening span," Elkins said. "You ask 
people on the street and they'll say, 'I listen all the time.' But they don't 
really.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some listeners say they would tune in longer if the station played more 
present-day comedians, but that is easier said than done. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is getting clean material," Elkins said. "I spend a lot of 
time splicing words out of Eddie Murphy bits. Most of Arsenio Hall is not 
broadcastable." 
</P>
<P>
And although a station slogan says, "If the records weren't free, we would be 
all news," the records are downright expensive -- and many are hard to find, 
Elkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hardly any comedy records anymore," he said. "We have to beg and 
borrow wherever we can." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the matter, some modern comedians have asked the station not to 
include them in the format. "Some think it will hurt them," Elkins said. He 
would not name names. "They think others will steal their jokes."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fillmore is being considered by the California Community College state 
chancellor's office as a site for a community college center branch to be built 
between 2001 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation came as part of a study released this week that says 25 new 
college sites and centers are needed to accommodate student growth over the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Community college enrollment is expected to jump from 1.4 million this year to 
1.9 million by 2005, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ventura College had 461 students from the Fillmore area. About 564 
Fillmore residents attend classes at the three-college district, with another 
200 attending off-campus classes, according to the district. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Derryberry, Ventura County Community College District chancellor, said 
the district recommended to the chancellor's office in January that additional 
campuses be considered in the Conejo Valley, Camarillo and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
"With 25 campuses and centers being considered, we were certainly pleased one 
of those is in Ventura County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings on all the sites are scheduled Oct. 23 in Los Angeles and Oct. 
24 in Sacramento. Afterward, the chancellor will make recommendations on the 
expansions to the board of governors, said Ann Reed, a spokeswoman for the 
state chancellor's office. The board is expected to act by January. 
</P>
<P>
The Fillmore campus would be a small learning center that would offer general 
education courses in addition to vocational education programs, said Lyn 
MacConnaire, vice president of instruction at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, it would become a full-service campus with broad course offerings 
and facilities such as an auditorium, library and counseling staff. GERRY

CITIZENS TO SEEK NEW RESIDENTIAL CONTROLS

Citizens will be asked to help draft a law that would curb crowding in 
single-family neighborhoods in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, after hearing homeowners pack City Hall to denounce crowding 
and call for controls, decided Tuesday night to use residents on a new 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has not yet been formed, but Councilman Larry Horner said 
Wednesday that he expects to have a group ready to work on a new ordinance by 
the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try to provide an ordinance that's got a little more teeth to it," 
Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners groups and council members for three years have been studying ways 
to limit what they say are growing numbers of people who rent rooms in 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
They have pressed for regulations to solve parking and other problems when 
homes are used as boardinghouses. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks zoning laws permit houses to be rented only to families or groups 
of less than six people. But the state Supreme Court struck down a similar law 
in Santa Barbara 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The law was ruled unconstitutional because the definition of a family is not 
clear-cut, City Atty. Mark Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Code enforcement officers have been unable to enforce all but the most blatant 
violations. But in heated speeches punctuated by frequent bursts of applause, 
24 residents told the council of their dissatisfaction with the lack of 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Elois Zeanah said some homeowners were unhappy that a draft ordinance 
actually increased the number of people who can live in a residence. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the third ordinance in three years, and none of them would have 
worked," said Zeanah, who represents the Conejo Hills/Lynn Estates Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As written, the ordinance "opens single-family homes to become overcrowded 
combat zones of crime and blight," Zeanah said. "This ordinance would have 
legalized the problems we have now." PSYCHE PASCUAL

LET THE FEASTING BEGIN -- IT'S THE JEWISH NEW YEAR;

RELIGION: THOUSANDS IN L.A. USHER IN THE HEBREW YEAR 5751 WITH PRAYERS

<P>
The start of the 10 Days of Penitence was just hours away. But Masha Metzger 
wasn't going to have to apologize for leaving anything out of her food basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Hancock Park woman was standing in the checkout line at a Fairfax Avenue 
market Wednesday after finishing the shopping that would to carry her through 
the two-day Rosh Hashanah celebration that marks the start of the Jewish New 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Los Angeles-area Jews ushered in the Hebrew year 5751 with prayers 
at neighborhood synagogues at sundown Wednesday and then at family feasts at 
home. The observance ends at sundown on Yom Kippur, Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we'll be having fish, vegetables, soup, turkey and stuffing, cranberry 
sauce, sweet potato tsimmes, potato kugel souffle, honey cake and apples dipped 
in honey," Metzger said, checking over her shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
"Thursday night we'll have fish, honey orange chicken, Jerusalem kugel, 
carrots, green beans and carrot cake. Friday night we'll have chicken soup, 
roast, salad, potato knishes, a green vegetable, green noodle kugel, fruit and 
apple cake. And challah bread at each meal." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said she was expecting to feed about 15 at each meal. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got giant pots to cook in and plenty of help from the kids. They're 17, 
16, 14, 12 and 6," she said, pausing to run down a mental list. "Well, not the 
14-year-old -- he's no help." 
</P>
<P>
At a fish market a few doors away, Barry Weiss of Los Angeles was buying a carp 
to serve at his family gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be eating it tonight, tomorrow -- for as long as it lasts, in fact," he 
laughed as he selected a large one from the glass-fronted display counter. 
"It's a big fish. But we have a big family." 
</P>
<P>
Feasting is a customary way of starting the Jewish New Year. Delicacies are 
prepared for good luck. Breads and apple slices dipped in honey are accompanied 
by prayers for a sweet new year. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax Avenue -- a center of Los Angeles-area Jewish culture -- was filled 
with last-minute shoppers hurrying to finish before sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not that religious -- I'm more traditional," said Beverly Hills resident 
Lili Winter, who ducked into a bakery to buy a round-shaped loaf of challah 
bread. "Being on Fairfax makes you feel more Jewish than you really are." 
</P>
<P>
Since Rosh Hashanah is a time for self-examination and penitence, her husband, 
Herbert Winter, said he would reflect on ways to avoid "shouting at my wife 
once in a while." Upon reflection, however, he quickly added: "After being 
married 43 years, I really don't do too bad!" 
</P>
<P>
Inside the bakery, Beth Lewis pulled number 53 from a ticket dispenser and 
settled in for a wait. "I came down here from Woodland Hills to buy bread," 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from Torrance," said shopper Renee Rodson, standing next to her. 
"That's nothing, I came from Houston just to get challah," chimed in Esther 
Berens, visiting friends in town for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The electric sign on the wall behind the harried bakery clerks read: "Now 
serving Number 53." Lewis laughed. "We're going to be here three weeks past 
Purim," she joked, referring to a Jewish holiday that comes in March. 
</P>
<P>
Up the street at a bookstore and gift shop, Max Narod of Granada Hills tried on 
a prayer shawl and then bought it. "I'll be using it at home starting tonight. 
We get together with the in-laws after we come home from the synagogue. It's 
definitely a joyous holiday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shop co-owner Ebbi Haroonian said business was brisk from customers purchasing 
New Year's cards, candles and prayer books. He said rabbis and cantors bought 
more than 50 ram's horns during the last two weeks to use at Rosh Hashanah 
observances. 
</P>
<P>
The ram's horn was used in biblical times to call the Israelites to meetings. 
These days, the shofar, as it's called, is sounded after Rosh Hashanah prayers 
are recited. "If their old one has a crack in it, it's not kosher to use it," 
Haroonian explained, fingering a $185 horn. 
</P>
<P>
Many Fairfax Avenue shops will be closed today and Friday because of the 
holiday. But not all. 
</P>
<P>
Bank manager Menachem Dagan said his branch at the busy corner of Fairfax 
Avenue and Beverly Boulevard will be open. But probably empty. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty or 70% of our clientele is Jewish," Dagan said, interrupting himself to 
take a telephone call -- in Hebrew -- from a customer with a question about his 
account. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be open," falafel stand employee Anat Efraim said glumly. Then, she 
added brightly: "But I'll be off!"

MARINE SANCTUARY TO MARK 10TH YEAR

The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary will celebrate its 10th 
anniversary Saturday and Sunday with Chumash Indian Dolphin Dancers, drawings 
for sanctuary cruises and free admission to Sea Center, Manager Stephen C. 
Jameson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara Channel surrounding the Channel Islands was designated a 
sanctuary by former President Jimmy Carter on Sept. 22, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Center, a marine museum on Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara, will be open 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It has full-scale replicas of a whale, sea creatures 
including sea horses and starfish to touch and an octopus tank. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctuary patrol vessel XANTU will shuttle people between the Sea Center 
and the new sanctuary headquarters at the Naval Reserve building in the Santa 
Barbara harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson said the sanctuary marks the meeting place of a cold current from the 
north and a warm current from the south, which lures temperate and warm water 
species to the islands. 
</P>
<P>
The region is rich in nutrients as a result of up-swelling, or deep water 
rising to the surface, Jameson said. The nutrients attract fish, which in turn 
attract birds and marine mammals. SCOTT LAWRENCE

GALLEGLY OPPONENT SAYS DONATIONS FROM S&amp;LS SHOULD GO TO TREASURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic congressional candidate Richard Freiman, seeking an 
attention-getting issue for his uphill campaign against Rep. Elton Gallegly, 
Wednesday called on Gallegly to give $20,000 in contributions from savings and 
loan institutions to the U.S. Treasury to help pay for a massive federal 
bailout of the troubled industry. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman, an Agoura attorney and television writer, said Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) should give the government the money to make it clear to constituents 
"that instead of being part of the problem, you are part of the solution" to 
the S&amp;L crisis, which regulators say will cost U.S. taxpayers $500 billion 
over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly was traveling and unavailable for comment Wednesday, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But in a prepared statement, the congressman said that less than 1.5% of his 
overall contributions have come from the thrift industry and that he supported 
several bills to aid prosecution of S&amp;L fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman's poorly financed campaign has attracted scant attention so far and 
political observers give him little chance of upsetting Gallegly. 
</P>
<P>
But like other Democratic congressional challengers around the country, he is 
trying to use thrift contributions as a political weapon against a GOP 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found that by a margin of 
39% to 17%, voters hold the GOP more responsible than Democrats for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And they were evenly split over President Bush's handling of the scandal, with 
38% approving and 37% disapproving. 
</P>
<P>
However, the same survey found that voters blame the situation much more on 
thrift executives than federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the poll showed that voters split almost evenly over whether they 
trust the GOP or Democrats more to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman said a recent Common Cause study ranked Gallegly 49th out of 435 House 
members in the amount of contributions accepted from thrifts, although he was 
in Congress for only four of the nine years covered by the study. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman charged that Gallegly "didn't take any action" to stave off the thrift 
disaster, despite having been elected to Congress four years ago. "It was his 
responsibility as a member of Congress to do something about this," Freiman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman said Gallegly voted in favor of legislation that allowed S&amp;Ls to 
continue to invest in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Gallegly said he voted in favor of seven bills designed to 
assist in investigating and prosecuting S&amp;L executives suspected of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman, who left his job to campaign full time for the Nov. 6 election, faces 
long odds in his struggle against Gallegly in the 21st Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans outnumber Democrats 177,000 to 124,000 in the district, which 
covers western and northern portions of Los Angeles County and southern and 
central Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 general election, Gallegly trounced his Democratic opponent, Donald 
E. Stevens, by a margin of 69% to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
In campaign finance statements filed in June, Gallegly reported having more 
than $100,000 in cash available for the fall campaign, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman reported having $436 on hand.

Paying for Troops in Japan 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 370 to 53 to require Japan to pay the $5-billion annual cost of 
stationing 50,000 U. S. troops and dependents there. This occurred during 
debate on the fiscal 1991 defense budget (HR 4739). About 5,000 of the 
Americans would be withdrawn annually if Japan declined to start paying for 
them. U. S. troops are based in Japan to protect it as well as American 
regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) complained that "American workers are paying 
to protect Japan while Japan closes its markets to us." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent David O'B. Martin (R-N.Y.) said the amendment sends Japan an 
appropriate message but "would be more detrimental to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to require Japan to begin paying for the American troops it 
hosts.

Troops in Korea 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 157 to 265, the House rejected an amendment to bring more troops 
home from South Korea than the White House wants returned as world tensions 
ease. The amendment to the 1991 defense bill (above) sought to reduce U. S. 
forces in South Korea from 43,000 to 30,000 in the next few years, contrasted 
with the 36,000 level sought by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.) said his amendment "would save us $3 billion 
over the next five years without affecting our deterrence capability." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said: "North Korea has done nothing 
really to . . . change its dictatorial policies to warrant us lowering our 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap U. S. military strength in South Korea at 30,000.

Student Loan Forgiveness 
</P>
<P>
The House refused, 200 to 212, to kill student loan forgiveness for new 
borrowers who have joined the proposed "national service." This occurred as the 
House sent to conference with the Senate a bill (HR 4330) establishing the 
volunteer corps, which would place youths in community jobs such as 
conservation and drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment sought to kill language canceling all interest and some principal 
on loans that volunteers receive after the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Thomas E. Petri (R-Wis.) said Congress should not relinquish to a 
private official, such as a YMCA director, the power to forgive student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Pat Williams (D-Mont.) said Peace Corps and Vista volunteers receive 
the same benefit, so "let's extend it as part of these 'thousand points of 
light' to other young Americans." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to eliminate loan forgiveness for national service volunteers.

AGREEMENT REPORTED IN LANDFILL POLLUTION CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON: AN ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS A CLOSED MEETING HAS LED TO A BREAKTHROUGH 
THAT COULD ENSURE THE DUMP MEETS AIR QUALITY LEVELS BY DEC. 15. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement has been worked out aimed at satisfying all three sides in the 
contentious Lopez Canyon Landfill dispute -- Los Angeles city administrators, 
state air-quality officials and dump neighbors sickened by methane gas 
emissions -- Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said that a daylong meeting he called behind closed doors Wednesday 
produced the framework of an agreement under which the city will bring the dump 
into compliance with state air-pollution laws by Dec. 15 and pay a $5,000 fine 
each time air-quality officials cite it for gas leakage violations after that 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The money would go into a fund to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods, said 
Katz, whose district includes the dump area. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty extraordinary in that I think we broke a stalemate" between city 
and regional air-quality officials and the dump's neighbors, Katz said. "This 
is an incredible breakthrough in its benefits to the neighborhood," because it 
"ensures the neighborhood can hold the city accountable," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hastily called meeting was attended by city Bureau of Sanitation 
officials, representatives of the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
enforcement staff and City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's office, as well as Rob 
Zapple -- a neighborhood leader in the fight against methane gas emissions, and 
Michael Magnuson, an attorney who represents a group of residents who live near 
the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said a meeting will be held Monday night, at a location to be determined, 
to inform the public of details of the agreement, which also must be approved 
by the City Council and an AQMD hearing board. The board has been holding 
hearings into noxious gas emissions from the landfill. Katz said more public 
comments will be taken at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said other highlights of the proposed agreement include: 
</P>
<P>
* A phased closure of the portion of the landfill that faces Kagel Canyon 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased monitoring of air by AQMD inspectors and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
* Public access to any city and state documents having to do with the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
* Formation of a task force of community members to advise the city and AQMD on 
landfill problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Appointment of a community member to a group of city and state officials that 
will meet once a month to discuss landfill problems. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the dump have complained for years of smelly and dangerous methane 
and other gases leaking from garbage decomposing underground. The AQMD last 
week cited the city for 28 violations of air-pollution laws for gas leaks, 
exposing the city to up to $700,000 in fines. The amount of the fine is being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday the City Council -- carrying out an agreement reached earlier with the 
AQMD -- approved spending $3.25 million to improve the dump's gas-collection 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The secrecy surrounding the meeting miffed some dump opponents and members of 
the South Coast Air Quality Management hearing board, which had to cancel its 
own scheduled hearing on the matter because its staff members were attending 
Katz's meeting.

DAVE DISTEL: LUGINBILL SAYS HIS TEAM MIGHT BE WORTH WATCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Luginbill is like a couple who can't wait to show off a new house to 
relatives or a person who can't wait to show off a new car to colleagues or a 
youngster who can't wait to show off a new skateboard to playmates. 
</P>
<P>
This is all nice and fine, except that Luginbill is excited about showing off 
his San Diego State football team . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . . on national television. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
. . . at Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
. . . against Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill's enthusiasm for this occasion is not at all what I expected. When 
CBS announced that this telecast would be beamed to 80% of the nation, I 
thought Luginbill would be pulling for history's largest power outage or maybe 
suggesting it be scrambled everywhere but Hoogle, N.D., and Mary's Igloo, 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Does Luginbill really want this game in 80% of America's living rooms, dens and 
saloons? 
</P>
<P>
Does he know what happened the last time SDSU was on national television? The 
year was 1979, the opponent was, ahem, BYU, and the score was 63-14. No, SDSU 
did not win. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows what impact that humiliation had on a program that went rapidly 
downhill thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
But Luginbill isn't looking or thinking downhill. He is looking uphill, because 
he sincerely believes that is the direction SDSU's program is headed. 
</P>
<P>
"One hundred million people think San Diego State will not play well against 
BYU," Luginbill said. "I know better." 
</P>
<P>
If he knows better, he must know something the 100 million unenlightened don't 
know. Assuming 100 million folks know or care about this little encounter, 
maybe 99,999,999 expect BYU to do a rather large number on San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill, of course, is the holdout. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an opportunity to execute and play well," he said, "and we have an 
opportunity to win this football game by doing so." 
</P>
<P>
This man seemed earnest. He talked matter-of-factly, with an intensity that 
discouraged suggestions that what he was saying sounded just a bit far-fetched. 
You would have thought he was talking about a game against someone such as Cal 
State Long Beach rather than the No. 4 team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we match up extremely well with BYU," Luginbill was saying. "If we go 
in there and don't execute, we'll have some problems. If we go in there and 
execute, they're going to have some problems." 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine what Lou Holtz would be saying if he was the San Diego State 
coach this week? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for these boys I'm taking up there to the mountains," he would 
say. "Gosh, it'll be a good game for us if we can keep 'em in double figures 
and get out without getting anyone hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Al Luginbill has no Lou Holtz in him. Not a bit. You don't find him hiding his 
feelings behind one-liners. You don't find him using humor to cover excuses. 
</P>
<P>
When he talks of this game being an opportunity, you find his tongue nowhere in 
the vicinity of his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in the foundation stage," he said, "with 65 underclassmen out of 79 
kids. But if we go into Provo and play extremely well and come out with a win, 
it hurries the maturation process. It's a hump game. You win this one, and it 
elevates you to where you want to be a little quicker." 
</P>
<P>
This is indeed the kind of game SDSU has to win to establish itself as more 
than a mere bit player to be chewed up by stars such as BYU, UCLA and Miami, 
three heavies on this and future schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"If we play well and don't get a win, does that mean it's the end of the world 
at San Diego State?" Luginbill asked. "No. Our university needs a game like 
this to go our way but, if this isn't the one, it's going to come." 
</P>
<P>
And Al Luginbill just would not confront the notion that it could get ugly 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, for example, that the Aztecs actually led at one point last 
year, 14-7, and played 22 minutes of the first half without starting 
quarterback Dan McGwire. What's more, the game was reasonably close, 35-24, in 
the third quarter before BYU pulled away to a 48-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
A loss by that score would hardly be an embarrassment to the Aztec football 
program, but it would not represent any sort of progress either. It would 
merely reaffirm the status quo, that being that SDSU cannot yet handle a team 
the caliber of BYU. 
</P>
<P>
Al Luginbill wants more than that and, in truth, expects more than that. 
</P>
<P>
The nation will be watching what it expects will be a private party for BYU and 
Detmer, who may be the first guy to have the Heisman Trophy cinched in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
If San Diego State really can crash this party, it will be pleased that 80% of 
the nation was tuned in. However, if the Aztecs crash at this party, they will 
need an assistant coach in charge of damage control.

ANGELS AREN'T FIELDERS AGAINST TIGERS, 12-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little could be said in -- or about -- the Angels' defense Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Even less could be said in defense of their relief pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jack Howell committed two errors and second baseman Donnie Hill 
and first baseman Lee Stevens committed one each to help Detroit score three 
unearned runs, but the Angels kept it close until their bullpen collapsed in a 
six-run Tiger ninth inning that gave Detroit a 12-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We had opportunities to put the game away and weren't able to do it," Manager 
Doug Rader said after his club lost its fourth consecutive game and fell below 
.500 again. "In the eighth inning, if we execute properly, I truly think we win 
it right there and we don't run into the trouble we got into in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored one run in the eighth to cut Detroit's lead to 6-5. They 
loaded the bases with one out, but Dave Winfield struck out and pinch-hitter 
Rick Schu flied to left. They collapsed in the ninth, an inning highlighted by 
Travis Fryman's bases-loaded triple on the first major league pitch thrown by 
reliever Jeff Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Joe Grahe (2-4) was the victim of the defense, but he hardly 
helped his cause when he gave up a home run to Lou Whitaker in the first and a 
three-run homer to Mark Salas in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"The one Salas hit was on a fastball down the middle, belt-high, and I deserve 
that if I make that kind of pitch," said Grahe, who lasted 4 2/3 innings. "To 
Whitaker, I was just trying to get ahead with a breaking pitch." 
</P>
<P>
The four-error game was the Angels' fourth this season and second in their last 
seven games. Their worst effort was a five-error game on May 16 at Milwaukee. 
They committed six in two games against Detroit and have been charged with 130 
errors, second only to Milwaukee's 137. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell (5-4) went the minimum five innings to earn his first victory at 
Anaheim Stadium after four losses, and Jerry Don Gleaton held off an Angel 
flurry in the eighth to earn his 11th save. In losing their fourth consecutive 
game, the Angels' record against AL East opponents fell to 42-42, far below 
last season's 50-24 record. They finished this home stand with a 5-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels hit Terrell hard in the third, parlaying four hits into two runs and 
a 3-1 lead, but a defensive lapse proved costly in the fourth, when Detroit 
rallied to go ahead, 4-3. After Lloyd Moseby singled and was forced at second, 
Fryman reached on a hopper that was bobbled by third baseman Howell. Salas 
slammed the next pitch over the fence in right. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels pulled even in the bottom of the inning on a single by Dick 
Schofield, Luis Polonia's double down the left-field line and Hill's sacrifice 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
However, two more Angel errors in the fifth led to two more unearned runs for 
the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Devon White, who left Tuesday's game with a bruised foot after being struck by 
a pitch from Jack Morris, felt well enough Wednesday to skip his scheduled 
X-rays. However, he was not in the starting lineup. Luis Polonia started in 
center field for the first time since Aug. 11.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

BONDS JOINS DAD'S CLUB; PIRATES LEAD BY 1 GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Bonds joined a club his father made famous, Doug Drabek became the 
National League's first 20-game winner and the Pittsburgh Pirates staggered 
home in first place Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With Bonds hitting two home runs, Drabek went into the eighth inning at Chicago 
breezing with a four-hitter with an 8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing comes easily these days for the Pirates, who barely ended their 
six-game losing streak, outlasting the Cubs, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates lead the NL East by one game over the New York Mets and by five 
over Montreal. The Mets-Expos game at New York was rained out, and they will 
play a doubleheader today. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds' two home runs put him in the club for players who have hit 30 home runs 
and stolen 30 bases in the same season. Bonds' father, Bobby, did it five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who play nine of their last 13 games at home, emerged from a 
hitting slump in the two games at Chicago, but the bullpen problem is not 
solved. They had 17 hits in this game. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, by beating the Mets three consecutive games in early September, 
built a 3 1/2-game lead. But when the hitters slumped, so did the relievers. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of confidence in his bullpen prompted Jim Leyland to extend several 
starters. He didn't take Drabek (20-6) out until he gave up a walk, a double 
and two singles in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Leyland brought in Ted Power, who gave up a single to Andre Dawson and a 
three-run home run to rookie left fielder Derrick May. Bob Patterson came along 
to get the last four outs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had butterflies until the last out," Manager Jim Leyland said. "Maybe the 
scare is what we need to settle us down. 
</P>
<P>
"But I haven't gotten on the players because they've given me 100%. I feel 
confident we're going to win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The near collapse tempered the enthusiasm for the milestones of Bonds and 
Drabek. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad said to go for it," said Bonds, who stole his 49th base. "He said if I 
could hit .300 I could hit 30 home runs." 
</P>
<P>
Drabek is the first Pirate to win 20 since John Candelaria in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 12-2 since the All-Star break," Drabek said. "I told myself to start 
throwing your breaking ball and throw it for strikes. Build your confidence and 
take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sutcliffe (0-2), making only his fifth start after missing most of the 
season because of shoulder surgery, had his poorest outing. He retired only two 
batters, giving up five hits and four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, San Francisco 1 -- The Reds may be sliding, but the Giants can't do 
anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Dave Justice hit a double and his 26th home run at Atlanta, and the 
Braves handed the Giants their fifth loss in the last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Steve Decker's first major league home run provided the only run off Tom 
Glavine (9-11). 
</P>
<P>
The defending NL champions are 7 1/2 games out with 13 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Giant hitters are struggling. Matt Williams is 0 for 23. Kevin Mitchell 
also is in a slump. The Giants have 11 runs in six games on the trip and are 
batting .182. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, St. Louis 4 -- Wes Chamberlain hit his first home run and Dale 
Murphy hit a two-run shot at St. Louis to give the Phillies their third victory 
in a row. DAN HAFNER

REDS RUN INTO PORTUGAL AT HOUSTON, LOSE, 5-2 
</P>

<P>
Mark Portugal is two different pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
There is the one who pitches like a Hall of Fame candidate in the Astrodome. 
And the one who can't get .200 hitters out on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the slumping Cincinnati Reds, they had to face Portugal at 
Houston Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
While the Astros pecked away at Danny Jackson (5-6) and four relievers, 
Portugal (10-10) shut the Reds out for six innings en route to a 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
With Juan Agosto choking off a rally in the eighth inning, Portugal improved 
his record at home to 7-2. In his past 40 innings in the Astrodome, he has 
yielded only six earned runs On the road, he is 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds retained their 4 1/2-game lead over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Just eight days ago, the Reds were seven games ahead of the Dodgers and the San 
Francisco Giants. Cincinnati has gained half a game on the Giants, but the 
Dodgers have closed some ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' skid can be traced to the failure of veteran left-handers Tom 
Browning and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, beaten Tuesday night by the Giants, is 1-3 in his last five starts 
with an earned-run average of 8.78. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson failed to make it through the third inning, giving up three runs and 
seven hits. In the last four starts, Jackson has given up 28 hits and 16 runs 
-- 14 earned -- for a 7.00 ERA in 18 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"What you really need at this time of the season is consistent starting 
pitching," Red Manager Lou Piniella said. "Right now, we have one really 
pitching well, Jose Rijo." 
</P>
<P>
Rijo (12-7) has a 4-1 record and an ERA of 1.13 for his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need," pitching coach Stan Williams said, "is three other guys 
pitching the way Jose is. The trouble is, where do you find them? We need some 
big efforts from some of these guys." DAN HAFNER

When quarterback Tommy Maddox threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver 
Reggie Moore in the third quarter of Saturday's game against Stanford, it was 
the Bruins' first second-half touchdown pass since their game against 
California on Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it was also UCLA's first second-half touchdown of any kind since the 
Oregon State game on Oct. 21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
By getting 32 points against Stanford, UCLA stretched its NCAA-record scoring 
streak to 218 games. The Bruins were last shut out by Michigan, 31-0, at Ann 
Arbor, Mich., in the third game of the 1971 season. 
</P>

Quarterback Don Majkowski, who missed 45 days in a contract holdout, will make 
his first start of the season Sunday for the Green Bay Packers against the 
Kansas City Chiefs. Anthony Dilweg started the first two games as the Packers

DYAL IS HAMSTRUNG FOR FOUR WEEKS

The Raiders placed tight end Mike Dyal on four-week injured reserve with a 
hamstring injury. Dyal was injured in Sunday's 17-13 victory over the Seahawks 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
To replace Dyal, the team signed free agent tight end Andy Parker, who played 
four years with the Raiders until signing with the San Diego Chargers as a Plan 
B free agent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
So, who replaces defensive end Howie Long, out six weeks with a broken toe? No 
one, really, but the Raiders are first going to give Mike Wise the chance. Mike 
Charles and Bill Pickel may also play some in Long's spot. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Evans, the Rams' first draft choice in 1987, will be starting at right 
defensive end for the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday against the Raiders at the 
Coliseum. Evans was released by the Rams before the 1989 season. He was signed 
by the Philadelphia Eagles and was later released, before catching on with 
Pittsburgh. He has one sack this season, one more than is career total with the 
Rams. CHRIS DUFRESNE

In a surprise move, Keith Jackson, Philadelphia's Pro Bowl tight end, ended his 
two-month holdout -- in time to play against the Rams Sunday at Anaheim 
Stadium. Jackson, who caught 144 passes in his first two pro seasons, had said 
he would not report to the team until the final two years of his contract were 
reworked. 
</P>
<P>
The contract remains the same, but he came in anyway. . . . With kicker Mike 
Lansford's right leg still aching, the Rams are leaning strongly toward signing 
an extra kicker and having him in uniform Sunday. Coach John Robinson said he 
wanted Lansford to try to kick but likely would sign one of three players as a 
backup -- Teddy Garcia, formerly with the New England Patriots; John Carney, 
formerly of Notre Dame and a Charger candidate this summer, and David 
Browndyke, formerly of LSU. . . . The Raiders placed tight end Mike Dyal on 
four-week injured reserve with a hamstring injury. Dyal was injured in Sunday's 
17-13 victory over the Seahawks in Seattle. To replace Dyal, the team signed 
free agent tight end Andy Parker, who played four years with the Raiders until 
signing with the Chargers as a Plan B free agent in 1989. The Chargers cut 
Parker during camp. . . . Quarterback Don Majkowski, who missed 45 days in a 
contract holdout, will make his first start of the season Sunday for Green Bay 
against Kansas City.

HAPPY TO HAVE YOU, HENRY; MEET OZZIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your first NFL start, Henry Rolling. This Sunday. In Cleveland. And by the way, 
you're covering Ozzie Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Chargers have lost linebacker Billy Ray Smith (abdominal strain) 
for at least four weeks, Rolling is the man. A free agent cut after six games 
last season by Tampa Bay, Rolling will make his debut at left outside 
linebacker covering Newsome, the most productive pass-catching tight end in NFL 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Is he ready? 
</P>
<P>
"Was Douglas ready for Tyson?" Charger Coach Dan Henning asked with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but what about Michael Spinks, Larry Holmes and the stiffs that did face 
plants into the canvas? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Rolling is pretty matter-of-fact about the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good player," Rolling said of Newsome. "I'm looking forward to playing 
against him because it'll make me a better player." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling faced him once in an exhibition and says he did fine. Besides, Newsome 
is known for his quick feet and soft hands but not necessarily his raw 
strength. Rolling is 25, Newsome 34. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hendrickson, the newest Charger linebacker, signed Wednesday courtesy of 
the 49er cut list. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson, 24, played three games last season for the 49ers, was waived and 
picked up by the Cowboys. A few weeks later, he was re-signed to the 49er 
developmental squad. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard is happy to have him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very intense kid," Beathard said. "He's got terrific speed and good 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Quinn Early's days might be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fighting," Henning said. "He gives us something that the other guys don't 
give us, but there's some speed element that these young guys have." Early, a 
six-game starter last season, was displaced by rookie Walter Wilson before 
Sunday's loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie tackle Leo Goeas, who missed most of training camp recovering from a 
broken foot, says he feels good and is ready to play. He played 20 downs 
against the Bengals Sunday. He figures that's a better test than staring at a 
coach drawing "Xs and Os." 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to talk about it on the chalkboard," he said. "But it's a little 
different when you're out there with a lot of bodies. The toughest thing is 
making it through the whole practice without aggravating the foot. I just need 
a lot of reps." 
</P>
<P>
It might be a few weeks before he is fit to compete for the starting position, 
now occupied by Broderick Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Goeas is questionable for Sunday's game. Also questionable is tight end Arthur 
Cox (lower back strain). On Cleveland's questionable list: running back Kevin 
Mack (finger), cornerback Raymond Clayborn (knee) and defensive tackle Chris 
Pike (ankle).

VOLLEYBALL: MIRA COSTA HIGH WAS THE NATIONAL CHAMPION LAST SEASON, BUT WITH 
ONLY ONE STARTER RETURNING, IT IS NOT GETTING ANY RESPECT IN A NATIONAL 
PRESEASON POLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These things go in cycles. Dae Lea Aldrich, girls' volleyball coach at Mira 
Costa High, knows it better than most. 
</P>
<P>
Only a year removed from a 27-0 season that left Mira Costa at the top of the 
prep volleyball world -- with No. 1 national rankings in both Volleyball 
Monthly and USA Today -- Aldrich finds herself back at the beginning of the 
spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Only one starter returns from last year's unbeaten squad. Only three of 
Aldrich's starters are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa is nowhere to be found in USA Today's Top 25 poll this month. And 
the Mustangs are ranked only sixth in the Southern Section by Volleyball 
Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
But in the preseason Southern Section coaches' poll, Mira Costa was ranked 
first in the 5-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the Southland's coaches still believe in Mira Costa, even if Aldrich 
is hedging her bets a little. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're going to fall apart or anything," Aldrich said. "But if 
we're lucky, we'll make the (CIF) quarterfinals. If we're luckier still, we'll 
make the semis. And if we've really got it all going for us, maybe we'll make 
it into the finals." 
</P>
<P>
At the center of Mira Costa's rebuilding effort is setter Robin Ortgiesen. She 
was the only junior on the team that steamrollered every opponent all the way 
through last year's State Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
Ortgiesen, the team's captain, is counted on to provide stability and 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Robin is big and she can lead, and she's got to get everything going for us," 
Aldrich said. "She's directing the traffic for us. She's our quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Two other seniors -- middle blocker Jen Smith and outside hitter Cindy 
DeGarceau -- are also veterans of Mira Costa's flawless 1989 squad. Smith was 
Aldrich's first reserve off the bench last year, and DeGarceau is finally 
getting her chance to start after waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
But after that trio of seniors, Aldrich is leading some inexperienced 
reinforcements. Outside hitter Shannon Park is a junior, and middle blocker Ann 
Windes and outside hitter Shawnee Hayes are sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
"They are young, green kids, but they're talented," Aldrich said. "They need 
time to grow, and this is going to be their growing year. But they're young and 
fiery, and they're not afraid to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Aldrich had the luxury of bringing in Smith or defensive specialist 
Jen Streatfield off the bench. This season, Aldrich said, her reserves are a 
little thin. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just not there yet," she said. "Volleyball is a real reaction game, 
and almost everything depends on second nature. It takes a while to develop the 
kind of athleticism necessary to react like that." 
</P>
<P>
They will have to learn in a hurry. Starting this weekend, Mira Costa plays in 
three consecutive weekend tournaments where it will face the cream of Southern 
California's volleyball crop. 
</P>
<P>
In this weekend's Edison tournament, the Mustangs will go up against three 
talented Orange County teams: Corona del Mar, Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor 
-- any of which Aldrich feels is capable of winning the Southern Section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The following weekend, Mira Costa tangles with Corona del Mar again, as well as 
powerhouse Santa Barbara, in the Redondo Power Classic. And on the weekend of 
Oct. 6, the Mustangs will be among 25 teams in the San Marcos Tournament, the 
state's most competitive event. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the eventual CIF champion comes from the San Marcos field of 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We might get beat up a little bit, but it will be good for us," Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a victory over Corona del Mar in the finals of last year's Edison 
tournament that launched Mira Costa on its unbeaten journey. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1989 team had the marks of greatness long before that crucial match. 
Six players from that team are now playing Division I college volleyball on 
full-ride scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Hahn, the team's setter and last year's CIF player of the year, is at 
Stanford with Heidi Eick, a former Mira Costa middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Middle blocker Krystal Attwood went on to the University of Hawaii, and outside 
hitters Rainy Chrisman and Erika Lawson are at Pepperdine. Streatfield took her 
tremendous jump serve to the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an amazing group," Aldrich said. "But even that unit took a couple of 
years to develop. They grew through the program together and they really 
excelled. It takes years of practice as a team to learn to play at the speed 
and level that those girls did." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich started coaching at Mira Costa in 1982 and has won seven Southern 
Section and four state championships. 
</P>
<P>
She spent the summer working as a private coach to beach professionals Elaine 
Roque and Nina Matthies and watched that pair win the tour's most prestigious 
event, the $50,000 World Championships in Laughlin, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, however, Aldrich is concerned with more traditional pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Mira Costa's youth movement has rung up a 2-0 record with non-league 
victories over Bishop Montgomery and West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want these kids to want recognition just because they play for Mira 
Costa," Aldrich said. "Usually, just the name 'Mira Costa' is worth a couple of 
points a match. 
</P>
<P>
"But these girls have to set their own standards, and make their own mark. They 
have to earn their own right to that name."

FRIDAY'S TOP GAMES

PASADENA MUIR (1-1) VS. BANNING (0-1) 
</P>
<P>
Friday, 8 p.m. at Gardena 
</P>
<P>
It's all business this week for down-but-not-out Banning Coach Joe Dominguez, 
whose team has lost five consecutive games dating back to last season. Sources 
on the Banning campus say the Pilots are preparing for the Muir game with Super 
Bowl-like intensity. But Dominguez, who has blamed himself for Banning's fall 
from grace, needs more than enthusiasm from his players. After the Pilots were 
cited for 18 penalties totaling 164 yards in a 7-6 loss to Long Beach Poly last 
week, Dominguez needs better execution and discipline from his team. One bright 
spot in the opening-game loss was the 99-yard performance of running back 
Wendell Dumas. But the Pilots weren't able to generate a passing attack, mainly 
because of dropped passes. Even more disconcerting is the fact that Banning's 
veer offense, run by quarterback Anthony Nicholson, was unable to get into the 
end zone more than once. Muir is coming off a 14-7 loss to Fontana, the state's 
top-ranked team. In its opener, Muir beat Palmdale, 38-13, as quarterback 
Sedrick Thomas threw for 250 yards and ran for 50. Last season, Muir tied 
Banning in an early-season game in Pasadena and went on to tie for the 
CIF-Southern Section Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
WEST TORRANCE (2-0) VS. ROLLING HILLS (1-1) 
</P>
<P>
Friday, 3 p.m. at Rolling Hills 
</P>
<P>
West Co-Coach Mark Knox isn't surprised by his team's 29-point scoring average, 
despite the off-season transfer of quarterback John Walsh. "Our offensive line 
is doing a really good job, and we've got two veteran running backs in Alex 
Schultz and Roberto Bustamante," Knox said. Schultz leads the team with four 
touchdowns. Knox said the ground game will be a key for both teams. "Rolling 
Hills can hurt you with the pass, but basically they're like us -- they need to 
establish the run in order to control the ball," he said. Rolling Hills' two 
previous games, a 28-9 loss to Mary Star and a 41-0 win over Centennial, have 
been virtual opposites. "Mary Star is much better than Centennial, but we did 
improve a great deal (from week to week)," Rolling Hills Coach Gary Kimbrell 
said. "And we'll have to continue to improve at the same rate to have a chance 
against West. They'll be the best team we've played." Rolling Hills depends on 
running back Robert Coulter. He gained only 36 yards in the season-opening 
loss, but came back with 183 yards to key last week's win. Kimbrell hopes the 
Titans have a more balanced attack by the time league play starts. 
</P>
<P>
TORRANCE (1-1) VS. REDONDO (2-0) 
</P>
<P>
Friday, 7:30 p.m. at Redondo 
</P>
<P>
A Redondo victory will match last year's win total. Clearly, first-year Coach 
Chris Hyduke has already turned things around. Previously Redondo's defensive 
coordinator, Hyduke has the Sea Hawks swarming to the ball. They've given up 
single-digit scores in both games. But Hyduke said he's also had fun putting in 
a new offense, which is averaging 29.5 points. Big-play running back Anthony 
Curtis has scored a team-high three touchdowns. But Redondo, which has beaten 
Miraleste (1-1) and South (0-2), will face its toughest challenge. Torrance's 
offense has averaged 18.5 points a game, and the defense held Morningside to 
one offensive touchdown in a 13-12 victory a week ago. The Tartars are led by 
running back Carlos Hilliard, who has four touchdowns; and up-and-down 
quarterback Jason Kendall, who struggled last week until suddenly catching fire 
on the game-winning 77-yard drive in the fourth quarter. Kendall finished with 
116 yards on six-of-15 passing but threw for 60 yards on the decisive series. A 
physical team, Torrance hopes to wear down Redondo. "We're in good shape," 
Torrance Coach Rich Busia said. "We take a lot of pride in our conditioning. 
(Morningside) did move the ball on us the first half, but our defense got 
better as the game went on because of our strength and conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
RIALTO EISENHOWER (2-0) VS. HAWTHORNE (2-0) 
</P>
<P>
Friday, 7:30 p.m. at Hawthorne 
</P>
<P>
For weeks now, Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas has been talking about his team's 
murderous non-league schedule. And although Hawthorne has survived unscathed in 
the early going, the opponents keep getting tougher. Eisenhower, which competes 
in the tough Citrus Belt League, beat Long Beach Poly, 14-7, and Cajon, 44-19, 
in its first two games. Casillas saw Eisenhower play last week and was 
impressed. "They're a fine, well-balanced football team," he said. "They pass 
and run well, and we're going to have to play a whale of a ball game just to 
stay with them. They've got good team speed. They've got a big, tall kid at 
quarterback (Jason Davis). They just look awesome. They completely tore apart 
Cajon." Hawthorne, ranked seventh in The Times' Southern Section poll, beat 
Santa Ana, 20-17, last Thursday, and the team is better for the experience 
gained in the game, Casillas said. "It's a good sign for a team to rally late 
in the fourth quarter like we did," he said. Hawthorne quarterback Jamil 
Williams and wide receiver Tarrick Brock have connected on three touchdown 
passes totaling 99 yards in the first two games, accounting for almost half the 
team's season total of 40 points. Casillas acknowledged that the 
Williams-to-Brock combination has been crucial to Hawthorne's offense, although 
he said he wishes the Cougars didn't have to rely on it so heavily.

BOWMAN TO BRING TALENT HOME FOR PICKWICK SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: FORMER NATIONAL CHAMPION FROM VAN NUYS TO PERFORM IN BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Bowman and Todd Eldredge, winners of the past two U. S. national 
men's figure skating championships, are expected to participate in 
"Icetraveganza," a benefit show produced by the Los Angeles Figure Skating 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, Eldredge and several other of the club's international competitors will 
perform in shows Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Pickwick Ice Arena in 
Burbank. There will be no scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 23, will be returning to his old stomping grounds. He grew up in Van 
Nuys and trained with Coach Frank Carroll at Pickwick until last year when 
Carroll opened his own Ice Castles International Training Center near Lake 
Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge, 19, originally from Massachusetts, now trains in San Diego with Coach 
Richard Callaghan. Eldredge was the surprise winner of this year's national 
championships in Salt Lake City. Bowman, who was bothered by a back injury, 
placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Both skaters competed in August at the Goodwill Games in Seattle. Eldredge, 
coming off a fifth-place finish in the World Championships, placed third in the 
Goodwill Games behind world champion Kurt Browning of Canada and Viktor 
Petrenko of the Soviet Union. Bowman, who appeared out of shape, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the nation's top pairs team, also will perform. 
Sand, 26, from Thousand Oaks, and Kuchiki, 13, from Canoga Park, were second at 
the U.S. championships behind Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo. However, the 
gold medal-winning team split up to pursue singles careers soon after. 
</P>
<P>
Kuchiki's former partner, Richard Alexander, 21, from Simi Valley, will skate 
with his new partner, Tristen Vega, 16, from Torrance. Alexander and Vega 
joined forces a year ago and won the U.S. Juniors title only four months later. 
</P>
<P>
Other top names who will be appearing in the show include 1984 Olympian Tiffany 
Chin, 1988 Olympic bronze medalist Peter Oppegard and the Olympic Festival gold 
medal ice dancing team of Jeanne Miley and Michael Verlich. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds go to the club's Olympic and world competition fund with a portion 
donated to the fight against cerebral palsy.

BOWSER DECIDES TO RETURN TO CSUN BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The area underneath the basket at the Cal State Northridge gymnasium hasn't 
gotten any smaller, but it may well appear that way because The Incredible Bulk 
has returned. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Bowser, for three seasons the Matadors' pivotal player in the pivot, is 
back on the Northridge basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser, 6-foot-8, 300 pounds-and-counting, left the team a year ago -- before 
the 1989-90 season began -- citing "personal reasons." He averaged 10.7 points 
and six rebounds a game in three seasons after signing with Northridge out of 
Montclair Prep in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody made me leave and nobody made me come back," said Bowser, who attended 
classes at CSUN last year but did not compete in athletics. "I have one year 
left to play basketball and a whole life to coach and do other things. I guess 
in my mind I always knew I should finish it out." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bowser rejoined the Matadors for unsupervised afternoon workouts. 
"I'm happy to have him back," Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser's return takes on added importance because Northridge will be without 
6-7 forward Percy Fisher, the team's top newcomer as a freshman last season. 
Fisher, who became a top shot-blocker by season's end, is academically 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our most improved player and our top freshman off last year's 
ballclub," said Cassidy, whose team finished 12-15 in 1989-90, its last season 
on the Division II level. "It's a big blow." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is enrolled at Northridge and could regain his eligibility for the 
second semester and the majority of the basketball season. Until then, Bowser, 
among others, will attempt to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great thing," Cassidy said. "Here's a guy who didn't want to 
look back 10 years from now and wonder, 'What if . . . ' I'm happy. I've always 
been fond of Todd and I know he can help us. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very tough positioning people up, he draws fouls, he shoots well from the 
(free-throw) line, and despite his girth, he's always run the floor pretty 
well. He's going to help our ballclub, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
There's just one not-so-minor matter left to contend with: getting fit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in terrible shape," Cassidy said. "He's very strong because he's been 
pumping iron, but his cardiovascular system has not been conditioned for 
basketball. But he has such great work ethic that my greatest fear is he'll try 
to get it all done at once." 
</P>
<P>
Bowser, who in July married former CSUN volleyball player Franci Bowman, said 
that regaining playing shape is "going to be a helluva thing to do."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CLU FOOTBALL COACH CALLS DORM HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They say you can't go home again, but Joe Harper would sure like to do so. 
Harper, the Cal Lutheran football coach, has moved into a Thompson Hall dorm 
room on campus rather than try to sandwich the commute to his Arcadia home 
around his 15-hour work days. 
</P>
<P>
Harper has been attempting to sell his Arcadia home and move to Thousand Oaks, 
but he finds himself, at 54 years old, sharing a double with "roomie" Steve 
Spencer, an assistant basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Harper hasn't thrown a water balloon or short-sheeted Spencer, and no 
one has had to tell either coach to turn down his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
"Weekends get a little noisy, but that's no big deal," said Harper, who never 
lived in a dorm while he attended UCLA. "It's been a real different experience 
for me, but I'm enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson Hall houses numerous transfers, and coincidentally, Harper ended up 
next door to his daughter Kerri, a senior transfer from Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a big help to me," Harper said. "She does my laundry and stuff like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Harper is constantly available to his players, and he says "I have a 
greater appreciation for some of the things they do." 
</P>
<P>
Rapid recoveries: Two weeks ago at the Moorpark Cross-Country Invitational, 
Glendale's Hugo Allan Garcia took a wrong turn while leading and went 75 meters 
off the course. However, Garcia recovered to win and set a course record. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday at the Mira Costa Invitational, while leading with less than 200 
meters remaining, Garcia went 40 meters astray -- and again held on for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real confusing at the finish line last week, even the women's leader 
went the wrong way," Glendale Coach Ed Lopez said. "We're going to make sure he 
knows the way this week. We can't afford for him to get lost again." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will compete Friday at Arroyo Verde Park in Ventura in the first of 
three Western State Conference meets that will be used to determine the WSC 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Making good: Washington State quarterback Brad Gossen, formerly of Westlake 
High, rebounded from a poor performance against Wyoming to pass for 323 yards 
in a 50-36 loss to Brigham Young. Gossen completed 25 of 42 passes, including 
touchdowns of 49 and seven yards. . . 
</P>
<P>
Sean Burwell, formerly of Cleveland High, rushed for 126 yards in 22 carries in 
Oregon's 55-23 victory over Idaho. . . 
</P>
<P>
Russell White did some damage in California's 52-24 loss to Miami before he 
left the game with 12 minutes remaining in the first half because of a thigh 
injury. White returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter. 
The former Crespi High standout is expected to start Saturday against 
Washington State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Cornell Collier, a linebacker from Taft High, recovered two fumbles in 
the game and linebacker David Wilson, formerly of Reseda High, recovered a 
fumble and made five tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Long-distance serve: CSUN setter Beth Welch is not afraid to try new things. No 
wonder she volunteered when assistant coach Angela Brinton-Collins suggested 
that one player serve from 20 feet behind the service line to give opponents a 
different angle from which to handle a serve. 
</P>
<P>
Little did Welch know what she bargained for. Often, she is backed up against a 
wall or a water fountain. And fans have unwittingly cut across the court in 
front of her just as she was about to serve. 
</P>
<P>
The early returns have surpassed expectations, however. Welch has served up a 
team-high 37 aces, including seven against 15th-ranked USC on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Between the lines: Against Occidental on Saturday night, Whittier had more 
offensive snaps, 70-57; more first downs, 15-12; rushing yards, 109-96; and net 
yards, 212-211; . . . and 25 fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental won, 38-13. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin power: Eliazar Herrera and Richard Erbes, probably the top two high 
school distance runners from Glendale in the past five years, helped UCLA 
finish third in the Fresno Cross-Country Invitational on Saturday at Woodward 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who graduated from Hoover High in June, was the Bruins' No. 1 man, 
finishing fifth with a time of 25 minutes 20.1 seconds over the five-mile 
course. Erbes, a 1987 graduate of Glendale High, was UCLA's No. 4 runner, 
placing 29th in 25:57.6. 
</P>
<P>
Heads up: Soccer goals can be as rare as total eclipses, but in a 12-0 victory 
over La Verne on Monday, it was all Coach George Kuntz could do to keep his Cal 
Lutheran women from scoring more goals. 
</P>
<P>
He limited the number of times his players could touch the ball with their feet 
before they passed or kicked it, but Cal Lutheran nonetheless led, 8-0, at 
halftime. By the second half, the players could only touch the ball once. If 
they touched it and didn't shoot or pass it, they simply had to give up the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
The margin climbed, and when the score reached 12-0, Kuntz told his players 
they could only head the ball into the goal. At one point, Rachel Wackerman 
dribbled the ball away from the front of the goal and tried to pass it to a 
teammate for a header. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive blowout victory for a team in only its second 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our program is headed in the right direction," Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Theresa Munoz, John Ortega, Brendan Healey and Kirby Lee 
contributed to this notebook.

WSC VS. THE LONE STAR 
</P>
<P>
The Western Football and Lone Star are considered among the top Division II 
football conferences in the nation. Last season, the conferences split six 
games in head-to-head competition. But this season, the WFC has taken a big 
upper hand, winning all five contests. Cal State Northridge, which travels to 
Central (Okla.) State for a game on Saturday, will try to keep that record 
perfect.

UNLV'S TARKANIAN TO VISIT ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Tarkanian, Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach, will return to the Antelope 
Valley today for a visit, more than three decades after he coached the 1958 
Antelope Valley High basketball team to a 4-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
It was his only season at the school and his only losing season as a coach, but 
now he has plenty of reasons to return. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley College, the local junior college, has been nicknamed UNAV 
because of its ties to Tarkanian and the UNLV basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian will attend the college's basketball class/practice from 3 p.m. to 5 
p.m. and likely will have a Shark's eye on 6-foot-5 sophomore swingman J. R. 
Rider. 
</P>
<P>
Newton Chelette, Antelope Valley's basketball coach, is a former Tarkanian 
assistant, and Chelette sent his star player, former Taft High standout Dedan 
Thomas, to UNLV this season. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian's son George was hired last month as a political science teacher at 
Antelope Valley College. BRENDAN HEALEY

LOS ANGELES HEAT DESERVED BETTER NEWS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul McLeod's account of the Los Angeles Heat's game vs. San Francisco (Times, 
Sept. 9) must have been heavily edited. One of the most important aspects of 
the game was omitted: the superb penalty-kick save by Mike Littman on a shot by 
San Francisco's Townsend Qin. 
</P>
<P>
This was a game of very high standards played before 3,500 that was dismissed 
by The Times in a postscript the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
In a few short months, Bobby Sibbald has woven a championship-caliber team. So 
let us give credit to Sibbald and the Heat, who made it to the championship 
final, and hope they will continue to satisfy their growing core of fans in 
Torrance at El Camino Stadium, not at West Torrance High.

SOCIETY: MAGIC SPELL CAST OVER FUND-RAISER AT HAZARD CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wizards who regularly toil and trouble to raise funds for the UC San Diego 
Cancer Center promised supporters an evening of "Magic in Mission Valley" on 
Saturday, and delivered more than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
A group led by Anne Otterson and George Goudy built a sort of brick caldron on 
the grounds of the new Hazard Center, a 42-acre office, hotel and retail 
development on the site of the former Hazard Brickyard, and fortified the 
requisite, bubbling brew of eye of newt and toe of frog with Cajun popcorn, a 
performance by magician Harry Blackstone and unintended but astonishing 
lighting effects. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the spell cast over Friars Road and California 163 were potent 
and varied. Among them, the cancer center earned about $125,000, while former 
city councilman and perennial political candidate Michael Schaefer lost his 
shirt. The partners in the sprawling project, the Trammell Crow Co. and the 
R.E. Hazard Contracting Co., underwrote the expenses of the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans have become adept both at staging parties on parking lots and at 
attending them with sang-froid. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than 1,000 guests spent the evening in the two open-air ballrooms 
constructed on the Hazard Center's lots. In the first of these, dominated by a 
statue of Hazard Co. founder R.E. (Pappy) Hazard Jr. (the motto on the plinth 
advises "Be Just and Fear Not"), guests toured a double avenue of hors 
d'oeurves stations almost profligate in their offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nibbles were freshly prepared crab cakes, a vast assortment of 
Chinese stuffed dumplings, beignets of Brie and bacon, assorted shellfish and 
even Thai chicken curry. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Rubel and her husband, past cancer center President David Rubel, were 
among those exploring the gourmet possibilities; David explained that the 
fund-raiser was the result of a lunch he shared with contractor Bruce Hazard in 
early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hazard was on hand with his wife, Mary, and in-laws Jane and John Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the new kid on this block," he teased, since the brickyard was established 
more than 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight is our version of magic in Mission Valley, and I hope no-one goes home 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Hazard had little to fear. The dining room -- fronted both by a massive stage 
draped in black cloth and a pair of dance floors -- stretched out comfortably 
under the canopy of night, warmed by gas heaters that on this occasion proved 
redundant. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbles of glittery decorations and votive candles created suitably magical 
gardens in the centers of the tables. 
</P>
<P>
The civic ordinance that decrees the use of street lights that cast a yellow 
glow created one of "Magic in Mission Valley's" most startling illusions by 
draining everything -- faces, food and clothes -- of color. 
</P>
<P>
One well-known blonde woman pulled a mirror from her purse, grimaced and said, 
"I look like I've been exhumed! This is kind of like 'Night of the Living 
Dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the eerie light, the caprese salads of ripe, red tomatoes, sea-green "spoon 
leaf" lettuce and cream-colored buffalo mozzarella looked like photographic 
negatives, unearthly pastiches in black-and-white quite unlike anything anyone 
had ever seen on a plate. 
</P>
<P>
An unnamed hero earned one of the evening's more sustained rounds of applause 
by throwing a switch that cut off the lights and reduced the party to the more 
subtle illumination of candles and star-power. 
</P>
<P>
Magician Harry Blackstone, son of the Great Blackstone and a performing 
illusionist since the age of 7, followed on the heels of the beef tenderloin 
and chocolate-hazelnut mousse dinner. 
</P>
<P>
He found himself facing a surprisingly tough crowd, which he facetiously 
thanked on several occasions for its "under-whelming applause." Among his more 
noteworthy feats were sawing a chap in half and making half the audience 
disappear before the conclusion of the show. 
</P>
<P>
For his finale, Blackstone invited nine men on stage, and while performing card 
tricks with several managed a neat sleight-of-hand in which he yanked Michael 
Schaefer's shirt from his back, even though the latter's arms were at his side 
and his coat buttoned. The audience was impressed by that one. Dancing to the 
Bill Green Orchestra followed. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included many of Hazard's fellow builders and developers, 
including Ernest and Jean Hahn, George and Kathy Pardee and Donald and Toni 
Daley. 
</P>
<P>
Among others in attendance were acting cancer center director Dr. Gerard Burrow 
and his wife, Ann; UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson with his wife, Rita; Maury 
and Charmaine Kaplan; Neil and Joan Kline; Trammell Crow's Ron Nelson; Robert 
and Cheryl Rohde; Frank and Elsie Weston; John and Sally Thornton; Audrey 
Geisel; Karl and Barbara ZoBell; Robert and Joan Tukey; George and Alison 
Gildred; David and Dorothea Garfield; Elliot and Lynne Schulnik; Willis and 
Ruth Allen; Joe and Jane Baker; Rolf and Mary Benirschke; Dallas and Mary 
Clark; Lou and Jane Metzger; John and Ann Davies; Pat and Dottie Haggerty; Jack 
and Virginia Monday, and Blair and Georgia Sadler. 
</P>
<P>
Even though one of the bars at the Sept. 13 "Roller Coaster Rock 'n Roller" 
benefit at Belmont Park was located directly beneath the tracks of the Giant 
Dipper, no-one dropped in for a drink. 
</P>
<P>
However, quite a few of the 700 guests at the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation 
fund-raiser hobbled over to the bar after screaming and yelping through the 
plunges and high-speed turns of the coaster, which held its grand opening that 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Giant Dipper reopened after a 14-year hiatus, and a common comment among 
the native San Diegans in the crowd was that the coaster seemed quite a bit 
faster than when they were children. 
</P>
<P>
"I think age does that to you," admitted one. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn Kuerbis recalled a private party given during the wig craze of the early 
1970s; hers blew off in mid-ride and sent guests scrambling under the coaster 
in a mad search for her elusive hair. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Park developer Graham MacHutchin chaired the event and was joined by 
partner Paul Thoryk. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, it's great to see the center being used," said MacHutchin with a broad 
grin untinged by the faintest hint of facetiousness. "It's so electric with 
people in it!" 
</P>
<P>
Added Thoryk: "It is fun to see people here." 
</P>
<P>
(Thus far, the Mission Beach retail and amusement center has failed to draw 
crowds as sizeable as its backers anticipated.) 
</P>
<P>
MacHutchin added that he hoped to establish the coaster event, which raised 
about $35,000, as an annual benefit for CAPF. 
</P>
<P>
Besides riding the coaster and whirling more calmly on the carousel, guests 
posed for photographs with impersonators of such celebrities as Elizabeth 
Taylor and President George Bush and browsed buffets laden with food donated by 
32 restaurants and bakers. 
</P>
<P>
The table nearest the Giant Dipper offered chocolate chip cookies, but not a 
single individual took advantage of the rather obvious opportunity to toss his 
cookies from the coaster. 
</P>
<P>
Four major groups -- the Coasters, the Nostalgics, the Legends and Ricky Nelson 
look-alike Gary Schorelle and his band -- took turns on the stage and kept the 
dance floor hopping. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance included Valerie Preiss with Harry Cooper, Barry McComic, 
Kathryn and Michael Murphy, Vicki and Scott Carstens, Kathleen and Colin 
Haggerty, Lisa Butterbrot with Bill Waite, CAPF President Norma Hirsh with her 
husband, Gary; Melanie Cohrs; Jeannette Day; Joy and Jim Furby; Gloria Penner 
and Bill Snyder; Diane Larson; Charlotte Kobey; Myra and Bruce Beare and Roger 
and Cindy Hedgecock.

DEAR SOS: I have searched for a Veal Oscar recipe and have not been successful. 
I would appreciate it if you could help. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MS. L.M.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MS. L.M.F.: It's not difficult to create Veal Oscar, basically a layered 
dish of veal cutlet, crab meat, asparagus spears and Sauce Bearnaise. It was a 
favorite on a lot of menus when Continental restaurants were big from the 1930s 
through the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
VEAL OSCAR 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter or margarine 
</P>

Saute cutlets 5 to 10 minutes, turning to brown both sides. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Add wine, cover and simmer 20 minutes or until tender. 
</P>
<P>
Saute crab meat in remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet, 3 to 4 
minutes. Arrange veal cutlets on serving dishes. Place equal portions crab meat 
over cutlets. 
</P>
<P>
Pour veal cooking liquid into crab skillet and boil rapidly until reduced to 
1/4 cup. Spoon over crab meat. Add 3 asparagus spears to each serving. Drizzle 
with Sauce Bearnaise and serve remaining sauce on side. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Sauce Bearnaise 
</P>

A PLACE TO TASTE TREE CAKES; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THE LITHUANIAN FAIR, THIS WEEKEND IN THE LOS FELIZ AREA, FEATURES THE 
GOOD FOOD AND FINE CRAFTS OF THE TINY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Yes, you've heard the call for freedom from little Lithuania, the 
once-independent republic that was annexed as one of the 15 Soviet Socialist 
Republics at the end of World War II. Still, you probably couldn't locate it on 
a map and you surely don't know what the people there eat. 
</P>
<P>
You can change all that with a visit to the Lithuanian Fair this weekend at St. 
Casimir's Church, 2716 St. George St., in the Los Feliz area. 
</P>
<P>
"We want especially to acquaint Americans with our culture through these 
events," says Gene Plukas, a recent immigrant who is an accountant and 
sometime-caterer known for the quality of her tree cakes and other Lithuanian 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 10,000 Lithuanians in Southern California many of whom maintain 
their traditions through publications, a language school and cultural and 
social events held by an organization called the Lithuanian-American Community. 
</P>
<P>
For the fair, Plukas and other members of the L.A.C. will prepare Cepelinai, 
mashed potato dumplings known as "potato Zeppelins." Good cooks use "old" 
potatoes, which contain the higher starch levels needed to keep the dumplings 
from falling apart when they are boiled. In the absence of "old" potatoes, 
which are hard to find in markets here (although the potatoes can be aged at 
home), cooks coat the dumplings heavily with flour to seal them before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
The huge dumplings are usually served with the sort of homemade Lithuanian 
sausages and sauerkraut that will also be available at the fair. "These dishes 
are great for people who live and work in a cold climate, like Lithuania," 
Plukas said. "They are a bit heavy for sunny California, but still interesting 
and very tasty." 
</P>
<P>
You'll find several other kinds of dumplings at the fair as well. There is the 
lighter potato souffle called kugelis -- made with raw potatoes, flour and eggs 
-- and Koldunai, a crescent-shaped won-ton-type dumpling filled with lamb, beef 
or cheese and eaten with a dollop of sour cream and melted butter. 
</P>
<P>
Soups are another important staple of Lithuanian life. At the fair you'll find 
a warm weather soup called saltibarscai -- a cold beet soup made with 
cucumbers, dill weed, green onion, eggs and buttermilk, that is eaten with 
boiled potatoes on the side. In winter, the soup is served hot. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every Eastern European country boasts its own style of cabbage roll. In 
Lithuania, the roll is called balandelai and is stuffed with meat and rice and 
served with boiled potatoes. In fact, there is hardly an entree that does not 
come with boiled potatoes, a staple in the Lithuanian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanians are proud of their desserts. Good cooks at the fair will show off 
their skills in a bake-off of traditional Lithuanian sweets: cookies (grybai), 
cookie twists (zagarelai) and the formidable multilayered Napoleon, made with 
puff pastry, cream and nuts. Just watching the Napoleon being prepared will 
make the trip worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Another spectacular cake worth noting is the "tree cake," which is cooked at 
the side of an open fire for five hours in an upright position and turned 
often. Little branches form on the trunk. The cake lasts up to half a year and 
feeds 60 persons. All of these pastries will be sold at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
And for thirsty visitors, there will be the national favorite, gyra, a 
refreshing and healthful drink made with black bread, yeast, sugar and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
The fair also features art displays and typical Lithuanian crafts, among them 
prized amber jewelry. There will also be continuous folk music, dancing, sports 
competitions, and fortune telling. Admission is $5; free for children younger 
than 12. For further information about the fair call, (213) 666-7593 or (714) 
540-0942. 
</P>
<P>
LITHUANIAN POTATO ZEPPELINS 
</P>
<P>
(Cepelinai) 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1 small onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
7 medium Russet potatoes, preferably old 
</P>
<P>
3 small cooked Russet potatoes, preferably old 
</P>
<P>
Flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound bacon, diced and crisp-cooked 
</P>
<P>
Melted butter, optional 
</P>
<P>
Sour cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
Combine beef, onion and allspice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Peel and grate raw potatoes. Strain through cheesecloth to remove any excess 
liquid; do not squeeze. Add mashed boiled potatoes and mix well. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch off 2-inch portion from potatoes. Flatten with heel of hand and top with 
1 tablespoon meat mixture. Fold potato over meat filling and shape into 
torpedo-shaped dumpling. Roll generously in enough flour to coat dumpling 
completely. Repeat with remaining potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Bring salted water in 2-gallon pot to rolling boil. Reduce heat to simmer. Drop 
dumplings into gently simmering water and poach 25 to 30 minutes, stirring 
occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove with slotted spoon. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle crisp bacon pieces over dumplings. Serve with melted butter or sour 
cream, if sauce is desired. Makes about 30 dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Old Russet potatoes, which are starchy, are needed in this recipe to hold 
potato dumplings together. 
</P>
<P>
MEAT DUMPLINGS 
</P>

<P>
4 strips bacon, diced and crisp-cooked 
</P>
<P>
Chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
Sour cream for topping 
</P>
<P>
In large bowl combine egg, oil, salt and 1/2 cup water. Add flour and knead 
until smooth. Let dough stand 1 hour. Melt butter in small skillet and saute 
onion until tender. Remove from skillet and add to ground beef with bouillon, 
allspice, salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough into 6 portions. Roll out about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into circles, 
using 2 1/2-inch cookie cutters. Place about 1 teaspoon ground meat mixture 
onto center of each dough circle. Fold each circle in half and seal edges well. 
</P>
<P>
Bring salted water in 2-gallon pot to rolling boil. Reduce heat to gentle 
simmer. Drop dumplings into simmering water, stirring to prevent sticking. Boil 
about 5 to 10 minutes or until dumplings start to rise to surface. Remove with 
slotted spoon. Serve topped with crisp bacon, onion or sour cream. Makes 5 
dozen. 
</P>
<P>

ABOUT WINE: CHARDONNAY BURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people hit an age in life when they experience midlife crisis; mine 
appears to be taking the form of Chardonnay burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Chardonnay may be considered California's greatest white wine, but I'm bored 
with the whole idea. Wine makers don't seem interested in making a Chardonnay 
that tastes like wine; these days, Chardonnay has to be big, rich, bold -- a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Each year as the new Chardonnays hit the market, I sample as many as I can get. 
I judge them in major wine competitions. And I see more and more of the same 
thing: fat, oaky, overdone flavors; flabby, sweet, thin, innocuous tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Chardonnay is made from grapes. Yet instead of grapes these days, I frequently 
taste the oak barrel it's fermented in. Some wineries like to trumpet the fact 
that they make "buttery" Chardonnays. Since when does the Chardonnay grape 
yield a buttery aroma or taste? 
</P>
<P>
I attended a tasting not long ago where a couple of dozen young Chardonnays 
were poured blind. So many of these wines were sweet, with noticeable residual 
sugar, that I can't imagine people putting them on a table with food. 
</P>
<P>
One wine that was dry (hooray!) smelled more like refermenting apple juice and 
tasted of sour well water. Another had an aroma akin to paper; a third was more 
like Riesling than Chardonnay. A number of these wines sell for more than $20 a 
bottle, but they were dull and uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
I've watched others drink these wines and heard them say, "give it time in the 
bottle; it'll be better." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, and the Cubs will win the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago I tasted 60 older Chardonnays dating back to 1980 -- not 
particularly a long time ago. Just a tiny handful of the wines we sampled were 
still alive and kicking. The rest, in the words of John Cleese, were deceased, 
bereft of life, pushing up daisies, and had gone to join the choir invisible. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, restaurants in the major cities grew up. We discovered arugula 
and radicchio, tapenade and peanut sauce, wild mushrooms and southwestern 
chiles, nouvelle and California cuisines, baby vegetables, Southern cooking 
with black-eyed peas and grits, and Oriental spices. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter what they ate, people ordered Chardonnay. Semillon or sparkling 
wine would go better with lots of these foods, and so would a half dozen 
others: dry German or Washington State Rieslings, Pinot Grigio or Arneis from 
Italy, or Semillon from Australia. Thai food and sausages scream out for dry 
Riesling or Gewurztraminer, yet in places where these foods are served, we are 
offered Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Americans don't lack adventurousness when they are dining. Only when they are 
drinking wine. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that Chardonnay became as popular as it is partly because it is the 
"safe" choice for diners who don't know enough to comfortably order a Mercury 
Blanc, a Sancerre or an Arneis. In the 1960s and 1970s, the "call" wine was 
Pouilly-Fuisse, and people were proud to be able to pronounce it. Those same 
people wouldn't dream of ordering it today -- they've moved on to Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
For a white table wine to go with dinner, we needn't spend a small fortune for 
a wine that can be such a crap shoot. Consider Sauvignon Blanc as an 
alternative to Chardonnay. A group of 35 wineries is doing just that. They have 
banded together in the Society of Blancs (SOBs) to promote the variety. Their 
goal: to bring newcomers to wine into the Sauvignon Blanc camp. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? The wine's benefits are obvious: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the last five years or so, Californians have made Sauvignon Blanc with 
more style and less of the vegetative character that once dominated the wines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They are far cheaper: The most expensive Sauvignon Blancs run little more 
than $10, and most are in the $7 to $9 range. Compare this with Chardonnay 
selling for $15 to $17. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alcohols are typically lower, in the 12% to 13% range; Chardonnays usually 
have more alcohol, a consideration when matching wine with food. (Spicy food 
tastes even spicier with high-alcohol wines.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sauvignon Blanc is available in a wider range of styles: some with oak, 
some without; some with a trace of sugar, others without; some grassy, some 
like a French Graves. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent series of tastings, I loved the 1989 Sauvignon Blancs from Louis 
Martini and Raymond (both sell for about $7.50 a bottle and are discounted). 
</P>
<P>
Another stunner is 1989 Greenwood Ridge from Mendocino County ($7.50), an 
exotic wine with a spice element I have rarely seen in Sauvignon Blanc. It won 
five gold medals at major wine competitions this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other 1989 Sauvignon Blancs or Fume Blancs I have liked this year are Preston 
Reserve, $12, and Robert Pecota, $9.25, both creamier and richer than typical 
Loire styles; Buena Vista Lake County, $8.50, and Kenwood, $9.50, both slightly 
sweet; White Oak, $8, with a mild hay aroma; De Loach Fume Blanc, $9, a spicy, 
lemony wine; Adler Fels, $9.50; and Dry Creek, $9.25, superb grassy styles; 
Clos Pegase, $9.50, with a Loire and spice character; Ferrari-Carano, $9, and 
Iron Horse, $11, leaning more on a lemon grass aroma; Markham, $7, and Matanzas 
Creek, $11, accenting melons and pears.

WINE NOTES: PANEL SEEKS TO SIMPLIFY INTERSTATE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A national task force on the wine industry last week considered various rule 
changes that would make uniform the laws to simplify the sale of wine from 
state to state. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the Task Force on the Wine Industry of the National Conference of 
State Legislatures (NCSL) is to reduce trade barriers for wine and come up with 
universal standards that would make selling wine from one state to the next as 
easy as it is for a U.S. producer to sell wine overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Task Force includes 33 states who have said they would like to smooth out 
the trade barriers to wine that are permitted under the 21st Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
California Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese, chairman of the task force, said 
NCSL's joint committee (which includes the National Conference of State Liquor 
Administrators, the National Alcohol Beverage Control Assn., and the Federation 
of Tax Administrators) met to look over proposals that would standardize 
license applications and reporting forms to eliminate duplication and 
inconsistencies between state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will meet again later this year to discuss the various 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Cortese said, there are two different types of state alcoholic 
beverage control setups -- one for control states (where alcoholic beverages 
are sold at retail through state stores) and one for license states, where 
stores are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see if we can find language and forms that everyone can agree 
on," said a spokesman for Cortese. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, said Cortese, the present system sets up a scenario where the 
various states operate like foreign countries with one another in respect to 
wine sales. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations attempt to deal with the barriers created in 1933 by 
passage of the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition, when the states were 
permitted to control the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
"Complying with the staggering array of state and federal regulations tests the 
stamina of every American wine producer," said Cortese (D-San Jose), who is 
also chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on California Wine Production 
and Economy. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 21st Amendment told the states they could make their own licensed 
beverage laws, the federal government would not be involved in much of what the 
wine task force hopes to accomplish, Cortese said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, noting that 43 states make wine from the grapes produced by 
8,000 grape growers, said the wine industry "is one of the most heavily 
regulated industries in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"As a grower of grapes, the wine producer is subject to all agricultural 
regulation. As a producer of wine he or she is subject to alcohol regulation at 
both the federal and state level," said the task force report. 
</P>
<P>
"Each state has its own comprehensive set of regulations. Each state has its 
own bewildering laws regarding wine, and no two states have the same laws. The 
federal government has its own comprehensive set of regulations. As a result, 
wine is one of the few products where interstate sales are spoken of in terms 
of 'import' and 'export.' " 
</P>
<P>
The trade barriers between the states, said the task force, "are bad for 
business and employment. They steal the competitive edge and ultimately are bad 
for the state and national economies . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The task force urged the adoption of interstate reciprocal shipping agreements 
to "allow any consumer, winery, or licensee to ship up to two cases of wine to 
relatives or friends in another state if both states have reciprocity." Such 
laws already have been passed by California, Colorado, Wisconsin, Oregon and 
New Mexico and a similar "reciprocity law" is being considered by other states. 
</P>
<P>
The task force further recommended that agreements permit the shipping of wine 
through the various states like "any package, with no other restrictions or 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations asked the states to adopt the standards of the uniform 
labeling requirements of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
(BATF). 
</P>
<P>
All labels on alcoholic beverages must be approved by BATF, but in some states 
these federally approved labels must be submitted back to a state agency for 
further approval, under varying different regulations. The task force said that 
instead, the states should simply accept BATF's labeling procedures -- 
standards similar to those required by the European Economic Community. 
</P>
<P>
The states should adopt standardized forms for application and permit systems 
and eliminate the requirement to notarize forms, said the group. There's no 
rational reason for vintners to be forced to leave their wineries to drive to 
the nearest city to find a notary public, they said. "This is a waste of time, 
effort and money," they said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when (Europe) is on the verge of becoming 'one nation' in 1992, the 
United States is still '50 nations' when it comes to wine . . . . While the 
Europeans have sought uniformity in their regulation of wine, we have not . . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
1989 Newlan Napa-Villages ($7) -- The word Villages often appears on Beaujolais 
Villages, from the French region that produces the lightest, most quaffable red 
wines of the Burgundy district. Newlan in the Napa Valley has made a 
Beaujolais-type wine from 80% Pinot Noir and the rest Gamay and Petite Sirah. 
It is a rich, spicy wine with plenty of raspberry/strawberry fruit, takes a 
chilling and can be enjoyed with a wide variety of foods.

NEW DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH VOTED FOR CENTRAL L.B. 
</P>

<P>
The central part of the city finally has its field of dreams. This week the 
City Council approved a zoning change that has transformed a weedy two-acre lot 
into a second ballfield for Martin Luther King Jr. Park. 
</P>
<P>
Next spring the new diamond will be the home field for the area's first Little 
League team. Children are already playing ball -- and dreaming -- on the 
freshly seeded field. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I'm going to get me a trophy," vowed Eric Gathrite, 9. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion adds badly needed space to the impoverished central part of town, 
which has few parks even though half of the city's children live there, 
according to figures provided by the school district. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said many of those children live in the Anaheim Corridor, a 
gritty area of ethnic neighborhoods and shops that stretches from Willow Street 
in the north to Seventh Street in the south, and from Redondo Avenue on the 
east and Pacific Avenue to the west. Just three of the city's 42 parks -- King, 
MacArthur and California Recreation Center -- are in the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
These parks are among the city's smallest, with parched and trash-littered 
grass, few large trees, no tennis courts and crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's parkland is in the east part of town, near middle-class and 
well-to-do neighborhoods such as Park Estates and Los Altos. These parks have 
duck ponds and tennis courts and shady picnic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"They got it made over there," said Kristina Bermudez, 17, sweating under the 
sun last weekend at MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Like many cities across California, Long Beach finds itself with a changing 
population whose needs no longer fit the city's design. The city runs five 
municipal golf courses, for example but has few soccer fields popular among 
Latinos, now at least a quarter of the city's population, according to city 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody sees a crying need for more space and activities for youngsters in 
that area," Kelton Reese, bureau manager for Recreation Services, a unit of the 
Department of Parks and Recreation, said about the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Planners have seen the need for some time. In 1986, the city's Strategic Plan 
called for building more parks and a sports complex. That plan, some park 
officials said, was forgotten as the city struggled with a 17% population rise 
in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not prepared for the numbers of people," one park official said. "We 
were in disarray." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new arrivals settled in the older parts of town, built before 
planners worried about open space, department director Ralph Cryder said. Now, 
Cryder said, there is not enough money to remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics, including park employees, say what money there is is not 
being allocated fairly. A department report describes "inequities in the 
distribution of general fund support for recreation programs and facilities in 
different parts of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Green space is so scarce in central Long Beach that people fight over it, said 
Andrew Munoz, the head of Long Beach's chapter of League of United Latin 
American Citizens. And many ethnic groups refuse to use parks they believe are 
dominated by rival ethnic groups, which in Central Long Beach include Latinos, 
Cambodians and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Before the second baseball field was built at King Park, a staff member there 
said, there were "nasty" fights over who got to use the existing field. 
</P>
<P>
On a scorching Sunday earlier this month, MacArthur Park was deserted except 
for a couple of Cambodian children and their uncle. Von Pen, 23, said many 
children must play on streets in front of their homes because the parks are too 
"dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Where does Savoeun Pen, 6, play? "Inside the house" because of "gangsters," she 
said, whispering. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure on central city parks has increased with the start of year-round 
schools and the subsequent need to extend "summer" park programs. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent study requested by Councilman Clarence Smith found that parks are 
low on the list of where children play. Just 12.4% of 3,000 children surveyed 
went to parks, fewer than those who played with friends, watched TV or went to 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? "Probably because we're not giving them anything to do," said one 
park official, who added that the city has just given the three central parks 
$43,000 to extend recreation hours. 
</P>
<P>
The concern is hard-nosed and practical, not sentimental, officials said: If 
parks keep kids off the streets and out of gangs, crime may go down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more concerned with treating the symptoms in this city than treating 
the cause of problems," said Smith, who contends that his colleagues are more 
concerned about bolstering police than parks. 
</P>
<P>
Some park officials call for the department to take on a dramatically expanded 
role. "We can no longer be just about getting bats and balls," Reese said. "We 
have to become catalysts in getting communities organized."

WHEN EIGHT IS JUST ENOUGH;

<P>
SPORTS: PIONEER BAPTIST HIGH IS SO SMALL THAT IT HAS TROUBLE FIELDING A 
FOOTBALL TEAM. BUT THE PATRIOTS KEEP PLAYING TO WIN IN THE CIF'S EIGHT-MAN 
DIVISION. 
</P>

<P>
Little Pioneer Baptist High School had only eight players for its opening 
football game. Fortunately, the Patriots play in the CIF's eight-man division. 
</P>
<P>
Without rest, those iron men from Norwalk lost, 20-7, to Pilgrim of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a day before their second game, Coach Manuel Cortez was hoping not 
so much for a victory, but that he could fill 14 jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these kids maybe couldn't play at a big public school on the varsity 
level, but they get a chance to play here," Cortez said. "We're trying to 
stress more the attitude than the victories. I'm not going to get fired if we 
go 0 and 9." 
</P>
<P>
He was in Excelsior High School stadium in Norwalk, a few miles from Pioneer 
Baptist, watching practice -- if it could have been called a practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We get freshmen out here to hold blocking bags so it almost looks like we have 
defenders," Cortez said. "It's not easy to have tackling practice with so few 
guys. We've had it one time." 
</P>
<P>
Cortez was worse off at the end of last season when, because of injuries and 
players quitting, he was down to six men and had to add two students who had 
never played football. The Patriots were 5-4 in 1989, their second winning year 
in their six-season history. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-man teams, fielded by 45 CIF Southern Section schools with an average 
enrollment of about 140, have a center, two guards, two ends, a quarterback and 
two other backs. Games are played on an 80-yard field that is also narrower 
than a regulation field. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez, 27, an Air Force sergeant who lives in Riverside, has been the unpaid, 
volunteer coach of the Patriots the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez is strict. He kicked a player off the team last year for devoting more 
time to his girlfriend than to the team. "If they break rules, they're going to 
pay for it," Cortez said. "I try not to let them get away with anything. That's 
the hardest part about having only a few kids. They think that if they do 
something they can usually get away with it because we have got to use them." 
</P>
<P>
He said his team's attitude has improved over that of previous years when 
players fought with opponents and many quit because they wanted to play only in 
games and not practice. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Baptist, which has 41 students in grades 10 through 12 and has pupils 
as young as 4, is a close-knit school with a family environment. Cortez's wife, 
Deanna, is the head of the cheerleaders. His father-in-law is Principal Lee 
Fitzgerald, whose son, Darrin, is Cortez's assistant and a seventh-grade 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Fitzgerald explained why the Patriots play football at all: "We do it for 
the kids, to give them an outlet. They see other kids playing, they want to 
play too. We feel if we can afford uniforms and insurance, we'll let them play. 
And it's part of a well-balanced education." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old school also has varsity boys basketball and baseball and 
varsity girls volleyball, basketball and softball. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get much recognition here," said 6-foot-2, 255-pound guard Bob 
Barnard, whose goal is to become All-CIF. Barnard was at Santa Fe High School 
as a freshman, but transferred to Pioneer Baptist, he said, because "I was 
getting away from the Lord over there." 
</P>
<P>
Barnard is one of two or three players on the team who Cortez said could play 
at a big school. "The kids here have only a basic understanding of the game," 
Cortez said. "We try to make plays very simple, but still they sometimes 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
The team's top offensive threat is senior tailback Elliot Merrick, a 
Huckleberry Finn look-alike who a few years ago was the water boy. "This is a 
lot more fun than 11-man, a lot more action, not so crowded," said Merrick, who 
hopes his future lies in the ROTC program at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Kevin Mullins, who has been at Pioneer Baptist since the 
second grade, is trying to overcome the rookie nerves that affected him last 
year. "If he can hold up, this might be our first year in the playoffs," Cortez 
said. But the coach admitted that Mullins is not a passer, and without a 
passer, it is hard to win in eight-man. 
</P>
<P>
But the quarterback remains enthusiastic. "It's awesome," Mullins said when 
asked what playing at Pioneer Baptist was like. "The coaches work with you 
one-on-one. Everybody from school goes to the games -- cheerleaders, pep club, 
all that. Teachers come and support us." 
</P>
<P>
Cortez said he finds the situation trying, however. Unlike some coaches at 
large schools, he has more to worry about than his players' times in the 
40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to line the field, make sure we get all the balls in, make sure we get 
everything done," Cortez said. "Our equipment is old. We have plenty of helmets 
but they're all small. Next year we should be getting more money for our 
football program." 
</P>
<P>
The coach, who played at Temple Christian in La Puente, said he keeps plodding 
because football once kept him in line. "I can do the same thing for these 
kids," he said. "You keep encouraging them and keep 'em out here, they're going 
to stay out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday morning, the Patriots, wearing their black jerseys over shirts and 
ties, snacked on Pepsi and chips with fellow students outside a cross-adorned 
classroom building that once was a church. The concrete schoolyard allowed 
little room for mingling, but since the students numbered barely a handful, it 
was sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Within sight of the soda machine, a sign read: "But be ye doers of the word and 
not hearers only, deceiving your own selves." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a passive approach that Merrick was taking toward the night's game. 
"We're going to run all over 'em," he predicted. "Nobody can stop me." 
</P>
<P>
When the bell rang, the players tried to put thoughts about the game aside for 
a few hours. Barnard pulled an English book from one of the lockers that flank 
the front entrance and went inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Get pumped, dude. Let's kill those guys," Mullins said to Merrick as the 
Patriots arrived in cars and pickup trucks at their home field at Excelsior for 
the game with Antelope Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
There was no trainer, so Cortez taped ankles in the locker room. The players 
struggled into pads and pulled on black pants with red and white stripes. Kevin 
Ballinger said his pregame meal consisted of two egg salad sandwiches and a 
bowl of soup. Barnard put in a red mouthpiece, Merrick swallowed Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Patriots suited up, but a few were ineligible freshmen who had not yet 
turned 15. Warming up, the team did not look well prepared. They had "student 
body left" down well, but Mullins got confused executing "split left, bootleg 
left." 
</P>
<P>
"You're going the wrong way, Kevin," Cortez said. 
</P>
<P>
The dissatisfied coach led the players back to the locker area, into a room too 
small to hold any team but this one. He closed the door and said loudly, "I 
will not put up with guys joking around. Is that understood?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," came the answer in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez went on: "You can't go out there using language that some of you used at 
the last game. You are a Christian school. And I don't want you looking around 
(in the stands) to see who's here." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Antelope Valley Christian, with three times as many players, 
had arrived by bus. 
</P>
<P>
The game started favorably for the 75 home fans when Ballinger recovered a 
fumble on the opening kickoff. Then Barnard lumbered on a guard-around play to 
the Antelope Valley 12-yard line. Rooting for him was his girlfriend, Carrie 
Hancock, one of two girls in the senior class, who spun in the new black 
uniform with the sailor collar that the cheerleaders wore. 
</P>
<P>
But Mullins lost a yard on a fumble, which forced the Patriots to try a field 
goal. A bad snap from center botched the effort. 
</P>
<P>
It took Antelope Valley almost all of the first quarter to score, but after 
that they were unstoppable. Time and again, a receiver would get behind the 
Patriot defense and catch a long pass. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez had said the day before the team has never had a good cornerback, and it 
was still true. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots also had no passing attack, and repeated thrusts up the middle by 
Merrick -- who was being photographed from the sidelines by his father, Steve 
-- were stopped after little or no gain. 
</P>
<P>
And the fierce tackling that the coaches had hoped for was lacking. Cortez had 
said last Thursday that the players are told to hit opponents as hard as they 
can and then, in the Christian manner, help them up. 
</P>
<P>
It was 32-0 at the half and, worse, guard Joey Bonar was wincing on the bench 
with an ice bag on his knee, and Mullins had been grounded by a blow to the 
groin. A towel near them read, "Jesus is the only way." 
</P>
<P>
"This is one night I'm glad I'm not wearing school colors," said the other 
senior girl, Stephanie Crowther, who was on the sidelines showing Merrick's 
father a letter she had received from Stanford University expressing interest 
in her as a prospective student. 
</P>
<P>
There was no band to play as the Patriots sprawled dispiritedly on the end 
zone's damp grass at halftime, worn down from having to play both offense and 
defense. The consensus seemed to be that the opponent's middle linebacker was 
killing them. "Bobby, you've got to lead these guys," Fitzgerald said to 
Barnard. 
</P>
<P>
But no moment of redemption occurred. Mullins returned to action but Bonar did 
not. Still, Pioneer Baptist always managed to put eight men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley kept passing, which irritated Cortez. "This is one of the worst 
things about eight-man football," he said after the score reached 38-0. 
"Coaches try to run up the score to get up in the polls." 
</P>
<P>
When another TD and 2-point conversion had made it 46-0 with 2:48 left in the 
third quarter, the referees, invoking the mercy rule, called the game because 
the lead was so large. Antelope Valley celebrated as if it had just won the CIF 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry about it, it's not the end of the world," Cortez told his players 
after they shook hands with the Eagles. "Don't feel ashamed of anything. They 
kept their starters in the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Barnard took the blame. "I don't think any of us, counting me, gave 100%," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald did not want the team to sag under the burden of an 0-2 record. "If 
you're proud you're out there playing, then you're not losers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Patriots looked as if they could not wait for the next game. 
Cheerleaders and parents walked out to meet them, to slap shoulders and offer 
words of comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"You OK?" Barnard's girlfriend asked him. 
</P>
<P>
They were all OK because, though this had been only an eight-man game, it was 
still high school football, with fans in the stands, under the lights on a 
Friday night. They would never forget it, much to the satisfaction of Cortez, a 
lone figure collecting yard markers from the field long after everyone else had 
left.

Rep. Glenn M. Anderson's opponent in the Nov. 6 election is charging that the 
11-term congressman improperly intervened in the chartering of a national bank 
whose organizers included Lee Anderson, the lawmaker's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson (D-San Pedro) denies that he acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a telephone call the congressman or an aide placed to the federal 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency shortly after the agency, in early 
1986, rejected an application by organizers of the Rancho Dominguez Bank of 
Carson for a federal charter. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers submitted a revised application in October, 1986, and won 
approval from the comptroller's office in January, 1987, agency records show. 
The bank opened for business on March 31, 1989, with Lee Anderson as chairman 
of the board. 
</P>
<P>
"Anderson was intervening on his wife's behalf, and, hey, that's not right," 
Republican Sanford Kahn said. "I do not know whether this violates the law . . 
. but it's morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn is making his second bid to unseat Anderson in the 32nd Congressional 
District, which includes Lakewood, parts of Long Beach, Hawaiian Gardens, 
Bellflower, Downey, San Pedro and Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anderson acknowledged that a telephone call from his office was made to 
the comptroller's office but he denied any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
"We get lots of calls from people who have problems with government agencies . 
. and we often call the federal agencies and see what the situation is," 
Anderson said. "I wouldn't have done it if I had thought it was improper." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he does not remember whether he or an aide made the call, when it 
occurred or the name of the official contacted. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the comptroller's office said last week that his agency 
received a telephone call from Anderson's office about the bank charter 
application, but he could not determine the exact date or content of the call, 
or whether it was made directly by the congressman. Another official said 
Anderson's call had no influence on the agency's handling of the application. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Anderson said last week that her husband, at her urging, contacted the 
comptroller's office -- but only, she said, to ask when the agency would 
respond to an inquiry by her group about its efforts to secure a charter. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets these kinds of responses constantly for constituents," she said. "It 
just so happens that he's married to this one. If (Kahn) is making a case of 
this, then he could make a case of every time a congressman picks up the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
Two current Rancho Dominguez directors interviewed last week supported Lee 
Anderson's account. But two other participants in the bank's formation said 
they were led by Lee Anderson to believe that the congressman's efforts on 
behalf of the bank went beyond a mere inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The Andersons own more than $250,000 worth of stock in Rancho Dominguez, 
according to a joint 1989 financial disclosure statement Rep. Anderson filed 
with the federal government. Bank records show that when the institution 
opened, Lee Anderson was one of the bank's largest shareholders, with 9.61% of 
its stock. She receives no salary as chairman, said Melinda Briggs, the bank's 
acting president. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Dominguez organizers first applied to form a national bank on Aug. 6, 
1985, according to the comptroller's office. The application was turned down 
April 1, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection cited "weaknesses in the market analysis and operating plan" as 
the primary reasons for denial. 
</P>
<P>
Among deficiencies listed by the agency were outdated information on economic 
activity in the Carson area, overly optimistic income and expense projections, 
and a lack of details on how the bank would attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
Bank organizers then wrote the comptroller's office on April 25, 1986, 
addressing the deficiencies, but they did not get what they considered a timely 
reply, correspondence shows. 
</P>
<P>
The step taken next -- Anderson's call to the comptroller's office -- is what 
has prompted Kahn's charge. 
</P>
<P>
Frank De Santis, then the official spokesman for the Rancho Dominguez group and 
now a director of the bank, made specific mention of Anderson's call in a July 
24, 1986, letter to the comptroller's office. 
</P>
<P>
Addressed to Ballard Gilmore, director of the bank organization and structure 
division in Washington, the letter refers to Anderson's attempt to find out 
when the group's April 25 letter would be answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Glenn Anderson spoke with you regarding the timing of a response 
to our transmittal dated April 25, 1986," De Santis' letter says. "He indicated 
that your office would have a response by June 27, 1986." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Rancho Dominguez organizers met with officials in the comptroller's 
San Francisco office in August, 1986, to discuss getting their charter efforts 
back on track. Two months later, the group reapplied for a charter. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Anderson did more for the bank group than he would have 
done for other constituents in his district. 
</P>
<P>
House rules permit members to contact federal agencies on behalf of 
constituents to express their opinion on an issue, request information and 
status reports, and urge prompt consideration, among other purposes, according 
to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee has said the service should be made available to all 
"constituents equally and should be pursued with diligence irrespective of 
political or other considerations." 
</P>
<P>
"That means that as a representative, you've got to represent constituents," 
said David Eppler, an attorney for Public Citizen's Congress Watch, a lobbying 
group founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. "But you can't do special 
favors for special constituents like campaign contributors or relatives. You've 
got to do the same for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the call to the comptroller's office was the same type of service 
that his office would provide any constituent. He portrayed Kahn's allegation 
as an ill-fated attempt to find a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "If this is what his campaign platform will be, it's kind of 
weak." 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the formation of Rancho Dominguez Bank disagree on whether 
Anderson made a special effort on behalf of his wife's group. 
</P>
<P>
De Santis said the congressman merely helped to obtain a reply from a federal 
agency that had turned a deaf ear to the Rancho Dominguez group. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an appeal," De Santis said. "We were left out to dry. We didn't hear 
(from the comptroller's office), and our operational costs were going on every 
month." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lee Anderson: "In frustration, I said (to Rep. Anderson): 'Do you know 
anyone?' He said he'd make a call and found out that we would hear from them 
shortly. I think that's all that was done." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Kirchoff, who served on an interim board of directors for the bank while 
the institution was being formed, said that, based on remarks Lee Anderson made 
after the charter rejection, he believes that Anderson's involvement was more 
extensive than a single, neutral telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
"The directors were told by Lee that she had asked Glenn to intervene to see if 
he could expedite the approval," Kirchoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man who served on the interim board but who declined to be identified 
by name, said he got the impression from Lee Anderson that the congressman "was 
quite influential in the whole cotton-picking thing. He had more than a passing 
involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Dean DeBuck, a spokesman for the comptroller, said the banking group won 
approval for its second application because it solved the problems that 
prompted the rejection a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"They did what should have been done the first time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn said that even if Anderson's role was limited to a single inquiry, as the 
congressman and his wife assert, the call was still improper because he made it 
on behalf of an investment group that included his spouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican, who lost to Anderson in the 1988 general election by a margin 
of more than 2 to 1, said he will use the case to illustrate a key plank in his 
campaign platform -- that long-term incumbency leads to abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
"When his wife is involved, he should say, 'Hands off,' " Kahn said. "Judges 
recuse themselves when they are dealing with a case in which they have a 
personal involvement. . . . It's sort of like a web. You've got to draw a line 
somewhere."

SUIT DROPPED AGAINST PAIR WHO FOUGHT DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISTS: BUILDER'S SO-CALLED 'UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER' IN SLAPP ACTION SEEN 
AS A VICTORY FOR FREE SPEECH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-million lawsuit allegedly designed to intimidate residents protesting a 
condominium project has been dropped in what local activists are calling a 
victory for free speech and a neighborhood's right to speak up. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "unconditional surrender" by Huntington Beach developer Gary 
Peters is not only a clear win for the two residents who were its target, but 
for the town itself, which rose up to fight what attorney Marc Coleman said was 
Long Beach's first SLAPP -- Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation. 
</P>
<P>
"I said from the beginning that Long Beach was the wrong place to try a move 
like this," Coleman said. "The people here hold sacred the right to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed in Long Beach Superior Court in July accused Michael 
Horrigan, a 54-year-old grandfather of four, and Sharon Douglass, a disabled 
ex-postal clerk, of engaging in a "conspiracy" to interfere with business when 
they rallied their neighbors to oppose a 63-unit condominium that Peters and 
another developer plan to build in the Zaferia neighborhood west of the Traffic 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The suit brought Horrigan and Douglass face to face with potential financial 
ruin. And it jolted the quaint community that straddles Redondo Avenue south of 
Pacific Coast Highway. Some residents stopped speaking at public meetings out 
of fear. 
</P>
<P>
But Horrigan and Douglass threw down the gauntlet. They hired Coleman and 
threatened to countersue for malicious prosecution if the developer pressed his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
As word of the lawsuit spread through town, hackles raised. Several residents 
publicly decried the developer's heavy-handedness and challenged him to sue 
them for saying so. Neighborhood groups pledged money to help Horrigan and 
Douglass wage what promised to be an expensive court battle, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Peters dropped the suit, saying in a press release: "I believe in 
the public's right to speak out and just as strongly believe in debating an 
issue based on the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Horrigan and Douglass said they are relieved to be free of the financial burden 
of the lawsuit. But they are climbing out of the ring with their dukes up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to sue that sucker for his property and put a park there and name 
it after him," Douglass said. 
</P>
<P>
The developers, G. M. Peters Development Co. and H &amp; P Development, 
meanwhile are altering the blueprints for their multistory condominium project, 
and plan to submit revisions to the city in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass said the neighborhood residents remain opposed to anything larger than 
single-family homes and, fresh with victory, are bolder than ever before.

CROWD PROTESTS REZONING, SUCCEEDS IN GETTING DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 60 Bell Gardens homeowners, developers and residents filled the City 
Council chamber Tuesday night during a Planning Commission meeting to protest a 
city staff recommendation that certain portions of the city be rezoned. 
</P>
<P>
Many held colorful handwritten signs carrying such messages as "End the abuse" 
and "We demand justice." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine families in the Kress Avenue area said they have been attending 
Planning Commission meetings for the past four months, requesting notification 
of rezoning plans. They were never informed of the changes and found out about 
the meeting after a neighbor saw the notice posted in the public library, they 
told commissioners. City officials say notice of the meeting was published in 
the local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners are concerned that the recommended downgrading of zones will 
decrease property values. After three hours of heated discussion, the 
commission decided to send the recommendation back to the city staff for review 
before the next Planning Commission meeting Oct. 16.

CHURCH HOPES TO COMBINE 2 LOTS AND EXPAND BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision is expected tonight from the City Council on whether the Sa-Rang 
Korean Church of Norwalk will be allowed to build a new facility on Pioneer 
Boulevard between South and 195th streets. 
</P>
<P>
The church wants to combine two adjacent parcels of land into one parcel that 
would be 1.75 acres. Both parcels have buildings on them, but one would be torn 
down to make way for a parking lot. The other building would be made into a 
church with offices, a children's nursery and a recreation room. 
</P>
<P>
The parcels are zoned for industrial or commercial uses but the Planning 
Commission is recommending that the church be allowed to locate there.

TRASH HAULER'S REQUEST FOR RATE HIKE TERMED EXCESSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With one member absent Tuesday night, the Compton City Council decided to put 
off a decision on whether to raise residential trash collection rates. Mayor 
Walker R. Tucker has been ill and unable to attend council meetings this month. 
</P>
<P>
The city's trash hauler, Murcole Inc., is seeking a rate increase of 17.16%. 
That would push the current monthly rate from $11.32 per residence to $13.26. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff told the council in a memo that the request is excessive because 
the consumer price index has risen only 4.9% and dumping fees at landfills have 
not gone up enough to justify such a high rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is recommending that the rate be raised to $11.94, which would 
be a 5.5% increase. The council is scheduled to take up the issue again at its 
meeting next Tuesday.

$55.5-MILLION BUDGET UP ABOUT 10% OVER LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved a budget for 1990-91 that calls for the 
city to spend $55.5 million -- about 10% more than last year -- including $16.7 
million on capital projects such as a new arts and sports center at Norwalk 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The $38.8 million the city will spend for ongoing operations will continue 
various programs started last year, including the city's anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes additional spending of $423,000 for improved landscaping 
maintenance. Employee raises of 5% will cost the city $600,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided to spend an additional $991,000 to more than double 
the number of seats -- from 800 to 2,000 -- at the yet-to-be-built amphitheater 
at Norwalk Park, and to make other improvements in the arts and sports center. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk is projected to finish the year with a general fund reserve of more 
than $10 million, about the same as last year.

RESTORATION COST SOARS FOR BRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: BIDS ARE ABOUT $6 MILLION HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED TO REPAIR 
CRUMBLING CONCRETE ON THE COLORADO STREET SPAN IN PASADENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Restoring the 77-year-old Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena will cost $26.3 
million, almost $6 million more than expected when the bridge was closed last 
year, city engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the work being done is unique," said Alan Charmatz, a principal 
engineer with Pasadena's Public Works Department. "Nobody's ever attempted to 
restore a historic, concrete arched bridge at the same time as an earthquake 
retrofit." 
</P>
<P>
The higher price tag arose after two construction bids were returned in July, 
both higher than budgeted for the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project will take 2 1/2 years to complete once work begins, possibly later 
this year, Charmatz said. The soonest the bridge could be reopened is mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
When the project was proposed in 1988, it was estimated at $15.8 million. With 
$12.7 million from the Federal Highway Administration, the city expected to 
make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
But public works officials were unpleasantly surprised in May, 1989, when 
engineering consultants De Leuw Cather &amp; Co. of Pasadena completed design 
drawings with a new estimate of $20.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the shortfall, city officials scurried to find other money and got 
$3.7 million from the county Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The city then advertised for bids. Kiewit Pacific Co. of Santa Fe Springs said 
it could do the work for $21.7 million, and Steve P. Rados of Santa Ana 
estimated $23.2 million. Neither bid included $2.6 million for a project 
contingency fund and $2 million for construction engineering costs to oversee 
the project, both of which were in the $20.4-million estimate, Charmatz said. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members and the consultant reviewed the project to determine whether 
the job could be cut back but concluded that it could not be, Charmatz said. 
</P>
<P>
The frail and crumbling Colorado Street Bridge was considered an advanced 
engineering feat, the highest concrete bridge in the world, when it opened in 
1913. It was saved from demolition in 1951 after a community letter-writing 
campaign and has become one of Pasadena's most visible landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rehabilitation project, the bridge will be brought up to earthquake 
safety standards. Concrete surrounding the bridge's 11 arches will be stripped 
away from the first level of steel reinforcing bars and repoured. 
</P>
<P>
The historically accurate restoration will include replacing the concrete urns 
that once lined the bridge and refurbishing 48 lampposts along its sides. 
</P>
<P>
All the work will be done within a restricted area to minimize the impact on 
the Arroyo Seco park below, Charmatz said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the novel work and conditions, the contractors submitted higher than 
usual bids to protect themselves from unforeseen costs, Charmatz said. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer contractors submitted bids than expected, he added, because of the 
passage in June of Proposition 111, a state gasoline tax that will fund 
government construction projects statewide. With more routine work anticipated, 
developers shied away from the complex Pasadena bridge job, Charmatz said. 
</P>
<P>
City Engineer Dave Barnhart is now asking for an additional $3.8 million from 
the county. He also hopes to reduce construction engineering costs by about 
$900,000, Charmatz said. The city would then have to provide the additional 
money.

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council of this small, hillside community has voted to forbid 
neighborhoods from closing themselves off with gates. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority, saying it was taking a stand against elitism, approved an 
ordinance that makes it illegal to install a security gate across a private or 
public road. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Wible, the only council member who voted against the ban last week, 
said the ordinance invades property rights, which include the option to gate a 
private road. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of nearby cities could think of no other city that has enacted such a 
ban. Real estate industry leaders expressed surprise and dismay at the city's 
move, which they consider government intrusion. 
</P>

Councilman M. Jay Collins, a 15-year resident of the town of 5,300, led the 
council supporters of the ban. "There's an elitist attitude that occurs behind 
a gated community," he said in an interview after the meeting. "It breaks up a 
community and divides the community. You end up with, 'My area is better than 
your area.' " 
</P>
<P>
Collins first raised the issue before the council last December, after 
developers brought plans before the city to gate private streets for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Collins wanted to keep gates off both new developments and the city's numerous 
private roads. These roads, which serve as shared driveways, are maintained by 
the families that live alongside them. The new ordinance will permit only those 
street barriers already in place, such as the one at the entrance to 
Flowerfield Lane, a tract of 20 homes in the southern part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance became necessary to prevent neighborhoods from walling off large 
sections of the city from most residents, Collins said. Whenever the community 
allows development, it is already surrendering "the natural lay of the land," 
he said, and if residents are then locked out, they "have given something up 
and got nothing in return." 
</P>
<P>
At stake, said Collins and other council members, is more than just an 
electronic security barrier, but the rural, independent, neighborly ambience 
that attracted residents to settle here in an era when the pervasive avocado 
ranches of the heights seemed a getaway from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have fought to maintain this lifestyle before, successfully beating 
back efforts to build a freeway through the city. Most households still have 
septic tanks rather than city sewer lines. And the narrow, twisting city 
streets lack curbs and gutters to create a rural feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is essentially a former avocado grove whose roads were designed 
for transporting farm produce back to the city," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also forbids street lights. Said council member Diane Kane: 
"We want to be able to see the stars in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
The encroaching Los Angeles metropolis, however, has practically blotted out 
the constellations with its light pollution, and brought about other changes as 
well, including the push for gated neighborhoods. Throughout the city, homes 
start at $400,000 and move rapidly upward. These days, well-heeled 
professionals and business people join the community to build 
multimillion-dollar dream homes on the hilltops. Many newcomers lack the rural 
orientation of longtime residents, who often raise horses, chickens and other 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Of recent arrivals, Kane said, "They're putting up lighting all over the place. 
I think they're terrified of being in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost uniformly, people building new homes want perimeter fencing and 
security gates," she added. "I don't see it. Our crime rate is extremely low 
and our (law-enforcement) response rate is excellent." Compared to greater Los 
Angeles, "we are a very safe area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting, Collins reported that there were only 12 residential 
burglaries in the first six months of 1990, down from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Crime statistics show that residents of nearby Whittier are twice as likely to 
experience residential burglaries, even though Whittier is not regarded as a 
high-crime area. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has no record of a murder in La Habra Heights for 
1988, 1989 or 1990. 
</P>
<P>
As for gated communities, the Sheriff's Department has no policy on them. In a 
letter to the city, Sheriff Sherman Block wrote that a gated community can 
improve security, but potentially slows down response to calls when officers 
have to negotiate gates. 
</P>
<P>
Crime wave or no, Mayor Wible, the lone no vote on the ban, said homes worth 
millions of dollars could legitimately inspire security worries in their 
owners, and the city should not diminish their property rights. "I'm going to 
tell you what kind of security you're going to have?" he asked other council 
members rhetorically. "I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"I do live on a private road, but I don't have a gate," Wible said later. "I'm 
not much of a gate guy, hideaway person. I just figure privacy is something I 
really think people should be able to choose. The basic issue is being able to 
choose what kind of security you want for your family." 
</P>
<P>
The presence of gates would not make residents any more active in or detached 
from the community than they would be otherwise, Wible said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the council's vote "has to do with Powder Canyon. They don't want 
that to be a gated community." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Powder Canyon development would include 136 exclusive homes built 
around a private golf course in the city's undeveloped northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge parcel," council member Kane said. He estimated that gating the 
Powder Canyon area would close off "one-third of the land mass of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Sequoia Real Estate in Torrance plans to develop the canyon. The developer will 
not contest the issue of having gates, said media representative Marlin Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
At least one potential challenge has already arrived, however. Attorney Raymond 
Tabar of Thomson &amp; Nelson, a Whittier law firm, faxed the city notice that 
certain unnamed city residents considered the gate ban an infringement of their 
rights. There may be a court challenge, the letter implied. When contacted, 
Tabar said he could not disclose his clients' identity. 
</P>
<P>
A legal battle, even if unsuccessful, could prove costly to the city, which 
operates with a part-time staff. The city's annual budget of $2.4 million is 
less than some residents will spend to purchase homes here. 
</P>
<P>
Although other municipalities discourage gated communities, the city staff 
could find no other city that had expressly banned them. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, one-third of 140 new developments under construction two 
years ago had security gates, according to Residential Trends, a Costa Mesa 
industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, gated districts go back at least 50 years, said Ellen 
Poll, the president-elect of the Los Angeles Board of Realtors. While security 
remains a primary motivation, enhancing property values and creating snob 
appeal are also involved. "There is definitely an aspect of prestige. 
Developers gate a community when they want to create an upper class," Poll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A gate purely for its own sake connotes 'estate.' It's a vestigial remains 
from the day when grand houses were at the end of long beautiful drives which 
were entered from a gate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Poll added that living behind a gate does not necessarily isolate people from 
the concerns and problems outside. "They have to come outside of the gate once 
in a while," she said.

MOVIES: THEIR REJECTION OF 'WILD AT HEART,' A CANNES WINNER, HAS ALL THE SOUND 
AND FURY OF A COMEUPPANCE.

Instead of being wild at heart, it's empty at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Washington Post 
</P>
<P>
You may enjoy 'Wild at Heart.' But an hour later you'll wonder why . . . It's 
David Lynch Lite. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Boston Globe 
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart" reveals a master of movie style on his way to becoming a 
mannerist. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Time magazine 
</P>
<P>
 One comes out of the theater feeling as if the mind had begun to melt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Times 
</P>
<P>
The Backlash, that curious natural phenomenon that occurs somewhat less 
frequently than the aurora borealis and is considerably less pretty to watch, 
is upon us. The viciousness of the pans David Lynch's macabre road movie "Wild 
at Heart" has received indicate that something more than a "bad" movie is the 
motivating force here. The film's trashing, coming just three months after it 
won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, has all the furious force of a comeuppance. So, 
for that matter, does the recent snub of "Twin Peaks" at the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Lynch mob? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not blind to the film's faults: It doesn't really have the haunting 
suggestiveness of "Blue Velvet," it crams too many crazies into too little 
story, the last half-hour runs out of steam, and a few set pieces are 
uncomfortably close to David Lynch shtick. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, I find it difficult to sanction the film's spirited, 
wholesale dismissal, particularly since the dismissals come from critics (and 
audiences) who exulted over "Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks." After all, it's not 
as if the sensibility at work in "Wild at Heart" has nothing in common with 
those films. And it diverges from them in ways that make sense both for the 
film and for Lynch's expansion as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
Can it be that Lynch, having broken out of his "Blue Velvet" cult status to the 
mass-audience TV success of "Twin Peaks," is being pasted for becoming a 
household name? Hell hath no fury like a critic whose cult icon has gone 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood isn't so chock-a-block with genius that we can afford to trounce 
Lynch for attempting to extend the boundaries of his artistry, particularly at 
a time when on-the-edge filmmakers are bucking a conservative juggernaut in 
popular culture. Even if the film is counted a failure -- a verdict I reject -- 
it should still be obvious that a failure from Lynch is far more interesting 
than the bland successes of most studio hands. Blind praise can be as 
deleterious for an artist as blanket dismissal -- if he bothers to listen to 
his critics. But there are plenty of reasons to praise with open eyes what 
Lynch has accomplished in "Wild at Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Far from being a sweeping of oddments from Lynch's left-over pile, "Wild at 
Heart" reverses many of the strategies set up in "Blue Velvet." Where that film 
was infernally dark and enclosed and trance-like, "Wild at Heart" is recklessly 
agitated, lit up, on the move. Lynch started out as a painter and sculptor. In 
plastic terms, "Blue Velvet" is representational and static, while "Wild at 
Heart" is action painting. 
</P>
<P>
Where "Blue Velvet" centered on a single demon, Dennis Hopper's Frank, "Wild at 
Heart" proffers an entire grab-bag. The Kyle MacLachlan character in "Blue 
Velvet" followed the filament of his own sexuality into pitch-black terrain; it 
was a profoundly inward journey. Nicolas Cage's Sailor in "Wild at Heart" has a 
profoundly extroverted sexuality -- that's why his Elvis mimicry is so 
viciously apt. And, unlike "Blue Velvet," the rigors the hero must undergo are 
there to test his love for his woman, Laura Dern's Lula. The film's emotional 
core -- the love between Sailor and Lula -- is both more ardent and more 
sentimental than anything in "Blue Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
It could be that this sentimentality, this hankering for the fairy-tale 
complacencies of true love, is part of what is putting people off to "Wild at 
Heart." At the end of "Blue Velvet," many in the audience refused to accept its 
peachy-keen idealism as anything but a put on. But Lynch doesn't have a taste 
for satire. The twinkly small-town bliss of "Blue Velvet"'s final moments is no 
joke. Quite the opposite, it represents what Lynch wants the world to be -- all 
mowed lawns and elm trees and chirping birds. The horror in his movies issues 
from the fact that the world isn't like that. It's a child-like revulsion, of 
course, but some of our best fantasists have been children at heart (as well as 
wild at heart.) In the arts, sophistication isn't all it's cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the reception to "Wild at Heart" would have been stronger if people 
hadn't toted their baggage from "Twin Peaks" into the theater. (And perhaps, 
after all the ratings controversy, the film would have fared better at the 
box-office if it had been branded X.) Stylistically, the Lynch-directed 
episodes of "Twin Peaks" are a more corseted and "knowing" version of "Blue 
Velvet." The malevolence of the ordinary is still on view, but tricked up with 
a dry jokester's wit. (The collaboration of Mark Frost, who produced "Twin 
Peaks" and co-wrote many of its episodes, may be the key to the show's 
mass-audience accessibility; he may have tenderized Lynch's furies, although 
apparently not enough to assuage the artery-hardened Emmy voters.) 
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart" doesn't dampen its rampages the way "Twin Peaks" does; and the 
"dryness" of the wit quickly turns to tinder. Unlike most of Lynch's other 
films, "Wild at Heart" doesn't turn its audience into voyeurs. On the contrary, 
everything in the film is startlingly on view -- the beetles of "Blue Velvet" 
have crawled out from under the thickets and into the molten sunlight. The 
film's emblem is its first image: a huge blooming close up of a lighted match. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, like most genuine film artists, draws on his own private menagerie. It's 
a dangerous way to work in Hollywood, where "personal" filmmakers with a vision 
often end up on the unemployment line -- or the assembly line. Lynch's movies 
are so shocking partly because we're not used to such unimpeded, deeply felt 
force in the movies. Lynch's dreamscapes transfer intact to the big screen. 
Because of the intimate way in which he works, it's natural that Lynch delves 
into themes and obsessions which tend to recur in film after film. But is this 
necessarily a sign that Lynch is repeating himself, becoming a "mannerist?" 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this sort of thing has befallen film artists -- Fellini, to take the 
saddest example. And sometimes, as in the case of Woody Allen, the syndrome 
periodically flares, although even Allen's stinkers tend to get raves from the 
Woodman's many minions. But Lynch is nowhere near the point where his movies 
are make-overs of each other. Artists are open to accusations of self-parody 
for precisely the reasons that they are artists. Less versatile, less 
"professional" than the hack, the film artist is constantly tuned to his own 
frequency. His career becomes a working out of a single theme, the realization 
of a single vision. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch has been working in a multiplicity of mediums in the last few years -- 
besides television, he created, with "Twin Peaks" composer Angelo Badalamenti, 
a symphonic work "Industrial Symphony No. 1," which was performed at the 
Brooklyn Academy last November; he's exhibited his paintings, written rock 
lyrics. But all of this activity is partly a response to his difficulties 
getting film work. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch may be a household name, but his notoriety -- at least in the feature 
film arena -- has not translated into the kinds of freedoms he requires. By all 
rights, Lynch should have made a movie right after "Blue Velvet." Instead, it 
took four long years. The drubbing that "Wild at Heart" has received may renew 
the waiting game. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Lynch is not "Wild at Heart." The problem is all the movies 
Lynch should be making but can't. As Orson Welles discovered long ago, in 
Hollywood, everybody loves a genius. They just don't want to subsidize him.

THE L.A. FESTIVAL: THUMBS UP OR DOWN?; 
</P>
<P>
DONORS: FINANCIAL BACKERS GIVE HIGH MARKS TO THIS YEAR'S DIVERSE PROGRAM. CIVIC 
AND BUSINESS LEADERS PRAISE EFFORTS TO INVOLVE LOCAL ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.

Most of the events at the Los Angeles Festival were free to the public -- but 
the price of participation was steep for the corporations, civic groups and 
city government organizations that donated funds for the $5-million Pacific Rim 
arts celebration. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, those backers said it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Festival marked the first time the Japanese Business Assn. has 
funded a citywide arts festival; companies that are members of the organization 
donated more than $1 million. Contributors included Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., 
Ohbayashi America Corp., American Honda, Sogo Shosha Group, Mitsui Fudosan, 
Nikkodo and Nissan. Masayuki Kohama, vice president of Hitachi Limited, said he 
believes his company's participation in the arts event was a sound business 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is, I think this was a very unique occasion," Kohama said. 
"Economically, the 21st Century will be the century of the Pacific Rim. Trade 
volume on the Pacific side already exceeds that of the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"However, without any sort of cultural understanding of each other, this 
relationship is very fragile. The L.A. Festival gave the so-called field for 
that exchange. . . . It is a very, very valuable event for Japanese 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Shellgren, a senior vice president at Transamerica Life Companies, one 
of the festival founders, said his company was also involved in the 1987 L.A. 
Festival. Though unwilling to estimate what the company gave this year in 
dollars and in-kind donations, Shellgren said he thought this year's festival 
was "less esoteric" than 1987's festival of European arts -- and therefore a 
more valuable investment. 
</P>
<P>
"With the earlier festivals, the rap was that they were all held at kind of 
downtown places, and the ticket prices were quite expensive," Shellgren said. 
"And the dance companies were companies like Twyla Tharp's (post-modern dance 
company) -- very avant-garde. If you knew about things and had a lot of money, 
you could come. But (festival director) Peter Sellars' approach to this one 
really did reach out, and encouraged people to attend events that were largely 
free. And not only to go to those events that kind of appealed to your own 
culture, but to kind of cross those cultural boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
Although not the focus of the Pacific culture festival, Los Angeles' black 
community raised $50,000 for the festival -- and fund-raiser Dr. Thomas 
Kilgore, pastor of the Second Baptist Church, called the money well-spent. 
"This festival leaves a much better taste in the minds and hearts of 
African-American people than we've had before, simply because there was 
involvement at several levels at the many venues around the city," he said. 
"Various racial and ethnic backgrounds came to know the real worth of people 
other than themselves." 
</P>
<P>
David Lizzaraga, president and chief executive officer of TELACU, a Latino 
community development corporation, said the festival served its purpose for the 
Latino community because its artists got a chance to participate. "This is the 
first time that I can remember that anybody has included Latin America as part 
of the Pacific Rim," he said. "I think we all would have liked to have better 
response as far as (audience) numbers were concerned, but we weren't in a 
numbers game -- we were into presenting a quality festival." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Arca, public relations vice president at AT&amp;T, another festival 
founder, said that while the company considered the festival a "risky" event, 
it's not the first time the company has sponsored an unusual arts project. He 
said that the corporation managed to maintain a high public profile during the 
festival by sponsoring single events -- such as the opening-night performance 
of Japan's "Legend of the Water Flame" and the Los Angeles Poverty Department 
performance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some critiques that I have already given the festival staff -- there 
needed to be a stronger marketing and promotional component to make sure people 
are aware of (the festival)," Arca said. "But overall, I think people got out 
of the Los Angeles Festival what they put into it." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Meier, vice president of administration and community affairs for Times 
Mirror, a Los Angeles Festival founder and parent company of The Times, said it 
is too early for the company to evaluate the success of the festival: "We 
really haven't had an opportunity to sit down and put our heads together on 
that subject. But personally, I though the performances were marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
Tressa Miller of Security Pacific Corp., first vice president in charge of the 
company's cultural affairs department, said Security Pacific became a festival 
founder precisely because the festival focused on cultures new to the L.A. arts 
scene. "Maybe it was offbeat -- or maybe it was just representative (of the 
community)," she said. "I know it was criticized for being in so many different 
locations, but I think that's why they were able to reach so many people." 
</P>
<P>
A few in the entertainment industry gave to the festival; Raleigh Studios 
donated space for movie screenings and rehearsals, and 20th Century-Fox donated 
an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
Fox chairman Barry Diller said he does not understand most of the entertainment 
industry's unwillingness to support non-commercial art forms. 
</P>
<P>
"This (entertainment) community is so much about returning an investment that 
not only does it not (get involved in the arts), it seems to run from it -- I 
don't know why that is, it seems loony to me," Diller said. "I think corporate 
giving should have a relationship to the world in which you function. We give 
to . . . everything that relates to the entertainment community. How you could 
say that an ethnic festival is not in the spectrum of your business? I don't 
get it."

GEARED UP FOR THURSDAY NIGHT'S FAMILY FEUD; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE FACE-OFF BETWEEN 'SIMPSONS' AND 'COSBY' HEATS UP AS THE LATTER 
OFFERS ITS FIRST NEW EPISODE OF THE SEASON TONIGHT.

<P>
It holds elements of an epic confrontation: "The Cosby Show," aging and hinting 
vulnerability, challenged head-on by the smart-alecky pop culture phenom, "The 
Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
Just the thought -- can the great Cosby really be taken by a cartoon? -- seems 
impossibly brash, but then the bold stroke is the signature of the Fox network, 
which posed "The Simpsons" gambit early last summer. 
</P>
<P>
After four weeks of dueling with reruns, the real battle -- at least half of it 
-- begins at 8 tonight when NBC debuts the seventh season of "The Cosby Show," 
which spent its hiatus undergoing an overhaul. It will be three more weeks 
before "The Simpsons" is back with new episodes. 
</P>
<P>
The "Cosby" changes, as well as the challenge from Fox, were prompted by signs 
last season that the show was teetering at the top. Where viewers had once 
religiously given "Cosby" TV's highest ratings for a series, the show had lost 
its lock-grip on the No. 1 spot and started to show signs of ratings mortality, 
finishing behind ABC's "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
But more, the show seemed tired and a bit stale, relying on such script 
gimmicks as dream sequences, and the spreading intuition in the industry was 
that "Cosby" had reached the point that all mega-hit TV shows eventually come 
to: held at the top by viewer routine, but poised for a fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cosby and the show's executive producers, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, 
sensed that their show needed revitalizing, and "Cosby" got a new executive 
producer to supervise production in New York, the writing staff was swept out 
and nine new writers were brought in. And a new character was added to the 
Huxtable household -- Pam, a 17-year-old relative of Clair Huxtable's with a 
disadvantaged background. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be changes in the existing characters, reflecting the fact that 
five of the new writers are women: Clair's career as a lawyer will become more 
substantial and demanding, Vanessa will start high school and Denise, a college 
drop-out, finally gets her life in order. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes are helpful," says Bernie Kukoff, the new executive producer, 
"because they add texture." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that "Cosby" was vulnerable resonated deeply, because an 
omnipotent "Cosby" has been the foundation underlying network programming 
strategies for the last several years. Thursday night became "Cosby's" night, 
which made it NBC's night, a fact that rival programmers' conceded by filling 
their Thursdays with programs bearing low ratings expectations. Until last 
week, NBC had not lost a Thursday night since February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In challenging this daunting force, Fox is gambling with its most valuable 
property. "The Simpsons," a sardonic animated view of family life that is the 
antithesis of "Cosby's" warmth, is more than just a popular cartoon. It's a 
genuine phenomenon in the mass culture, inspiring Simpsons' T-shirts, Simpsons' 
lunch pails and, most pervasively, a Simpsons' attitude. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly for Fox, the show was the network's first series to hit the 
rarefied reaches of the Top 10. Fox hoped that juice would transfer to 
Thursday, where "The Simpson's" would become the linchpin of a new night of 
programming for the network. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nervy step, admired even by the competition. "I really admire Fox," 
says Marcy Carsey, co-executive producer of "Cosby." "I think it was a 
wonderful move on their part." 
</P>
<P>
The early results seem to suggest otherwise. In its Sunday night time slot, 
"The Simpsons" reached No. 4 in the Nielsen ratings. But in August, when Fox 
moved the show to Thursdays, "The Simpsons" sank as low as No. 54. It was No. 
45 last week. 
</P>
<P>
This was only a contest between reruns, a summertime prelude to the real battle 
this fall, but the sobering result has Sam Simon, co-executive producer of "The 
Simpsons," wondering about Fox's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"The gallows humor started immediately" says Simon, describing the mood of the 
"Simpsons" crew. "We were nervous and unhappy about the move (from Sundays). 
The numbers thus far have made us even more nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Fox officials have stoutly defended the move, insisting that the ratings plunge 
is not as bad as it looks. They point to the valuable demographics of their 
show, arguing that "The Simpsons" is actually doing just fine among the younger 
audience that advertisers prize -- especially considering that the network has 
fewer affiliates than NBC and that the show is in its third cycle of 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's hope is that ratings will improve when new episodes of "The Simpsons" 
begin Oct. 11. Producer Simon, meanwhile, is more anxious. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Cosby Show' is a quality, classic show that has a franchise on Thursday 
night," he says. "When I heard that 'Cosby' was ripe for the taking, my mind 
first flashed on how many shows have tried to take on Johnny Carson, who was 
supposed to be ripe for the taking." 
</P>
<P>
Simon says that "The Simpsons" wasn't expected to topple "Cosby" right away 
when the show was moved last month, but that Fox had predicted it would fare 
better than it has. Research indicates that "The Simpsons" lost some child 
viewers and some of its female audience with the move. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's deeper fear is not simply that his show will lose the battle of 
Thursday night, but that the war against "Cosby" may quicken the life cycle of 
"The Simpsons," which went on the air as a series only last January. He has the 
sensation of watching his show's life flashing before him. 
</P>
<P>
The fast rise of "The Simpsons" as a pop culture phenomenon was fueled at least 
partly by its perception as a hot vehicle. But what perceptions bring up, 
perceptions can also bring down, and that is what worries Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole 'Simpsons' phenomenon has been so compressed," he says. "We became a 
'critics favorite,' then the next week we were a 'cult hit,' the next we were a 
'ratings hit,' the next we were a 'threat to society.' And the next, we were 
'over-merchandized.' And that (cycle) usually takes two years." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Simon can only wait for his show to begin airing original episodes, 
and hope that new shows will fetch more viewers. If not, he wonders whether Fox 
will consider moving his show back to Sundays, and even if it does, whether it 
will be too late. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of television," Simon says, "is not the history of networks 
admitting they made a mistake."

STAGE WATCH: 'INHERIT THE WIND' WILL RETURN TO THE COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people have seen more fictional courtrooms than real ones. Here's a chance 
to combine the two -- the courtroom drama "Inherit the Wind" will be staged in 
a downtown Los Angeles courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Leonard Grant will present the Jerome Lawrence-Robert E. Lee drama, 
suggested by the 1925 Scopes trial, in Dept. 2 of Los Angeles Superior Court, 
just east of the Music Center, opening Nov. 27. The occasion will mark the 
200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, as well as the 35th anniversary of 
"Inherit the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Seating capacity in the spectator section is 258, and there also will be 10 
seats for audience members in the jury box. Grant said he hopes to fill those 
jury box seats with white males, in order to sustain the illusion of a real 
Tennessee courtroom in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Miller, the actor and "That Championship Season" playwright, will play 
Henry Drummond, loosely based on Clarence Darrow. Other casting is not set, but 
Grant expects "some very prestigious actors" not only in this production, but 
in what he projects as future "Inherit the Wind" stagings in courtrooms 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
With a cast of 20 and only 250 seats, he contended it won't be possible for him 
to make a profit. He estimated the total production costs, including a handbook 
for use in other cities, as $250,000. The actors will work under Actors' 
Equity's Hollywood Area Theatre contract. 
</P>
<P>
Evening performances, at $35 a ticket, will run Wednesdays through Sundays, 
with $30 matinees on Saturdays and Sundays. Grant also hopes to do discounted 
student performances. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County will be paid for the use of the hall and the Music Center 
parking garage, and the Music Center Operating Company will be paid for the use 
of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion box office. Grant said the exact costs for the 
facilities will be determined today. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's chambers and other offices behind the courtroom will serve as 
dressing rooms. "Essentially, (the court employes) won't be able to keep a 
messy desk," said Grant, but he added that they already customarily lock 
confidential documents in cabinets before leaving for the night. Costumes will 
be brought out of a storage room for each show. 
</P>
<P>
Grant heard about a courtroom production of the play in Scranton, Pa., and 
approached author Lawrence about the possibility of adapting the idea to Los 
Angeles and other cities. "It is environmental theater in the purest sense of 
the word," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC LOOKS SOUTH: Coming soon to Las Palmas Theatre in Hollywood: "a comedy 
about incestuous twins who re-enact the Kennedy assassination as part of their 
foreplay." 
</P>
<P>
That's how Harvey Seister, general director of the Magic Theatre in San 
Francisco, describes "The House of Yes," scheduled to open at the 385-seat Las 
Palmas Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy MacLeod's play will be the 24-year-old Magic Theatre's first venture into 
Los Angeles. Cast, director and designer will be those who did it at the Magic, 
where it opened for a scheduled nine performances on April 4 and wound up 
playing 130 performances. "It was the best-selling new play in our history," 
said Seister. 
</P>
<P>
The play is set in the Virginia suburbs of Washington during a hurricane. It's 
"a wild satire" that makes "powerful statements about public violence and 
private relationships and the cult of hero worship," said Seister. 
</P>
<P>
RIBMAN IN PASADENA: The Pasadena Playhouse has won a $37,500 grant to stage 
Ronald Ribman's "Rug Merchants of Chaos" next March. The Fund for New American 
Plays also awarded $10,000 to Ribman for the project. The new play will appear 
in the Playhouse's Balcony Theatre, said artistic director Susan Dietz. 
</P>
<P>
GROVE WATCH: The Grove Shakespeare Festival didn't fare as well as LATC before 
its own civic authorities Monday. The Garden Grove City Council took no action 
on the Grove's request for $25,700 in emergency funds. But a special council 
meeting has been scheduled for Monday to reconsider the matter. 
</P>
<P>
It was decided Tuesday to continue rehearsals for "The Importance of Being 
Earnest," scheduled to open Oct. 4, despite a deadline of Oct. 5 for the 
raising of a total of $32,157. Grove officials have said the theater will have 
to close if the money isn't raised by then. 
</P>
<P>
Never fear, though -- the City Council did approve a proclamation designating 
October as "pride in our cultural activities month."

GETTING ALONG ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bad road habits only worsen the already contentious relationship between 
cyclists and motorists. Here are a few complaints from each camp. 
</P>
<P>
Bicyclists hate when motorists: 
</P>
<P>
* Suddenly make right turns across bike lanes without so much as a glance over 
their shoulders for cyclists cruising along next to them. 
</P>
<P>
* Back out of driveways without looking for bike traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Suddenly open driver's side doors into bike lanes (often done after a 
motorist has slowly cruised in a bike lane looking for a parking space, forcing 
cyclists to brake or stop). 
</P>
<P>
* Cruise up a few feet behind cyclists and blast their horns to announce their 
presence -- or just for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists hate when cyclists: 
</P>
<P>
* Blow through stop signs and red lights into heavily traveled intersections, 
without even pausing to look for traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* Ride abreast or in large groups, spilling out of bike lanes and taking up 
roadways. 
</P>
<P>
* Ride against traffic, especially on roads with no bike lanes.

A NIFTY PLACE TO HORSE AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET LOWE, Janet Lowe is a Del Mar free-lance writer who grew up on a 
ranch. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First there's the aroma from the bales of hay stacked in the parking lot. Then 
you get a whiff of the leather boots and saddles when you walk through the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you grew up on a ranch or just watch a lot of Western movies, Mary's 
Tack and Feed store will bring a rush of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
This is a place where you can outfit yourself for riding to the hounds, take a 
saunter through the Old West -- or just look around at what may be the best 
collection of leathers, brass, jodhpurs and blue jeans anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Hammond started the store in 1963 in a former hamburger stand. Then, 14 
years ago, she sold it to Mike and Saleta Mosley. Ever since, the small store 
at Via De La Valle and El Camino Real on the edge of Del Mar has grown with the 
North County population. In 1985, the Mosleys built a new and larger store 
across the street from the original tack shop. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mary's is believed to be one of the largest tack and feed stores in the 
country, attracting customers from all over the U.S. as well as Mexico and 
South America. Because of the large volume of business, including telephone and 
mail orders, the Mosleys are computerizing the business and creating a 
catalogue division. 
</P>
<P>
The store is in an area that was part of Del Mar's first ranch; for years 
farmers grew beans on the land. Today, the area is a hub for everything 
equestrian. The Rancho Santa Fe Polo Club is across the street, All Creatures 
animal hospital is next door, and the recently completed Showpark Riding Club 
borders to the south. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to own a horse or like riding to get a kick out of this 
mercantile establishment. It's full of gadgets and special equipment, live farm 
animals and pet supplies, books, pictures and video tapes. Blankets hang from 
the rafters, reins are draped on the walls, and finches and cockatiels chatter 
busily in an alcove. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Klika, who manages the store, points out that there is both rhyme and 
reason to the store's layout. Outside are the roomy pipe and wire cages for dog 
runs, keeping exotic birds outside, and sheltering other critters. That's also 
where the big trucks pull up to deliver hay, grain, straw and other bulk 
supplies for stables. Those big plastic tubs, explained one worker, actually 
are watering troughs. 
</P>
<P>
There are always a lot of kids around Mary's -- probably because of the 
collection of exotic animals. Black Polish roosters with white ruffled 
headdress prance around a shaded cage while next door geese tend a nest of eggs 
in a mound of straw. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have a lot more animals," Mike Mosley explained, "but people don't 
buy them anymore. People don't keep chickens (or peacocks or goats) in the back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mosley said, the outer yard of the store isn't fenced, and the animals 
become easy pickings. One night several expensive wood ducks disappeared, 
probably to become a gourmet dinner somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Klika said, the store is browser-friendly, and the bulletin board 
by the front door proves it. There, people list saddles, horse blankets, horses 
and pups and other goods for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the store would seem like a jumble of merchandise, if it 
weren't for Klika's guiding hand. The downstairs is devoted to English riding 
supplies, including everything for jumping, show horses and polo riding. That's 
where riders get fitted for tall black boots and little velvet-covered safety 
helmets. Upstairs is the realm of the Western rider, where supplies even 
include silver saddle and bridle decorations to dress a pony for a parade. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitting a new horse with basic riding gear can be as exciting as buying a 
new personal wardrobe, and costs about the same. For the basics, including a 
saddle, the minimum expenditure is about $750, Klika said. But the higher 
possibilities are almost limitless. 
</P>
<P>
"A new saddle may be $400," she said, "but then you can go as high as you want, 
on up to $2,000." 
</P>
<P>
Though Mary's is only about a mile from the Del Mar Race Track, the store 
doesn't cater to the racing trade at all. "The suppliers travel with the race 
circuit," Mosley said. "They have trailers with supplies for racing, and when 
Del Mar is done, they move on to another race track." 
</P>
<P>
The 32 employees at Mary's must be knowledgeable about such things as how to 
tighten a stirrup and which crop is appropriate for riding and which is used in 
the exercise ring. Klika tries to hire people who have had experience with 
horsemanship and husbandry, but even so, training is necessary to keep up with 
the latest products and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Klika herself has been at the store for almost nine years. Formerly, she worked 
as an assistant news photographer at Channel 8. She'd always loved riding and 
horses, and decided to make a career change into something related to her 
hobby. Since that time, Klika has gradually moved from living in the city to 
her own ranch in Julian. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't mind the commute to her job, though. 
</P>
<P>
Both she and Mosley say the best part of the business is not the horses but the 
people -- customers who have been coming to the store since the start of the 
business and have become friends. "I've seen kids grow up with the shop," Klika 
said.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: STANDARD 'COWABUNGA' ERA FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front door at Bunbury's opens into the mid-1960s. This Scripps Ranch 
restaurant, which has been in business for several years, remains a faithful, 
unchanging monument to the Southern California cuisine of that decade. The 
place in fact seems such a detailed replica of the standard SoCal restaurants 
of the "cowabunga" era that the absence of a surfboard rack outside the 
entrance almost seems odd. 
</P>
<P>
Diners enter through a bar that features a wide-screen television tuned to a 
sports channel. The sports action does not, however, intrude on the cube of a 
dining room which has plank walls reaching to the distant, beamed wooden 
ceiling. Green plants hang hither and yon and the only other major decor 
statement is made by the salad bar. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of a salad bar is something of a novelty these days, since the age 
when few restaurants lacked them seems well behind us. The right to indulge in 
this greenery fest is included in the price of all entrees, with Caesar salad, 
a tomato salad with bay shrimp and the soup du jour offered as alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the lone bowl of lettuce, which on a recent visit looked rather 
tired and shopworn, the bar does offer a thoroughly respectable congregation of 
composed salads, raw and pickled vegetables, fruits (an excellent selection of 
fresh melon wedges, although the canned peaches seem out of place), garnishes 
and dressings. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen does not venture beyond the simplest cookery. When asked if the 
evening's soup, French onion, had been brewed on the premises, a server paused 
momentarily, glanced up at the ceiling and said, "Not really." (The service, by 
the way, was surprisingly good.) In the same streamlined approach to getting 
food on the plate, the cheesecake, chocolate mousse and blackout cake are the 
provenance of an outside supplier. 
</P>
<P>
The menu opens with starters of Brie and fruit, shrimp cocktail, fried potato 
skins and sauteed mushrooms, but quickly comes to the point with a mention of 
prime rib, the great star in Bunbury's culinary firmament. 
</P>
<P>
Available in a full portion or a less overwhelming half-cut, the prime rib is 
presented in the fashion prescribed by the tradition of several decades, which 
is to say with a creamy horseradish dressing and a cup of what has come to be 
known rather amusingly as "au jus," a concoction that properly designates pan 
juices but here, as at most local restaurants, can be described as resembling a 
strong bouillon. 
</P>
<P>
The flavors are typical for this sort of presentation, and neither more nor 
less than might be expected; the meat itself is reasonably tender. The baked 
potato that accompanied it had a long-baked, creamy texture that was easy to 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
Once past prime rib, the entree list continues with filet mignon, top sirloin, 
grilled chicken breast and several teriyakis (this is the old California menu, 
after all), and combinations of prime rib or steak with chicken, halibut or the 
inevitable shrimp "scampi," which also stands on its own as an entree. The 
chicken breast, available teriyaki-style, also is offered plain with a dish of 
"honey curry" sauce on the side, and while this sweet-spicy concoction seems 
little more than honey and curry powder stirred together, it does have a 
pleasant flavor that adds something to the basic chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood list includes a brochette of shrimp and fish, grilled mahi mahi, 
broiled halibut, sauteed snapper and scallops, Bunbury's version of the 
Italian-style seafood stew called cioppino, and an Australian lobster tail. A 
separate "cafe" menu offers hamburgers, a Reuben sandwich and chicken and Cobb 
salads. 
</P>
<P>
Bunbury's serves very basic fare, although it is a cuisine that seems timeless 
and time-honored in this part of the country.

<P>
Hard-pressed by a tightening trade embargo, the government of Iraq retaliated 
Wednesday by beginning to take over foreign assets in Iraq and withholding 
payment on its debts. 
</P>
<P>
In decreeing the move, Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council targeted 
countries that have frozen Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets abroad and have deprived 
Iraq of the proceeds of Kuwait's vast investments. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency, which made the decree public, said it was 
issued under a new law dealing with the protection of "Iraqi interests, money 
and rights in Iraq and abroad." It quoted the decree as saying: 
</P>
<P>
"All money, assets and their revenues belonging to governments, institutions, 
companies and banks of countries that have taken arbitrary actions against Iraq 
are impounded." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not say how much money might be involved, nor was the U.S. 
State Department able to provide an estimate. Margaret Tutwiler, a department 
spokeswoman, said in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear from the Iraqi statement in what form or against whom the 
action will be taken." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, and other countries as well, froze Iraq's holdings abroad 
not long after Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2. According to the 
Iraqi News Agency, the new decree declares that action invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's order to seize foreign assets is the latest in a series of tit-for-tat 
moves President Saddam Hussein has made in an effort to counter the foreign 
pressure. Inresponse to the trade embargo, he has withheld food from foreign 
refugees trying to get out of the country; in an effort to deter military 
attack, he has moved foreign hostages to potential target areas. 
</P>
<P>
The decree's impact will vary from country to country. Britain, for example, 
has little in the way of assets in Iraq and is a net debtor. Several Japanese 
companies, on the other hand, are owed about $4.5 billion by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Several foreign companies have lucrative construction and oil contracts with 
the Iraqi government, and Iraq has taken the position that it will not be 
responsible for delays in completing these contracts, suggesting that it will 
not pay for incomplete projects. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation in Amman that Iraq will confiscate diplomatic property in 
Kuwait. Hussein has already ordered embassies there closed and suspended 
guarantees of diplomatic safety. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, meanwhile, took steps to tighten the net around Iraq by 
broadening the blockade to include air cargo as well as shipping and overland 
commerce. A proposed resolution would subject to inspection at intermediate 
stops all flights into and out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, introduced on the heels of reports that Libya and Yemen have 
not been complying with the embargo, would require all countries to close their 
airspace to planes approaching or leaving Iraq or Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a Bush Administration proposal to sell Saudi Arabia as much as 
$22 billion in arms encountered mounting opposition from members of Congress, 
who expressed concern about the potential impact on arms proliferation and the 
balance of power in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who attended closed-door briefings with top Administration officials 
said they received assurances that the Pentagon arms sale proposal is still 
under review by the White House and that no final decision has been made on its 
scope. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said he and a group of other Democratic senators 
urged Administration officials in one session to scale back the proposal to 
only those arms needed immediately by the Saudis to help counter the threat of 
Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"Every senator raised questions about the sale and the capacity of the Saudis 
to absorb that many weapons with their small forces," Cranston said. "The 
general suggestion was that it would be wise to tone it down so that there 
would not be a big battle in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said lawmakers are concerned that 
the original Pentagon proposal, which would provide the Saudis with advanced 
F-15 fighters and hundreds of tanks and armored fighting vehicles, would 
significantly escalate the Middle East arms race. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the Administration is trying to use the crisis as a fig leaf to 
have everything but the kitchen sink thrown in," said Levine. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee 
on foreign operations, said he has "tremendous misgivings" about the size of 
the Pentagon proposal and the potential lack of congressional oversight. "This 
is the sort of thing that would make Ollie North salivate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said there has been some 
discussion among members of Congress of providing the Saudis now with only 
those arms needed in the current crisis and delaying debate on the remainder of 
the package. 
</P>
<P>
In other gulf developments Wednesday, an airliner carrying more than 400 
Western women and children left Baghdad for London. The passengers were said to 
be mostly U.S. citizens but included some Britons. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, a spokesman at the French Foreign Ministry said Iraqi soldiers have 
arrested two more French nationals in Kuwait, adding to the thousands of 
foreigners held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo against Iraq continues to trouble Jordan, which appealed Wednesday 
for foreign aid. Before the Kuwaiti crisis, more than half of Jordan's exports 
went to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials have complained that the United States is dragging its feet 
in aiding Jordan because of its perception that King Hussein is supporting 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Japan and West Germany and other European countries have said they will provide 
Jordan with compensation, but the United States has yet to join in. Jordanian 
government spokesman Ibrahim Ezzedin attributed Washington's reluctance to 
"some doubts and misunderstandings about our political position." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan has applied the U.N. trade sanctions to Iraq, but grudgingly. Jordan 
continues to import most of its oil from Iraq, claiming a hardship exemption. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement likely to aggravate the already-strained relations with 
Washington, Jordanian Prime Minister Mudar Badran said Wednesday that the 
Americans will be the losers if it comes to war. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington's goal in the region is to compete with a united and 
powerful Europe by controlling the region's oil. 
</P>
<P>
Badran said this presents Washington with a dilemma because the region's oil 
production facilities could be destroyed in a war. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on this assumption, the United States will be the loser," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to accept Iraq's assertion of rule over Kuwait, saying that neither 
Saudi Arabia nor any other state in the region is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan has not recognized Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, but has not condemned 
the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the thrust of Jordan's diplomacy and its public stand on the 
crisis have fallen more and more into line with opinions expressed by the Iraqi 
government: that the major problem in the Middle East is the presence of U.S. 
and Western troops in Saudi Arabia and that the invasion of Kuwait is an issue 
that can be settled by Arabs.

HOUSE SUPPORTS ARMS CUT, SHIFTS $1 BILLION TO GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Democrat-controlled House approved deep slashes in President Bush's defense 
budget Wednesday to reflect the diminished Soviet threat. But in a last-minute 
move it began to confront the new regional threats symbolized by the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Just before passing a $283-billion military programs bill, the House shifted 
nearly $1 billion to address some of the problems revealed by Operation Desert 
Shield, the massive deployment of U.S. troops to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment offered by Democratic leaders would bolster military sealift, 
airlift and mine-hunting capabilities, improve defenses against chemical and 
biological weapons and correct pay inequities for the more than 100,000 troops 
in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The costs would be offset mainly by an additional $600-million reduction in 
"Star Wars" anti-missile research and a $348-million cut in DDG-51 destroyer 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved 256 to 155, primarily along party lines, would cut Bush's 
overall spending request by $24 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
Lawmakers brushed off a veto warning by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who 
protested provisions that would terminate the B-2 bomber program, cut planned 
"Star Wars" spending by nearly 50% and reduce U.S. troop strength by 130,000. 
</P>
<P>
Budget summit talks between the White House and Congress are expected to 
produce a defense cut closer to the $18 billion approved by the Senate last 
month. A House-Senate conference is likely to soften the cuts in "Star Wars" 
and troop levels and might agree to extend the B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the overall reduction approved by Congress almost certainly will 
represent a sharp rebuff to Administration arguments that a continuing Soviet 
nuclear threat and new Third World dangers require much higher spending levels. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said the House's 
first defense bill of the post-Cold War era "provides for a military still 
primarily sized and shaped to meet the Soviet threat." Even so, he said, it 
"takes the first steps toward buying the right defense for a new era" in which 
growing cooperation with the Soviet Union is accompanied by emerging regional 
threats such as Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks in part to (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein and (Soviet President) 
Mikhail Gorbachev, we are beginning to recognize that security problems of the 
new era require new solutions," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans attacked the bill, saying it cut too deeply in many areas while 
spending too much on some job-rich "pork-barrel" programs. For example, the 
bill continues funding of the V-22 Osprey, a troop-carrying helicopter-airplane 
that Cheney wants to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
Just before passage, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said that, 
despite the threats posed by well-armed dictators like Hussein, "House 
Democrats are rushing back to the weakness" of the post-Vietnam War defense 
budgets of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans were unable to restore funds for the Strategic Defense 
Initiative, commonly known as "Star Wars." In fact, the House voted to reduce 
Bush's $4.7-billion SDI request to $2.4 billion, even lower than the $3 billion 
approved by the Armed Services Committee. Moreover, GOP and Democratic 
conservatives made no effort to restore money sought by Bush to build two B-2 
bombers and to deploy the MX intercontinental missile on rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the typical reaction among 
lawmakers was: "Oh, my gosh, we've got to put more in for defense," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The President was using Desert Shield to argue for more spending on the B-2 
and SDI," he said. "But as people began to look at it, what the crisis showed 
was that the cuts related to the Soviet Union were not undermined by Desert 
Shield but reinforced by it, because of the Soviets' cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Although the gulf crisis demonstrated a need to allocate funds to improve the 
nation's fast sealift capability and address other problems encountered in the 
military buildup, Aspin said that "we don't really know yet" the full nature of 
the new regional threat. 
</P>
<P>
Besides slashing the "Star Wars" budget -- and moving to block early deployment 
of the space-based "brilliant pebbles" anti-missile system -- the House made 
only one other major change in the defense measure: adoption of the Desert 
Shield amendment offered by Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the amendment would give all U.S. troops deployed in Saudi 
Arabia "imminent danger pay" of $110 per month. That would help married 
enlisted personnel whose family budgets have been reduced by $177 per month by 
the loss of a meal allowance. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment also would require that the billions of dollars being contributed 
by other nations to help pay for the U.S. deployment be funneled through the 
congressional appropriations process. The Pentagon wants to control the funds 
itself, but some lawmakers have protested that relinquishing oversight would 
enable the Administration to divert funds to other programs that Congress has 
restrained, such as the B-2 bomber being built by Northrop Corp. in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment also urges the Pentagon to call up combat reserve and National 
Guard units in addition to the support units already summoned for Desert Shield 
to test the money-saving concept of mixing combat reserves with active-duty 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has resisted using combat reservists because the President now has 
authority to call up reserves for only 180 days, potentially insufficient time 
to train and deploy them efficiently. Lawmakers, however, said during the floor 
debate that they would move to give the President 360-day call-up authority. 
</P>
<P>
All California Republicans voted against the defense bill. The only California 
Democrats voting against it were Reps. Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles, Ronald 
V. Dellums of Berkeley and Don Edwards of San Jose. Reps. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Greenbrae) and Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) were absent.

IRAQI BRUTALITY, EXODUS ALTERING FACE OF KUWAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In launching a new wave of brutality and temporarily opening the Kuwaiti 
border, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein appears to be embarking on a strategy to 
keep control of Kuwait by literally changing its face -- ridding it of its own 
citizens and replacing them with Iraqis and sympathetic Palestinians, U.S. 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Although the horrifying tales from thousands of fleeing Kuwaitis suggest a 
situation of unbridled chaos, experts in and out of government say they see a 
calculated objective behind the campaign of torture and execution of Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
"They want these people out of there," one U.S. official declared. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, what you see is a logical unfolding of (Hussein's) plan to secure 
Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq. He is changing the Kuwaiti demography," 
said Richard W. Murphy, who was the Reagan Administration's assistant secretary 
of state for Near Eastern affairs and who now is a scholar at the Council of 
Foreign Relations. 
</P>
<P>
And if Hussein is ultimately pressured to withdraw from Kuwait, this effort 
could give him a real lever to retain power over the country. "He could offer 
to hold a referendum under U.N. auspices where every Arab in the country could 
vote," one Bush Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. businessmen who have had contact with Iraq have privately 
approached the White House with such an idea for free elections, offering it as 
a means of getting Hussein out of Kuwait without a war. 
</P>
<P>
Not only would Hussein's allies have a good chance at winning such a ballot, 
but they could also use it to "create fissures" in the worldwide alliance 
against Iraq, said Hermann F. Eilts, director of Boston University's Center for 
International Relations and a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
It would force U.S. allies -- particularly Arab countries -- to choose between 
restoring to the throne a royal family or holding elections that would give 
other Arabs a voice in running the country. "Many who support us now are not as 
committed to the (exiled) Sabah government," Eilts said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hussein has exploited the resentment of rich Arabs by poor ones, 
portraying his invasion as the unseating of a corrupt and elitist regime that 
has ruled Kuwait for centuries. An election would fit many of the themes he has 
emphasized with some success in the Arab world since the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, insisted that such a strategy would not be effective, in part 
because the United Nations has never preempted an existing government in favor 
of an invader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice trick if you can get away with it," Murphy said. "I don't think it 
will work, though." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, Kuwaitis were a minority constituting not 
more than one-third of the 2 million residents of their country. The majority 
were foreigners, many of them Palestinians, who had sought work there. 
</P>
<P>
They were not eligible for the generous government benefits that were a 
hallmark of Kuwaiti life and complained that they were not allowed to share in 
the nation's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Since the invasion, the number of Kuwaitis living there has fallen sharply, to 
the point where U.S. analysts say that only about 250,000 remain. Meanwhile, 
they say, it appears that Iraqis are being moved into Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
To destroy Kuwait's national identity, Iraq has given new names to streets, 
hospitals and institutions. Iraqis are even reported to be erecting a life-size 
statue of Hussein in what was once a busy traffic circle in Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Iraqi soldiers are reported to have begun searching houses, 
inflicting beatings and even performing summary executions. At the same time, 
Iraq has spread the word that it is opening the borders temporarily, suggesting 
that Kuwaitis should take what may be their last opportunity to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say Iraqi soldiers are clearly following instructions. 
Houses have been ransacked by disciplined troops under the command of officers, 
they say, and are part of an orchestrated effort to create an atmosphere of 
chaos. One U.S. official described it as a campaign of "fear, terror and get 
out while you can." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say the Iraqi troops have invaded foreign embassy grounds in 
Kuwait many more times than has been publicly reported, also apparently under 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Special forces units don't just go out and do these things," one said.

HUSSEIN HOPES TO SURVIVE FIRST STRIKE, STIR OIL CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, convinced that American forces will attack 
within a month, believes he can ride out a first strike and then plunge the 
world economy into chaos by disabling Saudi Arabia's oil fields with chemical 
weapons or missiles, according to U.S. government analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Many civilian strategists have tended to dismiss as mere bluster the repeated 
public assertions by Iraqi officials that they can win a military conflict with 
U.S. and allied forces. But Administration experts on Iraq believe that those 
statements are sincere reflections of Hussein's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
And the conclusion that Hussein believes he can survive a U.S. strike has 
potentially profound consequences for the United States. Even if Hussein is 
wrong, his belief would sharply reduce his incentive to withdraw peacefully 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's thinking is that an American attack "could wipe out my air force, but 
you still have to come at me on the ground," said one government analyst. The 
Iraqi leader accepts estimates that Iraqi casualties in a war would vastly 
outnumber U.S. losses but calculates that his country "can stand 10,000 
casualties, but we (the United States) can't handle 1,000," the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the full array of information available to U.S. officials, government 
analysts have concluded that Iraq's strategy calls for dispersing its air force 
and missile batteries -- "hiding them in the date palms," as one put it. That, 
Baghdad calculates, will enable enough Iraqi weapons to survive a massive U.S. 
first strike to mount a deadly attack against the Saudi oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts say, Iraqi air and missile units have expanded their 
training for night operations, expecting that any American air strike would 
come under cover of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground, meantime, Hussein is thought to believe that Iraq's deeply 
entrenched troops, tanks and artillery could inflict horrendous casualties on 
attacking American units -- even if eventually forced to give ground. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Hussein's strategic planning, U.S. analysts say, is the belief that 
Washington cannot sustain a war against Iraq if the American public must absorb 
heavy casualties and other nations -- including those now arrayed against Iraq 
-- see their economies disrupted by skyrocketing oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the pressure, Administration analysts say, Hussein would be likely to 
unleash terrorist attacks against American targets. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein is convinced that under such conditions Bush would face enormous 
pressure at home and abroad to cease hostilities and negotiate with Iraq, 
Administration analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there appear to be few signs, if any, that the economic 
sanctions against Iraq have begun to undermine Hussein's internal position 
seriously. Food rationing appears to be going smoothly, U.S. officials believe, 
and the country probably has food supplies for at least another three months. 
</P>
<P>
There are no indications yet of major leaks in the sanctions, U.S. analysts 
say, but Administration officials are keeping watch on several potential holes, 
the largest of which would be Iran -- if the Iranians decide to help their 
longtime enemy. 
</P>
<P>
In recent diplomatic discussions between Tehran and Baghdad, the two countries 
have discussed the possibility of Iran taking Iraqi oil and exporting it around 
the international blockade, Administration officials say, although there are no 
signs yet that the talks have led to action. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions could be evaded by sending tankers from Iraq directly to Iran -- 
sailing through territorial waters of both countries where the international 
blockade force would have difficulty stopping them. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility for Tehran and Baghdad would be to build a short pipeline 
connecting the major pipeline networks of the two nations. Such a pipeline 
could be built in about 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Hussein appears to be hunkering down for a long siege. The Iraqi army, 
with more than 200,000 troops in Kuwait and another 150,000 in neighboring 
regions of Iraq, is dug in at heavily fortified positions designed to withstand 
a lengthy ground assault. The fortifications are similar to those used during 
the eight-year Iran-Iraq War: concentric rings of mine fields and anti-tank 
ditches backed by massed artillery and armor, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to inflicting heavy casualties on American forces, the Iraqis "have 
made it quite clear that in case of war, the first thing to go would be the 
Saudi oil fields," the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Both government and non-governmental experts agree that the Saudi oil 
installations are highly vulnerable. Many of the largest fields in eastern 
Saudi Arabia are well within range of Iraqi missiles, which have been 
test-fired carrying chemical warheads. Even the threat of chemical attack could 
well drive off the foreign workers who keep the oil flowing, effectively 
shutting the fields down. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, war would halt the tanker traffic through the Persian Gulf that 
brings most Middle Eastern oil to Western refineries, causing huge disruptions 
in an oil market already facing a shortfall of roughly 1 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's leaders appear to hope that such disruption would put the United States 
under "immediate pressure to stop" a war. If negotiations then began, Hussein 
could well hope to emerge with at least some of the Kuwaiti territory he has 
seized, analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
So far as protecting the oil fields is concerned, the Saudis for several years 
have been working on an extensive system of anti-aircraft and anti-missile 
defenses for their oil fields and industrial installations, but have not yet 
completed that work, U.S. military officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bush ordered American troops to Saudi Arabia, the United States has 
deployed its own advanced Patriot ground-to-air anti-missile system around the 
Saudi fields, the military officials add. But although the Patriot system is 
believed to be effective against Iraqi missiles, it cannot totally protect the 
large area of the oil fields against such an attack, officials concede. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how Iraq views its chances in a war parallels a debate among 
military officials in the United States and allied nations about the staying 
power of the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
One view -- that Iraq's army would crumble quickly, despite its tenacity in the 
long war with Iran -- is strongly held by some Air Force officials. The same 
position is taken -- at least publicly -- by officials of Arab governments who 
have been urging a quick U.S. military strike against Hussein in hopes of 
eliminating a dangerous adversary. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of war, "they're going to experience something few armies have 
ever experienced. We're not 13-year-old Iranians," said one high-ranking U.S. 
military strategist. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's forces are "an army that relied heavily on mass power, firepower -- and 
had the whole world behind them" in the war against Iran, said one senior Arab 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever that army needed, they got" from allies determined to see Iran lose, 
the diplomat added. "For every bullet they fired, you and France and Britain 
and the Soviet Union and Kuwait would send them three bullets. If a tank went 
out, they got two tanks. . . . If they wanted Pepsi-Cola, (they got it) all the 
way from Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
Now, isolated and facing an adversary with overwhelming air superiority, the 
Iraqi army would crumble much the way the supposedly "battle-hardened" Egyptian 
army crumbled against Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, the diplomat predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Former Air Force Chief of Staff Michael J. Dugan advanced a similar argument, 
telling reporters from The Times and the Washington Post in an interview last 
week that the Iraqi air force would collapse in "minutes . . . not hours" if 
war came. 
</P>
<P>
In firing Dugan, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney chastised him for publicly 
"underestimating" the capability of the Iraqis. Other military officials share 
Cheney's more pessimistic view. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will prevail ultimately, but I think it will be costly," retired 
Adm. William J. Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a 
televised interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our air will take a tremendous toll on them. I really believe that. 
But I don't think that that alone would do it," Crowe said. "We will have to 
seize ground. We will pay a price." 
</P>
<P>
Much depends on the morale of Iraqi forces, a factor about which experts 
differ. During the war with Iran, Iraqi forces showed great tenacity while 
defending their home soil but much less initiative when defending conquered 
ground. How theywould perform in defending conquests in Kuwait -- an area many 
Iraqis have long considered rightfully a part of their country -- cannot yet be 
known.

CAMBODIA'S FOUR FACTIONS CAN'T AGREE ON ANYTHING; 
</P>
<P>
ASIA: THE BREAKDOWN IS A BLOW TO HOPES FOR PEACE. NO DATE IS SET TO RESUME THE 
TALKS.

The first meeting of a council representing Cambodia's four warring factions 
collapsed in acrimony Wednesday, dealing a severe blow to hopes for a speedy 
transition to peace. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended after three days in Thailand, the only place that the four 
adversaries would agree to sit down together. Although the breakdown was 
described as a temporary adjournment, no date was given for a resumption. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to reach any agreement at all," Premier Hun Sen said 
before leaving for Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Sept. 10 in Jakarta, Indonesia, the four factions agreed to put 
aside their differences and form a Supreme National Council to serve as 
Cambodia's executive authority for a transitional period during which the 
United Nations would assume many of the functions of government. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for a 12-member council composed of six representatives 
from the Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh and six members 
representing the three resistance factions that have waged war against the 
government since 1979, when a Vietnamese invasion drove out the brutal Khmer 
Rouge and installed a pro-Hanoi government. The factions are the Communist 
Khmer Rouge, plus two others led by exiled Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son 
Sann, a former prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The talks broke down over a vague provision of the Jakarta agreement that 
provides for a chairman who would be the council's 13th member. The agreement 
left this to be decided later. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bangkok talks, the resistance coalition insisted that Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk, the deposed ruler of Cambodia, be appointed as chairman. The Phnom 
Penh government, seeking to maintain numerical balance on the council, insisted 
that Sihanouk also be one of the 12 council members, or that the Phnom Penh 
government be given an additional vote as a counterbalance. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat commented that squabbles are to be expected when such bitter enemies 
sit down together for the first time. More than 1 million people have died in 
Cambodia since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate problem raised by the collapse of the talks is that the 
Cambodians now have no delegation to send to the United Nations later this 
month to take Cambodia's seat in the General Assembly. The seat is now held by 
the resistance coalition, but the United States has said it will no longer 
support this situation. 
</P>
<P>
After taking over the U.N. seat, the Supreme National Council was supposed to 
enter into negotiations with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security 
Council -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- on 
implementing their plan for bringing peace to Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for U.N. officials to take over the administration of Cambodia, 
supervise a cease-fire and organize free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Despite agreement to accept the U.N. plan in its entirety, logistic questions 
and matters of protocol bedeviled the first session. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting opened at the Cambodian Embassy in Bangkok, technically Cambodian 
territory. The participants were so wrapped up in the arrangements that their 
Thai hosts finally agreed to drive all four factions into the embassy in a 
giant red bus so that none could claim to have arrived first.

<P>
Northern California farmer Topper Van Loben Sels is putting off buying another 
tractor this year. Instead, he will repair the old one and hope it lasts 
through the spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
Van Loben Sels, who works his family's 3,000-acre farm south of Sacramento with 
his brother, expects the Persian Gulf crisis to force him to scrounge up an 
extra $50,000 to cover diesel fuel costs for this year's harvest. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of thousands of farmers across the nation who will soak up much of an 
estimated $1.7 billion per year in higher farm production expenses if oil 
prices remain around $30 a barrel -- up from the $20 range -- as a result of 
the cutoff of oil exports from Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers will be hit doubly hard: The trade sanctions imposed against Iraq 
and unusually competitive European Community grain markets are reducing demand 
for U.S. grain exports, causing prices to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER SHELF PRICES: American consumers can expect to pay part of the fuel bill 
in the form of increased food prices, a recent projection by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture says. 
</P>
<P>
Higher transportation costs are expected to boost retail food prices about 2% 
next year, the agency said. And that will be on top of an estimated 5% increase 
caused by general inflation. 
</P>
<P>
This year, food prices are increasing 5% to 7%, reflecting factors largely 
unrelated to the Middle East crisis, such as sharply higher prices for beef, 
pork, dairy and fresh fruit, the agency says. Last year's 5.8% increase was the 
biggest food price climb since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER BAD BREAK: For farmers, the Persian Gulf situation has become one more 
complication among the usual array of unforeseen natural phenomena and 
unpredictable supply and demand fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in southern Illinois, corn crops were planted late in the season 
because of heavy rainfall, so the corn must be artificially dried by propane 
gas heaters before it can be stored for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
For Dick Lathrop, the gulf crisis will add $250 each day to his average 
$500-a-day propane bill. 
</P>
<P>
EXPORTS SUFFERING: Montana's grain farmers are getting whipsawed by the Iraq 
embargo. Not only are their costs for fuel and fertilizers rising as a result 
of the disruption of crude oil shipments, but demand for wheat is unusually low 
and worldwide production is high. 
</P>
<P>
Because of extremely low European grain prices, the U.S. subsidy program 
offered the highest bonus levels in years last week, paying more than $50 a ton 
contrasted with an average $28 a ton in the last few years, an Agriculture 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Export Enhancement Program distributes surplus, government-owned 
commodities, called "bonuses," to exporters to compensate for U.S. exports sold 
at world-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that export prices are dropping, importers are buying less 
U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq imports more than 75% of its food, and the loss of 1.4 million tons of 
Iraqi wheat purchases is hurting U.S. farmers. Iraq also has been the largest 
market for U.S. rice exports. 
</P>
<P>
POOR OUTLOOK: In California, a summer drought stunted crop production. The Van 
Loben Sels are now harvesting their 500 acres of tomatoes, and low production 
coupled with a preset contract price with Campbell's Soup Co. are tilting the 
economics against the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We can all take Mother Nature, because you expect ups and downs, so you put 
that in your budget," Topper Van Loben Sels said. "But fuel, well, you pretty 
much figure on it varying only a penny or two. Now, the fuel hike is just one 
more thing to deal with."

PERSIAN GULF CRISIS STIRS PREDICTIONS OF FINAL CONFLICT;

<P>
PROPHECY BOOKS SELL WELL AMID FORECASTS OF THE COMING OF CHRIST AND THE 
MESSIAH.

<P>
As the threat of a major war in the Persian Gulf has heated up in recent weeks, 
so have religious predictions of a fiery Armageddon and the end of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The doomsayers -- whose prophecy books are selling well in Christian bookstores 
-- see the Middle East crisis as the trigger for a bloody series of events that 
will lead to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leader of an ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jewish movement is 
predicting that a cataclysmic clash in Iraq will usher in the first arrival of 
the Messiah before the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bible-inspired apocalyptic warnings are nothing new. But times of political 
unrest and socioeconomic hardship feed existing curiosity and fuel the belief 
that -- this time -- the end really is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"In any era when there is a dramatic international event, someone is always 
ready to link it to the end of the world," said Richard Gorsuch, professor of 
psychology at Fuller Seminary's Graduate School of Psychology in Pasadena. 
"Each event can square with some of the prophecy passages; it depends which 
ones you emphasize." 
</P>
<P>
Last month at an Episcopal church in Kennebunkport, Me., evangelist Billy 
Graham preached on biblical Babylonia, a part of the Middle East that is now 
included in Iraq. President Bush -- a vestryman in the church -- listened as 
Graham warned that upheavals in the Persian Gulf could have "major spiritual 
implications." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, Graham said that "these events are happening in that 
part of the world where history began, and, the Bible says, where history as we 
know it, will some day end." 
</P>
<P>
The evangelist said later that he couldn't agree with those who identify Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein as the Antichrist: "Historians tell us that people 
thought Napoleon was the Antichrist, they thought Mussolini was the Antichrist 
and they thought Hitler was the Antichrist," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the nation's estimated 50 million conservative Christians are 
thumbing their Bibles and paying rapt attention to specific end-times 
scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelist Greg Laurie, drawing a crowd of more than 25,000 to a talk on Bible 
prophecy in the Pacific Amphitheatre in Orange, said recently that Hussein 
seems to be taking on a role as heir apparent to warrior King Nebuchadnezzar 
and his ancient Babylonian empire. Hussein is fulfilling prophecies in the 
biblical books of Daniel and Revelation, leading to the time when all nations 
will unite in war against Israel, according to Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a sermon at the Fundamentalist Bible Tabernacle in Los Angeles, the 
Rev. R. L. Hymers thundered that the Middle East crisis and the West's need for 
Arab oil "may very well be . . . (what) unites the West under one man that the 
Bible calls in First John the Antichrist." 
</P>
<P>
According to William Alnor of Philadelphia, a prophecy student who said sales 
of his book, "Soothsayers of the Second Advent," have picked up recently, Bush 
is "allowing the Soviet Union to be a full player in the Middle East for the 
first time ever." This could "foreshadow a military move against Israel that 
could very well result in the second coming of Christ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lubavich movement Rabbi Menachem Schneerson of New York has told his followers, 
however, that a clash in the Persian Gulf will shake the world, "and then the 
Messiah will come and proclaim that salvation is at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Schneerson, 88, has excited many within the ultra-Orthodox wing of Judaism in 
Israel with his interpretation of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in the gulf is definitely part of the preparation for 
redemption," Lubavitcher Moshe Schlass of Jerusalem told a Wall Street Journal 
reporter. "What's going on now is like labor pains. It looks pretty messy. But, 
in the end, what will come out is a new, living light. The Messiah may be just 
an eye blink away." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone expecting the Apocalypse is religiously motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need God to finish it for us," booms a deep voice on San Francisco's 
new voice-mail "Hotline of Doom," inaugurated by the Society for Secular 
Armageddonism. "The coming end will be a strictly do-it-yourself apocalypse." 
</P>
<P>
Callers to (415) 673-DOOM hear warnings about nuclear and chemical weapons 
proliferation, toxic waste, deforestation, global warming, acid rain, 
increasing racism, AIDS, overpopulation, complacency and greed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately," writes William F. Allman, senior editor of U.S. News &amp; World 
Report, "the allure of the Apocalypse may lie in the very human trait of 
wanting simple solutions to complex problems."

U.S. SEEKS REDUCED PHILIPPINE MILITARY PRESENCE 
</P>

The United States will go to the negotiating table here today ready to propose 
a sharp reduction, but not an end, to the U.S. military presence in the 
Philippines over the next 10 to 12 years, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, sources said, the Pentagon, wants to keep as many as 5,000 
troops, about a third of the present number, and retain access well into the 
next century for visiting U.S. troops, ships and planes to what are now 
American-run military installations. 
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that President Bush's negotiator, former Assistant 
Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, will propose a "phase-down" of U.S. 
troops rather than a phase-out. Newspaper reports from Washington last week 
suggested that the United States is prepared to withdraw from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"Phase-down means a reduction," one official said, "but still some presence, 
still some access. (It's) not lock the gates, throw away the key and go home." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to trade presence for access," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the U.S. delegation, said of the military 
facilities: "They will be Philippine bases to which the U.S. would hope to have 
some access as it has with other countries around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Schrager did not provide specifics. However, the sources said Washington hopes 
to keep access to Clark Air Base, the naval base on Subic Bay and the pilot 
combat training range at Crow Valley 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposals are likely to meet stiff resistance from the Philippine 
side, led by Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus. Leading political figures in 
Manila this week called for a withdrawal period of five to 10 years, leading to 
full conversion of the military facilities to civilian management and use. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 16,000 troops, plus about 22,000 dependents and 
Defense Department employees, at six military facilities in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Formal negotiations began Tuesday on the future of the bases, hours after 
Philippine President Corazon Aquino called, for the first time, for an orderly 
withdrawal of U.S. forces. Both sides attribute the new attitudes to reduced 
tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and a rising tide of 
Philippine nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is expected to end Friday and to resume later in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine spokesman Rafael Alunan III said a formal agreement is not likely 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Americans were warned Wednesday night of "a possible imminent terrorist 
bombing" by the Communist New People's Army in the neighborhood where the talks 
are being held. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said in Washington that the danger was "in the 
vicinity of Roxas Boulevard in Manila." Several hotels, the U.S. Embassy and 
the central bank building where the bases talks are being held lie along the 
boulevard.

READY FOR NEW STEPS IN GULF, BUSH SAYS; 
</P>

U.S. POLICY: REMARKS AT A POLITICAL FUND-RAISER REAFFIRM STAND TAKEN AT 
HELSINKI SUMMIT.

President Bush said Wednesday that if the current economic embargo of Iraq and 
other efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis fail, 
"we are prepared to take additional steps." 
</P>
<P>
Although White House officials sought to play down the President's remarks -- 
because they echoed comments he made in Helsinki 10 days earlier when he met 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- they had the effect of throwing down, 
once again, a challenge to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In Helsinki, the two leaders had agreed that they were prepared to go beyond 
the current round of sanctions that have cut Iraq's income-producing oil 
shipments, as well as crucial food imports and weapons trade, in the 
international effort to force Hussein to pull occupying troops out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after their daylong summit in the Finnish capital, 
Bush and Gorbachev said that, if the current steps fail, "we are prepared to 
consider additional ones consistent with the U.N. Charter." The sanctions, 
prohibiting trade with Iraq, have been implemented under the direction of the 
U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that Bush was 
referring at the time to additional economic sanctions. But he also said that, 
because the joint statement did not rule out military force as an option and 
because it raised the prospects of additional action, it had the effect of 
advancing the possibility that a military course eventually could be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bush and other senior Administration officials have appeared 
extremely reluctant to suggest that there might be military steps. Thus, Bush's 
remarks Wednesday could be interpreted as raising that flag again. 
</P>
<P>
But even as Bush appeared to hold out the prospect for a military solution, a 
senior Administration official, who insisted on anonymity, seemed to moderate 
that message, saying as Bush arrived here after an overnight stay in Los 
Angeles that the President had no specific steps in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Gates, Bush's deputy national security adviser, said, "We've always 
said we would keep our options open if the sanctions didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday at a fund-raising luncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson's 
gubernatorial campaign, Bush repeated the three primary goals of the nations 
aligned against the Aug. 2 invasion: 
</P>
<P>
Complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration of Kuwait's "legitimate" government, the royal Sabah family that 
was overthrown by the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom for the vast numbers of foreign hostages being held in Iraq, many of 
them as "human shields" to protect against attacks on sensitive military sites. 
</P>
<P>
About 82 Americans are believed being held as prisoners in Iraq, and another 
1,400 are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Humanity will tolerate nothing less" than implementation of these goals, Bush 
said. 
</P>

"If Iraq does not meet these non-negotiable conditions, then its isolation will 
not end," the President said. "We are, as I've said before, prepared to take 
additional steps if sanctions and the quest for a political resolution do not 
work." 
</P>
<P>
He inserted the phrase, "as I've said before," into his prepared text, after 
reporters, given a copy of the speech by the White House before Bush spoke, 
questioned whether the President was sending a new, toughened signal. 
</P>
<P>
The President has refused to say how long he would wait to determine whether 
the sanctions are working before opting for increasing the pressure -- either 
through additional sanctions, tighter enforcement of the existing embargo by 
trying to crack down on air shipments to Iraq or by unleashing the more than 
150,000 U.S. troops deployed throughout the region. About 360,000 Iraqi 
soldiers are now stationed in Kuwait and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials repeatedly have said over the last several weeks that the 
sanctions are beginning to bite, causing shortages and rationing in Iraq. But 
while these officials have said that it could be many months -- possibly a year 
-- before the sanctions would force Hussein to retreat, other officials have 
suggested that military action could come much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Although the joint U.S.-Soviet declaration in Helsinki leaves open the 
possibility of further steps under the U.N. Charter, it is not clear whether 
the charter, in effect, would provide a blessing for military operations. In 
addition, such a move would be likely to create sizable cracks in the 
impressive display of international unity that greeted the initial embargo. 
Indeed, Gorbachev has appeared considerably more reluctant to move toward a 
military resolution than has Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush described the Helsinki statement as "extraordinary" and said: "It is an 
absolutely unparalleled message of solidarity -- a clarion call for Iraq to 
comply, immediately and completely, with the five resolutions which had been so 
urgently ordered by the U.N. Security Council. It heralds a new era for our 
world -- the Soviet Union and the United States standing together in vigorous 
condemnation of an outrageous aggression.

KEY ALLY FROM START, TURKEY SETTLES IN FOR LONG SIEGE; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: THE NATO MEMBER, HARD HIT ECONOMICALLY, KEEPS UP PRESSURE ON IRAQ.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pivotal American ally from the opening round of the Persian Gulf crisis, 
Turkey is settling in for a long siege, exerting tough economic, military and 
psychological pressure on neighboring Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
So far this week, Turkey has welcomed nearly two dozen U.S. F-16 interceptors 
to an air base in the south that is already crowded with American ordnance, and 
it has extended by a year the expiring leases on more than a dozen American 
bases and listening posts on Turkish soil. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, President Turgut Ozal will fly to Washington for lunch with 
President Bush; the two have been in touch by phone regularly since Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and have agreed on virtually everything. Now both want 
to keep unremitting pressure on Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Ozal will seek short-term U.S. economic concessions and, for the 
longer term, increased military aid. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal says that siding with the United States is a matter of principle for which 
Turkey expects no direct pay-back. But as Washington knows, and is grateful 
for, in confronting Iraq, Turkey has abandoned a neutralist role in Middle East 
affairs that had been a pillar of Turkish foreign policy since the collapse of 
the Ottoman Empire after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
In a region where racial hatred runs deep, it is a truism that Turks and Arabs 
dislike one another. 
</P>
<P>
"We ruled these Arab countries for 400 years, and they don't look at the Turks 
as friends," Yilmar Usluer, a retired admiral and editor of M5 Strategic 
Magazine, said in a recent interview. "But we cannot stay isolated. Turkey took 
sides; it had to take sides. If there is a fire in your neighbor's house, you 
are affected." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, Turkey has taken center stage in the Middle East. Without Turkish 
support, economic sanctions against Iraq could not succeed. The closure of 
pipelines that carried about half of Iraq's oil to world markets and the 
rupture of commerce -- along with a decline in tourism and other losses, 
including $1 billion in exports -- will cost Turkey around $5 billion a year, 
Central Bank governor Rusdu Saracoglu estimates. 
</P>
<P>
All this will mean a spurt in inflation and a 20% decline in growth in 1990 -- 
to a still-robust 8% -- but it is a bill that must be paid, in the official 
Turkish view. Twice so far, Turkey has rebuffed official Iraqi overtures -- 
promises of cheap oil -- to ease the pressure. A shipload of Argentine beef 
consigned to Iraq marks time in a Turkish warehouse. Suspicious Bulgarian cargo 
flights bound for Baghdad are denied overflight rights by Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Without Turkish military pressure, Hussein would have as many as 100,000 
additional troops available against the U.S.-led multinational force in Saudi 
Arabia. With Turkey neutral in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, Hussein did not 
defend his border with the Turks. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the global response to the invasion of Kuwait, though, Turkey 
swiftly reinforced its forces on the Iraqi border, with up to 85,000 men by one 
estimate. Now, military sources say, there are up to nine Iraqi divisions -- 
about 100,000 men, or nearly 10% of Hussein's armed strength -- in defensive 
positions on the Turkish frontier. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has destroyed any military benefit of Saddam Hussein's accord with 
Iran," said Seyfi Tashan, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, a private 
think tank. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the air base at Incirlik, near Adana in southern Turkey, normally 
home for about 9,200 U.S. service personnel and their dependents, bristles with 
newly arrived firepower. Usually, there are no U.S. warplanes based at 
Incirlik; they are rotated in and out for training. Now, though, there are 14 
U.S. F-111 fighter-bombers from England at the base. 
</P>
<P>
This week, they and four F-16 fighters there since last month for training were 
joined by 20 F-16s from Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid, according to a 
spokeswoman at the base. No one expects the F-16s to return any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ozal ramrodded a war powers bill through the Turkish Parliament 
earlier this month. It allows the dispatch of Turkish troops abroad and the 
stationing of foreign troops in Turkey. There is no expectation that Turkey 
will send troops to join the allied force in Saudi Arabia, but a senior Turkish 
diplomat described the war powers act as a psychological maneuver by Ozal to 
keep Saddam Hussein off-balance. The diplomat thinks sanctions rather than war 
are the best means of forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal, who believes Turkey's future lies with the West and has applied for 
membership in the European Community, is by all accounts enjoying himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He is clearly liking what he is doing," one Turkish official said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents complain that Ozal displays the same one-man high-handedness in 
handling the gulf crisis that he uses to run the country, but public opinion is 
with him. Turkey, an Islamic but secular and democratic country of 56 million 
people situated between East and West, finds itself not seeking friends but 
being sought out and praised. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Ozal talk with Bush; his ministers deal with the Iraqis, and also 
with the Iranians, providing a conduit to the West. If Turkey is enjoying this 
unaccustomed regional role, it may be a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
That, Turkish officials say, will mean upgrading the large but dated Turkish 
armed forces, which are getting $500 million in U.S. military aid this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal may raise the military aid issue with Bush, but it would be at the risk of 
alarming the strong Greek lobby on Capitol Hill. U.S. military aid to Turkey 
and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but 
constantly at odds over the Aegean Sea and divided Cyprus, is currently 
apportioned at a ratio of 10 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the European Community, Japan and the oil-rich gulf states 
have all promised to compensate Turkey, Egypt and Jordan for their losses in 
implementing sanctions.

YELTSIN GETS APPROVAL FOR SEPARATE KGB; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: SECURITY AGENCY UNDER LOCAL CONTROL IN HIS FEDERATION COULD CAUSE 
TREMORS.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a development symbolizing the shift of Soviet political power, Russian 
Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin said Wednesday he has received 
permission, in principle, to form a separate KGB state security agency for his 
republic that would be under local control. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, the anti-Establishment politician who once portrayed himself as the 
target of a KGB assassination plot, told the Russian Federation Parliament that 
he discussed the founding of a separate state security agency with KGB Chairman 
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and received Kryuchkov's consent. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative basis for the independent agency, which would break more than 
seven decades of monolithic and legally unfettered Soviet state security 
operations, could be in place by November, Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader's announcement, reported by the official Soviet news agency 
Tass, is likely to resound throughout Soviet society, where millions still fear 
or loathe the descendant of V. I. Lenin's Cheka and Josef Stalin's NKVD. They 
believe the KGB has remained above the law, despite President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent demonstration of the suspicion and hostility aroused by the KGB 
came on Sunday, when a crowd broke into the agency's local offices in Tbilisi, 
the capital of Georgia, and seized documents, video equipment and other 
property of KGB officials. They demanded that the KGB be abolished in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
In a vigorous reaction, the KGB denounced the "extremist manifestation of a 
frantic campaign against state security bodies" and blamed "Western special 
services" for inciting its foes by spreading anti-KGB propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the visiting board of directors and executives of the 
Associated Press wire service, Kryuchkov on Wednesday also highlighted the 
changes in his agency by saying that the Soviet Union is willing to share 
intelligence on Iraq with the United States, the AP reported. But it said 
Kryuchkov added that such an offer hadn't been made directly to the CIA because 
past KGB proposals of assistance had been rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced we could really tell each other something valuable," Kryuchkov 
told his American guests, without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
By seeking local control over the Committee on State Security, or KGB in 
Russian for short, Yeltsin reverses centuries of practice that have allowed the 
national government, or ruler, to run an internal surveillance network. Some 
historians trace that practice to Ivan the Terrible's band of murderous thugs, 
the oprichina, which answered to the 16th Century czar alone. 
</P>
<P>
With the ex-Communist Yeltsin now at its head, Russia has been a closely 
watched bellwether for other Soviet republics seeking to break the hammerlock 
of the central bureaucracy's control. 
</P>
<P>
By agreeing to allow a Russian KGB, the national government would make it 
nearly inevitable that each constituent republic will acquire its own agency, 
further limiting the ability of central authorities to determine what officials 
on the periphery should do. 
</P>
<P>
That concession to greater home rule, in the framework of the new federal 
arrangement being debated here, may be necessary to salvage anything like 
today's KGB. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB has vast and varied responsibilities, from checking the passports of 
foreign travelers who land at Moscow's airports and patrolling the country's 
borders to counterespionage at home and spying operations overseas. Under 
Gorbachev, it has also been drafted into the battle against organized crime and 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s, the KGB hounded political dissenters, a 
function that is now regarded by many here as a shameful phase of its 
existence. But under a Gorbachev-mandated restructuring, it replaced the 
anti-dissident department with one charged with protecting the Soviet 
constitution about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, the KGB's political functions remain too secret and hence 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Before he became the Russian Federation's president this summer, Yeltsin told a 
murky and bizarre tale of attempted assassination, claiming that he was 
crossing over a river in a Moscow suburb when a car ran him off a bridge. His 
account was never clear, and many gossiped that he had simply quarreled with 
his mistress. Some Soviets, however, sensed a KGB plot to murder their 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
What Yeltsin and Kryuchkov apparently have in mind is a division of labor 
between the new Russian Federation agency and the national KGB, whose Moscow 
headquarters in the grim and gray Lubyanka Prison still arouse a shudder in 
citizens who recall the millions unjustly confined or shot in Stalin's terror 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not immediately clear how the work would be split.

BULGARIA PREMIER NAMES NEW MOSTLY-SOCIALIST CABINET;

BALKANS: HOPES FOR A COALITION GOVERNMENT FADE AS THE OPPOSITION FRONT REJECTS 
COAXING.

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid deteriorating economic conditions that include worsening shortages of 
consumer goods and fuel, Bulgaria's Socialist prime minister announced a new 
government Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet nominated by Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov includes only one 
non-Socialist, although the list was not complete. The remaining ministers are 
expected to be named when the National Assembly votes today on the government, 
Lukanov's second in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Socialists -- formerly the Communists who ruled Bulgaria for 
decades -- won multi-party elections in June, the nation has been without an 
effective government. Despite extended effort, the Socialists have been unable 
to coax leading opposition groups of the United Democratic Front into a 
coalition government, a deadlock that some analysts say led to paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Lukanov said: "I am still not happy about not being 
able to form a multi-party government because I think that's what Bulgaria 
needs most. But Bulgaria needs a government because the present situation can 
have unpredictable consequences and can deeply hurt Bulgaria and its standing 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Since the election, the first free vote in four decades, the Socialists have 
come under increasing attack as key food and other items have vanished from 
shops and as oil shortages have disrupted daily life. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the authorities announced that white and yellow cheese, an important 
food item here, will be rationed for the foreseeable future, and intermittent 
power blackouts hit some parts of Sofia, underscoring a fuel crisis that the 
government predicts will worsen in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists here are already waiting in lines up to three miles long and for up 
to 36 hours to fill up their cars with gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel crunch comes from a double blow: the sudden jolt to world oil prices 
triggered by the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the decision by the Soviet 
Union to demand hard currency for continued supplies of petroleum products to 
its Eastern European allies. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lukanov said he plans to organize a national program to mobilize 
local sources of energy, including coal and wood, to help make up the 
shortfalls. He also appealed to the West for aid, noting that Bulgaria has 
strictly observed U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq, which have contributed 
to his nation's shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
The cash-strapped Bulgarian government has already suspended payments on its 
$10.3-billion foreign debt and has also appealed to the Soviet Union for 
economic aid to help get the country through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be famine in the real sense of the word," President 
Zhelyu Zhelev said recently, "but poverty is a fact." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say they hope to avoid meat rationing for at least the next two 
months, but the recent long lines outside meat markets reflect the already 
short supplies of beef and pork. Most shoppers were lining up to buy large 
quantities of a cheap sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer complaints are directed at a variety of targets. Some shoppers blame 
farmers for withholding goods from the capital; some attack poor market 
organization, and most level their anger at the Socialist government for 
failing to get a grip on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cheese and meat, Sofia residents say sugar, detergent, toilet 
paper and children's clothes are difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most troubling to most consumers is the warning by the government that 
electricity will be rationed to homes and industry this winter. Electrical 
energy to industry will be cut by an estimated 10% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
In his proposed Cabinet, Lukanov dropped Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov, who 
had been in office for 28 years, and replaced him with Yordan Mutafchiev. But 
there were few new names in the list. All are former Communists except for 
Science Minister Ilya Konev, who is not a national figure and has no known 
affiliation.

For the first time in its history, the UC Berkeley campus was shut down and 
evacuated Wednesday afternoon because of a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
A mid-morning telephone caller representing an unknown group called the United 
Unification Front claimed that four bombs had been planted on campus. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with the FBI, campus police took the threat seriously enough 
to evacuate thousands of students, faculty and staff. But after searching the 
campus for several hours, police found only one "suspicious-looking" package 
which turned out to be harmless. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it was possible the package had been left by the callers as part of 
a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
The campus reopened at 7 p.m.

A statewide anti-litter campaign is scheduled to begin Saturday with more than 
12,000 volunteers working to remove trash from the highways, roads and beaches. 
The campaign includes billboards featuring a trash can full of garbage and a 
sign that says, "Learn to hold it until you get to the can. Don't litter."

GATES, BLOCK ANNOUNCE BACKING OF LUNGREN 
</P>

Los Angeles' two top cops endorsed Republican Dan Lungren's bid for state 
attorney general Wednesday, triggering a debate over whether Lungren or his 
Democratic opponent, Arlo Smith, can claim top bragging rights to the crucial 
support of California's vast law enforcement community. In announcing their 
support for Lungren, Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates cited the former five-term congressman's personal character and his 
aggressive anti-crime stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe him to be an individual with impeccable integrity and credibility 
and one who will serve the cause of justice in this state," Block said at a 
Burbank news conference. "During the time he served in Congress he was always 
available and always responsive." 
</P>
<P>
Echoed Gates: "(Lungren) will look at the problems of crime, of gangs, of 
narcotics in California and aggressively beat those problems." Both Block and 
Gates are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, law enforcement officers backing Smith held press conferences 
in Los Angeles and Sacramento to reaffirm their support for the 11-year San 
Francisco district attorney. Among them was Mel Jones, president of the Assn. 
for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, whose 7,000 members work for Block. 
</P>
<P>
"Voters are faced with a distinct choice for attorney general -- a law 
enforcement professional with 36 years' experience prosecuting criminals or a 
politician who has never prosecuted a case," said Jones, speaking on the steps 
of the downtown Criminal Courts Building. "Dan Lungren could only qualify for 
an entry-level position in the attorney general's office if he were to apply 
for a job instead of run for one." 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to counter Lungren, Smith backers in Sacramento went so far as 
to trot out a dog owned by Smith's press secretary to poke fun at the 
Republican's campaign biography. The 4-year-old collie, they said, recently 
received a membership card from the Washington-based Assn. of Federal 
Investigators, which once awarded a "Legislator of the Year" honor to Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
As the November election nears, the two candidates for the state's top law 
enforcement position have placed a high priority on endorsements from the 
plethora of police organizations across the state and nation. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Lungren, who helped draft and win passage of major anti-crime 
legislation while in Congress, has won the backing of most management-oriented 
California police organizations. Smith, who once headed the criminal division 
of the state attorney general's office, has been endorsed by some of the 
largest police rank-and-file labor organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren called Wednesday's endorsements by the high-profile Block and Gates -- 
as well as those from organizations such as the California Police Chiefs Assn. 
and the California State Police Assn. -- among "the most important" events of 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"With the help of the people that they represent, I intend to help lead a fight 
in this state to make sure we balance the score on the side of the 
law-abiding," said Lungren. "I want to shine the light of day on the 
shenanigans that go on in Sacramento in the Legislature that ensure . . . the 
cries of (crime) victims and the urgings of law enforcement are not heard." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren also pledged to fight for stiffer sanctions against casual drug users, 
although he stopped far short of backing Gates' recent controversial remarks to 
a U.S. Senate committee that casual users should be shot.

HAYES BOTCHING SCHOOL BONDS, BROWN SAYS

On a hot, sun-baked schoolyard, Democrat Kathleen Brown warmed up the race for 
state treasurer Wednesday, claiming that incumbent Thomas W. Hayes has 
"mismanaged" the financing of the school bond program in a way that has cost 
schools $37 million in higher interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a former Los Angeles school board member who loves to use schools as a 
backdrop for press events, struck a teacherly tone in attacking her Republican 
opponent. She said: "If we were to give him a grade, we'd have to give him an F 
for mismanagement in the area of school finance." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Lucas, Hayes' campaign manager, responded: "I'd have to give her an I for 
incomplete because of her lack of information." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, in an earlier statement, contended that Hayes "has earned more money and 
sold more bonds for education than any other treasurer in California's 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Striking back on a more personal level, Lucas pointed out that Brown quit her 
elected job on the Los Angeles school board to move with her husband to New 
York in 1980. "She quit the Los Angeles Board of Education abruptly in the 
middle of her second term when L.A. school kids needed her the most," Lucas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown called that a cheap shot, saying her decision to give up her seat was 
made solely to keep her family together. "What transpired in my personal life 
and my family life is something totally outside of my control," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Triggering the campaign potshots was a treasurer's office policy that requires 
schools to temporarily borrow money for construction projects from the state's 
Pooled Money Investment Fund, even when voters have approved state bond issues 
that could provide the money at a lower interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer's office ultimately issues the bonds for school construction, but 
only when the projects are well under way or even completed. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes claims his hands are tied by requirements stemming from a 1986 federal 
tax law. The law allows state and local governments to sell bonds only when the 
construction projects are ready to go. In the past, governments had floated the 
bonds, put the money in the bank and earned substantial interest on it while 
waiting for projects to be readied. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, however, argues that Hayes is being excessively cautious in interpreting 
the law -- and his caution is costing the schools dearly. By paying the higher 
interest rates, she says, schools have lost at least $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
She used the playground of a severely overcrowded school in South Sacramento to 
illustrate her contention that money lost by Hayes could have built as many as 
seven new schools around the state. Prairie Elementary School was built for 350 
students and currently serves nearly 1,250. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's contention was supported by Diane Kirkum, a special assistant to state 
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig. She said the Department of Education 
calculates that schools spend roughly $50 million a year on interest payments 
to the Pooled Money Investment Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure that $90 million has been charged to the school construction program 
over the last two years for interest that must be paid to the Pooled Money 
Investment Fund," she said. Kirkum added that the system will require that $100 
million more be set aside over the next two years. "Those monies otherwise 
could be used to build schools," she said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITION 130; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCIAL TRIES TO SHOW SUPPORT IS MAINSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of Proposition 130, designed to save California's forests from 
logging, began their advertising campaign Wednesday with a commercial intended 
to show mainstream support for the forestry measure. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second television commercial, which will be aired through Sept. 30 in 
most major media markets, shows a fresh-faced state park ranger in a Smokey 
Bear hat strolling through a grove of trees and bemoaning the loss of giant 
redwoods. The ranger notes that the California State Park Rangers Assn., the 
Audubon Society and the Sierra Club support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial comes at a time when opponents are linking the measure to the 
radical Earth First! environmental group in radio commercials. The group is not 
a sponsor of Proposition 130, although members of Earth First! may support it 
and were hired along with others to circulate petitions to qualify it for the 
Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no involvement with Earth First! whatsoever," said Proposition 130 
spokesman Steven Glacier, accusing opponents of a "smear tactic. . . . We are 
backed by mainstream groups. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130 would ban clear-cutting on all timberlands statewide. It 
defines clear-cutting as the removal at one time of 60% or more of trees from 
2.5 acres or more, or, in the Sierra Nevada, from five acres or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all of the cutting that is done in California now could be called a 
clear-cut under that definition," said Ross Johnson, chief of forest practice 
regulation for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would put environmentalists on a state forestry board that 
decides appeals to logging plans. Environmental groups charge that the 
governor-appointed board now is dominated by supporters of the logging 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138, a countermeasure put forth by the forest products industry, 
would ban clear-cutting only of old-growth or ancient forests and reduce by 50% 
clear-cutting in other forests. 
</P>
<P>
But the countermeasure defines clear-cutting differently from Proposition 130. 
Johnson said Proposition 138 follows the state's definition, meaning that all 
but about six sizable trees could be removed from an acre. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial for Proposition 130, the park ranger notes that only 5% of 
the state's ancient redwoods remain. According to the state forestry 
department, California still has about 1.6 million acres of redwood forests, 
but about 95% of them have been cut down at least once or twice. Some species 
of wildlife depend on virgin forests for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Although the television commercial may reassure voters that the initiative does 
not represent merely the views of an extremist group, the ad also provides the 
opposition with another opportunity to criticize the involvement of a San Mateo 
financial adviser in the anti-logging effort. 
</P>
<P>
As required by law, backers of Proposition 130 note that funding for the ad 
came from H.L. Arbit, as well as from environmental groups. Opponents claim 
that Harold Arbit, the financial adviser, has major holdings in timber and 
paper companies that primarily do business outside California and hence would 
profit by Proposition 130's passage. Forestry workers and their families staged 
a demonstration in front of the Pacific Stock Exchange on Tuesday to protest 
what they said would be huge profits for Arbit if the measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
Arbit, however, says he contributed $940,000 to the measure because of 
long-held concerns about logging practices and not for personal financial gain. 
He says he personally owns no stocks and maintains that timber stocks he bought 
for his clients represent a tiny fraction, about one-fifteenth, of their 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to changing logging practices, Proposition 130 would authorize $742 
million in state general obligation bonds to purchase remaining ancient forests 
and save them from logging. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that the measure would reduce logging by 70% and eliminate 
75,000 jobs in California. Supporters argue that it will increase timber 
harvests over the long term because it requires loggers to save more of the 
forest land now.

BASIC EDUCATION FOUND TO BE JOB PATH FOR POOR; 
</P>
<P>
WELFARE: REPORT SAYS THAT SINGLE-PARENT MOTHERS WHO FIRST TRY TO EARN HIGH 
SCHOOL DIPLOMAS BEFORE GETTING WORK SKILLS MAY NOT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

Low-income, single-parent mothers who receive basic education as a component of 
job training programs are more likely to find employment and earn higher wages 
than those who first try to earn a high school diploma, according to the 
findings of a Rockefeller Foundation report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that a San Jose job-training program that incorporated 
classroom study into technical skills courses "had large positive impacts on 
employment and earnings by the end of the first year." By contrast, women in 
training programs in three other cities, where remedial education preceded job 
training, "did not achieve similar early gains." 
</P>
<P>
Women in the San Jose program experienced a 27% increase in employment and a 
47% increase in earnings, compared to a control group that received no 
training. By contrast, programs studied in Atlanta; Providence, R.I., and 
Washington, D.C., resulted in virtually no gains for the women who 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
The study should prompt state officials to consider alternatives to the 
traditional school-first, work-training programs as they comply with federal 
job-training programs, said senior researcher John Burghardt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying that improving basic education skills or getting people a 
(high school diploma) is a bad thing," he said. "But there should be a wider 
array of options. People should think about other ways of doing this." 
</P>
<P>
The Family Support Act of 1988, which replaces the Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children program, requires states to begin implementing new programs 
in October that will shift low-income mothers from welfare dependency to 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
A key provision of the law requires single, welfare recipients with children 
under 3 -- and as young as 1 in some states -- to further their educations or 
accept job training to qualify for continued government support. Despite 
complaints from critics of the law, who contend that such programs do little to 
help keep single mothers off the public dole, states are drawing up a variety 
of remedial education and job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to know that they can do something (to help welfare mothers), but 
it's more important how you do it," said project director Phoebe Cottingham in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The study tracked a random sample of 4,000 poor women in job-training programs 
run by private community groups. The Rockefeller Foundation provided $12 
million for the demonstration and study. Mathematica Policy Research Inc., a 
social policy evaluation firm, analyzed the results of the various programs 
after the first group of mothers had completed 12 months of work experience. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Providence and Washington, the organizations followed the 
traditional approach of testing applicants and then providing a typical 
classroom education to qualify them for the equivalent of a high school degree. 
Those who obtained graduate equivalent degrees then were offered specific job 
training skills. 
</P>
<P>
Burghardt of Mathematica said that further study is required to determine 
exactly which types of job-training programs work best.

DRUG PANEL PRAISES TREATMENT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Concluding that drug rehabilitation programs are "a neglected front line in the 
war against drug abuse," a panel of experts Wednesday proposed a shift in 
federal resources to improve and expand the nation's drug treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
In a study undertaken by the prestigious Institute of Medicine, researchers 
found that rehabilitation is an important and cost-effective means of fighting 
the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The treatment methods available today can yield benefits . . . that well 
exceed the costs of delivering these services," said Lawrence S. Lewin, 
chairman of the research panel. 
</P>
<P>
The report evaluated public and private drug treatment services available 
across the country and concluded that, while methods and results vary, 
treatment programs are beneficial even if some addicts ultimately are unable to 
kick their habits. 
</P>
<P>
"As with many therapies for chronic problems, even the best interventions work 
only partially -- some of the time and for some of the people," Lewin said. But 
while dropout rates can be high, some programs "virtually pay for themselves 
during the treatment period by reducing the criminal activities of the people 
enrolled in them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers recommended an increase in federal funding for public 
rehabilitation programs and changes in medical insurance policies to cut the 
costs of private treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the report, the White House's Office of National Drug Control 
Policy acknowledged Wednesday that drug treatment may have been neglected 
"historically." But it noted that federal spending on drug treatment has 
increased dramatically in the last two years, from $880 million in 1989 when 
the study began, to more than $1.3 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The study "is a pretty impressive piece of work that is consistent with our 
view of drug treatment," said David Tell, an aide to Director William J. 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four major types of rehabilitation programs, the study found that three 
-- methadone maintenance, residential therapy and outpatient treatment -- are 
cost-effective means to reduce drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
But the study said that the fourth type of treatment -- chemical dependency 
programs that begin with a month-long hospitalization -- are no more effective 
than the other methods and are significantly more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that these programs are more attractive to many patients 
because the cost of hospitalization is often borne by their medical insurance. 
Consequently, they urged private insurance companies to restructure coverage so 
that patients will have an incentive to enroll in less-costly residential or 
outpatient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that while no method was consistently better than another, 
patient success in all programs improved dramatically with the length of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "our data suggest that there should be a shift in emphasis toward 
longer-term and follow-up care," said panel member Maxine L. Stitzer, an 
associate professor of behavioral biology at the Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The report was conducted by the Institute of Medicine, an affiliate of the 
prestigious National Academy of Sciences. The academy is a congressionally 
chartered, private organization that advises the federal government on matters 
of science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Although 75 million Americans have used illegal drugs, only a small fraction -- 
an estimated 5.5 million -- "clearly" or "probably" need rehabilitation, the 
study said. However, admissions to drug treatment programs numbered only about 
1.1 million last year.

KING NOW THE RULER OF LPGA; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: SHE HAS ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT NANCY LOPEZ, WHO TURNED PROFESSIONAL THE 
SAME YEAR, IS A MORE POPULAR PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Betsy King has been playing professional golf long enough that five years ago a 
set of her famous-label irons sold for $25 at an Irvine garage sale. 
Unfortunately, her swing didn't come with the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
So, while some have struggled to learn how to swing a King, few know more about 
King than that she has a good swing. This is partly because she started on the 
LPGA tour in 1977, the same year as one of the most popular golfers of all 
time, Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was a star from the start, winning nine tournaments in 1978 and eight in 
'79. She had 27 victories before King earned her first. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez not only won more, she smiled more and talked more than the quiet, shy 
King. Then Lopez married a baseball player and had a couple of babies. 
</P>
<P>
And King? "I had a very good rookie year," she said Wednesday at the Los 
Coyotes Country Club in Buena Park, where the LPGA tournament begins today. 
"And it would have won rookie of the year in a lot of other years. But there I 
am, in the same rookie class as Nancy. It's timing, and it's obviously not 
something you can control." 
</P>
<P>
From 1977 through '83, Lopez earned more than $1 million, King $328,839. To 
date, Lopez has 42 career victories to King's 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I resented it somewhat, but not anymore," King said. "Now I cheer for 
everyone, and it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, King has not only earned $771,000 more than Lopez, she has finished 
first or second on the money list four times to Lopez's one. She ranks ahead of 
the third-place Lopez on the career money list by $50,000. "The purses are 
bigger now," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season was King's best as she won six tournaments and $654,000. That was 
the most money ever earned in one season on the LPGA tour until Beth Daniel 
broke the record this year. This season has been nearly as good. She has won 
three tournaments, including two majors, and is third on the money list with 
$470,760. 
</P>
<P>
And lately, King seems to be talking more. 
</P>
<P>
When asked recently how she felt about public acceptance of women's 
professional golf, she complained about the media, who rarely write about her. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of (the problem) is the media is dominated by males and -- I hate to say 
this -- they often send the middle-of-the-barrel reporters to cover our 
tournament, or guys who do hockey in the winter," King told the Hartford 
Courant. 
</P>
<P>
"Once last year, after I'd won four events, someone asked me, 'What kind of 
year you having?' Ever hear a pitcher with a 20-4 record asked what kind of 
year he's having?" 
</P>
<P>
Camera crews were stacked up four deep behind King and Lopez Wednesday before 
they began play in the pro-amateur tournament at Los Coyotes. By 11:40 a.m., 
King had given six interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I am getting more fan recognition now," King said. "Last year made a 
big difference, My first good year was in 1984, and I played well for a few 
years since then. And it's been interesting that quite a few of the wins that I 
have had have been on television. All three this year were televised, and at 
least four or five of my six wins were on television last year. That's your 
only chance at a really big audience." 
</P>
<P>
King said the turning point in her career actually came in 1980, her worst 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Several things happened that year -- at the beginning of the year I became a 
Christian, and then went on to have my worst year -- but that has helped me the 
most," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I was a Christian, I put my self-worth on how I did on the golf course. 
I don't have to do that anymore. And with that perspective, it allows me to be 
bolder in my play." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1980, King hired Ed Oldfield as her coach and credits much of her 
success to him. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 35, the most famous female golfer from Reading, Pa., is learning how to 
deal with all of the increased attention. 
</P>
<P>
"After you do 100 interviews, you do get better at it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
LPGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, No. 4 this season on the money list with $439,076, has 26 career 
victories and needs four more to get into the LPGA Hall of Fame. She would be 
the first player to enter the Hall since Nancy Lopez in 1987. Bradley is the 
No. 1 career money leader with $3,305,105, followed by Betsy King with 
$2,940,454 and Lopez with $2,885,221. Bradley is also the only golfer to have 
won all four modern majors, three of them in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After the top four -- Beth Daniel with $661,578, Patty Sheehan with $640,751, 
King with $470,760 and Bradley -- there's a big drop to No. 5 Rosie Jones with 
$319,391. Lopez had this explanation Wednesday of why the top four players are 
so far ahead: "With players of that quality, once they get on a roll, they have 
the confidence and are just going to go ahead. Once one is doing it, the others 
fight to keep up." . . . Daniel and Sheehan are not playing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the tournament is $10 today and Friday, $12 Saturday and Sunday. 
Parking is at Hughes Aircraft Co. on Melvern and Gilbert avenues, and a shuttle 
is provided. There is no parking available at the course. . . . A field of 144 
players will tee off today, including Amy Alcott at 9 a.m., Juli Inkster at 
9:10, Lopez and Bradley at 11:50, and King and Jan Stephenson at 12:30 p.m.

ANGELS ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE MULTIYEAR CONTRACT FOR RADER SOON 
</P>

<P>
An announcement that the Angels have rehired Manager Doug Rader -- with the 
multiyear contract he sought -- is imminent and could be made as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
Rader's status was among the topics Wednesday when General Manager Mike Port 
met with Angel owner Gene Autry and Autry's wife Jackie, who has authority in 
club business matters. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that in those discussions, the Autrys authorized Port to give 
Rader a contract longer than one year, a condition about which Rader had been 
adamant. 
</P>
<P>
Although Port cautioned that "nothing is as simple as it sounds," he added, 
"It's possible I'll have something for you (reporters) shortly. Not today, 
because we need one more day of speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Rader, whose second one-year contract expires after this season, declined to 
discuss the terms he requested. "Whatever it is I'm interested in should remain 
between myself and the ownership," he said. "Until something happens, there's 
no need to discuss it." HELENE ELLIOTT

PAEZ'S CORNERMAN IS A CUT ABOVE THE REST 
</P>

Chuck Bodak, who has been in boxing nearly a half century, gave Jorge Paez 
quite a compliment recently, comparing him to Muhammad Ali, considered one of 
the slickest fighters of all time. 
</P>
<P>
"Jorge is an instinctive fighter. He has a lot of Ali's characteristics," said 
Bodak, who will be Paez's cutman when he challenges Tony Lopez for his 
International Boxing Federation junior-lightweight championship Saturday at 
Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Jorge can do something wrong and make it turn out to be where it's right," 
Bodak said. "His reflexes and raw talent are unbelievable. Ali was the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Bodak, 74, said one of the highlights of his boxing career was having been 
associated with Ali. 
</P>
<P>
Bodak, born and raised in Gary, Ind., said he spent 75 percent of his career 
working out of Chicago, and that was where he first met Ali, then an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked with Ali in both national and international amateur bouts," said 
Bodak. 
</P>
<P>
Bodak worked with Ali again briefly in the latter stages of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Angelo Dundee was his main cutman for most of his professional career," Bodak 
said. "I ran into Ali in Las Vegas in the 1970s when he was shooting a movie 
there, 'The Greatest.' 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me to work for him, and I did, including the Leon Spinks fight (Sept. 
15, 1978, when Ali regained the world heavyweight championship)." 
</P>
<P>
Bodak at various times has worked for Jimmy Ellis, Ernie Terrell, Michael 
Dokes, Tony Tucker, Tommy Hearns and Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, Bodak has been associated with fighters under the guidance of Nacho 
Huizar, Paez's manager and trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Bodak has been in Paez's corner since Huizar obtained his contract before his 
23rd fight on December 1987. Paez, a pro since 1985, is 35-2-3 with 25 KOs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's bout will be the 10th world championship fight for Paez since he 
beat Calvin Grove for the IBF featherweight championship on Aug. 4, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bodak hasn't had much to do in those title fights. Paez has only been cut three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst cuts came in his first (Louie) Espinoza fight (May 21, 1989)," Bodak 
said. "That's the only time he had to have stitches." 
</P>
<P>
Huizar said: "Chuck did a great job then. Jorge had a deep cut over his eye 
that was caused by a head butt and another cut underneath the eye. They 
happened early in the fight, and I thought the fight might be stopped, but 
Chuck kept the cuts controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Bodak said Paez's other cuts also were caused by head butts -- once against 
Lupe Gutierrez on Dec. 9, 1989, in Reno, and again in his last bout on July 29 
against Troy Dorsey in Las Vegas. "We just taped those up," Bodak said. 
</P>
<P>
Paez has been on the deck only once, put there by a right to the jaw by Steve 
Cruz in the second round on July 30, 1989, in El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"He was stunned," said Huizar, "but he got right up. He told me in the corner, 
'I made a mistake. It won't happen again.' Jorge went on to win the fight." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Paez appeared at the Sacramento Police Athletic Gym, posing for 
pictures and signing autographs. Huizar said that will be Paez's final 
appearance at the gym. "He's done with training except for running 10 to 15 
minutes in the morning," Huizar said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Edgington, Lopez's trainer, said the champion's training has gone well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's starting to get on edge. I like that," Edgington said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez will complete his sparring at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday at Brocker's.

MCKEON MAY NOT LAST WEEK WITH PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Padre ownership group has decided to fire Jack McKeon, vice president of 
baseball operations, sources said Wednesday, but it is waiting to find a 
replacement before the decision is announced. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Chairman Tom Werner, reached at his Los Angeles office, said: "It's 
inappropriate to comment at this time. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, that's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, who has been with the Padres since July, 1980, said: "I haven't heard a 
word, but they have the prerogative to do what they want. I don't have anything 
to be ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, who has one year left on his contract that will pay him $400,000, is 
scheduled to meet Werner on Friday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Although 
the meeting was scheduled a month ago, sources close to McKeon said that he 
plans to address his status. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown who the Padres plan to hire for McKeon's position. They have 
interviewed Gordon Ash, Toronto Blue Jay assistant general manager, and are 
believed to have interviewed Roger Jonegewaard, the Seattle Mariners' vice 
president for scouting and development. Sources say the Padres hope to 
interview Larry Himes, who will leave as the Chicago White Sox general manager 
at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also have asked for permission from the Minnesota Twins to interview 
General Manager Andy MacPhail, but MacPhail turned down the request.

NEWSWIRE: TRAINER'S AIDES' HEARING POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arraignment hearing for the bookkeeper accused of embezzling more than $1 
million from thoroughbred horse trainer Charlie Whittingham has been postponed 
until Oct. 4. The hearing had been scheduled for Wednesday in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Stubblefield, 54, is facing one charge of grand theft and nine charges of 
forgery in what has been described by police as a five-year scheme that 
allegedly included payroll checks written to Whittingham employees who did not 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
Stubblefield, who worked for Whittingham for eight years until irregularities 
were discovered earlier this year, appeared in court Wednesday. Bail, set at 
$350,000, was described as exorbitant by Stubblefield's attorney, Bruce South, 
who said that his client, now a resident of Texas, would enter a plea of not 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"The bail is excessively high," South said. "The district attorney is still 
trying to piece together a case, and this is too much money to ask of a woman 
who has no job and no income." 
</P>
<P>
In another case involving a bookkeeper for the Whittingham stable, Janice Karen 
Walters, 32, faces three counts of grand theft for allegedly embezzling 
$31,000. Walters was released Wednesday on her own recognizance, and her 
arraignment also was set for Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Craigo, Whittingham's attorney, said that the shortages have been 
resolved, and Walters still works for the trainer. The district attorney's 
spokeswoman said there is no evidence of conspiracy between Walters and 
Stubblefield. Walters allegedly wrote checks that resulted in her being paid 
bonuses that she hadn't earned. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham has sued Bank of America, which handled his payroll accounts, and 
Craigo said discussions are continuing regarding the bank's liability. BILL

PATRIOTISM: LEONA HELMSLEY, FREE PENDING APPEAL OF HER CONVICTIONS FOR TAX

TO MAGNIFICENT HEIGHTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
For billionaire hotel queen Leona M. Helmsley, the last three weeks have been a 
coming-out party of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
But the felon wants to make one thing clear: It was patriotism, not 
publicity-seeking, she says, that inspired her to sing "God Bless America" 
after having the Empire State Building decked out in red, white and blue on 
Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
It was a desire to influence the Iraqi tyrant, not the hope of spin-doctoring 
the appeal of her convictions for tax evasion, mail fraud and conspiracy that 
compelled her to buy a full-page "open letter to Saddam Hussein" in Monday's 
New York Times. (The general rate for such an ad is $44,453, a newspaper 
spokesman said.) 
</P>
<P>
It was her love of her country, she says, that prompted her Tuesday night to 
light up the Helmsley Building with a giant flag. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it," Helmsley says, leaning forward on her desk at the Helmsley Palace 
hotel, "because I am an American." 
</P>
<P>
She got the idea for her public displays of patriotism after hearing President 
Bush speak on the Kuwait crisis, she says: "I thought that the American public 
should get behind the President. . . . Those that don't like our flag and want 
to burn it, let them go home. Those that don't think our national anthem should 
be sung, let them go to another country. We have the most wonderful country in 
the world, and this is my way of showing it." 
</P>
<P>
Her letter reads in part: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Mr. Hussein: 
</P>
<P>
"As your troops terrify innocent men, women and children; as your occupation 
forces loot Kuwaiti cities; as your security forces smash down the doors of 
apartments looking for foreigners to intern, you keep referring to these 
victims as 'guests.' 
</P>
<P>
"I know something about how one is supposed to treat guests, Mr. Hussein. I 
have been inviting guests from around the world into my hotels for 18 years.. . 
. In your bizarre world where detention centers have become hotels and hostages 
have become guests, I can make one recommendation that I have never made in all 
the years that I have been welcoming people: Mr. Hussein, it is time to check 
out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley says the assertion that the letter may be a bizarre bid to overcome 
her own image as a tyrant is "nonsense" and "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
She says she wrote the letter herself, then let her high-profile public 
relations firm and her lawyer read it. Neither suggested that such a letter 
might prove imprudent at this delicate moment in the judicial appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought it was a wonderful thing to do. Very patriotic. . . . They said, 
'How did you ever think of anything so wonderful?' 
</P>

"I can't conceive how anyone could think it's a publicity stunt," she says, her 
face, much scrutinized during the trial, growing taut, her right eye twitching. 
"I didn't create this stuff in the Middle East. How could it be a publicity 
stunt?" 
</P>
<P>
Rather, she says, her activities are intended to inspire Americans. "I hope 
people will put a flag in front of their house. I hope they will wear a flag on 
their clothes," she says, her hand adorned with a ring containing a pearl the 
size of a quail egg, gesturing to the four American flag pins on the lapel of 
her navy suit. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley is convinced the public will rally behind her patriotic efforts, just 
as they have rallied, she says, behind her legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
During her trial and conviction last year in a U.S. District Court, for which 
she received a sentence of four years in prison, 750 hours of community service 
and a $7.1-million fine, the media dubbed Helmsley "The Queen of Mean," after 
former employees offered a litany of complaints about her imperious and 
cavalier management style. Quickly, the coverage itself became mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
"But I understand that," Helmsley says. "There was a gag order out. I was not 
permitted to speak to the media." With the gag order lifted, though, her public 
image has changed, she says. "The public has turned. They like me." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate this national mood swing, Helmsley, 70, asked an aide to bring 
out folders containing some of the "thousands and thousands and thousands" of 
letters of support she has received -- a clear contrast to the hate mail her 
attorney produced at Helmsley's sentencing. A perusal shows encouragement from 
individuals, flooring companies, tropical fish companies and even an inmate at 
Lompoc, offering advice on how to fight tax charges. 
</P>
<P>
Many correspondents eventually get around to other matters: "We would like to 
obtain funds so we can open a pet shop," one wrote, for instance. But most 
express admiration for Helmsley and anger at the media for their portrayal of 
her. "The media, in order to generate class hate, has tried to convict you.. . 
. " a writer from Elmhurst, Ill., wrote. "All I can recall is Donnie Trump's 
statement, 'It couldn't happen to a nicer person. . . . ' Well, look at little 
Donnie now," another wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving on to a live interview with a San Diego radio show, Helmsley 
takes a moment to point out music boxes she has given her ailing husband, Harry 
Helmsley, over the years. From a walnut shelf she removes a box with a drawing 
of King Kong atop the Empire State Building grasping a caricature of her 
husband, reputedly one of New York's wealthiest men and the owner of a 
controlling interest in the legendary skyscraper. Gently clasping her visitor's 
arm, she turns on the box and softly sings along: "I'm just wild about Harry, 
and Harry's wild about me." 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, Helmsley arrives by limousine at a landscaped traffic 
island outside the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue and wades into the small 
crowd consisting mainly of staff members with American flag pins on their 
lapels, a platoon of public relations people, and the press. 
</P>
<P>
She shakes hands with employees, waves at passing motorists, busses a reporter 
who interviewed her for the November Playboy, and scratches the chin of his 
ribbon-bedecked cocker spaniel. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a flourish, she steps up behind a podium. At her signal, 169 
employees behind curtains in the elegant building push plugs into sockets, and 
an American flag of red white and blue lights, 148 feet tall and 104 feet wide, 
emblazons the building. 
</P>
<P>
"God bless America!" Helmsley says over the honks of passing taxis. "God bless 
the hostages!" 
</P>
<P>
One of her employees watches the scene admiringly. "It's beautiful, isn't it," 
the woman says. "She's a real Yankee Doodle Dandy. She was born on the Fourth 
of July, you know."

RECREATION: IN ADDITION TO SELLING FOREIGN-LANGUAGE AND SPECIALTY PUBLICATIONS, 
ETHNIC BOOKSTORES ARE IMPORTANT NETWORKING CENTERS.

'I feel I'm not just selling books; I'm selling the Filipi no culture," says 
Linda Maria Nietes, owner of the Filipiniana Bookshop in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Like the dozens of other ethnic bookstores in the Los Angeles area, Filipiniana 
has functions that extend well beyond the retail trade. Armenian, Chinese, 
Latino or Russian, the stores are important networking centers for new 
arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
On any weekend, the ethnic bookstores are crowded with browsers looking for the 
latest romance, the newest biography, the revered classics in the languages 
they learned from birth. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to speak Tagalog, Vietnamese, or any of the other languages 
found in these stores to appreciate the window they provide on the dazzling 
cultural mosaic of Los Angeles. Most carry at least a few English books, and a 
bit of browsing may lead to an enriching cross-cultural exchange with the 
shopkeeper or patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Nietes' customers range from recent expatriates longing for a reminder of home 
to parents who fear their first-generation American children are growing up 
unaware of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the young people are eager to learn about their culture," says Nietes, 
a former Merrill Lynch manager who left the Philippines in 1984 in protest of 
the Marcos regime. "We're here to help them strengthen their sense of 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
Filipiniana, now in its second year, is filled not only with cookbooks, 
histories, and novels, but also with reminders of the land Nietes and her 
countrymen and women left behind. Wooden carvings of the rice gods who, legend 
has it, guarded Filipino granaries, here guard the store from a high shelf. A 
kulintang, a traditional ancient gong, occupies another and colorful hand-woven 
tapestries decorate the wall. 
</P>
<P>
And down below, visiting Filipino authors and poets often give readings, and 
lectures are organized regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Across town at Abril's Armenian Bookstore and Print Shop in Central Los 
Angeles, owner Harout Yeretzian speaks often of the importance of language to 
the preservation of culture. 
</P>
<P>
"The language is the only thing that keeps the Armenian culture together," 
Yeretzian says. Much of his business comes from supplying textbooks to the 
Armenian day schools in the Los Angeles area, but he also does a thriving 
business supplying language aids, both for recent Armenian immigrants who want 
to learn English and American-born Armenians who want to absorb the language of 
their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Intercultural marriages also provide a fair amount of business for the stores, 
say Yeretzian and Nietes, both of whom have aided their share of Americans in 
search of peaceful relations with foreign-born in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to know, a lot of traditions," Yeretzian says with a wink, "They 
need some help." 
</P>
<P>
There is an underlying irony in the fact that what is bad for the native 
culture can be energizing to its expatriate communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The first influx of Armenians here was after World War II," says Yeretzian. 
"After so many years went by, the language was dying. Now with all the trouble 
in the Middle East, and a new influx of people, it's been restored somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
Armenians are more partial to poetry than prose, says Yeretzian, who also tries 
to hold readings by Armenian poets several times a year. "Poetry readings are 
different in Armenia than here," he says. "The poets don't just read; they are 
trained as actors. Their performances are very dramatic and emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Khatchik Araradian, 78, is a former poet and actor who works part time in the 
store. "I gave one-man shows for 40 years, from Iran and Egypt, to Greece, to 
South America," he says. "I also taught in the Armenian schools here. I had to 
stop because it became too emotional for me." Araradian pauses, tears welling 
in his eyes. "The history of Armenia is a long tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The bookstores can also be a point of access for one culture's attempts to 
explore another. At the Libreria de Buenos Aires in West Los Angeles, the phone 
rings frequently throughout the day with calls from English speakers trying to 
learn Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
They may be stuck on a verb tense or the pronunciation of a particular phrase, 
but one thing is clear to owner Bernard Hamel: the Latinization of Los Angeles 
has gone mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"A large percentage of our customers are actually Americans learning the 
Spanish language," says Hamel, a former professor of Spanish literature at Cal 
State Northridge and Occidental College. He and his Argentine wife, Leonor, 
have been in the Spanish language book business for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel says he has noticed a change in Spanish-speaking immigrants in the last 
several years. "It used to be that five or 10 years ago, they'd become 
Americanized right away," he says. "Now that they're here in such numbers, 
they're making a deeper imprint on the local culture. It's whetted the 
English-speakers' appetite to learn more of Latino culture." 
</P>
<P>
Hamel, whose shop carries everything from Spanish versions of Kafka to 
technical computer textbooks, plans to launch a literary round table next year. 
He recently set up a small reference corner for writers, a sort of informal 
library, because "not that many writers can afford this range of reference 
books." Hamel also publishes his own Spanish literary magazine, El Ateneo, (The 
Atheneum), a journal of culture and language of the Spanish-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood-based La Cite des Livres is the only exclusively French language 
bookstore in the United States, according to owner Lucien Plausoles. In 
business since 1965, the store's inventory also extends to contemporary French 
pop music, a scarce commodity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The store's clientele reflects the tremendous diversity of the French-speaking 
world, says Plausoles, who estimates one-third of his customers are French, 
one-third from other French-speaking nations -- including Egyptians, Lebanese 
and Moroccans -- and one-third are Americans learning French. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend a lot of time in here helping people with their French," Plausoles 
says. "They enjoy struggling with the language. They'll speak French as a kind 
of relief."

<P>
REFUGEES: HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES FLED THE KHMER ROUGE ARE 
ACCLIMATED TO AMERICAN LIFE IN CLASSES AT HAZELTINE SCHOOL IN VAN NUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Cambodian children -- all refugees forced out of their homeland 
by the Khmer Rouge in 1975 -- began enrolling at Hazeltine Avenue School in Van 
Nuys. The school changed dramatically, dropping from a 95% Anglo enrollment to 
90% minority in about five years. 
</P>
<P>
Although a burgeoning Latino population contributed to the shift, the growing 
numbers of Cambodians proved the greater challenge for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Assistance arrived in the form of six Khmer-speaking teachers' aides, special 
English classes and counseling services. Today, about 200 Cambodian students 
attend Hazeltine, which has the largest Cambodian enrollment among San Fernando 
Valley elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Acclimating scores of Cambodian students to a new culture has been an ongoing 
challenge for teachers, as refugee children continue to come to Hazeltine. The 
school now regularly sends children home with bulletins printed in three 
languages: English, Khmer and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Hazeltine -- which has 1,200 students enrolled in 48 classrooms, five with 
mostly Cambodian children -- holds regular staff meetings to inform teachers of 
such customs. Parenting classes also are offered, informing adults of such 
services as the school nurse, psychologist and community health centers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these students have survived in the jungle and war situations," said 
Diane Agliam, Hazeltine's assistant principal. "Many relied on folk culture and 
folk medicine, like 'coining,' to pull them through. We have to be sensitive to 
that when dealing with the children today." 
</P>
<P>
Coining, a common practice among Cambodians, involves the repeated rubbing of a 
coin lengthwise along an arm until redness occurs. The action, usually used to 
relieve headaches, is said to bring the "hot pressure" or sickness out of a 
body. Some Cambodian children have burn marks the size of a dime or smaller on 
their stomachs -- evidence of another remedy, where burning incense or special 
embers are applied to the skin. The practice is said to protect small children 
from such ailments as diarrhea and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
"If we know that coining is taking place, we ask the parent to come in for a 
consultation," Agliam said. "It's a delicate situation. It's obviously their 
culture. We start by acknowledging that they're doing the best they know with 
their child. 
</P>
<P>
"We always approach the situation not from a condemning attitude but from one 
of assistance -- explaining that the school nurse is available -- that there 
are more modern, accepted and advanced technologies available." 
</P>
<P>
Amy Catlin, a UCLA anthropologist who has studied Cambodian culture, said many 
Cambodian parents would not accept alternatives. Headache remedies such as 
aspirin are considered chemical-based -- definitely not for consumption by 
Cambodians. 
</P>
<P>
Khmer-speaking teachers' aides help bridge cultural gaps best, administrators 
said. Sopheap Ho has worked as an assistant teacher at Hazeltine for four 
years. She escaped from Cambodia to Thailand in 1980 and arrived in the United 
States in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I like teaching the children, because I can help them work out things between 
their own culture and the American culture," Sopheap Ho said. "I can talk to 
them in Khmer, but I mostly speak English to help them speak their new 
language. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I taught children to say things like, 'This is my hair. This is 
my hand.' Now they come back to me and speak rapid English. I like that. It 
makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
In a Hazeltine classroom for second- and third-graders, 25 children, mostly 
Cambodian, sat at attention on a recent afternoon. A strictness pervaded the 
room as children recited in unison, occasionally interrupted by a "Joey, sit 
up!" and "Neo, cover your mouth when you sneeze!" One red-haired child, a 
recurrent troublemaker according to teachers, mumbled about the "wetbacks" that 
he said surrounded him. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Nat Glickman said such name-calling is rare. "The assimilation 
between racial groups is fairly smooth, especially with younger children," 
Glickman said. "They're less conscious of any difference. When name-calling 
does occur, it seems to come from outside. Kids bring it from home or from 
other friends. We try to deal with it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Activity in an adjacent classroom was less subdued. "Children! Pick up a 
crayfish to show our visitors!" said Jackie Kurkjian, a first- and second-grade 
teacher of 20 pupils. Children dunked hands into a small pool holding the 
crayfish and later showed prized crayfish books, crayfish stories and crayfish 
poems they had constructed. 
</P>
<P>
Kurkjian said she uses a "living language" approach when teaching her Cambodian 
charges. The children's immediate environment is used to teach new words such 
as feed, water, sand and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Hazeltine's Cambodian children, who are usually shy in the presence of 
strangers, had little to say about their transition from refugees to Van Nuys 
grade school pupils. Yon Yem, an 11-year-old fifth-grader who arrived in the 
United States in 1982, said she does not remember her homeland's war, other 
than helping her mother cook and other vague memories of life in a tent. "It 
was OK," she said. "It's fun now. We have a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Agliam said such shyness in the children was first taken by teachers as a sign 
of weakness or disrespect. "At first, if Cambodian students did not look at 
teachers when spoken to, we would say, 'Look at me, I'm talking to you!' " 
Agliam said. "But we quickly learned that Cambodians keep their heads down as a 
sign of respect to elders. We're not going to insist that a child look directly 
in our eyes if this is taught as a sign of disrespect in the home. We 
continually balance those two aspects -- home instruction and school 
instruction. It's a fine line." 
</P>
<P>
Something as simple as a hand gesture to "Come over here" means something quite 
derogatory in the Cambodian culture, Agliam said, adding, "The children, in 
essence, have become our teachers in these things." 
</P>
<P>
Another complication for Hazeltine has been determining the ages of Cambodian 
children. The Cambodian culture marks a child's first birthday as one year 
after the date of conception. "Sometimes the ages are a lot older than what the 
children's papers indicate," Glickman said. "Or sometimes there's simply no 
documentation. They're going by what they can remember. We do our best." 
</P>
<P>
Esty LaHive, who has taught at Hazeltine for 27 years, has perhaps witnessed 
the greatest number of such complications. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started, we had a middle-class neighborhood with an active PTA," said 
LaHive, who taught the first bilingual class at the school in 1978. "There was 
lots of parent participation -- many parents worked in the film industry. 
Mothers would volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, both parents of children usually work. We have many more single parents 
and lots of transient families. Children come and go out of here all the time. 
But the children adjust to whatever circumstances they find themselves, no 
matter what culture they're from. We talk about their problems and how they 
feel -- especially the older ones. 
</P>
<P>
"And of course we have every language you can think of represented. It's a 
beautiful makeup, really. It looks like the United Nations around here."

BLENDING DREAMS WITH TRADITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
GRADUATES: YOUNG IMMIGRANTS FIND DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING TO GREATER SOCIAL 
FREEDOMS IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After leaving the secure atmosphere of elementary school, what happens to 
Cambodian refugee children as they prepare to enter an adult world? Some simply 
trade war zones -- from the killing fields of Cambodia to the Asian gang wars 
of Van Nuys. Most find that adjusting to greater social freedoms in the United 
States, such as dating and extended friendships, depends upon their parents' 
attitudes toward those freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not supposed to have a boyfriend," said Pinthang Ouk, a sophomore at Grant 
High School in Van Nuys who entered Hazeltine Avenue School when she was 6. "In 
our way, if a guy likes you, your parents have to watch after you and stuff 
until you get married. If you go out with different boyfriends before you get 
married, it means you're not a real virgin -- even if you just go out on a 
date." 
</P>
<P>
Pinthang, 15, lives in the Vallerio Gardens apartment complex in Van Nuys with 
her mother, aunt, grandmother and two sisters. Six concrete buildings at the 
complex house about 300 Cambodians, who are packed 10 to 15 each into 
two-bedroom apartments. Central courtyards harbor fledgling gardens where 
scores of children play, spilling out into an alley that dissects the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Pinthang said she agrees with her mother's and grandmother's attitudes about 
dating. "It's hard, because I can't usually go out with my friends -- my mom 
wants me around the house," she said. "But I wouldn't want to hang around a lot 
of girls who flirt and stuff. I want to stick with the girls who are just like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Pinthang said traditional Cambodian dance, which she learned in Phnom Penh, 
where she was born, helps her through adolescence. She now dances with a local 
troupe at festivals and schools. "My grandma's mother was a dancer in the 
temples for royalty in Cambodia," she said. "So now, when I dance, it's like 
generation to generation, we're passing the tradition down." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school, Pinthang is thinking of becoming a flight 
attendant or a "lady cop." 
</P>
<P>
"But my mom told me to forget it," she said, flipping the pages of "Dynamic 
Anatomy and Physiology" while her two younger sisters took turns combing her 
shoulder-length hair. "She said to work in an office or something. My grandma 
said that too. They want to keep me safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go to college, but my grandma doesn't want me to go. She doesn't 
think a girl needs that much education. Only guys do. I don't agree with her. 
I'm going to go anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Roatha Buth, 18, lives next door to Pinthang with his mother, an aunt, five 
sisters and three brothers. He was kicked out of 10th grade at Van Nuys High 
School earlier this year and later spent one month in juvenile hall for 
attempting to break into a car, a charge he denies. Roatha Buth has no plans to 
return to school, often thinks of getting a job as a fast-food cook in San 
Bernardino, where he has friends, and sometimes dreams of becoming a 
firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first come here, the gangs make me fight," he said, smoothing his 
T-shirt, emblazoned with a Corona beer label. His thick, black hair was pulled 
back with a blue rubber band and around his neck hung three gold chains, one 
sporting a dime-size Mercedes-Benz symbol. "Like they hit you up. They go, 
'Where you from?' I didn't know or understand who they were. First there were 
Mexican gangs, then Asian gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Roatha Buth said he was a member of the Asian Boys gang for two years when he 
was 14 and 15. "They jump you in, they jump you out," he said, describing the 
initiation process. "When they jump you in, three of them start to hit you and 
you got to hit back for 30 seconds. And then you start hanging around them. I'd 
rather be a fireman. Lots of action. But you have to graduate and all that from 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
Roatha Buth's immediate concern is his living arrangements. His mother recently 
told him he must leave the house unless he gets a job. "I just want to get out 
of this apartment," he said, glancing at a corner Buddhist altar laden with 
incense, mostly hidden by a towering ensemble of audio equipment. "I want to go 
somewhere far away. Too much trouble. Screaming, crying, arguments. Even Maria, 
my girlfriend, screams at me. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go nowhere. You can't get out of this place. Only like in Beverly 
Hills it's quiet, I think. There are no gangs over there. Or if you lived in a 
house, it would be quiet then, I think." R. DANIEL FOSTER

Final results in the special election for the City Council were delayed two 
hours Tuesday night while a precinct worker had dinner with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, anxious city officials, candidates and their supporters and 
reporters cooled their heels at City Hall, fueling wild speculation and at one 
point setting off a frantic search for the missing votes. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Arnold Glasman said Jennifer Scott was supposed to bring the ballots 
from a precinct at the Emerson Village retirement home to City Hall to be 
counted. But, he said, she apparently thought there was no hurry and could hand 
them in the next day. 
</P>
<P>
By 9:30 p.m. Tuesday night, votes had come in from 25 of the city's 26 
precincts. Boyd Bredenkamp, a businessman and planning commissioner, held a 
clear lead over two opponents in the race to replace recalled Councilman C. L. 
(Clay) Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council chambers, where the ballots were counted, was crowded with 
Bredenkamp supporters waiting to cheer the final results. A beaming Bredenkamp 
was standing by to go on cable television with a victory speech. 
</P>
<P>
Time passed and the wait continued. 
</P>
<P>
The audience filled the time with speculation. Maybe someone had stolen the 
ballots. Maybe, the concern of council candidates about crime had yielded 
another example, an election worker waylaid. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials began making some calls and found out that Scott, the 
precinct inspector, had left for City Hall more than an hour earlier. They also 
learned that she was pregnant and hadn't been feeling well. More speculation. 
Maybe she didn't deliver the ballots because she was delivering a baby. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elizabeth Villeral then called the watch commander at the Police 
Department to report Scott and the ballots missing. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Nell Soto, who supported losing council candidate Bob Dahms, 
said she was in bed when she was awakened by a call from a friend who had heard 
on a radio scanner that police were hunting for missing ballots. She said the 
friend was convinced that chicanery was afoot, and that the results were 
tainted. Soto was more realistic. She said she knew one precinct wasn't going 
to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
But by this time, some Bredenkamp supporters waiting at City Hall were 
beginning to think that an election they had won at the polls was in danger of 
being stolen. What if ballots had been destroyed? Would there be a new 
election? 
</P>
<P>
Then, a report circulated that the city attorney was about to leave City Hall 
to pick up the ballots. A dozen Bredenkamp supporters rushed to their cars to 
follow. Two reporters chased the supporters chasing the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, Scott showed up. 
</P>
<P>
City officials ushered Scott off to a private meeting to find out what had 
happened. Glasman said Scott told him that she went to her mother's house for 
dinner. The mother apparently thought it odd that the ballots had come along 
and suggested that her daughter try to get to City Hall before midnight. But, 
Glasman said, Scott still thought she had until the next morning to turn them 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Scott refused to talk with reporters. A man who accompanied her said it was 
simple: "She didn't know she was supposed to bring the ballots in." 
</P>
<P>
Villeral said Scott should have known from the instructions given to her that 
she was to take the ballots to City Hall immediately, but no harm was done. 
Glasman said the 378 ballots had not been tampered with, and the results from 
the precinct nearly matched those of the election as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
When the missing precinct was added at 11:30 p.m., final results showed that 
Bredenkamp had captured 54% of the vote. He received 2,903 votes to 1,868 for 
Dahms and 604 for Nancy Lopez. The turnout was 13.5% of the eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Glasman said he and the city clerk will look into the matter further, but the 
precinct worker's excursion to her mother's house for dinner does not appear to 
jeopardize the integrity of the election. "There is no indication of anything 
but some very poor judgment by a precinct officer," he said.

GIFT FROM TAIWAN GIVES ASIANS ACCESS TO FAR EAST AUTHORS;

MONTEREY PARK: BRUGGEMEYER MEMORIAL LIBRARY IS SUBSCRIBING TO A COMPUTER 
NETWORK THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO SEARCH FOR BOOKS IN CHINESE, JAPANESE AND KOREAN.

<P>
Librarians soon will be able to search for titles, authors' names and subjects 
on a computer screen -- in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. 
</P>
<P>
With a $20,000 gift from the Taiwan chapter of Lions Club International, 
Bruggemeyer Memorial Library is subscribing to an on-line computer network that 
will allow it to share information about its Asian book collections with 
libraries and universities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The network is provided by Dublin, Ohio-based Online Computer Library Center, a 
nonprofit organization that enables libraries to store bibliographical 
information, borrow books from other libraries, and even print and sort their 
own card catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
"This will benefit the surrounding libraries as well," said Christina Yueh, a 
senior librarian. "If we have the system, we can share it with them." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Wang, who directs the library center's Asian/Pacific Services, said 
10,000 libraries in 39 countries subscribe to the English-language network. The 
Asian-language network, however, is used mainly by scholars in 30-40 large 
universities with extensive collections from East Asian countries, including 
Harvard, UCLA and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park will be only the second city, behind Chicago, to join the Asian 
program, Wang said. When the system is installed, librarians will be able to 
scan the entire collection of the National Center Library in Taipei, Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
And in several years, they'll have access to a catalogue of all the works 
written in mainland China from 1911-1949, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Library of China in Beijing has signed an agreement with the 
library center to provide a complete bibliography of about 120,000 works from 
that period, beginning with the rise of the Kuomintang Party and ending when 
the Chinese Communist Party took over. 
</P>
<P>
Yueh said the computer program also will simplify the tedious task of 
handprinting all of the library's 20,000 Chinese titles and filing them in the 
card catalogue. Because of the time it takes to copy and file information by 
subject, author and title, more than half of the Chinese collection isn't even 
included in the catalogue, Yueh said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Monterey Park will have to pay several thousand dollars for the 
system each subsequent year, the exact amount depending on usage.

SAN MARINO FACES HARD CHOICES; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING: A YEARLONG STUDY RECOMMENDS A STRATEGY TO COMBAT NEW PROBLEMS THAT 
MAY DISTURB THE CITY'S EXCLUSIVE ALLURE.

SAN MARINO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financially strapped schools, a rapidly changing ethnic makeup, traffic, drugs: 
The problems facing this haven of high incomes and luxury homes are much the 
same as those of its less affluent neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
And a Strategic Planning Committee that has studied life in San Marino for the 
past year has recommended solutions both ordinary and esoteric. 
</P>
<P>
For example, to attract restaurants -- for the convenience of residents as well 
as sales-tax revenue -- city leaders should reverse the longstanding policy 
forbidding sale of alcoholic beverages. To bolster enrollment in the public 
schools, they should consider the annexation of nearby county areas. 
</P>
<P>
And to get senior citizens involved with schools? A quintessentially San 
Marinan solution: a "Platinum Card" allowing free admission to school games and 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
These conclusions were in a recently released planning committee report that 
assessed nine sectors of community life. The report pointed out that city 
officials face hard choices in how to maintain the city's exclusive, 
single-family residential makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The 127 volunteer committee members supported some controversial changes. For 
example, the report advocated completion of the 710 Freeway extension, which 
would represent a major shift in San Marino's neutral, Switzerland-like pose in 
the debate between warring neighbors, freeway advocate Alhambra and freeway 
opponent South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"We have something wonderful and unique here," said Barbara L. Maxwell, a 
lawyer and head of the Strategic Planning Committee. "It's definitely worth 
preserving. But it's not going to happen by magic. If we don't take some 
action, we're not going to have the same city that we have now." 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell said the consensus among nine subcommittees was that "everyone wanted 
to keep San Marino pretty much the same as it always has been. But that's not 
going to be easy to do -- for financial reasons." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are designed to shape public policy between now and 2013, 
the year of the community's centennial. The City Council officially accepted 
the report last week, but council members said they will need time to study it 
before discussing its recommendations. Copies will be mailed to all households 
and businesses in the city next week. 
</P>
<P>
While calling it a "really fine report," Mayor Suzanne Crowell said city 
officials were "proceeding cautiously. I don't think we're ready to make any 
big pronouncement on anything." 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Eugene Dryden said: "We now have a very good challenge to figure out 
how to go through and implement" the recommendations. But, he said, "we will 
not necessarily take their recommendations verbatim." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he said, "whether we come out in favor of the 710 Freeway or not 
remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
On the emotional annexation issue, the subcommittee studying it concluded that 
adding residents of certain neighborhoods might help to bolster the declining 
enrollment and coffers of the city's school system. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that "thorough consideration" be given to annexation of 
nearby county neighborhoods. One of two county areas where residents are 
petitioning to be annexed to San Marino contains apartments, not allowed under 
San Marino zoning. 
</P>
<P>
The report was adamant that zoning laws, which now allow only single-family 
residences in the city, should not be changed. But Maxwell said it "didn't 
close the door" on taking in an area with apartments, perhaps through 
"grandfathering," which would allow duplexes or apartments only where they 
already exist in an area to be annexed. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be overriding benefit to the city in order to justify such action," 
the report said. Such a benefit could include a financial one, it suggested. 
</P>
<P>
In the education section, the report went into great detail about financing of 
the public schools. The city, the report urged, should take steps to solicit 
new families with children who will attend the public schools as a way to 
stabilize enrollments, which have declined in recent years. It did not specify 
how such solicitation should be done. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing social problems, the education subcommittee lamented "the countless 
unsupervised teen-age parties and the apparent lack of parental unity in 
approaching these problems." And, the report said, the city has a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
As a tactic to educate the community about alcohol and drug abuse, a 
subcommittee proposed that the city sponsor quarterly Town Hall-style meetings 
with young people, parents and police officials. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee also identified child care as a pressing issue and recommended 
that city officials consider changing zoning to allow "a quality commercial 
child-care provider" in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the subcommittee identified ethnic issues as a potential problem in 
the schools, where 47% of the students are of Asian ancestry, many of them or 
their parents new immigrants. "Our community could become polarized by ethnic 
differences," the report said, urging the city Recreation Department to offer 
adult classes in English for non-native speakers. 
</P>
<P>
The core committee that oversaw the report included, besides Maxwell, the chief 
executive officer of an electronics firm, a real estate broker, a contractor, 
the president of an investment management firm, two former teachers and two 
engineers. Community involvement of these ranged from the San Marino Chinese 
Club to the Tournament of Roses Assn., Little League and the PTA.

CHILDREN OF THE DRUG WAR;

<P>
EXPOSED PRENATALLY, BABIES NEED TOP CARE

COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she arrived at the Covina Development Center in May, 2-year-old Diane 
weighed nine pounds, couldn't walk or swallow solid food and stared blankly at 
her teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, the tot with the curly black hair is up to 15 pounds. She's 
eating meals and making eye contact. Her development is now equivalent to that 
of a 3-month-old child. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the heartbreakingly slow progress made by children exposed prenatally 
to drugs. Diane -- not her real name -- is one of about 35 children in the 
preschool program at the Covina Development Center who suffer learning 
disabilities because their mothers smoked crack, shot heroin, took PCP or mixed 
all three with alcohol while pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
At the Covina center, teachers are on the front line of what experts call a 
developing epidemic. No one knows how many drug-exposed children are growing up 
across America, but Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, president of the National Assn. for 
Perinatal Addiction Research and Education in Chicago, estimates that more than 
375,000 of the 3.9 million babies born each year have been exposed prenatally 
to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say prenatal drug exposure can leave children with a variety of 
emotional, physiological and neurological problems that linger long after a 
newborn undergoes withdrawal. Damage can range from mental retardation and 
convulsions in the most extreme cases to poor motor and cognitive skills, 
hyperactivity, speech defects, an inability to concentrate or remember, 
violence, apathy and lack of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters, doctors and teachers say it's impossible to separate the 
prenatal damage done by drugs and alcohol from the environmental problems bred 
by poverty and neglect. Often, the two go hand in hand; bouncing children from 
abusive parents to institutions and foster homes doesn't help, professionals 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Covina's is one of a handful of programs in the Los Angeles area that work with 
drug-exposed children, all of whom have been removed by court order from their 
families and placed in foster homes. At the preschool, teachers, psychologists 
and aides help children ages 1 to 4 develop play skills, control their tempers, 
interact in small groups and build self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Although much remains unknown about how to educate drug-exposed children, 
experience has taught those at the Covina Resource Center that emotional 
nurturing and individualized attention are the keys. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thrust of our program is to redevelop their sense of trust. 
They're very fragile emotionally," says Executive Director Paula Jeppson, who 
operates the nonprofit center in classrooms leased from the Covina Christian 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, they haven't bonded with anybody. We try to make the world very safe 
for them so they can concentrate on learning activities," Jeppson says. 
</P>
<P>
She believes most drug-exposed children have the potential to improve if they 
receive focused help in their first years of life. But she adds that there is 
not enough money available from state, federal and local agencies to identify 
and work with them. At Covina, teachers have worked with about 200 drug-exposed 
babies in the last three years, assigning one staff member to each three 
children at a cost of $60 per child per day. Two-thirds of the program's 
funding comes from the Covina-San Gabriel-Pomona Regional Center, which funnels 
state money to local agencies that work with the developmentally disabled. The 
San Gabriel Valley Assn. for Retarded Citizens provides the rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, administrators are in their third 
year of a pilot program to identify and teach drug-exposed children. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeppson estimates there are thousands of drug-exposed children in Los 
Angeles County who are falling through the cracks of a system that doesn't 
recognize their unique problems. Local agencies are set up to deal with 
disabilities such as mental retardation or deafness, but most drug-exposed 
children don't fit those categories. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, they have a difficult time qualifying for funding. Others become 
victims of their own success if they score too high on achievement tests that 
are administered periodically. Drug-exposed children often score high on IQ 
tests but are saddled with overwhelming behavioral and learning disabilities 
that make it impossible for them to function in a regular classroom, Jeppson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Take Johnny (not his real name), who underwent heroin withdrawal at birth and 
was shuttled from foster home to foster home because of physical and emotional 
problems. Placed in the Covina center, he began to thrive. His tantrums stopped 
and he progressed in play skills. But when he scored above 69% on an 
achievement test, he no longer qualified for public funding and was placed in 
regular kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
In a class with 30 other children, Johnny regressed. He threw tantrums that 
lasted hours. When teachers chastised him, he only grew worse. Eventually, the 
court placed Johnny in an institution. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have an enormous potential to get better if they're served," 
Jeppson says. "If not, society is not going to be able to contain them." 
</P>
<P>
Jeppson says courts, schools, social services and funding agencies must 
recognize the special needs of drug-exposed children and create a new category 
to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Jeppson said, her center worked mainly with children who 
were developmentally disabled because of Down's syndrome or other, more 
traditional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, however, children with unusual new troubles hit the preschool 
center. These drug-exposed babies threw uncontrollable tantrums. They were 
easily overwhelmed by too many people, toys, noise or movement. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they make up 70% of the Covina Resource Center children. 
</P>
<P>
Now, teachers meet the children at the bus every morning, taking their hands, 
leading them into the classrooms, addressing them by name to reassure them 
about their new environment. New concepts are introduced slowly, accompanied by 
exaggerated physical or verbal cues to prepare the child. 
</P>
<P>
Showering the children with attention and affection is also important, teachers 
have found. For children who have spent their young lives shuttling from foster 
to group care homes, a nurturing teacher may provide the only consistent 
security and love they know. 
</P>
<P>
"These children need to feel safe, and sometimes their worlds need to get just 
a little smaller," Jeppson said. "They do beautifully here, but put them in a 
classroom with 30 other children and they fall apart."

GROUP GETS OPTION ON LAND

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council agreed Tuesday to give the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit 
group, the option to buy 1,200 acres of city land in Sawpit Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Trust for Public Land will have two years to decide 
whether to buy the hillside property for $648,000, or about $540 an acre. The 
trust, based in San Francisco, buys property and transfers it to such agencies 
as the U.S. Forest Service for permanent preservation as open space or for 
recreational use, City Atty. Richard J. Morillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia sold 635 acres of land in the foothills above Duarte to the same group 
in 1987 for $320,000.

<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved a $100,000 project for reconstructing 
restrooms at two city parks. 
</P>
<P>
The project, paid for with a state park conservation grant, will include water 
conservation equipment and graffiti-proofing at Vincent Lugo and Smith parks. 
</P>
<P>
Also, starting Oct. 18, charitable organizations in the city will be required 
to renew their solicitation permits only once a year. 
</P>
<P>
The council amended the current regulation that requires nonprofit 
organizations to renew permits every month. City officials said the monthly 
requirement was too time-consuming.

FIREFIGHTING FEE OKD

<P>
The cost of fighting fires and responding to other emergencies would be billed 
to people responsible for the incidents under an ordinance tentatively approved 
by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Marshal Lyn LaRochelle estimated that the city would collect $7,000 to 
$10,000 a year under the cost recovery program, which is already in use in a 
number of other cities and counties. Under the plan, La Rochelle said, Pomona 
could recover costs from arsonists, from people who illegally store hazardous 
materials, from people who cause accidents while driving under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol and from parents whose children cause property damage. 
</P>
<P>
A final vote on the measure is expected Oct. 1.

BEST BETS: LEGENDS OF CHUMASH TO BE BROUGHT TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illusions Theatre celebrates "The Spirit of the Chumash" in Ojai's Libbey Bowl 
when six myths and legends are brought to life starting Friday in a collection 
of oral narratives adapted for stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The production is based on Tom Blackburn's 'December Child,' capturing the 
beliefs, the good times, the bad times and the creative genius of the Chumash 
people," said Bettie Ridenour, who is director of the Illusions Theatre. 
</P>
<P>

TERM LIMITS RESCINDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has reversed its decision to limit city commissioners to four 
consecutive two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday rescinded the limits, imposed earlier this month, after 
members could not agree on how to implement them. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was when the clock should start running for commissioners now serving. 
After two motions on the subject died for lack of seconds, Councilman Patrick 
Froehle moved to repeal the limits altogether. Councilwoman Mary Manning 
seconded the motion, and because there was no objection, Mayor Thomas Breazeal 
ordered the limits rescinded.

For this week's Ventura County theater review, the fourth in the series, we 
took a look at the Century 8 Theatres complex at 2875 Elba St. in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Food: Know that saying "You can't tell a book by its cover"? Well, you 
apparently can't tell a hot dog by its bun, either. The appetizing sesame seed 
bun (and the attractive double wrapping) hid what turned out to be a very salty 
dog that wasn't particularly easy to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
The popcorn was a pleasant surprise. It is advertised as being served with real 
butter, and it tasted like the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: Very clean. For people washing their hands, there is the option of 
the blow-dry machine or paper towels -- a nice feature for moviegoers whose 
skin chaps easily. The color scheme is a pleasant brown and white. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie entertainment: Ahhh. Something different. A combined 
advertisement/movie trivia slide show with symphonic Muzak playing softly in 
the background. So, do you know the name of Indiana Jones' sidekick in "Temple 
of Doom?" 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: One. 
</P>
<P>
Previews: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Theater features: A high-domed ceiling and a curved screen give each theater a 
spacious, circular effect. Seats are soft and comfortable and rock back and 
forth -- a great place to take a nap if the film gets boring. 
</P>
<P>
Special added attractions: A stress tester, sex meter, photo booth and video 
arcade in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Short Round (played by Ke Huy Quan). 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday from the Ojai Film Society: "Time of the Gypsies" (1989). With a 
cast of mostly Gypsies, this Yugoslavian- Romanian film tells the story of an 
orphaned Gypsy boy with magical powers who resorts to thievery, baby stealing 
and murder to come up with enough money to get married. 
</P>
<P>
The film won the Director's Prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival. Show 
time at the Ojai Playhouse is 4:30 p.m.; tickets are $6. LEO SMITH

THE PETER IN 'PETER AND THE WOLF'; 
</P>
<P>
ACTOR PETER STRAUSS IS PREPARING FOR ONE OF HIS TOUGHEST ROLES, WITH CHILDREN 
AS HIS CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Strauss is sitting in the office of his Spanish hacienda in Ojai, his 
latest script lying open on the desk. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the sight wouldn't be unusual. Ever since Strauss first gained fame 
in the television miniseries "Rich Man, Poor Man," the Emmy Award-winning actor 
has had no complaints about a lack of television, film and stage projects. 
</P>
<P>
But this script is different. 
</P>
<P>
It's a musical, and Strauss doesn't sing. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of action going on, but he doesn't move. 
</P>
<P>
He's a big-name actor, but he gets upstaged by a French horn. 
</P>
<P>
No, this is not some avant-garde collaboration between Oliver Stone and Rogers 
and Hammerstein. Strauss is preparing for his role as the narrator in the 
Ventura County Symphony's performance of "Peter and the Wolf," Serge 
Prokofiev's musical fairy tale for children. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, part of the Ventura Music Celebration, will also include the 
humorous "March Past of the Kitchen Utensils" from "The Wasps" by Ralph 
Vaughn-Williams, "Intermezzo" by Enrique Granados, the minute and finale from 
Franz Joseph Hayden's Symphony No. 45, and the first movement of Beethoven's 
Piano Concert No. 3, performed by 15-year-old Joseph Shen Chieh I. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss, whose script is actually an orchestral score that has fortune 
cookielike strips of narration taped to various bars, sees his appearance with 
the symphony as a professional challenge. After all, he said, a role once 
performed by Eleanor Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Mia Farrow and Peter Ustinov 
is nothing to sneeze at. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking the part lightly at all," Strauss said. "Kids are probably the 
worst, toughest audience there is." 
</P>
<P>
Strauss should know. He is the father of two sons, ages 4 and 6, and he's an 
actor whose face and voice can be seen and heard often on television. 
</P>
<P>
But his children aren't that impressed with his acting credentials. Often, 
they'll walk by the television set and remark off-handedly, "Oh, there's Dad on 
the TV again," as they head off to play, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His sons may be his toughest critics, but they have taught him a thing or two. 
"If I read them a story and start getting into it and acting out too many of 
the characters, they'll get frustrated with me," he said, laughing. "They say, 
'Oh Dad, can't you just read it?' So right now, I have to give a lot of thought 
to how I'll approach the narrator's part." 
</P>
<P>
Strauss has other reasons to worry about his upcoming performance. He has a 
background in music because his German father, a pianist, introduced him to it 
when he was a child. And when he was young, the younger Strauss played double 
bass. But reading an orchestral score, he said, is a bit different. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of counting each bar, as an instrumental player would, Strauss will 
rely on the notations for the musicians -- such as those telling them to play 
staccato or pizzicato -- for his cues. 
</P>
<P>
He will also be depending on symphony conductor Frank Salazar, who came out to 
the 35-acre Ojai ranch last week to check on Strauss' comfort level with the 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"We only had one rehearsal, and so he wanted to walk me through it," Strauss 
said. "Frank hummed the entire score for me, and then would ask me, 'Do you 
hear the violins here?' Then I'd say, 'Yeah, now do the horns,' " said Strauss, 
suddenly breaking into an imitation of Salazar imitating a French horn. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar said he has absolute confidence in Strauss, adding that he is a 
"wonderful choice" for the part. 
</P>
<P>
"The role requires a first-class actor, more than musicianship," Salazar said. 
"It's not like a singer where he'd have to hit specific pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Written in 1936 for a small orchestra, "Peter and the Wolf" is the story of a 
young boy who captures a large, ferocious wolf with the help of friendly 
animals. Each character in the piece is associated with a specific instrument 
and melodic phrase -- the wolf, for instance, is represented by a French horn, 
the bird by a flute and the cat by a clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
Because the piece allows listeners to identify the different sounds and 
personalities of various instruments, it has long been considered one of the 
better ways to introduce children to an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a masterpiece," Salazar said. "No one should get through childhood 
without hearing it." 
</P>
<P>
For Strauss, who is donating his time to the symphony, that was the major 
motivation for taking the role. His sons will be sitting in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the perfect example of something that allows kids to use their muscle of 
imagination and conjure up their own images," he said, pausing for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to bite the hand that feeds me," he said, "but it's the 
antithesis of TV." 
</P>

CHARGES OF BIAS PROMPT CALL FOR U.S. PROBE AT KING'S VILLAGES; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: TENANTS SAY THE MANAGER EVICTS OR HARASSES THEM IF THEY EXERCISE THEIR 
CIVIL RIGHTS.

<P>
Reports of evictions and harassment of tenants at the King's Villages housing 
project in Northwest Pasadena have prompted the city Board of Directors to call 
for an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The board wants federal authorities to prosecute Thomas Pottmeyer, manager of 
the privately owned low-income housing project, if, as the King's Villages 
Tenants Union Organization maintains, he has violated the civil rights of his 
tenants, most of whom are black. 
</P>
<P>
"This Pottmeyer is writing a new chapter in discrimination," City Director 
William Paparian said Tuesday. "He's not discriminating because of their race; 
he's discriminating because they're exercising their rights as American 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Pottmeyer has singled out for evictions outspoken tenants or those active in 
the tenants organization, tenant union members told the board Tuesday. Such 
actions appear to violate constitutional rights of assembly and petition, 
Paparian said. 
</P>
<P>
Pottmeyer denied that he has evicted activists. "I haven't violated anyone's 
civil rights," he said Wednesday. "No one has brought a grievance to me that I 
haven't listened to." 
</P>
<P>
The board Tuesday voted unanimously to request the federal investigation. It 
also directed the city attorney to determine whether Pottmeyer's business 
partner and housing project co-owner, Goldrich, Kest &amp; Associates, can be 
sued by the city for breach of contract and for money damages. Goldrich and 
Kest bought the project from the city in 1982 under a sale agreement 
prohibiting discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the board voted to ask federal Housing and Urban Development 
officials to terminate Pottmeyer's management contract if he has violated 
federal rules for operating low-income housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I have talked with Mr. Pottmeyer, and hard-nosed is a polite word," City 
Director William Thomson said. "The only thing he is going to respond to is 
strength and force." 
</P>
<P>
Since January, when tenants complained of conditions at the complex and 
demanded action from the board, city officials have been scrutinizing the 
272-unit housing project along Fair Oaks Avenue. A report on evictions over the 
past three years at the project will be presented to the board in two weeks, 
said Gordon Anderson, acting director of the Pasadena Employment Development 
and Community Services. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also have been investigating whether the city has the legal 
ability to force a management change. 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Philip Hawkey said Tuesday that Pottmeyer's response to city 
inquiries has been to "counterattack and express resentment." Pottmeyer has 
declined to explain his policies, instead citing his rights as owner of a 
privately held housing project, Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
Pottmeyer said city officials seem determined to draw him into a conflict and 
denied that he has been uncooperative with them or unsympathetic to his 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"I run the complex like I run any apartment complex anywhere," Pottmeyer said. 
"I do not discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
The 26-acre development opened in 1969 as a HUD project but reverted to city 
hands when the developers went bankrupt in 1982. The city quickly sold it to 
Goldrich and Kest, a Culver City-based company with 10,000 HUD projects in 
California. The company accepts low-income tenants with federal rent subsidies 
under the Section 8 program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Pottmeyer was brought in as a managing partner with a 49% ownership. 
Since he began managing the complex, tenants have complained that they are 
spied upon, harassed, questioned about visits from those outside the complex 
and issued eviction notices when they stand up for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants also complained about the death in January of Robert Earl Holloway, who 
was strangled after project security guards tried to detain him for 
trespassing. Despite requests by the tenants for prosecution of those involved, 
the district attorney and the state attorney general both declined to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Pottmeyer, who maintains that he is ridding the project of drug dealers, said 
the complainers are mainly former tenants. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernice McDaniels, 63, a 17-year resident at the complex, told the 
board Tuesday that Pottmeyer has been "picking on" her for nearly two years. He 
fired her from a grounds maintenance job at the complex and threatened to evict 
her after she circulated a petition on tenant rights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
He also threatened to evict her because of an iron screen door she had 
installed at her apartment more than seven years ago, she said. McDaniels said 
11 other tenants with iron screen doors have been similarly threatened. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Pottmeyer entered her apartment unannounced and told her he was 
checking the management office key to the screen door, McDaniels said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was so angry that she took the key from Pottmeyer, then tossed it 
back. Two weeks later, she said, she received an eviction notice accusing her 
of assault. 
</P>
<P>
Pottmeyer denied having entered her apartment and said he came no closer than 
five feet from her door. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not trespass, period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels said that she has since filed a lawsuit against Pottmeyer for 
trespassing and that he has refused to accept her rent payments for the past 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the board watched a videotape made Sept. 4 of McDaniels attempting 
unsuccessfully to pay her rent at the housing project's management office. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant June Harper said Pottmeyer uses what she termed "scare tactics" against 
politically active tenants, refusing to accept their rent payments on the 
grounds that they are being evicted. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Denton, public affairs officer for the U.S. Attorney's office in downtown 
Los Angeles, said the Pasadena officials' request for an investigation would be 
forwarded to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Any decision to prosecute would then be made in Washington by the Justice 
Department, Denton said. The regional office would have only the responsibility 
of filing the charges and prosecuting.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH CITY FATHERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I moved to Alhambra to get away from gangs, graffiti, unkept lawns, loose dogs, 
drunks and dirty streets. 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm seeing my street being taken over and going down the drain in a very 
rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, in a half-block area, 12 homes have been knocked down to 
build condos or rentals. We have not had a clean street in all that time. Every 
day, trucks go up and down with dirt and materials. Hammering, electric saws, 
loud music, lunch trucks blow their horns at break and lunchtime, not once but 
three times every day. 
</P>
<P>
Old apartments rent for high rents, so three and four families move into one 
unit, kids play in the street until late at night, shopping carts, loud music, 
cars race at all hours. Laundry hangs on fences and porches. Fights at night 
and graffiti, so gangs know that this street belongs to them. Schools 
overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
I saw my old neighborhood go down and now I'm seeing Alhambra going down even 
faster. What is wrong with our city fathers? Can't they come out of their fancy 
homes and offices into the real world? Drive by the streets and see what is 
going on. I cry for Alhambra. It was a wonderful city, but not anymore. When 
I'm walking down my street and see about seven to 10 boys flipping a knife, you 
don't know what they're going to do. It really scares me!

NIGHT LIFE THE CLUB SCENE: I-RAILS LISTEN TO FANS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY CAN PLAY ANYTHING FROM "PURPLE HAZE" TO "SESAME STREET."

<P>
Well, there's art rock -- you know, Brian Eno, The Moody Blues, XTC and like 
that -- but how about smart rock? The local rock trio, the I-Rails, features 
two members who moved here from Visalia. Now that's smart. 
</P>
<P>
Bass player and singer Chris O'Connor and guitarist and singer Jeff Sparks met 
in school in Visalia, then moved here like everyone else. With drummer Tim 
Lauterio (a local), the I-Rails have been around for three or four years. The 
band is in the process of recording its fourth tape, which will be titled 
"Panharmonium." It surely will be original, hard-driving rock with no Megadeth 
covers. O'Connor and Sparks offer some happening harmonies that make the 
I-Rails worth the drive. 
</P>
<P>
But remember, fun is never a four-letter word when the I-Rails play. Often, the 
band members take requests from the audience and they can do just about 
everything from "Purple Haze" to "Sesame Street" and stuff even stranger than 
that, especially by the last set. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, the members described their life and music. 
</P>
<P>
Where do you guys play? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Pretty much around here -- Charlie's, Alex's Cantina in Santa 
Barbara, occasionally a gig at The Carnaval Club and, if we're lucky, the 
Ventura Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: But we're not very lucky. No one seems to be very interested in us. Our 
fans actually want to save the world, but they'd rather sit in Charlie's and 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
Describe the rather extensive I-Rails discography. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: We had two tapes that we barely released -- about 200 copies each. I 
don't even have copies of them. Then we put out a single record. The last tape, 
"Nine Songs From Nowhere," sold out all 700 copies. I don't know if we'll make 
more; it's a hassle. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Fame is unnecessary for a band of genius. 
</P>
<P>
If nobody hears your stuff, how do you get signed? 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: You don't get signed from Ventura. We just want to play and make good 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Mass acceptance is not a sign of quality. The thing is to create 
great things and, somehow, they will be heard. 
</P>
<P>
How did the band get started? 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: We knew each other at Mt. Whitney High School in Visalia, even before 
that. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Yeah, Jeff taught me how to play guitar in fifth or sixth grade. 
Then, later, we moved down here in 1986. We wanted to be near L.A., but not in 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Describe I-Rails music. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Well, we want to be totally credible as a . . . rock band, and still 
be subtle. We don't want to get stuck. We're not afraid of any style of music. 
We don't rule anything out. 
</P>
<P>
Who are some of your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: The third Replacements' album, Husker Du, R.E.M., stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
And what are you guys in it for? 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: Hey, we're artists, you know. 
</P>
<P>
How come nobody dances much anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: Well, they used to. I think it's directly proportional to the amount of 
alcohol consumed. Also, there's more dancers on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: And let's not forget the introspective, retrospective and intelligent 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: Let's not. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best thing about being local rock gods? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Well, it sure ain't hauling all this equipment around. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks: It sure ain't getting drunk and then having to go to work the next day. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: It sure ain't playing the same hole-in-the-wall places all the time. 
But we just keep playing anyway. 
</P>
<P>
So the I-Rails still need day jobs? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: Sure. I'm an air-traffic controller, Jeff works for Patagonia and Tim

TRYING TO PASS THE LOS ALTOS QB TEST; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: MIKE ALLEN IS THE LATEST IN A LINE OF SUCCESSFUL QUARTERBACKS AT 
LOS ALTOS, BUT WHERE HE WILL RANK IS YET TO BE DETERMINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the annals of CIF Southern Section football history, the names of Los Altos 
High quarterbacks dot the list of passing records like a shrine to the school's 
tradition-rich past. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, quarterbacks such as Mike Smith, Dennis Sproul, Rob 
Hertel and Blake Smith have played an integral role in developing the Hacienda 
Heights school into one of the most successful programs in the Southern 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquerors have another quarterback who is generating a lot of attention 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Los Altos Coach Dwayne DeSpain said senior Mike Allen might not rank 
with the Smiths or the Hertels yet, but he is heading in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be a good one," DeSpain said. "He's going to be one of the best, 
but we'll really have to wait until after the season to really evaluate him." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 17, who is starting his third season as Los Altos quarterback, already 
has some impressive numbers behind him. In his first two seasons with the 
Conquerors, he completed 226 of 413 passes for 2,822 yards and 29 touchdowns 
with only 11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
After two games as a senior, the 6-foot-4, 200-pound Allen leads the San 
Gabriel Valley in passing yardage, having completed 27 of 48 passes for 369 
yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive is the fact that the Conquerors have produced a 23-4 
record over the past three seasons with Allen at quarterback, including a 2-0 
start this season. 
</P>
<P>
Success has followed Allen since his first season on the varsity as a 
sophomore, when the Conquerors won the Southern Section Division IV 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Allen admits he is a little surprised at his success considering his limited 
background in football and the injury problems that beset him before he joined 
the Los Altos varsity. 
</P>
<P>
As a youth, Allen said he was more interested in basketball than football. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd throw the football around a little at home but mostly we played 
basketball," he said. "It seemed like that's what we played at home most of the 
time. When I was younger, I'd always be in the back yard playing with my dad or 
brother." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Allen never played organized football until his first year in high 
school on the freshman team. That season was cut short by an injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I never played Junior All-American ball," Allen said. "I played a little 
sandlot ball on the street, but this is where I started playing football. Then 
in my freshman year in high school I broke my knee in my first league game and 
didn't play the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
For Allen, it was the second time in two years that he had suffered a serious 
leg injury. He also broke a leg when he was in the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
But after regaining full strength by the end of his freshman year, Allen 
quickly learned DeSpain's intricate passing offense. By the end of preseason 
practice as a sophomore, Allen had become the team's starting quarterback -- 
one of the youngest ever to accomplish the feat at Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure coming from a school like Los Altos because we have 
such a good tradition," Allen said. "But I guess I caught on pretty quick. 
</P>
<P>
"You start to learn the system when you're a freshman and then just add a 
couple of things each year. So you know it pretty well by the time you're a 
senior." 
</P>
<P>
With three years of experience to draw from, Allen said he feels confident this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Just knowing more about what to expect out there is a big difference," he 
said. "I've also gotten more accurate with my throwing and that's given me 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
DeSpain said Allen's strength and leadership ability are two areas where he has 
improved from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked with weights a lot in the off-season and he's just gotten very 
strong," DeSpain said. "His poise and his ability to read (defenses) are very 
good and just his overall leadership has been outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Allen also said he has benefited from a better mental approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably improved the most over the summer because that's when I really 
started to understand the mental aspects of the game," he said. "I think as a 
sophomore I didn't really understand the proper mental approach to the game and 
now I do. If I can stay sharp mentally, I think I can have a good year." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he also worked on his footwork during the summer and that has helped 
improve his time in the 40-yard dash to about 4.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"My footwork's come a long way," he said. "It's still not where I want it to be 
but it has come a long way. I think basketball really helped a lot with that. I 
played a lot of summer basketball and you have to always be quick on your feet 
for that. I think that's really helped my foot speed for football." 
</P>
<P>
Allen has already caught the attention of college scouts. One national scouting 
service, the Pennsylvania-based G&amp;W Recruiting Report, said he "may have 
(the) strongest arm in California. (He) throws the ball 60 yards with ease." 
</P>
<P>
Grades will certainly not be a problem for Allen. He has a cumulative 
grade-point average of 3.5 and it is 3.7 including honors points. 
</P>
<P>
"My grades are important, especially to my parents," Allen said. "I'd say 
they've always pushed the academics. When it comes to that, they've always been 
hard on me." 
</P>
<P>
Allen is also a standout setter in volleyball and was a center in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Although he likes basketball, he doesn't think he has a future there. 
</P>
<P>
"I still enjoy it a lot but I don't know many people in (NCAA) Division I who 
are looking for a 6-4 post man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he has yet to decide between his other two sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I really have to wait and decide after this year," he said. "I really like 
volleyball and I like football, too." 
</P>
<P>
If he decides to play football, there is a good chance that he will wind up at 
either Brigham Young University or Arizona State. His father, John, played wide 
receiver at Arizona State in the 1950s and his older brother, Marvin, played 
linebacker for BYU teams in the early 1980s that included quarterbacks such as 
Steve Young, Jim McMahon and Robbie Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who is a Mormon, admits that BYU is his top choice. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole family went to BYU," he said. "My brother and (five) sisters went 
there and I've gone up to (football) camps up there. I also have a lot of 
friends there and I have a sister who lives about five minutes from the 
campus." 
</P>
<P>
But Allen doesn't want to get ahead of himself or think too much about passing 
records or college plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really set any goals in terms of numbers," he said. "But I know that 
as long as we do our best and I do as well as I can, the rest will follow."

CRIME STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are almost 8,000 stories in the naked city of Ojai, few of them 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
But that's by big-city crime standards. 
</P>
<P>
By the small-town standards that Ojai's leaders so fiercely maintain, there's 
plenty to keep a law enforcement officer busy, and sometimes entertained. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 24, 1989, Darrow (Duke) Tully, publisher of the Ojai Valley News, 
shot a neighbor's dog after it wandered into his yard. The district attorney 
charged Tully with one count of cruelty to animals. The publisher was convicted 
of a misdemeanor and had to give up his BB gun. The dog, a 10-year-old cockapoo 
mix named Baby, recovered and was back in his yard the next day. 
</P>
<P>
* On March 1, 1990, a student known as Shi Stone was handcuffed and led away 
from Nordhoff High School. Authorities alleged he was not the 17-year-old son 
of a U.S. soldier wounded in Panama, as he claimed, but a 31-year-old veteran 
con man named David Michael Murray. "Ojai was wide open to me," he told a 
reporter later, while jailed. "I could have taken the entire town." 
Stone/Murray, who has maintained that he is both innocent and 17 years old, is 
scheduled to begin trial in late September. He is expected to represent 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
* On May 23, 1990, a man and woman on horseback rode into The Hub, a bar on 
Ojai Avenue, and ordered two beers to go. While they did so, their horses left 
droppings on the carpet. The owners of the bar, Jim and Leah Beard, said they 
knew the man, but they and police filed no charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
To help cut its waste 25% by 1995 -- as required by the state -- the Temple 
City Council adopted a trash recycling program Tuesday that should be in 
operation before the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which will cost residents an extra $1.45 a month, provides to each 
single-family home in the city three nesting bins, the size of milk crates, for 
cans, glass and newspapers. These materials will be collected on each week's 
second trash-pickup day. 
</P>
<P>
The council said recycling programs for yard clippings and trash from 
businesses are also planned.

CALLS CAN RANGE UP TO HOSTAGE SITUATIONS. THEY MAKE A DEPUTY'S JOB STRESSFUL 
AND CHALLENGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Rick Jones, 26, is one who wears a badge in Ojai. He also 
lives there and grew up there. The kids wave to him in his squad car, and the 
people at the Village Pastry Shop know he likes his croissants with ham and 
cheese. Yes, the cops in Ojai eat croissants. 
</P>
<P>
This is how a weekday work night went for Deputy Jones: 
</P>
<P>
First, a 3 p.m. briefing in the substation staff room -- four deputies coming 
on, four going off, and a row of black flashlights recharging along one wall as 
scuttlebutt is passed. All four deputies are to watch the city, two of them 
will monitor the less affluent surrounding neighborhoods as well. 
</P>
<P>
The scuttlebutt: A fancy Italian motorcycle -- bright red, worth something like 
$15,000 -- was stolen from in front of MK's restaurant the night before. And a 
man in a red Triumph was seen the afternoon before at Camp Comfort, a park on 
the edge of town, giving money to children and suggesting trips to Magic 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was off to the streets. Outside the city limits, Jones arrested a 
28-year-old Oak View man for throwing a piece of pottery at another man, and 
looked over signs of small-scale juvenile vandalism in a Meiners Oaks rental 
residence. He also assisted California Highway Patrol officers and an ambulance 
crew when an 8-year-old boy was hit by a black Camaro in Meiners Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Calls in the unincorporated areas can range from the smallest thing to a 
hostage situation, Jones said, and they are what make a deputy's job stressful 
and challenging. 
</P>
<P>
But on this night, inside Ojai, almost nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
* A little after 4 p.m., a lifeguard called from Nordhoff High School, saying 
she had been threatened by three young men from the area, who were refusing to 
leave. Jones rolled up in his car, and then a second deputy rolled up, and then 
a third. The young men were gone. The deputies got descriptions and left. 
</P>
<P>
* At 5 p.m., Michelle Wells, 15, called in a discovery. On her way back from a 
racquet club with friends, she had seen a red glint in a ditch next to 
Buckboard Lane. A motorcycle. She called authorities and when deputies arrived 
-- one, two, three cars -- they saw the word "Ducati" on the gas tank. The 
stolen cycle. Unable to hot-wire it, the thieves had pushed it several blocks 
and discreetly parked it beneath an oak tree across from a half-million-dollar 
house on Buckboard Lane, taking care to use the kickstand. While another deputy 
gathered information, Jones gave Wells a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
* About 9 p.m., Jones stopped for dinner at Wendy's, which sits just outside of 
town because drive-throughs are forbidden inside city limits. 
</P>
<P>
* At 9:50 p.m., another deputy made a traffic stop at Ojai Avenue and Signal 
Street, and cited the driver for no tail lights, no driver's license on hand, 
and an expired registration. 
</P>
<P>
After eight hours on the job, Jones showed on his log four calls, one observe, 
and one felony arrest -- the pottery-thrower in Oak View. A slot was open in 
the next shift, and he decided to pick it up and work the whole night. 
</P>
<P>
* At 3:15 a.m., Jones pulled a driver over at Ojai Avenue and Country Club 
Drive, and wrote out a citation for lack of auto insurance and driving with an 
expired registration. 
</P>
<P>
* At 3:39 a.m., another deputy made a traffic stop at Ojai Valley Inn. 
</P>
<P>
And at some point, someone complained about an illegally parked car that turned 
out to be parked perfectly legally. 
</P>
<P>
That was about it for the night in the city of Ojai: one stolen motorcycle 
recovery, one suspicious circumstances call at Nordhoff High School, three 
traffic stops and a legally parked car. "An unusually slow night," Jones said.

FEELING BAD, SOUNDING GOOD;

<P>
FOR ROCKER MELISSA ETHERIDGE, A LOVE THAT HAS TURNED SOUR IS DEFINITELY 
SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT. 
</P>

<P>
If it were the movies, rocker Melissa Etheridge would be what is called the 
strong female lead -- perhaps Sigourney Weaver beating up those slimy "aliens." 
She's got a voice as big as all outdoors, sort of like Pat Benatar on steroids, 
and Etheridge rocks as hard as any of those guys in leather pants. 
</P>
<P>
The Beatles may have sung ". . . all you need is love," but the love Etheridge 
sings about, nobody needs. It's angst with a beat, rocky relationships that 
rock. But you'll probably be too busy dancing to hang yourself. She has a hot 
band behind her featuring, among others, Bernie Larsen on guitar. Feeling bad 
never sounded so good. 
</P>
<P>
From "Let Me Go," a sample line: 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I the snake inside your garden 
</P>
<P>
 The sugar in your tea 
</P>
<P>
 The knock upon your backdoor 
</P>
<P>
 The twist that turns your key 
</P>
<P>
 Am I the sweat you feel on your hand 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow on your face 
</P>
<P>
 The tune inside your head that put you 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the first place 
</P>
<P>
 Well I don't want to be . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Etheridge, from Leavenworth, Kan., is on a roll with two gold albums. The 
self-titled 1988 debut earned her a Grammy nomination. The second album, "Brave 
and Crazy," was released in 1989, also on Island Records. 
</P>
<P>
Etheridge, 29, will make her local debut when she plays the tree-lined Santa 
Barbara County Bowl on Saturday night along with local rock heroes Toad the Wet 
Sprocket. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, she had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
When can we expect a new album? 
</P>
<P>
Well, we're going into the studio in February. It'll probably be another year. 
</P>
<P>
Will you be playing any new songs at the concert? 
</P>
<P>
Well, that depends on the crowd -- sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in the music business? 
</P>
<P>
I've been in the music business ever since I could walk. It didn't come from my 
family -- it wasn't a musical family. I got into music from records I bought 
and from listening to the radio. WHB was our station in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Who were some of your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
Most of it was pop music from the '60s -- the Beatles, Tommy James &amp; the 
Shondells and, later, Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
You've toured extensively the last couple of years; where are most of the 
Melissa fans? 
</P>
<P>
Wow, Montreal, Canada, I guess; I'm a huge star up there. I'm also popular in 
Australia, New York, Colorado and California. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a basic Melissa fan, and is it a serious, young female English lit 
major-type dressed in black? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it used to be like that, young, female, between 20 and 30 years old, 
working or in college, but not so much anymore. I'm attracting everybody now 
and that's really exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Was J. Geils right; does love stink? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you can't deal with it, it can. But it's not so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Does bad love make good songs? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, but it's my challenge to make a common experience into a good song. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Nilsson once wrote a song called "Joy" in the early '70s. It had a line 
in it that said, "If everyone was happy, there wouldn't be any love songs. . . 
." Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
That's true. As songwriters, we tend to deal with conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
How would you describe Melissa music? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's rock 'n' roll. Hopefully, it's an intense performance of feelings 
and emotions that we all experience. 
</P>
<P>
What do you say when people tell you, "Melissa, lighten up"? 
</P>
<P>
I say now wait a minute, I'm not actually just complaining about things. I 
believe it's important to speak out and talk about things. That's the problem 
with the world today, we don't talk; we just push things under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
Can music change the world? 
</P>
<P>
I think it has, it can and it will. I want my audience to leave with more than 
they came with. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best thing about being a rock goddess? 
</P>
<P>
Getting free desserts at restaurants. Also, I'm able to do what I want. 
</P>
<P>
What was your strangest gig? 
</P>
<P>
Playing at a supermarket opening in Leavenworth, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
You live in Los Angeles; how about those Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Who? 
</P>
<P>
How about those Royals? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, I do care about the Royals -- they're my hometown team.

<P>
NYC BALLET'S PETER MARTINS STRUGGLES TO MANAGE THE HOUSE THAT GEORGE BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GRESKOVIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The upcoming "new" year for New York City Ballet, which begins with its 
one-week season on Tuesday, Sept. 25, at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, marks the first year that Peter Martins is officially, single-handedly 
in charge of the company that George Balanchine left. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a few months before Balanchine died, City Ballet formally announced 
that the artistic directorship had transferred jointly to Martins and Jerome 
Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
During the ballet year that ended in July, Robbins relinquished his title as 
co-Ballet Master in Chief. His departure followed the resignation last 
September of Lincoln Kirstein, who had been general director since he founded 
City Ballet with Balanchine in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
These prominent shifts have led to the coining of "Peter's company" for 
describing City Ballet today. Speaking by phone from his Connecticut country 
house, the Danish-born ballet master said emphatically, if softly, "No, no, 
absolutely not," to the notion of specifically emphasizing his name now that 
Robbins and Kirstein have left. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Jerry and Lincoln are around, are as involved as they were prior to their 
announcements. What they say is that they are leaving to me all responsibility 
of everyday issues." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a year after his mentor's death, Martins stated the following in a 
book on Balanchine: "His last advice to me about continuing the company was, 
'Declare war. Don't accept anything you don't believe in. Begin from scratch if 
you need to. If my setup doesn't work for you, change it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Martins laughed as he was reminded of this "war" prerogative, almost as if he'd 
forgotten the advice. "I've come close, but no, I haven't done it yet." 
</P>
<P>
The ballet world's facets -- its audiences, fans, critics, dancers and 
administrators -- have all, at one time or another, become something of an 
extra complication for Martins as he acted to oversee the cultural institution 
that Balanchine built. While the Russian-born visionary was developing and 
guiding City Ballet, everyone who followed it was learning from its example. As 
Martins has put into practice what he learned on the inside -- working with 
Balanchine as both dancer and choreographer -- others, citing the lessons they 
gained from the outside, have not hesitated to voice their doubts about 
Martins' regime. 
</P>
<P>
Critics commented on ill-presented ballets and on undeveloped dancer talent. 
Dancers "commented" on their lack of fulfillment in the company by leaving it 
to seek work in lesser-known American and European ballet companies. Some part 
of the company's loyal audience drifted away, sometimes because of a lessened 
emphasis on Balanchine's work. Enthusiasts of retired artists, such as Suzanne 
Farrell, wondered why such knowledgeable sources had no significant part of the 
company's artistic staff. 
</P>
<P>
Responses of "yes and no," examples of changes that are not really changes, and 
instances of business-as-usual frequently surface in Martins' conversation. But 
the slightly defensive, noncommittal answers are intermixed with others that 
reconsider his current thinking on the company. 
</P>
<P>
As Martins responded to questions concerning such controversial issues, he 
spoke more conciliatory than fighting words. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION. What's your current enthusiasm level for your own choreography? At 
the end of your dancing career and the start of your directorship, you voiced 
real eagerness for the task. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER. It becomes a pragmatic issue more than a desire to choreograph -- you 
need a ballet, and this particular person hasn't had one for a while, so you 
know you have to do a ballet for him or her. For the most part, it's not like 
in the old days, before I had any obligations, where I would stumble upon a 
piece of music and go, "Wow, this is great." 
</P>
<P>
Q. The repertory for this seven-performance stint includes 13 ballets: eight by 
Balanchine, three by Robbins and two by you. How typical is this ratio, in 
general? 
</P>
<P>
A. Sixty percent Balanchine, 30(%) Jerry and 10(%) me, something like that. 
These basically are the proportions I try to go by. 
</P>
<P>
I always say my two biggest functions are, first, to make sure the Balanchine 
heritage is being taken care of, to the best of our ability, and second, to 
make sure that it does not become the sole purpose of the company, and that 
obviously leads to the creative aspect. If I don't make sure that the company 
can remain creative, we're going to have a big, big problem. I have dancers who 
shall remain nameless who pray (for new work). They don't care who choreographs 
it, as long as (Balanchine's now classic) "Serenade" isn't the only thing they 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about some place for Suzanne Farrell on staff since she officially 
retired from the stage last December? 
</P>
<P>
A. She and I have had a series of conversations over the summer, and she is 
going to begin here now in the fall. She's going to come in, to be . . . I hate 
the word "coach," but I guess there's nothing closer than that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about the development of dancers -- the use of repertory to make 
well-trained dancers into compelling performing artists? 
</P>
<P>
A. First, I have never seen such talent like this in my life, on both sides, 
boys and girls, men and women. My big problem right now is to feed all these 
people. Somehow Balanchine managed, either he had less talent (available) or 
was more prolific or was better to spot it and provide for them. Who the hell 
knows? You find yourself hiring talented people, and what you don't want is for 
them to get lost. You can't give everybody everything, which I have tended to 
do in the beginning, to kind of homogenize everybody, and everybody has the 
same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does this mean that Anna Kisselgoff, New York Times' chief dance critic, is 
accurate noting, amid her generally high opinion of the company: "If there is 
one major criticism to be made it is that more attention has been paid to 
keeping up this uniformly high level (of ensemble proficiency) than to singling 
out new individuals as the principals of the future." 
</P>
<P>
A. That's her opinion. I'd answer yes and no. You can't make somebody have 
"that" if they don't have it, and if they have it, you can't suppress it. I 
think it's much less a case of policy than of circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And what of critics, in general, some of whom, once the company's biggest 
admirers, are now some of its most sharp detractors? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think you want me to get started on this subject, but in general, 
yes, I do think you need criticism, critical response to what you do on stage, 
and it goes without saying, you have to take the good with the bad. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the company's strength in the area of the cavalier, the partner, 
the key counterpart to the Balanchine tenet of the supremacy of the ballerina? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's a problem -- it's always a problem. It's not just a matter of being 
able to partner, it's a matter of height. I have many good dancers that are 
small and that are very good partners, but I can't put them with (big 
ballerinas). Or, I have some dancers that are tall, that are very talented 
partners, who are not ready to be put out there in a major thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the Balanchine repertory being performed today look better, worse, or 
the same as it did under Balanchine? 
</P>
<P>
A. OK, I'll open myself up for attack. I think it looks better. Given the 
circumstances, given the dancers, and I'm not saying I prefer the dancers who 
dance his ballets today to the dancers who danced them when he was around. I'd 
say better without a doubt because there's much more attention than was given 
to them when he was around. He'd take "Symphony in C" off the shelf two days 
before and give it 1 1/2 hours and put it out there and it'd look like a 
nightmare. And, by the fifth performance it got pretty all right. He could get 
away with it. We realize we can't. We simply put more time into Balanchine 
ballets than he ever did. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So what about instances in which the company's performances have included 
the kinds of mishaps -- with partnering or pointe work -- that were not seen so 
readily in the past? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have become so bureaucratic, so enormous, so perfect in our approach, so 
holy in our approach toward George Balanchine -- and I don't mean to imply that 
we don't consider him holy -- but, the way we prepare his ballets is so 
inflexible, I find myself seeing dancers (acting) much more like (prominent 
foreign companies) or American Ballet Theatre -- if they don't have 17 
rehearsals they can't go on the . . . stage. My whole career was based on 
learning a ballet in three hours, and I learned and it made an enormous 
difference to me. I'm trying to get a little bit of that element back because 
it can make a dancer. So maybe the mishaps were my saying, on short notice, 
"Look, do you know the ballet? Fine, go out there tomorrow night." 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the future? 
</P>
<P>
A. For now, we are financially healthy. By that I mean we don't have a deficit 
but, if the New York City Ballet does not have a major endowment before this 
century is over, I think it is fair to assume that there will not be a New York 
City Ballet in the beginning of the next century.

<P>
SANTA ANA ZOO MOUNTS A SWEET SAFARI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cookies and critters are among children's favorite things, and on Saturday, 
Sept. 22, little ones can get a bellyful of both at the Santa Ana Zoo's Cookie 
Safari. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, young adventurers will be given a "passport" to visit the 13 
"cookie stations" scattered throughout the zoo grounds. At each, children can 
sample goodies from cookie giants such as Pepperidge Farms, Sunshine and 
Nabisco. After adding a stamp to their passports, they will wind past some of 
the zoo's 350 exhibited animals to the next outpost. With a full passport (and 
a fuller tummy), children will return to the zoo gift shop and receive a prize. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jacqueline Beurskens, program director of the Friends of the Santa 
Ana Zoo, the facility's support group, this fourth annual event serves as both 
a fund-raiser and a "friend-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
"The zoo is 38 years old, yet a lot of people in this area don't know we're 
here," Beurskens said. "So we came up with a family event that would be fun for 
everyone and help raise community awareness." Last year's Cookie Safari 
attracted about 3,000 visitors and raised $19,000 for the zoo's general fund, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only one-third of the zoo's 20-acre site is dedicated to animal 
exhibits, but plans are in the works for a large-scale expansion and 
improvements. One of the items on the drawing board is Monkey Island, an 
open-air display featuring colobus monkeys and tiny duiker antelope. The zoo's 
collection now features 16 species of monkeys, as well as mountain lions, 
birds, reptiles and a small children's area with barnyard animals. Larger, more 
exotic animals will be added when space and funding allows. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, organizers also plan to do away with the outdated 
enclosures which house many of the animals. "Whenever possible, we're trying to 
get our animals out of cages and into more natural settings" similar to those 
at the much-larger San Diego Zoo, Beurskens said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sept. 22 event, a handful of furry and feathered folk will be brought 
out of their cages for a little kid-to-critter contact. Zoo personnel will 
answer questions and supervise handling of the animals. Also scheduled are 
animal shows, face painting, a kiddie train and carousel and entertainment by 
clowns and jugglers. The zoo's playground will also be open throughout the day. 
Food and drink will be sold, and Rico Garcia and the Local Boys will play Latin 
jazz from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Open from 11 a.m. daily. Last call is 1:30 a.m. (714) 860-9090. A gleaming, 
upscale watering hole with lots of room to stretch out and a hassle-free 
environment. It attracts a somewhat cosmopolitan clientele, but if your idea of 
a bar is to jockey for room along with lots of vivacious, talkative people, 
well . . . have you thought of moving to Chicago? CATHY CURTIS

OFTEN MY LOVE: One of the most-performed songs in history is "Never My Love," 
made a hit in 1967 by the Association, whose members, brothers Larry and Del 
Ramos, still live in Orange County. . . . According to music giant BMI, the 
song's been performed 5 million times. "We did 192 dates last year, and we have 
to do that tune," says Del. "That's what they come to hear from us." Zan Dubin

CHEERS: Amy Apodaca didn't wait for legal action when she was suspended Friday 
from the Dana Hills High School pep squad because of a haircut school officials 
considered extreme. 
</P>
<P>
The popular high school senior started a petition right away, and by midweek 
she had about 200 signatures. Apodaca said she didn't have time or reason to 
give it to administrators, since she was reinstated Wednesday (B3). "Right 
now," she says, "our main concern is football and basketball." Zan Dubin and

MAX JACOBSON: REASON TO SHOUT 'YASSOU!';

BELLY UP TO A GOOD TIME AT HUNTINGTON BEACH'S ATHENIAN

THE ATHENIAN 
</P>
<P>
5874 Edinger Avenue, Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
(714) 840-6518. 
</P>
<P>
Open for lunch Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. through 3 p.m.; dinner Sunday 
through Thursday from 5 to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday 5 to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All major cards accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The purist in me balks at the idea of belly dancing at a Greek restaurant. The 
party lover in me says "Yassou!" and reaches for a shot of ouzo. 
</P>
<P>
Belly dancing, after all, is Middle Eastern, and Greece, despite centuries 
under the Ottoman yoke, is a Balkan country with its roots firmly in Europe. 
Besides, in Greece men are the ones who dance in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the purist in me is just going to have to put a sock in it. The 
Athenian, a smashing new Greek restaurant in Huntington Beach, brings out 
everybody's party side. It's nothing more than a slightly boxy, almost 
claustrophobic restaurant located in the corner of a shopping mall, but there 
is so much atmosphere you get caught up in the place almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Everything seems to be either blue or white -- colors of the Greek flag -- all 
the way down to some blue and white sailing banners that give the restaurant 
the look of a basement rec room gone island-happy. The banners take up a lot of 
space, too . . . there's barely room for the belly dancers to gyrate. 
</P>
<P>
After the belly dancing finishes, the Greek dancing starts. That's when chef 
and co-owner Aristedes Deslis leads a troupe of his guests around the room, 
Pied Piper-style. (At least on Saturday nights, sit in one of the heavily 
padded booths and avoid the long tables in the middle of the dining room if you 
don't want to caught up in the dancing.) 
</P>
<P>
Deslis parades around his dining room in a frenzy, pulling surprised 
suburbanites, men and women, up by the hand to join the syrto, or circle dance. 
Just seeing this shellshocked group holding hands and coming to life while 
traipsing around the dining room is enough to make even the most curmudgeonly 
dining guest snap his fingers. It's the purest form of enthusiasm you will find 
in a restaurant, and an infectious part of the Greek spirit. Most of all, it's 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
Deslis cooks with spirit, too. He is one of Southern California's best Greek 
chefs, and if you don't believe me, just ask him. (He'll probably tell you even 
if you don't ask him.) Until recently he was cooking at Greek Cuisine, a very 
good Greek restaurant in Tustin. Now he has teamed up with Angelo Hioureas, a 
fellow native of Kalamata (where Greek olives come from) and opened this 
restaurant. It's a sorely needed addition to Huntington Beach's somewhat 
attenuated dining scene. 
</P>
<P>
Greek food is filling, so you may want to do a bit of dancing yourself before 
the evening is through. Start with one of Deslis' heavier appetizers, perhaps 
the melitzanes, a thick eggplant dip not unlike the dish called imam bayildi 
found in the better Middle Eastern restaurants. It's slightly sweet with the 
smallest hint of garlic, and it makes a perfect marriage with the incredibly 
soft home-baked pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
I can't say enough about the restaurant's fluffy, flavorful bread. It's as 
fresh as can be, and deceptively easy to fill up on. Enjoy this bread to the 
fullest with taramosalata, a wonderfully creamy dip made from carp roe, or 
skordalia, sort of a garlic puree with mashed potatoes. You may not want to 
dance real close after eating one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners here come with soup or salad, and that is a tough choice. Deslis' egg 
lemon soup (avgolemono) is the thick, peasanty sort that a Greek grandmother 
would be proud to serve. It's generous with egg yoke and the essence of fresh 
lemon, and further enriched by shreds of chicken breast and fine-grained rice. 
</P>
<P>
Deslis' version of horiatiki, the well-traveled Greek salad, is one of the best 
I've tasted anywhere. The onions are minced, then mixed with a good olive oil 
and crumbled Greek feta and used as a dressing. The lettuce is cool and crisp, 
the tomatoes ripe and the authentic Kalamata olives juicy. I couldn't resist 
beginning with both soup and salad. 
</P>
<P>
All of the traditional favorites are found on the long list of entrees, and a 
few surprises. Moussaka, the eggplant casserole made with ground meat and 
topped with a baked bechamel sauce, is served in a dense square and is aromatic 
with clove and cinnamon. The same goes for the macaroni casserole called 
pastitsio, which uses the same meat mixture and the same bechamel topping. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken skordalia is one of the chef's signature dishes. It's half a chicken 
marinated in lemon and oregano, smothered in a heap of chopped parsley and then 
baked. Just before serving, it's doused with a heady garlic sauce. Perhaps the 
biggest seller here is arnaki kleftiko, a specialty of the chef's home turf in 
central Greece. It's sliced tenderloin of lamb with dill, garlic and scallions, 
wrapped in filo dough and then baked. I actually prefer the lighter arnaki 
psito, which is simply roasted spring lamb, served in thick slices. Whatever 
you choose you can't go wrong here. 
</P>
<P>
There are three desserts. The baklava is a rich, syrupy one. Galaktobureko is 
like eating your Cream of Wheat in a pastry wrapper with honey poured all over 
it. Finally there is rizogalo, a finely textured rice pudding with plenty of 
cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
Now all you need is some muddy Greek coffee, a shot of ouzo and a healthy pair 
of pipes with which to shout "Yassou!" Or a good pair of dancing shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The Athenian is moderately priced. Appetizers are $2.95 to 7.95. Entrees are 
$7.95 to $14.95. Desserts are $1.50. There is a limited selection of wines on a 
Greek-dominated list. Try Robola, from the island of Cephalonia, a dry white 
priced at $16.95.

DUTY'S CALL STRAINS FAMILY TIES;

THOUSANDS OF PARENTS OF CHILDREN -- MANY SINGLE -- ARE AMONG SERVICEMEN AND 
WOMEN ORDERED TO SAUDI ARABIA. A GENERATION AGO, SUCH HOUSEHOLD UPHEAVALS WERE 
VIRTUALLY UNDREAMED OF.

<P>
After 11 years in the military, Staff Sgt. Brenda Brown thought she would never 
get the call. Then, with little advance warning, she found herself sending her 
3-year-old son to her sister in North Carolina and struggling to explain why. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told him that me and his father have to go away for a while and it was 
part of our jobs," Brown said as she and her husband, also a sergeant, prepared 
to leave for Saudi Arabia from Ft. Stewart's Hunter Army Airfield. "I didn't 
want him to feel we were sending him away for no reason. It's hard to explain 
to a 3-year-old when you're packing his bags." 
</P>
<P>
It is harder yet to explain the deeper fear that she will never see her son 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared," Brown admits. "I'm afraid of dying." 
</P>
<P>
This kind of sudden confrontation with reality is hitting thousands of military 
personnel and reservists this month -- not just in households like the Browns', 
where both husband and wife are in the military, but in others where soldiers 
double as single mothers or fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Although American women have been involved in military conflicts since the 
Revolutionary War, the U.S. response to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
invasion of Kuwait is taking a toll on families in ways that were virtually 
unknown only a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
For some, such as those who have infants or have been recently divorced, the 
timing has presented special hardships. Others, like the Browns, must worry 
about the survival of both spouses and the welfare of the children they left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the sorrow of separation has simply proved more traumatic than they 
ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case of Tina Mercer, 20, a single parent and an Army logistics 
specialist stationed at Ft. Bragg, N.C., who gave birth to a baby girl July 10, 
according to her aunt, Vicky Littleton of Garden Grove. Mercer was still on her 
six-week maternity leave when her unit was called to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"She had to turn to her mother to care for her new baby," Littleton said. But 
that wasn't simple. Her mother, Michelle Mercer, 41, is an active-duty Air 
Force sergeant stationed at Rhien-Main Air Base near Frankfurt, West Germany. 
"My sister (Tina Mercer's mother) flew from Germany to the States to pick up 
the child to take it with her back to Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Tina Mercer was deployed to Saudia Arabia to join her unit. Her 
aircraft stopped for two hours to refuel in West Germany. "Michelle knew she 
was going to be there so she had the baby there. They got to visit for two 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
"Now," Littleton said, "If my sister gets called to the Middle East than I 
would be next in line for the baby. Sure I would take it. Sure there would be 
some sleepless nights, but I am the only one left." 
</P>
<P>
Tina Mercer has been told to be prepared to be away for as long as a year, 
according to her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"She cried a lot at first. She was afraid the baby would not know who she was 
and thoughts of not spending Christmas with the baby made her sad," Littleton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The growing number of women in the work force -- and the emergence of more 
single-parent families in the United States -- over the past two decades has 
had a sizable impact on the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
Women now make up 224,272, or 11%, of America's 2 million active-duty troops -- 
a four-fold increase since 1973 -- as pilots, mechanics, intelligence 
specialists, communication experts, supply supervisors and truck drivers. There 
also are 55,103 single parents in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Although by law women currently are excluded from direct combat, experts say 
such distinctions would make little difference during actual combat, where 
staging areas are just as vulnerable to attack as the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some would argue that none of this should have come as a surprise. 
Each parent in uniform is a volunteer and knew when enlisting or joining the 
reserves that he or she might well be sent overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some, such as Judith Boehm, a clerk-typist for the city of Ontario, 
Calif., whose naval reserve unit was called up last month, even welcome the 
chance to test their skills. "It will be a challenge," she said shortly before 
departing. "It will intensify my training." 
</P>
<P>
And the armed services have amassed an impressive array of support services for 
spouses and offspring who remain behind -- including legal and financial aid, 
housing assistance, counseling and parenting classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Family Care Plan' 
</P>
<P>
Military authorities also have for some time required that active duty 
personnel as well as reservists file a "family care plan" with their unit, 
transferring responsibility for their children to a relative or friend if they 
are deployed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Milt Wofford, chief of the family support division at Ft. Bragg in North 
Carolina, acknowledges that there always are a few cases where the best-laid 
plans seem to go awry. 
</P>
<P>
In one such case, Staff Sgt. Faagalo Savaiki, who was called up on Aug. 29 with 
his Ft. Campbell, Ky., unit, has been charged with leaving his three children 
without food. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, ages 13, 12, and 9, were found dirty and hungry with a note on the 
wall telling them how to use Savaiki's automatic teller card to withdraw money 
from a bank. 
</P>
<P>
Savaiki, whose wife returned to Hawaii after their recent divorce, has pleaded 
not guilty to three child-abuse charges in Clarksville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at various military Family Assistance Centers, which provide 
around-the-clock help for soldiers and their families, said last week that they 
had encountered no problems as serious as the Ft. Campbell case. 
</P>
<P>
But here at Ft. Stewart -- amid patriotic trappings such as banners proclaiming 
"God Bless Our Troops" and T-shirts emblazoned with "Somebody 's Me in Saudi" 
-- they have been swamped with inquiries and requests for help. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors at Ft. Stewart's main base in Hinesville, Ga., southwest of 
Savannah, handle about 500 calls and 150 to 200 walk-ins each day, says Jane 
MacDonald, an Army community service chief. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Complications 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of contacts involve such routine matters as obtaining a 
copy of a military pay stub, or helping a soldier's spouse get out of a lease, 
some complications have been more serious. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of wives decided their husbands were going to Saudi Arabia, and they 
didn't want to take care of the kids, so they just ran off," says Maj. William 
Broome, Ft. Stewart's family life chaplain. "They were either immature or they 
had bad marriages to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Search for Child Care 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the men's departure was postponed indefinitely or delayed until 
they could find child care. "The Army does a lot better with child care than a 
lot of civilian employers," Broome asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Grant De Pauw, a history professor at George Washington University and 
founder of the Minerva Center in Arlington, Va., which studies the role of 
women in the military, agrees that in some respects, the armed forces appear to 
be ahead of the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason a lot of single parents are in the military is because the military 
is an equal opportunity employer," De Pauw says. "You do a good job, you're 
secure, you get health care, you get promoted. If there is sexual harassment, 
there is at least a chain of command to report it. Many women trying to do the 
best they can for their children will have joined." 
</P>
<P>
The tens of thousands of husbands left behind with kids have found themselves 
with a newly defined mission as well. They also serve who stand and bake -- or 
clean and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"For every one, there's not enough hours in the day," says Jeannette Ruffing, 
director of the Family Support Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, 
which operates programs for spouses and children of those deployed in addition 
to its ongoing single-parent support groups. 
</P>
<P>
Reade Hamilton, a Fayetteville, N.C., policeman whose wife left Ft. Bragg with 
her military intelligence company on Aug. 26, knows all about making every 
minute count. Hamilton, 49, makes breakfast for his 6-year-old son before 
racing off to work at 6:40 a.m. each day. 
</P>
<P>
He gets back at 3:30 p.m. to check Benjamin's homework, join him on a bicycle 
ride, cook dinner and put him to bed before collapsing himself. On weekends, he 
shops, does laundry and cleans house. "I listen to him more now," Hamilton 
says. "There's no 'Go see your mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fellow policemen have dubbed him Mr. Mom. "I'm doing it all," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother's Touch 
</P>
<P>
But even for families that have found ways to cope with the contemporary 
role-reversal, there are inevitably those times when a mother's touch is sorely 
missed.

William Lensing's wife, Susan, a nurse and lieutenant commander at Bethesda 
Naval Hospital in Maryland, left Aug. 13 on the 1,000-bed hospital ship 
Comfort. Lensing, 49, also a registered nurse, says he and his daughter, 20, 
and son, 16, are holding up well. 
</P>
<P>
But when Brad Lensing's high school football team was routed in his first game 
as starting quarterback, he returned to their Chevy Chase, Md., home, retired 
to the den and re-read his mother's five letters. "I could tell he really 
wanted her there," Lensing says.

Wofford, Ft. Bragg's family support chief, says he is already anticipating a 
traumatic Christmas for children whose parents may still be gone. For some of 
those parents, it will mark the second such experience in a row. Many were in 
Panama last Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beginning to look at that," Wofford says. "I'm sure that as time goes on 
-- if they stay an extended period of time -- there will be different problems 
arising."

TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES MUST CONSOLIDATE UNDER NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's transportation agencies -- including the Transit District and 
the Transportation Commission -- will be replaced by a single agency next year 
under provisions of a new law signed by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, authored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), mandates 
that six members of the new 11-member board be selected by the cities; four 
members would be selected by the Board of Supervisors, and one member would be 
selected by the 10 other board members. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission, the Orange County Transit 
District, the Consolidated Transportation Services Agency and the Services 
Authority for Freeway Emergencies have been given until December, 1991, to 
develop a plan to consolidate their functions into a single transportation 
agency, according to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan is not adopted, the cities and the county will face the loss of 
state gas tax subventions in 1992-93 fiscal year.

MARINE BASE ADVISES AGAINST DISPLAYING YELLOW RIBBONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The patriotic gesture of displaying a yellow ribbon to show support for U.S. 
troops in the Middle East is being discouraged by Camp Pendleton, where 
officials are concerned the ribbons could invite crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them on car antennas and on porches. Either way, you're marking 
yourself 'follow me home,' " base spokeswoman Capt. Rose-Ann Sgrignoli said 
Wednesday. "It's not a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Base officials worry that the ribbons might call attention to dependents left 
alone while their Marine spouses are deployed. At least one crime reported in 
North County might be linked to showing a yellow ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad police are investigating the Aug. 31 sexual assault of a 19-year-old 
woman who was attacked at gunpoint as she walked from the Plaza Camino Real 
shopping center at dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ray Trujillo said the suspect "made reference to the yellow ribbon on 
her vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
But, he cautioned, "there's nothing to indicate the suspect picked her out 
because of that." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County communities surrounding the Marine Corps bases at El Toro and 
Tustin, police said there have been no reports of crimes committed against 
those with yellow ribbons festooning homes or cars. A spokeswoman for the air 
stations in El Toro and Tustin, sounding surprised by the Pendleton action, 
said no warning has been issued by the Orange County bases. Nor, she said, have 
there been reports of break-ins or crimes at locations decorated by yellow 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Boeka, who has tied a ribbon on the doorstep of her San Clemente home to 
honor her 27-year-old son in the Persian Gulf, said Wednesday that removing the 
bows might be smart for some people, like women living alone. But not for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, I don't need to take mine down unless my husband left," Boeka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ribbons began appearing on sprawling Camp Pendleton and the neighboring 
community of Oceanside after a large contingent of Marines was hurriedly 
deployed to the Middle East in early August. The exact number of departed 
Marines has not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Karina Kingman, director of family programs, said she is aware that the yellow 
ribbons might identify a Marine dependent living alone, but she noted "we're 
still giving them out. They're for everybody. I have one and my husband's not 
(a serviceman). It's just to show support."

MALATHION IS CAUSING FEW HEALTH PROBLEMS, COUNTY SURVEYS FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although concern about malathion spraying is high in Orange County, few people 
report suffering health problems because of the pesticide falling around them, 
according to a survey released Wednesday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 4% say their health has suffered, and 51% want the spraying to stop, 
according to the most recent Orange County Health Surveys. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the health effects, you don't have a high level," said Dr. 
Hoda Anton-Culver, professor of epidemiology and one of the principal 
researchers of the survey. "But more than 50% are anxious and concerned, and 
because of this, we need to take a look at that." 
</P>
<P>
In another area of questioning, researchers found that young single people who 
do not own property are the least prepared for an earthquake and that 
preparedness-education efforts directed toward them are wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"If the chancellor were to ask me, 'What can I do to get the students 
prepared?' I would say, 'Don't bother,' " said David Dooley, UCI professor of 
social ecology and a survey researcher. "I'd say: 'Do it yourself. Put food and 
water in the basement. . . . (The students) simply aren't going to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Health Surveys were created in 1988 and are conducted each 
spring and fall to monitor public medical needs. They are sponsored by the 
Irvine Health Foundation and UCI. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent survey involved about 800 randomly selected residents. Its 
focus was on malathion spraying, earthquake preparedness and the Pap smear, a 
test that can help detect cervical cancer. General questions about health, 
diseases and behaviors such as drinking and smoking are asked in each survey in 
order to track trends. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to combat a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation, state-ordered 
malathion spraying began over Brea last November and over the Garden Grove area 
in January. The health survey was conducted in April, and researchers found 
that awareness of the spraying at that time throughout the county was high -- 
98%. Although 196 of the survey participants said their residences were 
sprayed, researchers found that, according to state records, only 104 actually 
lived within the ZIP code areas of the spray zones. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned about whether people knew they were being sprayed," 
Anton-Culver said. With the exception of survey participants living within one 
ZIP code area, "there was high awareness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12 of the 130 respondents -- or 9.2% -- who lived within the spray zones 
complained of health ailments, with most mentioning respiratory or skin 
problems. Another 19 living in areas either next to or some distance from where 
the malathion was applied also said they suffered health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures are not alarmingly high, Anton-Culver said. In fact, when those 
incidences are compared to the incidence of all medical conditions for the 
county at large, "overall, there is no difference," she said. Anton-Culver 
noted that too little time has passed to explore the question of whether 
long-term health problems are associated with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the high level of anxiety produced by the malathion sprayings warrants a 
look at the "psychological effects" of them, Anton-Culver said. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about earthquake concerns have been asked in the health surveys for 
the past two years. Social ecologist Dooley said that the concern level always 
jumps after a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
That anxiety, however, "degrades in a matter of weeks, maybe months," 
especially if the temblor occurred elsewhere, Dooley said. "But I have a 
suspicion that in Santa Cruz, where you walk by crumbled buildings, it might 
last longer," he said, alluding to the damage inflicted by the magnitude 7.1 
quake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Concern does not automatically translate into preparedness, though, Dooley 
said. Nearly 40% of the respondents -- asked whether they are storing water and 
other supplies, putting aside flashlights and wrenches and securing shelves or 
water heaters -- said they had taken no steps to ready themselves for the Big 
One. 
</P>
<P>
Those most likely to be prepared for an earthquake are older, married, have 
families or own their homes, Dooley said. "If you have connections, you want to 
make a survivable nest." 
</P>
<P>
People who have no ties to family or property are least prepared to weather a 
major quake. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain people will simply not prepare themselves," he said. Students, young 
people, single people and apartment dwellers "find other life concerns more 
pressing. . . . It's not good, bad or evil. It's the way people are." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, any efforts to persuade that segment of society probably 
are wasted. He suggested that apartment owners -- who must meet requirements 
for fire safety -- should perhaps be required to stockpile food and water since 
it appears that the tenants are not going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
O.C. Health Surveys

UCI recently surveyed about 800 randomly selected residents on malathion 
spraying, earthquake preparedness and Pap smears, among other public health 
issues. Results of the malathion portion of the survey are shown below.

2 SUSPECTS HELD IN AUTO THEFT CASE

Two San Francisco Bay Area residents suspected of stealing a car, a wallet full 
of credit cards and at least one blank check taken from a Laguna Hills business 
have been arrested, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Dawn Masincup, 23, of San Mateo, and Yarub Marwan Taher, 27, of San 
Francisco, were being held on $10,000 bail each at Orange County Jail, 
Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were scheduled to appear today for arraignment on auto theft and 
possession of stolen property charges at Harbor Municipal Court, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Angel Johnson said that two CHP officers riding north along the San 
Diego Freeway about 11 p.m. Tuesday saw a car idling on the freeway emergency 
lane south of the Culver Drive off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought it was a disabled vehicle," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the patrol car pulled up, the driver sped off, she said. A short chase 
ensued and then the car, reported stolen Sept. 15 from a Dollar Rent-a-Car lot 
in San Francisco, turned off at Culver Drive and stopped, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested without incident, Johnson said. A search of the car after 
the arrests also turned up four credit cards believed stolen and two blank 
checks, one of which has been confirmed stolen, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were looking into whether a blank check from a Los Angeles 
business was stolen. In addition, a video recorder, believed bought with one of 
the credit cards, was discovered in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the pair appeared to have been heading north to San Francisco when 
they were stopped. JAMES M. GOMEZ

POLICE, FBI SEEKING 'TINA TURNER BANDIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man dubbed the "Tina Turner bandit" is being sought by police and the FBI in 
connection with a string of recent bank robberies in Orange and San Diego 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was armed with a handgun in each of the robberies, was nicknamed 
after the popular singer because of a wig he donned during some of the crimes, 
said John Meiter, an investigator with the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is described by police as a white male, 25 to 35 years old, about 6 
feet tall and of medium build. In one photograph supplied by the FBI, the 
suspect is pictured striding through a bank wearing a wig that resembles 
Turner's hair, though he uses other disguises as well, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The first robbery occurred on July 3 at Security Pacific Bank, 2880 N. Main St. 
in Santa Ana. The man walked into the bank wearing what police described as "an 
Abraham Lincoln beard" and sunglasses. Once inside he handed a teller a note 
with instructions to place money into a blue nylon bag, Meiter said. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later the same man, police believe, robbed the Security Pacific Bank 
at 16811 Algonquin St. in Huntington Beach. This time, the suspect fired a shot 
into the front window of the bank before handing the teller a note demanding 
money. During that robbery, the suspect wore a closely cropped beard and floppy 
hat and instructed the teller to put the money in what appeared to be the same 
bag used in the earlier robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The Tina Turner wig made its first appearance on July 17 at a Security Pacific 
Bank in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"In this robbery, he changed his method drastically," Meiter said. "He took off 
the beard, put on a fake mustache and put on the wig." 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth robbery, the suspect returned to Orange County, police said, 
holding up the Union Bank at 31971 Camino Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano. 
The robber again appeared in Tina Turner garb, and after walking into the bank 
immediately fired two shots into the ceiling before demanding money. 
</P>
<P>
Although police are seeking the public's help in locating the suspect, Meiter 
said people should not attempt to capture him. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want citizens chasing after this guy," Meiter said. "He has already 
fired shots so there's a propensity towards violence." 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the robberies and police declined to say how much money was 
taken from the banks. Anyone with information about the robberies can contact 
the FBI at (714) 542-8825 or (800) 442-2244.GREG HERNANDEZ

COUNCIL APPROVES 727-ACRE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite protests from more than 200 residents, the City Council on Tuesday 
approved plans for a controversial 727-acre development that will be built on 
the city's last undeveloped ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-0 vote, the council approved a plan for Serrano Heights, a development 
project that has been in the planning stages for six years and will feature as 
many as 1,800 town houses, apartments and single-family residences. Mayor Don 
E. Smith abstained from voting, citing a possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of votes, the council approved a zoning change for the project, 
certified a report detailing the project's expected environmental impact and 
approved development plans. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano Heights will be built by Irvine-based Woodcrest Development Inc. in the 
east section of the city. The development includes extending Serrano Avenue, 
which will link Anaheim Hills to Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the residents wore orange ribbons to the council meeting as a symbol of 
their opposition, and they voiced concerns about traffic, noise and possible 
environmental fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"Building on ridgelines should go the way of dinosaurs, it should be extinct," 
said Joe Pelka, a representative of the Maybury Ranch Homeowner Assn. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Pelka said he and other residents were disappointed with the 
council's action. 
</P>
<P>
"A majority of the people are opposed to the project," Pelka said. "We intend 
to continue to pursue the matter throughout the approval process. I don't feel 
the council took into consideration the views of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Resident Larry Larson also spoke out against the plan, calling it "outdated." 
</P>
<P>
"It does not respect the existing environment," Larson said. "We are talking 
about the last major undeveloped ridgeline in Orange County. Once a mountain or 
hillside is blasted, it will never return to us." 
</P>
<P>
But Woodcrest consultant Frank Elfend defended the project and said much of the 
community opposition is based on "misinformation." He said only one-third of 
the ridgeline will be affected. GREG HERNANDEZ

MURDER CHARGES AGAINST BOY REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge on Wednesday eliminated charges of first-degree murder against a 
14-year-old Anaheim boy accused of fatally shooting his 12-year-old sister, but 
he refused to reduce the charges from second-degree murder to involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Richard Hubler, who claims he shot his sister, Gema Marie Hubler, 
by accident at their Anaheim Shores home on June 14, will probably be released 
from the California Youth Authority between the ages of 19 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
A conviction of involuntary manslaughter would have meant no more than two to 
three years' confinement, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
A first-degree murder conviction could have meant that Hubler would have 
remained in custody until he was 25. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert E. Thomas, hearing the trial in Santa Ana without a 
jury, is expected to decide Hubler's fate at the conclusion of closing 
arguments today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Sharon Petrosino claims that the shooting was an 
accident, but at worst no more than involuntary manslaughter. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Brent F. Romney counters that Hubler intentionally shot his sister during 
an argument over use of the telephone. And even if he didn't, Romney told the 
court, he knew that the weapon might still be loaded; he had told police that 
while he was playing with the gun after unloading it, he was surprised when one 
bullet ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Hubler threw away the gun, bullets and an empty shell 
casing before calling 911 to try to get help for his sister. JERRY HICKS

CHEERLEADER BACK, WITH HAIRCUT INTACT

<P>
Five days and countless media interviews after she was benched from the Dana 
Hills High School pep squad because of a haircut her coach thought was 
inappropriate, Amy Apodaca was reinstated Wednesday when school district 
officials realized they didn't have a legal leg to stand on. 
</P>
<P>
With her curly brown locks hanging loose, Apodaca's hair looks like almost any 
other young woman's. But when she puts it in a ponytail, the way cheerleaders 
just have to wear it, the inch-wide band of closely cropped hair above her ears 
and across the back of her neck clearly shows. 
</P>
<P>
Team adviser Margie Paige decided Friday that the look fell under "extreme 
haircuts" prohibited by team rules and benched the 17-year-old before last 
Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after news reports and student opposition, school officials 
decided to reinstate Apodaca since they could find no legal precedent to keep 
her from performing, said William Eller, assistant superintendent for the 
Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"From a legal perspective, we looked at the issue of First Amendment rights and 
considered, first, does her look detract from her competition, and second, does 
it create any danger to herself or to her team or her fellow students. Her 
appearance does not at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Apodaca, who had become somewhat of a celebrity on campus Wednesday when 
several television and newspaper reporters interviewed her, said she was upset 
when she was benched and didn't understand why her coach had authority to 
decide which haircuts were "extreme" and which were acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Students I ask think it is cool," she said. "I choose to wear my hair this 
way. I shouldn't be punished for that." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news Friday, she still showed up at the football game in her 
uniform -- only to sit in the stands with friends instead of on the field with 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat there and still cheered my team," she said. "That's my job. But it was 
really embarrassing to have to sit in the stands and everyone was asking me, 
'Why aren't you cheering?' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite one missed performance, Apodaca was back at practice Wednesday, a bit 
surprised at all the media attention she has received. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little shocking," she told reporters while smiling to friends who 
gathered to watch the interviews. "I thought people would think, 'Oh, big deal 
that some cheerleader cut her hair.' But I'm glad that people are interviewing 
me. Usually you see stuff on the news that's important to adults but this is 
important to us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of her friends and classmates agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was kind of sad that she got in trouble for her hair," 
said friend Tara Dixon, 17, from Laguna Niguel.LUCY CHABOT

CHARGES SOUGHT AGAINST DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California State Police said Wednesday that they will seek a vandalism charge 
against a builder who allegedly hired a tree cutter to fell a 75-year-old 
Bishop pine so he could have an unobstructed view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Dennis Michael Hall, the owner of Mission Tree Service in San 
Clemente, was arraigned in South County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel on a 
misdemeanor vandalism charge. Hall, 35, is being held at the Theo Lacy Jail in 
Orange, where he is serving a four-month sentence for possession of narcotics, 
violation of probation and indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Aaron Tassin of the California State Police declined to identify the 
builder but said Hall's arraignment "in no way signaled" the end of the state's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Hall) had no other motivation to cut down the tree other than to get 
paid," Tassin said. "This is a high-dollar crime that eventually comes out of 
the pockets of taxpayers . . . and we want the payer (of the cutter) to be 
financially liable." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Department of Transportation said the 45-foot 
conifer, which was a landmark on the Camino de Estrella on-ramp of north 
Interstate 5, was leveled on May 12, two days after Caltrans maintenance 
supervisor Alan Kato intervened to prevent Hall and his crew from chopping it 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Wednesday that they were saddened by the felling of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids played on it, it was a noise barrier, and it provided us with lots of 
privacy," said Estelle Peters, whose house was partially shaded by the pine's 
boughs. "When I came home and saw it gone, I felt as if I had lost a close 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Kato said the tree's size and age made it "irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Hall could receive a year in jail and be ordered to pay 
restitution for his alleged involvement.

NIXON'S LAW OFFICE GETS A FINAL APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Nixon Law Office Preservation Inc. appealed to City Council 
members Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to save the former President's first 
place of business from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spent about 20 years of my life trying to keep that building there," 
said Lois Lundberg, a lifelong resident of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something you can reconsider in a couple of years after it's torn 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Although it did not take final action, the council agreed to study the matter 
and take it up again next month. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal Tuesday came as the city was preparing to proceed with demolition 
plans for a collection of buildings known as Old Settler's Plaza, where Nixon's 
former law office is located. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Cramer, recognized as La Habra's city historian, asked the council to 
work with the preservation group to develop a plan to save the office and the 
historic Wester Hotel in the same block. Cramer offered to volunteer her time 
in coordinating the project. 
</P>
<P>
But plans to renovate and restore the pre-1933 structures hit a snag this year 
when cost estimates skyrocketed. Considerable damage was done by the 1987 
Whittier earthquake, and they were rocked again this year in the Upland quake. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of strengthening the brick buildings is prohibitive, according to City 
Manager Lee Risner, who added that retaining one or two of the structures would 
drastically limit the usefulness of the surrounding property. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have discussed the possibility of moving the structure to 
another location. But Risner expressed skepticism, saying that unreinforced 
brick buildings cannot be easily moved. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the complaints, council members agreed to look into possible 
methods of saving the building. Councilman William D. Mahoney has scheduled a 
meeting with Cramer and others next month.DAVID F. BURKE

CYPRESS MAN KILLED IN FALL FROM CATALINA ISLAND CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Cypress man died after he fell 70 feet while attempting to scale 
a sheer rock cliff overlooking the surf just south of Avalon Harbor on Santa 
Catalina Island, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gregoire, who was hiking with a companion, was pronounced dead at County 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance about 10 p.m. Tuesday, three hours after 
rescuers finally reached him below a vertical rock wall in treacherous surf 
conditions, Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It began as a casual hike. . . . That's how these things start off," said Lt. 
John McKay, a Los Angeles County lifeguard spokesman. "But it was old, brittle 
rock, and they carried no rock-climbing equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said they knew Gregoire's condition was deteriorating rapidly as they 
struggled to reach him. But they were forced to climb slowly and could carry 
only limited rescue equipment as they edged down the cliff to the spot where 
Gregoire was sprawled on a ledge, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
"The water was surging and the tide was coming in," McKay said. "Our men were 
almost getting swept off the rocks themselves. It was one of those situations 
where we had to minimize the number of people on a rescue to minimize injury to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
One rescuer suffered cuts from falling rocks, and another nearly fell into the 
water when a stretcher basket being lowered by a Coast Guard helicopter struck 
him on the head. Both injuries were minor, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
After two rescuers climbed down to Gregoire, other rescuers had to dive in the 
water from a patrol boat and ferry life-saving equipment to the base of the 
cliff, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a helicopter was called in, it was unable to maneuver close enough to 
pull him up because of the rocky cliff and testy wind drafts. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, rescuers lowered an inflatable life raft, loaded Gregoire in and 
pushed the raft out into the surf, where it was tied to a patrol boat. As the 
helicopter circled for a second attempt to lift Gregoire, McKay said, its 
rotors churned up too much water, making a lift impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have saved some time with a direct lift into the helicopter, but we 
just couldn't," McKay said. "We took the patient by boat about two miles to 
Catalina Harbor and he flew from there to a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that Gregoire had taken a ferry from the mainland and arrived 
about 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday to met his friend, Shane Anderson, 20, of Cypress, 
who had been working on the island. 
</P>
<P>
The two friends, one garbed in jeans and the other in shorts, decided to hike 
up to a 500-foot summit. They carried no rock-climbing equipment, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 feet up the face of a rocky cliff, both climbers could no longer find 
any convenient holds for their hands or shoes. Unable to climb in any 
direction, the two were trapped, Anderson told rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
Gregoire then apparently slipped and fell. Anderson, who was several feet below 
Gregoire, said he never saw his friend fall.

TITANS: SENIOR CORNERBACK CLEANS UP HIS ACT AFTER TRANSFER TO A HIGH SCHOOL OUT 
OF HIS ATTENDANCE AREA.

<P>
Nuygen Pendleton's rise from a scrawny high school football player who didn't 
receive one recruiting letter or phone call to a Division I scholarship player 
who starts for Cal State Fullerton is improbable enough. 
</P>
<P>
But what is even more surprising is that Pendleton made it past high school on 
the educational track. Those who knew him in junior high certainly wouldn't 
have given Pendleton good odds. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton had juvenile delinquent written all over him. He was a pint-sized 
hellion who might have set an unofficial record for suspensions at Stephens 
Junior High in Long Beach -- about 20 in three years, Pendleton estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always in trouble," said Pendleton, a 5-foot-8, 160-pound senior 
cornerback at Fullerton. "I was hanging around gangsters, getting in fights 
every week, skipping school, smoking weed, stealing from people, sneaking out 
of the house late at night. I was trying to be a tough guy." 
</P>
<P>
Then his mother, Margaret Keaton, decided to toughen up. She requested and 
received an inter-district transfer so Pendleton could to go to a high school 
outside of his attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of attending Long Beach Poly, Pendleton was bused to Millikan High. The 
change of scenery and some stern motherly lectures, proved to be the right 
tonic. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton was suspended once in his freshman year, but from then on was a model 
citizen at Millikan. He played football and ran track and graduated with a 2.6 
grade-point average. He says he hasn't touched marijuana since junior high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to compete for the Long Beach City College football and track teams 
before doing the same at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
And for this, he thanks his mom. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure glad she changed me around, because I'd probably be in jail right 
now," Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Keaton admits she was worried about Pendleton during those tumultuous times. 
</P>
<P>
"But when he reached the 10th grade and got into football, he started to care 
more about his schoolwork," Keaton said. "I figured if I could break him up 
with his friends and get him in a new environment, it would change him, and it 
did. I'm very proud of the way he turned out." 
</P>
<P>
Still, few would have thought Pendleton would turn up in a college secondary. 
At Millikan, he was a 135-pound wide receiver and defensive back who didn't 
earn all-league honors. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1985, Pendleton didn't pursue college athletics. He 
attended El Camino College instead before deciding to enroll at Long Beach City 
and run track during the 1986-87 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton finished fourth in the long jump at the 1987 state community college 
meet, helping Long Beach win the title. He also caught the eye of Viking 
football Coach Wil Shaw, who talked Pendleton into trying out for the football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton was a reserve on the 1987 team but started in 1988, earning 
second-team, all-Mission Conference honors at cornerback and first-team punt 
return honors. 
</P>
<P>
He was a part-time starter for Fullerton in 1989 but appeared in all 11 games, 
making 27 tackles, intercepting one pass and returning 23 punts for 156 yards. 
He also placed third in the long jump (23 feet 5 1/2 inches) at last spring's 
Big West Conference track meet. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton earned a starting job this season but has found himself amid another 
world of trouble. Not the kind he had in junior high school, but trouble just 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary was supposed to be one of Fullerton's strengths this season, but 
in three games it has been a sore spot. 
</P>
<P>
Depleted by injuries and academic ineligibilities and forced to use several 
inexperienced defensive backs, the Titans have allowed 842 yards passing and 
eight touchdowns in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton isn't shouldering much of the blame. He sprained his ankle early in 
the second half against Auburn, sat out last week's game against Mississippi 
State and is expected to return for Saturday's game at Akron. 
</P>
<P>
But he's still feeling the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all sort of down, because we were supposed to be a strong point and now 
it looks like we're the weakest point of the team," Pendleton said. "We know 
everyone is going to try to throw on us, but instead of missing tackles and 
assignments, we have to do what we're supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to come together real fast, because we play Fresno State next week and 
that's the game of the year for us." 
</P>
<P>
It pained Pendleton to watch last week's game. Mississippi State quarterback 
Tony Shell, who would have trouble starting for most Big West teams, shredded 
Fullerton's defense for 220 yards and two touchdowns as the Bulldogs erased a 
13-6 halftime deficit and won, 27-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan secondary consisted of seniors Darrell Bruce, Lionel Denman and Bob 
Baiz, none of whom saw much action last season, walk-on redshirt freshman 
Darrius Watson, junior walk-on Dan Seymour and freshman Terry Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"When they started catching up, I asked (defensive backs coach) Mike Foster if 
I could go in, but he said no," Pendleton said. "I think I could have helped 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
But Titan Coach Gene Murphy had decided before the game that Pendleton wouldn't 
play, no matter what the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"He was doing jumping jacks on one foot in warm-ups," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton will be a sight for sore coaching eyes this week, though. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our best cover guy in terms of closing speed, being able to shorten the 
distance between him and the receiver once the ball is thrown," Foster said. 
"He has great instincts and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"And with him, we won't have to play so many people who are tired, so we should 
be stronger at the end of the game. Last week we had only three cornerbacks, 
and one of them (Darrell Bruce) played every down. I'd rather not do that."

ROBINSON STILL SHOPPING FOR INSURANCE

<P>
The Rams are leaning toward signing an extra kicker as insurance should Mike 
Lansford further injure his leg during Sunday's game against the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford hurt a muscle in his lower right leg Sunday on the opening kickoff, 
kicked off only one more time but continued the kicking chores without major 
difficulties. Although his leg is still aching, Lansford almost certainly will 
be counted on to do at least as much on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mike will be able to kick field goals fine," Coach John Robinson said 
Wednesday, discounting speculation that Lansford could be deactivated Sunday. 
"If we get down to the end of the game and need a field goal, I want Mike 
kicking it. I don't want him standing next to me dressed in a Sears suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Our anticipation is Mike will be in the game, and whether Mike's range is 
shorter or not, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson did say he probably will sign one of three kickers -- former 
Patriot Teddy Garcia, Notre Dame graduate John Carney or David Browndyke, 
formerly of Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and Carney survived Tuesday's eight-kicker group workout, and Browndyke 
was brought in Wednesday. Garcia is the most likely to be signed because he has 
been showing the strongest leg for kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Punter Keith English, to rather dismal results, had to kick off after Lansford 
hurt his leg. English, Robinson insists, is not the guy he wants doing that 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"The one scenario that I don't want to have happen, that I'm worried about, is 
Mike saying, 'Hey, I feel great, kicking the first kick, (then) say, 'Oh, I'm 
out,' and then I've got English kicking again," Robinson said. "Now that, I 
don't want, so I've got to have a backup." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said a final decision about who the Rams might sign for Sunday will 
probably be made Friday. If a kicker is signed as insurance, it would give the 
Rams the odd situation of holding two kickers on their 45-man active roster. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand why he would want to do that, and unfortunately that takes a job 
away from somebody else," Lansford said. "I think that I can do the job. I know 
I'm effective on field goals, and on kickoffs, I don't think I'll lose too much 
distance. I think I can hang the ball, spot it anywhere he wants it, certainly 
better than Keith English." 
</P>
<P>
Lansford took about 10 kicks Wednesday and said he had no problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Eagles' Pro Bowl tight end Keith Jackson ended his 
two-month holdout Wednesday and returned to the team -- just in time to prepare 
to play against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who caught 144 passes and was the NFC's starting tight end in the Pro 
Bowl in his first two NFL seasons, had said he would not report to the team 
until the final two years of his original contract were reworked. He got no 
such reworking, but came in anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Can he be effective Sunday after missing all of training camp and getting only 
a few days of practice time? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think so," Robinson said. "I think if he gets a couple of days in, he 
can be somewhat effective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a plus for the quarterback (Randall Cunningham). I think 
Jackson's his buddy . . . That will be a positive thing for him, 'Boy, I've got 
my guy back. I can start making progress.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said even though he hadn't heard 
officially that Jackson would be activated, he was definitely planning on 
having to defend against him. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, when I started talking about their personnel, I had him in a little 
different-colored letters, but they were in there," Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three (long holdouts) come in against Green Bay (in Week 1) that way, 
you know, come in that week and play. Kevin Greene came in and played, Doug 
Reed came in and played and (Michael) Stewart came in and played, and played 
pretty effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those highly skilled great players like that can come in and be pretty 
darned effective. And you know, he and Randall have worked together on a large 
scale for a long time. It's like riding a bike with those two guys, once you 
know how to do it, it's not too hard to jump on and start pedaling." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest NFL statistical rankings, the Rams are sitting at the top as the 
No. 1 offense with an average of 398 yards through two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where it should be," said Jim Everett, who also happens to be the NFL's 
top-rated quarterback. "It's a nice stat to have. I think it definitely 
portrays what kind of talent we have on this team. 
</P>
<P>
"But again, we're 1-1. I wish we were 2-0 and (ranked) 28th." 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: The Rams have no serious injuries listed for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eagles have lost one starter -- defensive tackle Mike Pitts was 
placed on injured reserve this week -- and three other key players are listed 
as questionable. They are starting left tackle Matt Darwin (knee), right 
defensive end Clyde Simmons (ankle) and strong safety Andre Waters (knee). 
</P>
<P>
There is tenseness in the Philadelphia air lately, all tied to the Eagles' 
unexpected 0-2 start this season and dramatically heightened by the team's loss 
to Phoenix last week at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us were embarrassed," Cunningham said Wednesday. "But we're not having 
any luck on our team right now. Last year, we had some situations where we got 
some lucky breaks and they helped us." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are clearly fighting to save their season -- and very possibly the 
job of Buddy Ryan, who is in the last year of his original five-year contract 
and has a strained relationship with Norman Braman, the Eagles' owner. Braman 
has said he expects the Eagles to make the "quantum leap" into Super Bowl 
contention this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can salvage the season," Ryan said. "I've been 1-3 before, so it's 
a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
But, after two first-round losses in the playoffs and now two losses to start 
the season, isn't Ryan feeling some heat? 
</P>
<P>
"Nope, I think heat's something you put on yourself," Ryan said. "I'm doing a 
good job. Nobody's done a better job in this league than I have over the last 
four or five years, so I don't worry about it. 
</P>

Cal State Fullerton safety Terry Tramble, who was expected to miss six to eight 
games after sustaining a broken forearm Sept. 8 against Auburn, might be back 
sooner than originally anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Tramble, an all-Big West, first-team defensive back in 1989, saw a specialist 
Wednesday and was told surgery on his left ulna would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
He resumed practice Wednesday but will concentrate on conditioning and 
participate only in non-contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
Tramble, who will wear a protective device on his arm, said he hopes to be 
ready for the Fresno State game Sept. 29. But Titan defensive coordinator Kirk 
Harmon said Tramble will be evaluated on a week-to-week basis beginning next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure when he'll be ready," Harmon said. "We're going to work on 
keeping his legs fresh and see how his arm feels." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Tramble would be a boost to the Fullerton secondary, which has 
allowed 842 yards and eight touchdowns passing in three games. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, getting Terry back will help because he's a senior member of the 
defense, a team leader and an all-conference performer," Harmon said. "We're 
excited about that prospect." MIKE DiGIOVANNA

OIL: WITH 90% OF ITS EXPORT EARNINGS DEPENDENT ON PETROLEUM PRODUCTION, GULF 
CRISIS PROVES A BOON AFTER 15-YEAR CIVIL WAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
After 15 years of an economically devastating civil war, oil-rich Angola may 
find itself on the winning end of the conflict in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The southwestern African nation derives 90% of its export earnings from oil 
production, and experts say the recent run-up in crude prices on worldwide 
markets could bring a windfall in profits. 
</P>
<P>
The light crude from Angola's oil-producing center in Cabinda province already 
has risen to as much as $32 a 42-gallon barrel since the Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait by neighboring Iraq. That was $17 higher than the April average. 
</P>
<P>
It's a welcome relief for Angola, which, like other oil-producing nations, had 
to weather a soft oil market in the mid-1980s, when crude prices neared the 
$10-a-barrel level. 
</P>
<P>
"The government needs oil revenues desperately," said Robert Connon, general 
manager of Cabinda Gulf Oil Co., a unit of Chevron Corp., which operates rigs 
off the Cabinda coast near Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
Oil is what has kept the country going during the civil war between the Marxist 
government and U.S.-backed UNITA rebels, who have been fighting for power since 
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of Angola's land is fertile, little has been under cultivation 
since the war. And exports of the country's large mineral deposits, including 
diamonds and iron ore, have been virtually halted. 
</P>
<P>
Angola currently pumps about 550,000 barrels of crude a day, up from a daily 
output of 130,000 barrels in 1982, according to government figures. That's only 
about one-tenth the oil of Saudi Arabia, but with crude reserves at 2.1 billion 
barrels, Angola follows Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry experts estimate that Angola's crude oil exports earned $2.5 
billion last year, up from an estimated $1.9 billion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest buyer of Angolan oil even though it spends 
more than $50 million a year in arming UNITA, which stands for the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola. U.S. imports of Angolan oil totaled 
42.7 million barrels from January through May, according to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Angola is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 
but it often follows moves by the cartel to cut or raise production. It's 
unlikely, though, that Angola will boost production any time soon to make up 
for a shortage of supplies stemming from the Iraqi invasion and subsequent U.S. 
troop buildup in the region, representatives of the big foreign oil companies 
said. They said Angola oil production already is operating near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fields in Angola, and from what we understand, the other fields as well 
are producing pretty much flat out," said Bill Rapp, Texaco Inc.'s West African 
and Latin American area coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
But Cabinda Gulf's Connon said that in the next three years his company expects 
to increase its pumping capacity by 50,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some exploration successes recently, and I see a fair amount 
of interest from companies not operating here yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State-owned Sonangol is the sole concessionaire for oil exploration and 
production rights in Angola. But foreign firms, including Texaco and Chevron of 
the United States, Frances's Elf Aquitaine and Belgium's Petrofina, have opened 
production-sharing agreements or joint ventures with the state company.

PAGING FIRM REPORTS LOSS FOR QUARTER

<P>
Southland Communications Inc., a financially struggling paging company that is 
facing civil and criminal investigations related to an alleged stock 
manipulation scheme, reported a third-quarter loss of $393,118 for the period 
ended July 31. 
</P>
<P>
The loss compared to a year-earlier deficit of $244,062. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the third quarter was $1.6 million, up slightly from $1.5 million a 
year earlier. In a Sept. 14 federal filing, the company disclosed that its cash 
flow is in "extremely critical condition" and its working capital deficit rose 
to $6.5 million, up from $3.6 million on Oct. 31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Southland said it has reduced its work force from 84 to 49 people. The company 
is being sued by Motorola Communications Inc. in Orange County Superior Court 
in Santa Ana for failing to make payments on $5.6 million worth of leased 
paging equipment. Southland has filed a countersuit against Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed civil charges against Ahmad N. 
Bayaa, Southland's president, accusing him of conspiring to manipulate 
Southland's stock price, which rose 91% in a three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the SEC, Southland said it believes that Bayaa and the company 
could be targets of a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice and 
the FBI involving securities laws violations, mail fraud and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers denied an appeal by 
Southland that its stock continue to be traded on the NASDAQ exchange.

PROFIT DECLINE PROMPTS ALLERGAN TO SHUT LENS FACTORY

Trying to hold down costs in response to declining profits, Allergan Inc. said 
Wednesday that it will close its contact lens manufacturing plant in New York 
next year and transfer those operations to a facility in Waco, Tex., and its 
corporate headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The eye and skin care company said it will eliminate 280 jobs at its plant in 
Woodbury, N.Y. At the same time, Allergan said it will create 135 jobs in Waco 
and hire 45 to 50 people in Irvine to perform customer service, research and 
development, and administrative services for the company's lens manufacturing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
After the latest changes are complete, the company will have a net loss of 
about 95 jobs, said Allergan spokesman B. Norris Battin. 
</P>
<P>
"This will improve the efficiency of Allergan's business. We will be able to 
manufacture our products at a reduced cost," Battin said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Allergan began shifting most of its manufacturing operations from 
Irvine to Waco to take advantage of lower land and labor costs. After the New 
York plant closes, Battin said, all of Allergan's contact lenses will be 
produced in Waco, where the company's lens care products already are 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan is trying to reduce costs to help improve its profits, which have been 
slipping because of delays in getting a new lens cleaning product to market and 
an industrywide decline in the number of new lens users over the past 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter ended June 30, the company's earnings fell 20% to $17.1 
million from $21.5 million for the same period in 1989.

HOW TO CHANGE YOUR NAME LEGALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE BOZANICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So what happens if Esther feels in her heart of hearts that she is actually a 
Tiffany? If Billy Ray Jim Bob knows his life would be different if he became 
Thaddeus? If the appellation doesn't fit, change it. 
</P>
<P>
You can adopt a name at any time and change it on credit cards and some other 
official records using an "also known as." But "a.k.a.'s get messy with tax 
records," said Charlotte Hooker, probate division supervisor in the county 
clerk's office. "The only way to get your birth records changed is to go 
through the legal name-change process." 
</P>
<P>
Name changes are handled locally by the probate division of the Orange County 
clerk's office, located in the Orange County Courthouse, 700 Civic Center Drive 
West in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The filing fee is $123. Forms for the Petition for Change of Name, Order to 
Show Cause for Change of Name and Decree Changing Name are available on the 
first floor of the courthouse in the county clerk's office. When completed 
(they must be typewritten), they can be returned to the probate division on the 
second floor, Department 3. Families -- such as husband and wife, parent and 
minor child, and brother and sister under the age of 18 -- can petition 
together. A hearing date will be assigned when the paperwork is filed. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the filed Order to Show Cause for Change of Name must be published in 
an adjudicated Orange County newspaper at least once a week for four 
consecutive weeks. A list of the 30 such newspapers is available in the county 
clerk's office. The newspaper's Proof of Publication should be submitted no 
later than two days before the hearing date. 
</P>
<P>
In California, a request for a name change can be denied only if a person with 
a legitimate reason for rejecting the change files an objection with the court. 
If this is not the case, the Decree Changing Name is granted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If you are recently married 
</P>
<P>
You do not have to go through the court process to change your name. You do, 
however, have to contact the agencies listed below to alert them to the change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies to contact 
</P>
<P>
The first agency to alert is the Social Security Administration. You can 
request the necessary forms by telephone by calling (800) 234-5772. Once the 
forms are filled out, you can mail them to any of the seven local Social 
Security offices with the original or certified copies of the court order that 
changes your name, your marriage certificate or divorce decree. The documents 
will be returned to you after processing. If you do not want to send original 
copies through the mail, you can take the forms and documents into any Social 
Security office and they will process the name change. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security Administration records and tax records are linked by computer, 
so there is no reason to contact the Internal Revenue Service as well. Social 
Security will alert the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to change the name on your driver's license. The Department of 
Motor Vehicles will issue you a new license (with a new picture) for a $10 fee. 
</P>
<P>
Others to contact about your name change include: your bank; your employer; 
credit card, utility and insurance companies; voter registration, passport and 
post offices; magazines and newspapers you subscribe to, and your school alumni 
association.

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: EX-FOOTHILL STUDENT 2ND IN CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Anderson, a June graduate of Foothill High School in Santa Ana, 
finished second in a nationwide poster contest sponsored by the Knights of 
Pythias to enlighten young people about drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, now a student at Golden West College, received $1,100 in bonds and a 
$200 scholarship for her poster based on the contest's theme: "The Hazards of 
Drug Abuse." Amber Goodwin of St. Clarksburg, W. Va., was selected the national 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights of Pythias is a fraternal order founded in Washington in 1864. Its 
members support children's charities, a youth camp in the Sierra Nevadas and 
the Children's Welfare Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Huge enrollment increases in California public schools will continue at least 
until the end of this decade, the state Department of Finance has predicted. 
</P>
<P>
New figures released last week by the department's population unit show that 
enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade will grow from almost 5 million 
this fall to 6.8 million in the fall of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The increase this year over 1989 was 193,000 pupils, which is 10,000 more than 
the department was projecting last May and almost 40,000 more than was 
predicted a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
These huge annual enrollment jumps are the underlying causes of problems such 
as overcrowded classes, the shaky financial condition faced by 20 to 30 school 
districts and a $5-billion backlog in unmet school construction needs. 
</P>
<P>
The department's population experts said the enrollment increases are due to a 
continuing rise in the state's birthrate, which has been climbing since 1974, 
and to continued heavy increase of out-of-staters moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
The highest projected percentage increase would be in Riverside County, where 
school enrollments are expected to increase by almost 107% -- from 201,600 this 
year to 417,100 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County is expecting a 91% increase in the next 10 years, San 
Diego County 55%, Santa Barbara County 49%, Orange County 44%, Los Angeles 
County 36% and Ventura County 30%. 
</P>

COMEDY: PROP STAR; 
</P>
<P>
GALLAGHER AIMS HIS STEAMROLLER AT THE COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a staff writer for The Times Orange 
County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gallagher is the undisputed king of prop comedy, which -- depending on how you 
look at it -- is either a compliment or the ultimate put-down. 
</P>
<P>
Many comedy purists say props are the lazy comic's way to a cheap laugh. 
Gallagher doesn't do interviews, so the only thing speaking in his defense is 
success: One of the top-drawing comics around, Gallagher stars in his own TV 
specials and commonly sells out big halls in multinight runs. 
</P>
<P>
The long-haired comic's loud and loyal Orange County following has a chance to 
see him in a smaller-than-usual setting as he comes to San Juan Capistrano to 
play the Coach House, where he opens a five-night run Monday, Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Props aren't the only thing on the bill in his long shows (he topped 2 1/2 
hours in a series of 1988 performances at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre). He'll 
delve into topical issues, try his hand at whimsical wordplay and banter with 
the crowd. But it's the props that steal the show. 
</P>
<P>
They range from raucous vaudeville stunts to devilishly inventive visual puns. 
</P>
<P>
His Rolodex watch, complete with little file cards, is a favorite with 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional show-closer is the Sledge-O-Matic -- a big mallet with which he 
smashes melons and other messy inanimate objects (watch out if you sit in the 
first few rows). 
</P>
<P>
One of his newer additions speaks to the lengths to which he'll go to get a 
laugh. It's a real live steamroller, which Gallagher uses to run over audience 
volunteers. One slight modification: the roller is made of foam rubber. 
</P>

MOTHER IN SLAIN GIRL TRAGEDY FACES DRUG COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman whose plight gained statewide attention last year after her 7-year-old 
daughter disappeared and was later found sexually molested and strangled in a 
neighbor's house was charged today with drug possession, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hodges, 43, of Apple Valley, and two others were arrested Tuesday night 
when Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies raided a Newhall house and seized a 
quarter-pound of methamphetamine, a gun and $5,000 in cash, Deputy Gabe Ramirez 
said. Arrested with Hodges were Don Hall, 38, and his sister, Mary Alexander, 
39, who live in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges formerly lived in the home in the 24900 block of Alderbrook Drive and 
was doing yardwork at the time deputies arrived Tuesday night. Deputies said 
they found a small quantity of methamphetamine in Hodges' purse and she was 
charged with possession of methamphetamine, a drug commonly referred to as 
speed. Hall and Alexander were charged with sales of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
When Hodges was renting a room from Alexander in the Alderbrook Drive house in 
1989, her daughter, Sara Nan, disappeared and was the subject of a massive 
search by deputies and community volunteers for three days. Her body was found 
March 26, 1989, in a neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had been sexually molested and strangled and her body was stuffed 
behind the headboard of a water bed in the bedroom of 14-year-old Curtiss 
Cooper. The boy was arrested, later pleaded guilty to killing the girl and was 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance and slaying of the girl touched a nerve in the community and 
dozens of strangers attended her funeral and contributed to a fund to pay her 
funeral costs. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy was followed by another four months later when Sara Nan's father, 
Wallace S. Mann, who was separated from Linda Hodges, committed suicide on his 
daughter's grave. Investigators concluded that Mann, 36, was distraught over 
his daughter's slaying and the breakup of his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said today that Linda Hodges' arrest came following a two-month 
investigation of activities at the house on Alderbrook Drive. A narcotics 
investigator said the investigation was begun after deputies received numerous 
complaints from neighbors that drugs were being sold there. 
</P>
<P>
An investigator, who asked not to be identified, said Hodges was often seen at 
the house and was believed to be close friends with the two other suspects. He 
said Hodges was previously known to narcotics investigators as a drug user and 
had been arrested at least once before. He said there was no evidence she was 
involved in the sales of drugs at the house. 
</P>
<P>
"She might have just been there as a customer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone said deputies who raided the house found 
three-tenths of a gram of methamphetamine and bag containing cotton balls 
soaked with liquid methamphetamine in Hodges' purse. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a good usable quantity but not enough to imply sales," Stone said, 
explaining why she was not charged with selling the drug as were Hall and 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter-pound of the drug found in the house could be worth as much as 
$3,750 if sold on the street, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, who has one other daughter, was being held at the sheriff's station 
jail in Valencia in lieu of $5,000 bail. Alexander was being held in lieu of 
$15,000 and Hall had no bail because his arrest violated his parole from a 
previous conviction of possession of narcotics for sale, deputies said.

ASIAN GAMES PANEL GIVES IRAQ THE BOOT

<P>
The Olympic Council of Asia voted today to expel Iraq from the Asian Games and 
from the council as punishment for its invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates leaving a closed meeting of the 38-member council said that of those 
present, 27 voted to expel Iraq, three opposed expulsion, five abstained and 
one ballot was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Iraq, Yemen and Palestine opposed expulsion, said Roy De 
Silva of Sri Lanka, vice chairman of the meeting. Mongolia and Afghanistan did 
not vote. 
</P>
<P>
Palestine is recognized as an associate member by the Olympic Council of Asia 
and allowed to enter the Games and vote in council meetings. Palestine is not 
recognized by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The council's president, Sheik Fahad Ahmad Sabah of Kuwait, was killed when 
Iraqi troops stormed the royal palace following the Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the Kuwaitis, have justice on our side," said his son, Ahmed Fahd Sabah, 
president of Kuwait's National Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The voting took less than 30 minutes. Approval by two-thirds of voting 
delegates was needed to pass the ban. Abstentions did not count. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates said Iraq was suspended from the council until Kuwait's National 
Olympic Committee is able to function normally in its homeland. Most of 
Kuwait's competitors were trapped in the country following the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Some Kuwaiti athletes, who were outside their nation when Iraq invaded, have 
arrived in Beijing to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The Games open Saturday and close Oct. 7. At least 31 nations representing 
about 4,300 athletes have agreed to participate in the Games, held every four 
years. Iraq had declared its intention to compete, but its athletes had not yet 
checked in at the Games village. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel sorry for the (Iraqi) athletes. We feel more sorry for the spirit of 
Olympism. This is a victory for everything illegal," said Abdul Karim Mulla, 
president of Iraq's National Olympic Committee. "It is clear that there was 
great pressure." 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi National Olympic Committee statement described the expulsion as "a 
clear and flagrant violation of the OCA constitution and all its principles and 
values of fair treatment for all members." 
</P>
<P>
Today's council meeting began with all delegates, including the Iraqis, 
standing in a moment of silence for the slain council president, delegates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Fahd Sabah said today's vote would help the morale of the few Kuwaiti 
athletes at the Games.

Lawyers asked a judge today to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H. 
Keating Jr., a central figure in the nation's saving and loan scandal, 
characterizing him as a pauper who won't flee. 
</P>
<P>
The former American Continental Corp. chairman sat in Superior Court with three 
co-defendants as attorneys argued that he would have trouble financing his 
defense against numerous cases stemming from the $2-billion collapse of Irvine, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
-based Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Arizona developer surrendered to Los Angeles County prosecutors 
Tuesday to face a 42-count grand jury indictment, and Judge Gary Klausner 
surprised even prosecutors by setting the bail at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The bail reduction hearing also sought cuts in the $1-million bails set for 
co-defendants Judy E. Wischer, Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner took no immediate action on the defendants' requests.

The Bucks County coroner, ignoring calls from citizens groups, today said he 
has no intention of reopening the investigation into the suicide of political 
activist Abbie Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens Commission on Human Rights and the Prozac Survivors Support Group 
-- both offshoots of the Church of Scientology -- had asked the coroner to 
reopen the case after it was learned Hoffman took the controversial 
anti-depressant Prozac six weeks before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Rosko ruled that Hoffman committed suicide on April 12, 1989, in 
Solebury Township by taking an overdose of the sedative phenobarbital and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, 52, had filled a prescription for Prozac before his death, but Rosko's 
autopsy did not find any traces of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
A Harvard study published in February found that 3 1/2% of Prozac users 
developed suicidal thoughts that lasted up to three months after taking the 
drug.

A man who lost an arm after falling on subway tracks while drunk has been 
awarded $9.3 million by a jury. "God bless America," said Francisco Marino, 30, 
a Mexican citizen who had been in the United States for one year working as a 
dishwasher before the April, 1989, accident. 
</P>
<P>
City transit officials said they will appeal Wednesday's state Supreme Court 
decision, which compensates Marino for pain and suffering and loss of earnings. 
He was hit by a northbound train after falling. 
</P>
<P>
Marino's lawyer, Alan Shapey, contended that his client would not have fallen 
in front of the train if transit officials had followed their guidelines to 
"take charge" of disabled or intoxicated people, at least until a police 
officer arrives, to ensure their safety.

EAST COULD GET BIG QUAKE IN NEXT CENTURY, STUDY SAYS

California may get the publicity, but residents of the East are in just as much 
danger from earthquakes, according to a report published today. 
</P>
<P>
There are many more quakes in California than there are in the Eastern states, 
but when tremors strike in the Central and Eastern states, they affect much 
larger areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Hence, while California is more hazardous . . . on the basis of frequency of 
occurrence, both regions have comparable risk," say S. P. Nishenko and G. A. 
Bollinger in Science, the journal of the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science. The report is due out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The two researchers calculated that there is a 29% chance of a serious quake in 
the East or central states by the turn of the century and that such a temblor 
is 97% certain within 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do this responsibly and not cry wolf and cause people to be 
alarmed," Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of earthquakes is well known in California. But scientists warn that 
quakes in the East can cause damage over larger areas because the underlying 
bedrock in the region is different from that in the West. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Bollinger and Nishenko calculate, there is an 8% chance of a 
magnitude 6 quake in New England, 11% in the Southeast and 13% in the New 
Madrid, Mo., area, which includes much of the central United States. Combined, 
there is a 29% chance of a quake in the East, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The New Madrid area was struck by the strongest tremor on record in this 
country in the winter of 1811-1812, a quake reportedly felt as far away as 
Washington and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2090, the researchers calculate a 97% chance of a 6.0 quake 
somewhere in the East. The chances are 55% in New England, 70% in the Southeast 
and 75% in the New Madrid region.

The Russian republic's Parliament overwhelmingly approved a resolution today 
urging Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his Cabinet to resign, 
calling them unable to save the country from economic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which passed on a 164-1 vote with 16 abstentions, said Ryzhkov's 
government "is not capable of pulling the country out of its deep economic 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The Russian body called on the national Parliament, the Supreme Soviet, to 
"solve the question of the resignation of the entire government of the 
U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
But the resolution was referring to the Council of Ministers and not President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has backed a sweeping 500-day program that would 
bring quicker market-oriented reform than Ryzhkov has called for.

Tamil militants wielding knives and automatic weapons stormed through a fishing 
village in northern Sri Lanka, setting fire to houses and killing at least 40 
villagers, a senior military official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the massacre took place Wednesday evening in the ethnic 
Sinhalese-dominated village of Vella Mundel, about 80 miles north of Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the powerful ethnic Tamil 
separatist group fighting to create an independent homeland for the nation's 
minority Tamil population, were responsible for the attack, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recovered 15 bullet-ridden bodies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from the village said police rescued two wounded villagers, who 
told them an unspeciied number of armed militants killed people on sight. 
Officials said the two wounded villagers told them at least 40 people had been 
killed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"A large number of fishing huts have also been burned down," the official said. 
"We fear that there are bodies charred inside."

Tests on ticks collected in the 1940s indicate Lyme disease plagued the United 
States three decades earlier than previously thought and may have originated on 
Long Island, researchers said today. 
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the bodies of 136 ticks preserved in alcohol in the Museum of 
Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Mass., and the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington, researchers found evidence of the microbe that causes Lyme disease 
in some ticks that roamed eastern Long Island 44 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lyme disease was not recognized as a distinct illness in the United States 
until 1975, when patients were first diagnosed in Lyme, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
More than 14,000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported in 43 states since 
1980, with most cases occurring in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic coastal 
states and Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The first symptoms usually are a distinctive rash at the tick bite site and 
flu-like symptoms. The disease can usually be treated with antibiotics. But 
without treatment, complications such as chronic arthritis, neurological and 
organ damage can occur.

MONEY-LAUNDERING LAWS BEING DODGED, PANEL FINDS

Congressional investigators said today that businesses are routinely conniving 
with customers to circumvent money-laundering laws requiring large cash 
transactions be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses from across our land are willing to assist others in laundering 
money and evading taxes for a 'quick buck,' " said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), 
chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Loopholes in the present law are "big enough to . . . drive a brand new 
Mercedes-Benz through," said Rep. Richard Schulze (R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1984 law, businesses are required to report to the IRS all transactions 
that involve more than $10,000 in cash. The purpose was to help the IRS 
identify taxpayers with large cash incomes that might otherwise be 
under-reported. 
</P>
<P>
However, the subcommittee investigators found that car dealers, jewelers, yacht 
salesmen and others are willing to ignore the law in order to make big cash 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It is shocking that businesses throughout the country are routinely conniving 
with customers to violate the law," Pickle said during a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee investigators reported on their visits to 79 businesses 
nationwide where they negotiated for the purchase of $4.2 million in luxury 
goods, each for more than $10,000 cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy-six out of 79 of these businesses agreed to accept cash and not report 
the transactions to the IRS. In fact, some of the businesses actually suggested 
ploys to circumvent the reporting requirements," Pickle said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators bought a $55,000 Persian rug, a $250,000 condominium, a 
$22,000 antique mirror and a $73,000 Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze criticized the IRS for lax enforcement, saying, "Our investigation 
found an almost total breakdown in the program." 
</P>
<P>
But Schulze said it was obvious that many businesses are anxious to hide large 
cash transactions and they need to be pressured into compliance.

DAKOTA WHEAT BOUNTIFUL BUT FARMERS ARE STUCK WITH IT

For two years, the powdery soil on David Lang's farm refused to yield a crop. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he finally got rain and about 1,500 acres of golden wheat. But he's 
stuck with the wheat. 
</P>
<P>
A world wheat glut totaling more than 21.6 billion bushels is holding down 
prices, experts say. The U.S. wheat crop alone is expected to total a 
near-record 2.76 billion bushels, up 35% from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a wheat war going on," said Neal Fisher, director of the North Dakota 
Wheat Commission. "Canadians sold wheat to China about two weeks ago for 
something around $2.50 a bushel. The European Community is selling it for 
$2.05." 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota wheat farmers are getting about $2.20 a bushel, at least $1 less 
than last year and the lowest they've seen in at least five years. Farmers say 
the costs of producing a bushel are at least three times that much. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to pay $1.35 to $1.40 for a gallon of gasoline just to harvest that 
crop," said Lang, 44, who farms 3,000 acres with his father near Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
Government subsidies help offset production costs, but farmers say they also 
are being squeezed this year by energy prices, which have risen sharply since 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably lose more farmers this year than any year previous," said 
Gov. George Sinner. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat growers say the embargo against Iraq is having little effect on the 
market because American wheat sales to Iraq had already dried up this year. 
</P>
<P>
Farm leaders are asking the U.S. Agriculture Department to help lift wheat 
prices by keeping more grain in reserve, offering bigger loans to farmers and 
paying more federal export bonuses to increase sales. 
</P>
<P>
Lang said he's not asking for wheat at $5 per bushel when $3.50 would do. All 
he wants is a stable farm program. 
</P>
<P>
"Urban people have got to realize where food comes from," he said. "If we're 
not out here producing it, one of these years they're going to go hungry."

National Semiconductor Corp., which laid off 2,000 workers last month, posted a 
$165.5-million first-quarter loss today, largely because of a $143.6-million 
restructuring charge. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing semiconductor manufacturer reported revenue of $442.7 million for 
the quarter that ended Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The results compared with a loss of $21.9 million on revenue of $397.6 million 
in the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
National Semiconductor's stock was down 25 cents at $4.50 a share in early 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 21, National Semi said it would lay off 2,000 workers, or about 6% of 
its work force. The company shut down one of two production lines at its 
Puyallup, Wash., plant and said it would close a Tucson facility that assembles 
and tests products for military markets. 
</P>
<P>
The company posted a pretax operating loss of $21.6 million for the first 
quarter before the restructuring charge.

If Denver is awarded a National League baseball franchise for 1993, the team 
will be known as Colorado and a fan contest will determine the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
The use of Denver in the title has been ruled out, and it's not considered 
likely that the nickname of Bears will be used because of marketing conflicts 
with the NFL's Chicago Bears. Several fan groups, however, have been attempting 
to drum up support to keep the Bears' name, which has been associated with 
Denver's minor-league baseball teams for most of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Denver was removed as a possibility because the prospective owners want to send 
the signal it will be a regional team, not the city's team.

FLORIDA ESCAPES NCAA'S 'DEATH PENALTY';

COLLEGES: THE GATORS' FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL PROGRAMS GET PROBATION. PENALTIES

<P>
The University of Florida football and basketball programs were placed on two 
years' probation by the NCAA today but escaped the "death penalty" that could 
have shut down both sports for two years. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second time in six years the NCAA had imposed sanctions on the 
Gators, but this case -- centered on infractions occurring under former 
football Coach Galen Hall and former basketball Coach Norm Sloan -- seemed 
nowhere near as severe as the other. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike 1984, when Florida football was slapped with two years' probation, lost 
scholarships and was banned from appearing in postseason games and on live 
television, the penalties this time were relatively light. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA banned the football team from appearing in a bowl game after this 
season, but took no more action against that sport. The basketball program will 
lose three scholarships over two years and must return a portion of the revenue 
it earned from the 1988 NCAA tournament because of the use of an ineligible 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
The Gators will be permitted 13 scholarships in 1991-92, two fewer than the 
maximum, and 14 scholarships in 1992-93. The NCAA also cited Sloan and Hall, 
both fired last year, for unethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Although the school avoided the "death penalty," university President John 
Lombardi took exception to the postseason ban on this year's football team, 
which is 2-0 and ranked No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept as appropriate the punishment of the innocent for the sins of 
a prior generation," Lombardi said. He described the ban as "a particularly 
difficult blow to accept." 
</P>
<P>
The school can appeal the sanctions, or ask that the ban against the football 
team be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
The school had argued in a 1,100-page response to the NCAA charges that swift 
corrective action taken when infractions were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, now a graduate assistant coach at Penn State, was asked to step down in 
the middle of last season after admitting he provided improper salary 
supplements to two assistant coaches. The NCAA also charged that he assisted a 
former player in paying child support, but Hall denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan, who is coaching a professional team in Greece, has denied any knowledge 
that he broke NCAA rules, including an allegation that he provided an airline 
ticket for ex-Gators star Vernon Maxwell to attend a summer basketball camp.

LEAGUE BANS LIONS' TAYLOR FOR FAILING DRUG TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cornerback Terry Taylor of the Detroit Lions became the fourth NFL player to be 
banned from the league for life today when the league banished him after he 
tested positive for illegal substances for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor, 29, who is in his seventh season, can apply for reinstatement in a 
year. He was suspended for four games in 1988 while playing for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round draft pick in 1984, Taylor was starter for most of his seasons 
with the Seahawks before being traded to the Lions in 1989 for running back 
James Jones. He had 16 lifetime interceptions, including two he returned for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The other players banned for life under the NFL's drug program -- which affects 
players testing positive three times -- are running back Tony Collins, then 
with Indianapolis, in 1988; defensive end Dexter Manley of Washington last 
November and defensive end Frank Warren of New Orleans earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who spent most of his career with New England, was reinstated this 
season and signed with Miami. He made the team in training camp but was 
released a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants running back Dave Meggett, apparently upset over his current 
two-year contract, skipped a team practice, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett, who set a team record with 1,807 all-purpose yards and made the Pro 
Bowl as rookie last season, failed to report to Wednesday's practice, placing 
his status for Sunday's game against the Miami Dolphins in question. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Agnone, Meggett's Baltimore-based agent, told New York Newsday that his 
client was ill. "I don't think he was feeling well," Agnone said. "I think it 
was a touch of the virus." 
</P>
<P>
Agnone told the New York Post that Meggett is expected to return to practice 
today. He told the New York Times that before this season's training camp the 
Giants had agreed to discuss a contract extension, but failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants placed cornerback Mark Collins on injured reserve Wednesday with a 
sprained right ankle. He will be out for at least three games. 
</P>
<P>
Collins won't be eligible to practice with the team for at least four weeks.

BEACH TOWEL IS ONE TO BEAT IN LI'L BROWN JUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The trainer of Little Brown Jug favorite Beach Towel says looks can be 
deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Remmer, a co-trainer of Beach Towel, on Wednesday said that to look at 
his horse next to others you wouldn't see much of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
But it is what is inside Beach Towel that sets him apart. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a will to win," Remmer said. "That's something you don't know when 
you look at him, but he sure displays it on the race track." 
</P>
<P>
Beach Towel is the heavy favorite going into today's 45th running of the Little 
Brown Jug at the Delaware County Fairgrounds. The Jug is the third of pacing's 
triple crown events. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains caused the postponement of Grand Circuit racing on Sunday and again 
Wednesday. But sunshine and mild temperatures are expected for the Jug. And 
even a drizzle couldn't dampen Remmer's admiration for his horse. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider him to be a once-in-a-lifetime horse," Remmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-horse field was narrowed in three eliminations. Beach Towel was 
considered the horse to beat even before he drew the No. 2 post in the third 
elimination, away from most of the other top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the challengers are In The Pocket, Global Assault, Road Machine and 
Brando Hanover in the first elimination, Kiev Hanover and CKS in the second and 
Scoot Outa Reach in the third.

SEPARATING THE FACTS FROM THE OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FACT: The nine hitters earning at least $3 million a year(Jose Canseco, Kirby 
Puckett, Don Mattingly, Robin Yount, Kevin Mitchell, Will Clark, Eric Davis, 
Joe Carter, Rickey Henderson) are hitting a combined average of .270 this year 
with an average of 21 home runs and 75 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: I don't care how little they got in return or how good a 1990 year he 
is having with the Dodgers, the Orioles are better off without Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Since the beginning of the 1988 season, the Redskins have won five of 17 
games against teams with winning records. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: If the 49ers slip, the Giants will be the team that catches them. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: If the A's win the World Series this year, it will mark the first time in 
27 years that the champions of the three major sports are repeat winners at the 
same time. (The Yankees, Packers and Celtics reigned together from the time of 
the Packers' second straight NFL title in December, 1962, until the Yankees' 
loss to the Dodgers in the 1963 World Series.) 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: Jerry Glanville may be a loudmouthed punk, but at least he is an 
original personality in the homogenous NFL. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Throwing out the strike year of 1982 (when the size of the playoff field 
doubled), every NFL team except the Packers and the Cardinals played a 
postseason game in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: At less than three hours, NFL games are almost start-to-finish 
watchable again. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: The bombing of Pearl Harbor came less than a year before Eddie Robinson 
was hired as the football coach at Grambling, where he coached his 500th game 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: Sure, Rickey Henderson is having a terrific season, but Cecil Fielder 
is the MVP in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: John (Hot Rod) Williams will earn $9 million in the first 12 months of 
his new mega-contract. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: With road games at Tennessee and USC in November, Notre Dame will have 
trouble finishing No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: The Toronto Blue Jays have almost quintupled their attendance in the last 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: It sure is fun watching Buddy Ryan get his tough talk stuffed back in 
his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Thirty-two years ago today, Hoyt Wilhelm became the first Oriole to throw 
a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: I wish the rest of the announcers on television were as knowledgeable 
and insightful as CBS tennis analyst Mary Carillo. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Arizona defensive back McCann Utu was ruled ineligible by the NCAA for 
posing nude in Playgirl. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: Dexter Manley might wind up playing for -- gasp -- the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: (From the "What Game Were You Watching?" Dept.) After his team lost to 
Oklahoma by six touchdowns last weekend, Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt said: 
"I think Oklahoma gained some respect for Eastern football." 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: Vinny Testaverde may never get over the hump. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Gerald R. Ford was six months into his term as President when the New 
England Patriots drafted their current quarterback, Steve Grogan. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: The Chiefs, Jets and Falcons are NFL teams headed in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Yes, it was the U.S. Open, but Curtis Strange, supposedly the best 
American golfer of his generation, has won only one golf tournament in the past 
23 months. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: The Bills, Browns and Saints are NFL teams headed in the wrong 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Television audiences for the biggest college bowl games are roughly the 
same size as audiences for most regular-season NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: With his pleasant demeanor and attention to tennis history, Pete 
Sampras is almost too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Steve Trittschuh, a member of the U.S. soccer team that played in the 
World Cup last summer, recently became the first non-Czech since 1938 to score 
a goal in the Czechoslovak league. He plays for a team in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: Someone needs to explain to the Boston Celtics that they aren't close 
to being a championship team.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ACIDIC OR SALTY FOODS CAN DRAW ALUMINUM OUT OF POTS, PANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON AND TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently purchased a used set of aluminum pots and pans. One friend 
has told me I should not use them because I'd get Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Another friend says, "Although doctors say Alzheimer's patients have aluminum 
in their brains, aluminum cannot be absorbed from eating food cooked in 
aluminum pots." 
</P>
<P>
Which should I believe? I don't think I want to use these pans until I get your 
advice. If there hasn't been enough testing, so that no one is sure, I wonder 
if I should take the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No one yet knows whether aluminum predisposes one to Alzheimer's 
disease or if the accumulation of the mineral in the brain is a secondary 
consequence of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Our only caution would be to avoid cooking acidic or salty foods, which can 
pull aluminum from the pots and pans. This element can be absorbed from food so 
tomato sauces or sauerkraut, for example, would be verboten. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When you wrote recently about home remedies for cold sores, why in heaven's 
name didn't you tell people about l-lysine? 
</P>
<P>
For 50 years I would develop fever blisters every time I went out in the sun. 
About four years ago a pharmacist told me about l-lysine. Since then I have 
taken it for a week before I know I'll be exposed to sunshine. I have not had a 
cold sore since. 
</P>
<P>
A. We were flooded with letters like yours praising the power of l-lysine. One 
young woman wrote, "My boyfriend got these sores constantly, and as a last 
resort we went to the health food store to see if there was anything that could 
help. He was told to take lysine, and the sores have never returned." 
</P>
<P>
Another reader reported suffering from nasty fever blisters that lasted three 
or four weeks. She was told by a friend to take lysine, and when she was 
skeptical, the friend said, "Then live with them if you're stubborn." 
</P>
<P>
She now takes l-lysine whenever she feels a cold sore coming on or if she is in 
the sun more than usual. She says, "It quickly nips them in the bud. Doctors 
and druggists don't seem to believe this, but I know it works." 
</P>
<P>
Though it may not work for everyone, this amino acid may be worth a try.

The Highwaymen -- country music stars Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny 
Cash and Kris Kristofferson -- arrived at their concert with more than 80 tons 
of food in tow to give to the area's needy. 
</P>
<P>
"We waste food in this country," Jennings said.

<P>
Jennings and his wife, singer-songwriter Jessi Colter, praised the 
hunger-relief organization Feed the Children in collecting the food and urged 
concert-goers to donate more canned goods. 
</P>
<P>
The produce, canned goods, cookies and potatoes loaded on four tractor-trailer 
trucks are being distributed to more than 50 area churches, food banks, 
shelters and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Highwaymen, who played Tuesday night at the Sun Dome, collected canned 
goods for the organization at each stop of the group's 18-city tour of the West 
and Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Colter said 1.5 million pounds of food has been distributed so far during the

The International Museum of Photography is honoring the sultry-voiced Lauren 
Bacall with an award for her illustrious film career. 
</P>
<P>
Bacall will be given the George Eastman Award "for distinguished achievement in 
American film" at a fund-raising gala at the George Eastman House on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Previous recipients of the award include Gregory Peck, James Stewart and 
Lillian Gish. 
</P>
<P>
Bacall, who was born Betty Joan Perske, began her career in the 1940s in the 
movie "To Have and Have Not" with Humphrey Bogart. Her come-on in that film to 
Bogart, who became her husband, has become movie legend. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want anything, just whistle," Bacall's character coyly intones. "You 
know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? Just put your lips together . . . and 
blow." 
</P>
<P>
Bacall starred with Bogart in "The Big Sleep," "Dark Passage" and "Key Largo." 
In 1970, she won a Tony award for her stage performance in the musical 
"Applause." More recently she played roles in "Murder on the Orient Express," 
"The Shootist" and "The Fan."

U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II filed for divorce the same day he sailed 
unopposed through the primary election. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrat is seeking a third term representing Massachusetts' 8th 
Congressional District, which includes parts of Boston and Cambridge. 
</P>
<P>
He faces Republican Glenn W. Fiscus in the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kennedy and his wife, Sheila Rauch, filed for a no-fault divorce in 
Suffolk Probate Court, the judge's clerk said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement and financial statement submitted with the divorce papers were 
sealed by the judge, said the clerk, who declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 37, and his wife, 40, separated in February, 1989. They have twin 
9-year-old sons. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy is the oldest of the 11 children of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was 
assassinated in Los Angeles in 1968 after winning the California primary in his 
bid for President.

<P>
Little Richard Penniman Boulevard had been known as simply the "downtown
