CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, the failure by the 
federal government to enact a revenue and spending package that meets the 
established federal budget deficit level by the beginning of October will 
result in automatic spending cuts. These automatic cuts will be so severe and 
so indiscriminate that it will be necessary to send federal personnel home 
without pay for an indeterminate number of days. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the 5,000 members of the FBI Agents Assn., I want to make 
clear what the human cost would be. I also want to point out how unfair it is 
to identify the costs of running an agency such as the FBI, as a part of 
federal expenditure problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tremendous cynicism and irreparable damage to morale will be the result of the 
inescapable message that would come from the temporary dismissals -- that the 
work we do is is ultimately non-essential. The men and women of the FBI are 
very proud of our record for successful investigation of organized crime, drug 
trafficking and money laundering, political corruption, white-collar crime, 
including bank fraud and government contracting fraud, terrorism and foreign 
espionage. We are also very proud of the work our records and laboratory 
divisions do on behalf of state and local law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the interruption of ongoing investigations, the American taxpayer 
should understand the FBI is anything but a bloated government agency. The last 
10 years have seen a steady erosion in pay and benefits for the FBI. The 
Administration's own official figures on federal pay show that the average pay 
for an agent is 33.94% below that of those with comparable levels of training, 
education and responsibility who work outside government. 
</P>
<P>
If you agree with us that the war on crime, the war against drugs, the 
uninterrupted investigation of the savings and loan scandal, and the protection 
of our country's security from terrorism should go on unabated, then tell your 
elected officials so. Give this message to your representatives and the 
President (the White House Comment Line is 202-456-7639).

Oakland, Sacramento, Irwindale and Fontana, don't blame Al Davis for your own 
shortcomings.

If Oakland had it together, the Raiders would still be there. Sacramento 
part-ownership, I think not; Irwindale couldn't get the money or the site in 
order. Fontana, well, who cares?

The Coliseum Commission should be forced into hard manual labor for its

THE UNFOLDING TRAGEDY OF SOUTH AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
DE KLERK, MANDELA NEED TO REGAIN MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a few short months ago, President Frederik W. de Klerk was carefully 
guiding the white minority government toward sharing power with 30 million 
blacks. Nelson Mandela, finally freed from prison and deputy president of the 
newly legalized African National Congress, was triumphantly leading the black 
majority toward peaceful negotiations designed to create a new multiracial, 
democratic order. South Africa, miraculously, seemed on the road to 
irreversible change. 
</P>
<P>
All that is now at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The sense of progress has been challenged by bloody political and ethnic 
rivalries -- possibly exacerbated by white right-wing extremists. The immediate 
result has been the brutal murders of nearly 800 black South Africans in 
townships near Johannesburg. But also left struggling to survive has been that 
cautious but palpable optimism inspired by the adroit and even visionary De 
Klerk and Mandela -- the odd couple in search of the new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
All is not lost yet, however. De Klerk is taking greater responsibility for 
ending the black violence between supporters of the ANC and followers of Zulu 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi and his Inkatha political party for primacy 
during the negotiations on the divided nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
The government crackdown, Operation Iron Fist, is using tough tactics to 
restore law and order in the townships -- though it must not, of course, become 
a license to kill. 
</P>
<P>
The South African president has also acknowledged a "hidden hand" in the 
violence. Police are looking for a white gunman who allegedly participated in 
the random murder of pedestrians last week in Johannesburg. South African 
police officers must show the same fervor in cracking down on pro-apartheid 
whites who instigate violence as they have in moving against fighting blacks. 
</P>
<P>
To address doubts about police impartiality, De Klerk is appointing special 
teams to investigate widespread allegations that government forces are siding 
with the more accommodating Buthelezi and his backers. In addition to their 
investigative chores, those teams are expected to monitor police behavior in 
the townships, an important concession to terrified black residents. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush must play a role as well when he meets on Monday with De Klerk. 
The President must remind De Klerk that he stands on the verge of history, with 
the world watching, as he tries to steer his divided ship of state out of the 
crisis. Bush also must put to De Klerk such tough questions as, "Do you have 
control of your government?" 
</P>
<P>
The President might also inquire about the curious timing of the decision to 
prosecute Winnie Mandela on charges stemming from the murder of a black 
teen-ager accused of informing for the police and the assault on three other 
youths by her bodyguards nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Justice certainly must be served, but the decision cannot be expected to please 
her loyalists, and it is bound to upset her husband, Nelson Mandela, who is 
crucial to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has demonstrated his commitment to progress once again by not giving in 
to ANC members who are seeking arms to defend themselves. A return to an armed 
struggle would result in greater bloodshed and could reduce the possibility for 
peaceful negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's top leadership, in a sharp and welcome reversal, has called for a 
meeting with Buthelezi and the heads of the other black homelands to get to the 
bottom of the violence.While a meeting of Mandela and Buthelezi cannot assure 
peace, anything less assures continued brutality -- and a slow killing of the 
goal of a peaceful and united nation. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of further chaos is too horrifying to contemplate, the hope of a 
just and multiracial South Africa is too essential to be lost.

It seems that the Congress is having the usual hard time putting together a 
budget. I suggest that our representatives just let Gramm-Rudman kick in and 
then resign. 
</P>
<P>
These "honorable gentlemen" have not been able to get it together, ever. I work 
3 1/2 months a year for the government already, and I know I don't get my 
money's worth. Banking, business and health care are crumbling, and all they 
want to do is raise taxes and cut social programs more. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't they take responsibility for their past actions? Instead of Japan 
bashing, take a quick lesson. Admit that you have made mistakes and destroyed 
this great nation. Then get out of the way!

AUTO INSURANCE ON A COLLISION COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's auto insurance system has been a mess for so long that one would 
have thought it impossible to jolt this state's drivers, already beleaguered by 
high rates, out of their cynicism about insurance reform. But Insurance 
Commissioner Roxanni Gillespie may have done it when she authorized a 
staggering 85% rate increase in the state's assigned-risk plan. 
</P>
<P>
The assigned-risk system allows drivers unable to obtain coverage in the 
regular market to buy coverage from a pool in which all the state's auto 
insurance companies share the burden. It was designed for drivers with poor 
records, but has become a haven for many good drivers who simply can't afford 
regular coverage. For policyholders in Los Angeles, Gillespie's rate increase 
could mean a jump of about $500 in their annual insurance bill, even if they 
have a good driving record. Those with poor driving records could pay as much 
as $1,000 more per year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no one in his or her right mind is going to fork over that kind of 
money unless he or she absolutely has to. And with the state's strict 
enforcement rules for mandatory auto insurance due to lapse Jan. 1 -- thanks to 
continued inaction by the state Legislature, which allowed the system to 
deteriorate -- what's more likely to happen is that the number of uninsured 
motorists is going to increase. So down the road, so to speak, those of us who 
want to obey the law, or simply protect our financial well-being by carrying 
sufficient liability insurance, will pay more for uninsured-motorist coverage, 
already the biggest chunk of the typical auto insurance bill. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a no-win situation. Nobody came out ahead on this one. Not good 
drivers or bad drivers. Not the insurance companies, who make a credible case 
that they are losing money on the assigned-risk plan and need some kind of rate 
increase to keep it afloat. And not politicians, because Gillespie's decision 
may feed the anti-incumbent mood growing among voters in California and 
elsewhere. Only the trial lawyers, who have blocked all efforts to enact a 
no-fault insurance system in this state, have little to complain about. The 
tort system that lets them make money from even minor automobile accidents 
remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the political shortcomings of Gillespie's decision, it's a useful 
wake-up call to remind us all that the auto-insurance mess is still with us two 
years after voters enacted Proposition 103 in an effort to reform the system. 
It might even prod a new Legislature, governor and insurance commissioner to 
get down to the business of bringing California a real no-fault insurance 
system, complete with a no-frills auto insurance policy that even the poorest 
driver can afford.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON MOSQUE DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mosques and condos -- to the City Council, they're all the same! The council 
appears incapable of making a decision where there are distinctions of purpose 
and symbolism. I can't recall a house of worship in Los Angeles which "fits in" 
to its neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if churches in New England can be taken as an example, the mosque 
ought to stand out as a place of spiritual refuge and regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
Muslims ought to have houses of worship which suit their history and culture, 
just as Jews and Christians get to have crosses, steeples and Stars of David. 
The design suggested by the Muslim clergyman certainly seems no more unusual 
than the designs of churches throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, this whole red herring gives me an idea. Perhaps a few onion domes on 
the City Hall -- where our confused council meets -- would add at least the 
appearance of wisdom and purpose.

I could not believe that the political powers have nothing better to occupy

mosque to straight lines instead of the traditional dome shape to maintain the 
"look of the neighborhood."

Shall we, who have bumps on our noses, have them straightened to maintain an 
"American" look or some such thing? Why do we continue to insult our own

from the previous year. The company blamed reduced profits on legal and other 
expenses related to its merger with Dennison Manufacturing Co. and the impact 
of a weak worldwide industrial economy.

EXPOS WIN TWO, COMPLETE SWEEP OF METS

<P>
A doubleheader at home? What better time to close in on a division leader. 
</P>
<P>
That's what the New York Mets thought of their doubleheader Thursday against 
the Montreal Expos, but now they find themselves farther behind the first-place 
Pittsburgh Pirates than they have been in more than a week, with the streaking 
Expos on their heels in the National League East race. 
</P>
<P>
Expo rookie Chris Nabholz pitched a one-hitter for his first major league 
shutout and Montreal beat New York, 2-0, to complete the doubleheader sweep at 
Shea Stadium and drop the Mets 2 1/2 games behind the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal scored both its runs in the fourth inning off Sid Fernandez, on Tim 
Wallach's broken-bat RBI single and Marquis Grissom's sacrifice fly. Fernandez 
gave up only two hits in six innings, losing for the sixth time in his last 
seven decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, the Expos rallied for four runs in the eighth inning against 
Frank Viola and reliever John Franco, winning, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Magadan, Darryl Strawberry, Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies, the 
Mets' No. 3 through 6 hitters in the order, had two hits in 20 at-bats in the 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who swept the three-game series at New York, have won six 
consecutive games and trail the Pirates by 4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh beat the Chicago Cubs, 11-2. The Pirates' magic number s 11. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come back before, but now time is just running out," Magadan said of the 
Mets. "Now we have to win on the road." 
</P>
<P>
New York plays 10 of its last 13 games on the road at Chicago, Montreal and 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Nabholz (6-0) did not allow a hit for 5 2/3 innings until Tommy Herr singled to 
right field. The left-hander walked three and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Said Expo Manager Buck Rodgers: "We have to pass the Mets before thinking about 
first place. I just hope the schedule doesn't run out on us." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 11, Chicago 2 -- Andy Van Slyke hit two home runs and drove in three 
runs and Barry Bonds hit a two-run homer, leading the Pirates at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Van Slyke homered in the first inning off loser Randy Kramer and hit a two-run 
homer, his 17th, off Mitch Williams in a three-run sixth. Van Slyke walked in 
his other three appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds hit his 32nd homer in the eighth inning after Van Slyke had walked. It 
was the most home runs by a Pirate since Willie Stargell hit 32 in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Bob Walk allowed only one hit before the Cubs scored a run in the fifth 
inning, and needed relief in the sixth after Ryne Sandberg hit his National 
League-leading 37th home run. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, Atlanta 3 -- Pinch-hitter Mike Laga hit a tie-breaking two-run 
homer in the sixth inning at Atlanta to give Eric Gunderson his first major 
league victory. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was only the second in seven games for San Francisco, which began 
play in third place in the National League East, 7 1/2 games behind 
division-leading Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Laga, batting for Gunderson, hit his second home run of the season off John 
Smoltz after a one-out single by Jose Uribe. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Rookie Ray Lankford's pinch single capped a 
three-run ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a victory at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis, which snapped a four-game losing streak, was held to two runs and 
four hits over eight innings by Terry Mulholland, but Todd Zeile started the 
ninth with a double, bringing on reliever Roger McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile held second on Rex Hudler's infield hit and took third when Pedro 
Guerrero hit into a double play. Felix Jose's infield hit made it 4-3 and, 
after Jose stole second, Denny Walling, pinch hitting for winning pitcher Mike 
Perez, singled off third baseman Charlie Hayes' glove to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Smith's double sent pinch-runner Dave Collins to third before Lankford's 
single gave Perez his first major league victory.

Pinch-hitter Carl Nichols singled home the tying and winning runs with two out 
in the ninth inning Thursday night, giving the Houston Astros a 3-2 victory 
over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, who have lost three straight and six of 11, had their National League 
West lead trimmed to 3 1/2 games over the Dodgers, who beat San Diego, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Davis led off the ninth with a single off Reds' relief ace Randy Myers 
(3-5), who relieved starter Norm Charlton in the eighth. Gerald Young ran for 
Davis and Dave Rohde, another pinch-hitter, was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Biggio sacrificed the runners to second and third and Rafael Ramirez was 
intentionally walked, loading the bases. Myers struck out Mark Davidson before 
Nichols batted for winning pitcher Xavier Hernandez and delivered his 
game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez (2-0) pitched one hitless inning in relief of Mike Scott, who gave up 
two runs -- one earned -- and six hits in eight innings. Charlton held Houston 
to three hits in 7 1/3 innings. Since moving into the starting rotation July 
15, Charlton is 7-3 with a 1.91 earned-run average and has not allowed more 
than three earned runs in any of his 14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Davis singled, stole second, 
continued to third on catcher Biggio's throwing error and scored on a passed 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis made it 2-0 in the fourth with his 22nd homer. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros began their comeback in the sixth when Eric Yelding singled, stole 
second and scored on a single by Casey Candaele.

Cleveland's Carlos Baerga led the extra-base hit parade Thursday night at New 
York as the Indians scored 11 runs in the middle three innings in defeating the 
Yankees, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
Baerga had a triple and three doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians got 16 hits and tied their season-high with nine doubles. Brook 
Jacoby had three hits, including two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Baerga hit an RBI triple in the first inning, but the Yankees bounced back for 
a 6-1 lead. Baerga doubled to start a four-run fourth inning, doubled home a 
run in a four-run fifth and hit a two-run double during a three-run sixth that 
made it 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Chicago 3 -- Erik Hanson won his fifth consecutive decision and 
Henry Cotto homered, tripled and drove in four runs for the Mariners in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The loss by the second-place White Sox reduced Oakland's magic number for 
clinching the American League West to four. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson (16-9) gave up eight hits and retired the last 11 batters.

Bolsa Grande High School's Wilson twins -- Marcus and Maurice -- sparked a 
second-half offensive burst that led the Matadors to a 40-20 nonleague victory 
over winless Pioneer Thursday night at Pioneer High School. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande (1-2) led, 7-6, at halftime, but the Wilson brothers took over in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound tailback, finished with 155 yards rushing and 
two touchdowns in 15 carries. Brother Marcus, a 6-1, 200-pound fullback, gained 
146 yards and scored two touchdowns in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer (0-3), which dropped its 13th consecutive game, managed to exploit 
Bolsa Grande's special teams for its three scores, including an 84-yard kickoff 
return by Anthony Perez and an 85-yard kickoff return by Oley Khounesavath. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Troung scored Bolsa Grande's first touchdown on a three-yard run, but 
Pioneer closed the gap to 7-6 in the second quarter when Mike Moreno recovered 
a blocked punt in the end zone. Bolsa quarterback Brian Taylor ran for a 
35-yard touchdown in the third quarter on a fake punt play. TOM BIRSCHBACH

RANCHO ALAMITOS HITS IT BIG, 74-0

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Alamitos High School football team, which has been oh-so-close to 
the Southern Section playoffs the past three seasons, sent a message to the 
rest of the Garden Grove League Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the Vaqueros' 74-0 rout of Magnolia, they don't plan to be denied 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (3-0) equalled the third-highest point total in Orange County 
history, tying Whittier Christian, which defeated Brethren, 74-0, in 1989. The 
county record is held by Fullerton, which beat Anaheim, 109-0, in 1921. 
Brea-Olinda defeated Capistrano, 75-0, in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll let the kids enjoy this tonight, but starting tomorrow we'll let them 
know that it doesn't mean anything," Vaquero Coach Mark Miller said. "League 
(play) starts next week, and everyone is winless." 
</P>
<P>
In each of the past three seasons, the Vaqueros needed only to win their final 
league game to qualify for the playoffs. Each time, they lost to a team that 
was out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Rancho Alamitos will enter league play as the favorite. The 
Vaqueros, who haven't been to the playoffs since 1982, are off to their best 
start since 1987, when they won their first three games -- including a 60-0 
victory over Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Vaqueros finished 6-4 that season and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three seasons -- nonleague, league and playoffs," Miller said. 
"We've just finished season No. 1, there are two more to go." 
</P>
<P>
But the Vaqueros finished it in style, with an offensive extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos had 401 yards rushing and 599 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ulysses Taammell and Mario Gonzalez had more than 100 yards rushing. 
Taammell had 145 yards in 17 carries and scored three touchdowns. Gonzalez had 
114 yards rushing, including a 67-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Third-string tailback Jeff Byrd had 80 yards rushing and scored two touchdowns, 
one on a 61-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Chris Singletary was nine of 14 for 198 yards and one touchdown. He 
also scored a touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros scored on nine of their 10 possessions and twice when their 
offense didn't have the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Luther Tolbert returned an interception 62 yards for a score just before 
halftime to give Rancho Alamitos a 41-0 lead.

Century High School scared Bloomington for a half Thursday night at Santa Ana 
Stadium, but the Centurions eventually lost, 24-14, and are still looking for 
their first varsity football victory in school history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to walk before we can run," Century Coach Bill Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"But right now, we're breaking into a trot." 
</P>
<P>
Century's Orlando Olivos, a sophomore wide receiver, set up the game's first 
score with a 57-yard reception from sophomore quarterback Rick Odoardi. 
</P>
<P>
Odoardi capped the drive with a one-yard run, scoring the first points of the 
year against the stingy Bloomington defense to give Century a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomington responded by marching 79 yards in 10 plays and scoring on a 
fourth-and-goal, four-yard pass from Larry Humphreys to Jason Smith. Greg 
Mermilliod made the conversion to give the Bruins a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomington scored the next 17 points, including a third-quarter, 97-yard 
interception return by Keith Gory. Century finished the scoring with a 
touchdown in the game's final minute. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get our first win yet," Brown said. "And I won't be pleased until we 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Odoardi was a bright spot for the Centurions' offense, completing nine of 17 
passes for 204 yards, including three passes that went for more than 40 yards. 
He also intercepted one Bloomington pass from his cornerback position. MICHAEL 
ITAGAKI

LAGUNA HILLS MAKES PASSES COUNT

Steve Bresnahan, Laguna Hills High School football coach, wasn't pleased with 
quarterback Casey Sullivan's completion percentage Thursday night against 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
But he can't fault his quarterback for being unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, a transfer from St. Monica, completed only four of 11 passes for 108 
yards, but three completions were for touchdowns as the Hawks' offense came 
alive in the second half for a 26-7 victory at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, a 6-foot-3 senior, threw for two touchdowns in the second half as 
Laguna Hills outscored Garden Grove, 19-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey missed some plays too," Bresnahan said. "Those touchdowns were big 
plays, but we missed some (completions) we should have had." 
</P>
<P>
But Sullivan wasn't the Hawks' only scoring weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marwan Saba got into the act too, rushing for 189 yards in 37 
carries and catching a 16-yard touchdown pass from Sullivan in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks' defense held Garden Grove to 111 total yards -- including minus-28 
in the second half -- forced a safety and set up two touchdowns for the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense did a better job than last week (a 10-7 loss to San Clemente)," 
Bresnahan said. "But we still didn't play with a whole lot of enthusiasm 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove appeared to be in good shape offensively in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts (1-2) took a 7-0 lead with 1 minute 54 seconds left in the first 
quarter when quarterback Bob Ioja tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to his 
brother, Adrian. A 47-yard run by the Argonauts' Bob Rosa two plays earlier set 
up the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But Laguna Hills (2-1) answered on the ensuing possession when quarterback 
Casey Sullivan found tight end Kirk Brown wide open on the right side. Brown 
outraced two defenders for a 53-yard touchdown. Marc Brodbeck's extra point 
tied the score at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills wasted little time taking control in the second half. The Hawks 
took the opening possession 63 yards, capped by a 16-yard touchdown pass from 
Sullivan to Saba.

Even big plays can't draw big smiles from Pat Ward, Fullerton High School 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton improved to 3-0 after scoring 21 points in the fourth quarter 
Thursday night to defeat Alta Loma, 36-18, at Chaffey College. 
</P>
<P>
But the Indians' coach wasn't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a good football team at all," said Ward, in his first year at the 
school. "This was the worst football game we've played all year." A tricky 
lateral-and-pass play gave Alta Loma (1-2) an 18-15 lead at the end of the 
third quarter. Alta Loma quarterback Robert Church hit Alfie Gallegos with a 
long lateral, and then Gallegos heaved a 39-yard scoring pass to Rob Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Even David Chacon, who almost single-handedly brought Fullerton back from the 
brink, didn't escape criticism. Ward saw Chacon speaking to reporters after the 
game and told him: "Give them a few words, then get your butt off the field. 
You're not an NFL player." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, a 5-foot-9 cornerback and running back, erased the 18-15 deficit when 
he scooped up a punt blocked by teammate D.C. Olsen and scrambled 55 yards down 
the sideline for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon also picked off two passes, returning the second interception 54 yards 
for Fullerton's final score of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen blocked two punts, with the first setting up his own five-yard touchdown 
run in the third quarter. He also scored on a two-yard dive in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen carried 11 times for 59 yards. Reserve halfback James Peterson added a 
33-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.

LEWIS GETS QUICK START ON RETURN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nate Lewis, a big wide receiver from a little college, has been ripping it up 
for the Chargers on the kickoff return team. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that right, Coach Dan Henning? 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to me in November," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
But this is 5-foot-11, 197-pound rookie. And he's second in the AFC in 
returning kicks with a 25.8-yard average in five returns. A rookie . . . from 
Oregon Tech. 
</P>
<P>
"That's two games," General Manager Bobby Beathard said. "Wait until the end 
and see where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Conclusion. A kickoff return man isn't built in a fortnight. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at Cleveland, Lewis will attempt to close on Eric Metcalf, a darting, 
elusive running back who is atop the AFC with a 34.3-yard average in six 
returns. Metcalf went 98 yards for a touchdown last week against the Jets, 
which put him well ahead of Lewis in the return-average standings. Lewis 
returned one for a touchdown three weeks too early, swerving around the Rams 
for an 87-yarder in the second exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could count it," he said. "It's coming, though. One of these games 
I'll break one. I've just got to keep working." 
</P>
<P>
That's something he's good at. 
</P>
<P>
"Nate has taken this job very seriously," said Larry Pasquale, the Charger 
special teams coach. "He knows when to run and he knows when to take whatever 
he can get. There are times when the hole is supposed to be there and it isn't. 
He takes the extra five yards and that's it. He comes off the field and says 
'Coach, that's all I could get.' And I say 'That's fine. You did a great job.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Because he has caught on quickly, Lewis is being loaded up with more 
responsibility. He serves on the kickoff coverage team, the punt team and will 
be worked in on more plays at wide receiver this weekend. The Chargers are 
hoping to find a way to take pressure off wide receiver Anthony Miller, who 
sees more than his share of double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Miller was used on kickoff returns to boost a special teams unit 
that rarely did anything right. With Lewis around, Miller can concentrate on 
receiving and, with help from Lewis and another rookie, Walter Wilson, he may 
soon have help catching passes, too. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, for Lewis, there's nothing quite like the thrill of returning 
kickoffs. Big guys, coming at you full speed ahead trying to separate your 
helmet from your shoulders with or without your head, whichever is more 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about it," Lewis said. "Like they say, if you're scared, don't 
get back there. The guys up front do a good job. They stop that suicide 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pasquale: "I think it's sort of a combination. Nate is running the ball 
hard up the field. Guys are appreciating that and I think they're giving their 
best effort to make it work for him. And it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' journey to the NFL has been like returning a kick against 10 Pro Bowl 
players and King Kong. Before transferring to Oregon Tech, he played his 
sophomore and junior seasons at Georgia. After his junior season, he was 
declared academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief stop at Western Kentucky, where he found he was ineligible to 
play football, he chose Oregon Tech, which had a passing offense that made full 
use of his talents. 
</P>
<P>
He caught 27 passes for 434 yards as a senior. Not earth-shattering numbers, 
but impressive considering he hobbled through the season on a tender hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't really full speed most of the year, but he tried to play," Greg 
McMackin, his coach at Oregon Tech, said. "He would go out there and compete 
until he would start limping, and we wouldn't want to hurt him so we'd get him 
out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back, running hard, watching films on his day off, studying the game 
plan and hoping by November he'll be somebody worth talking about.

HE GETS GREAT RECEPTION;

His California license plates read "WEB-STAR," and they deliver a significant 
message about Webster Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after completing an outstanding career at San Diego State, Slaughter 
is the big-play man of the Cleveland Browns -- a player of Pro Bowl stature. He 
will pose big problems for the Chargers when they meet the Browns Sunday in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator, talked about the task of 
containing Webster, a 6-foot, 170-pounder whose 19-yard average per catch last 
season was the best in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a marvelous player," Lynn said. "He makes tough catches, he makes 
acrobatic catches, he makes catches in a crowd. He catches balls he should 
catch and he catches balls he shouldn't catch. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't a 4.2 guy (for 40 yards) -- only about 4.5 -- yet he's a deep threat, 
for several reasons. He has good timing with the quarterback (Bernie Kosar), he 
sets up the defenders well, and he explodes out of the break. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll talk trash with you, and that's part of his competitive nature. He's 
such a competitive guy that you can't let up on him. We'll probably double-team 
him a lot Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn called Slaughter and teammate Reggie Langhorne "probably the most 
underrated pair of receivers in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Charger cornerback Gill Byrd compared Slaughter to a former teammate, Wes 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a faster version of Chandler," Byrd said. "Wes had that knack of getting 
open all the time. Slaughter reminds me of him. He always knows where the 
defensive back is going to be, and he has great quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Gary Plummer said that when the Browns use a so-called gadget play, 
it's a good bet that Slaughter will be the key man. 
</P>
<P>
"They go to him for big yardage," Plummer said. "He'll run reverses and 
flea-flickers, and he'll catch halfback passes." 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Marty Bayless cited another side of Slaughter's competitive 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be a showboat," Bayless said. "As small as he is, he's not afraid to 
take a lick, and when he gets up, he'll let you know he's around. He'll show 
the ball in your face or pat you on the butt or something like that. He can get 
you teed off. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, though, he's an underrated receiver. He's deceptive. He'll put 
you to sleep, maybe take a play off, but on the next play he'll be in the end 
zone dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who will be 26 on Oct. 19, has reached the end zone 20 times since 
the Browns made him their second-round draft choice in 1986. He has caught 188 
passes for 3,164 yards, including six for 83 yards this season, after catching 
122 for 1,647 yards in two seasons at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a burner, but I can get by anybody," Slaughter said by telephone from 
Cleveland. "The 4.2 guys usually don't have good hands. I'm fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Fast enough, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
En route to leading the AFC in average per catch last year, Slaughter had 
receptions of 97, 80 and 77 yards. His 97-yarder against the Chicago Bears was 
a league high, and his 1,236-yard total set a club record. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who has been hampered this season by what he calls a tender knee, 
appeared close to his old self when he caught five passes against the New York 
Jets last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been basically nicked up since training camp," Slaughter said. "The only 
thing that will help is rest, and there's no time for that." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's physical problem is one of the reasons for the anemic production of 
the Browns' offense in their first two games, one of which they won. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as important as anybody we have," Coach Bud Carson said. "He made as many 
big plays last year as anybody in the league except maybe San Francisco. We 
need him 100%." 
</P>
<P>
One can grasp the degree of Slaughter's importance by the fact that many 
veteran observers consider him the Browns' best receiver since the days of Hall 
of Famer Paul Warfield, who retired in 1977. In an interesting twist, it was 
Warfield, then scouting, who recommended that the Browns draft Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
As good as he is on the football field, Slaughter's talents are anything but 
one-dimensional. In fact, he is so adept at playing a saxophone that he didn't 
even try out for football until his senior year at Franklin High School in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in the band," he said. "We were No. 1 in the nation in the music 
Olympics in Anaheim. I played alto sax, then I switched to tenor. I was no 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
"Then before my senior year, one of the coaches saw me in a pickup basketball 
game and asked me to come out for football. Even after I made the team, I 
stayed with the band. I just couldn't march at the games. 
</P>
<P>
"I still play the sax whenever I get a chance, but I miss it sometimes. I like 
jazz and top-40 pop." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of a football background, Slaughter was named to the 
all-conference team in his only high school season. Then he made such a good 
impression at San Joaquin Delta Junior College in Stockton that he received a 
flock of scholarship offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I narrowed it down to Illinois and San Diego State," he said. "I picked San 
Diego State because it was closer to home and it was warmer. I had great 
coaching there, and I worked with an excellent quarterback in Todd Santos. Todd 
and I had great rapport." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's musical bent doesn't end with tooting a saxophone, either. He and 
Eric Metcalf, the Browns' game-breaking running back, were featured at halftime 
of NBC's Thanksgiving Day game last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rapping, and Eric was dancing," Slaughter said. "The reviews were pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the gig was written for 10 Cleveland players, but eight failed to 
show up. Slaughter improvised. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter adapts so easily to situations that a former Cleveland columnist, Bob 
Kravitz, wrote recently, "He represents the very essence of cool. Cool shades. 
Cool duds. Cool car." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter is even cool when he recalls the two times he fell asleep at the 
wheel of his car. 
</P>
<P>
"In my rookie year, we watched a highlight film downtown at night," he said. "I 
left early because I was sleepy. All the way home, I kept nodding off, and 
finally I fell asleep and hit the stone divider on a bridge. The car was 
totaled. 
</P>
<P>
"The following year, when we broke camp, I was going home, and the same thing 
happened. Luckily, I just hit a couple of mail boxes and no damage was done." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Slaughter does things his way. A year ago, he dreamed up an idea so 
drastic in the NFL's eyes that it led to a new rule. Hereafter, all players on 
a team must wear solid-color shoes and all must be the same color. You might 
call it the Webster Slaughter Rule. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Monday night game in which he was to make his 97-yard reception, 
Slaughter painted his shoes orange and Metcalf did the same. Most of the Brown 
players were wearing shoes that were all or partially orange by the end the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We painted just about everybody's shoes one way or another," Slaughter said. 
"Nobody put a stop to it, so we kept on painting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're wearing white now, but we've been working on a secret plan, so don't be 
surprised if you see orange again."

MCKEON, HIS FUTURE SHAKY, TO DELIVER SPEECH TO OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jack McKeon, Padre vice president/baseball operations, has prepared an 
elaborate speech and will address his precarious position at noon today in a 
meeting with team chairman Tom Werner. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said McKeon plans to leave the organizational meeting knowing whether 
the Padre ownership will retain him or fire him once they find a successor. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what's going to happen in the meeting," McKeon said 
Thursday, "but I would think it would come up." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled four weeks ago, was designed to discuss the budget and 
the club's direction. Yet, with swirling speculation surrounding McKeon's 
future, and the club openly interviewing candidates for his job, McKeon intends 
to find out if he is wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre ownership group surreptitiously has hired Tal Smith as a consultant 
to conduct the front-office interviews. His services originally were sought by 
the new ownership group to appraise the club's value, but he was retained when 
the Padres decided that they wanted an independent party to recommend 
candidates for possible vacancies in the front office. Smith, who will attend 
today's meeting, had worked for the Padres for about seven years as a 
consultant, but was fired during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, who has one more year on his contract that will pay him $400,000, was 
toying with the idea of issuing an ultimatum, friends said, but decided that a 
speech would be the best approach, and has been preparing it for three days. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, according to sources, McKeon will review his accomplishments in 
his 10 years with the Padre organization, talk about the direction of the club, 
and close by asking if the ownership wants him to be part of the future. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how Werner will respond.

VERSATILITY A FACTOR IN MAYS' RELEASE

<P>
The Chargers on Thursday released punt returner Jerry Mays, signed wide 
receiver Ron Heard and then made plans to place Heard on injured reserve so 
they could fill his spot with wide receiver Scott Schwedes. 
</P>
<P>
Follow? 
</P>
<P>
Heard, a 5-10, 177-pound sixth-round pick of the Steelers, missed mini-camp and 
all but one day of training camp with a torn quadricep muscle. He remains 
unable to run at full speed, but is considered a promising prospect by General 
Manager Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
"We have pretty much decided to place him on injured reserve if we can work out 
a contract with Schwedes," Beathard said. "We gave Heard a tryout and he didn't 
run real good. He apparently has calcium deposits in his thigh, but he's a good 
enough prospect to give him a look." 
</P>
<P>
Heard received a call from the Chargers about 5 Tuesday night and was on a 6:55 
flight from Detroit to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not able to go full speed yet, and they understand my situation and are 
willing to work with me," Heard said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwedes, a 6-0, 182-pound second-round choice of the Dolphins in 1987, 
averaged 9.7 yards on 66 punt returns. He also caught 13 passes for 304 yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, a free agent rookie from Georgia Tech, returned seven punts for an 
average of 4.3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have received several calls from people across the country who 
have heard about the mysterious illness that has hit cornerback Gill Byrd's 
6-year-old son, Gill Jr. 
</P>
<P>
A truck driver from Ohio said the youngster's rising temperature and painful 
joints were similar to the symptoms experienced by his own child. Another man 
from Wisconsin said his daughter had been ill, and passed on information to 
Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Gill, Jr. has been released from Children's Hospital, but continues to have 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd said he hopes to hear results of a series of tests conducted earlier on 
his youngster today. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland "Dawg Pound" fans, who may elect to pitch dog bones at the Chargers 
on Sunday, take note: 
</P>
<P>
"I've eaten dog biscuits before," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "And I'm 
a Milk Bone type of guy. They're dry, but you know they're not bad." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will be playing in front of a sellout crowd Sunday, and the 
end-zone fans in Cleveland Stadium have developed a rowdy reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be much different than playing Arkansas in Fayetteville," Tolliver 
said. "They throw whiskey bottles, chili dogs, and maybe even a little Red Man 
chew every once in a while. They usually get you with a real nice spray. 
</P>
<P>
"So it can't be any tougher than Arkansas." T.J. SIMERS

A jury in Painesville, Ohio, recommended that cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren, 
40, be put to death for killing a family of five in a cult ritual. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted Aug. 29 of the 1989 slayings of the Dennis Avery family, which 
included children ages 15, 13 and 6. The bodies were uncovered in a Kirtland 
barn after a cult member notified authorities. A Lake County judge is to 
sentence Lundgren today. Lundgren had broken away from the Reorganized Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and took with him a following that 
believed he was a prophet chosen by God to lead the church.

Rep. John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, has driven with an 
expired Connecticut license for 16 months but plans to renew it "at the first 
opportunity," a spokesman for Rowland said. The 33-year-old congressman 
contended that the state Department of Motor Vehicles never sent him a renewal 
notice -- a claim the agency denied. Rowland's license expired in May, 1989, 
but the fact that he failed to renew it was not made public until the Hartford 
Courant checked motor vehicle records after receiving an anonymous tip.

High School in Colorado Springs, Colo., and even became a cheerleader, at which 
students said he did a good job.

Student reaction ranged from amused to angry or scared. Parents were just plain 
angry, school officials said. Charles Janloyames Daugherty, a 5-foot-9

CRISIS IN MIDDLE EAST SPARKS RUSH-HOUR PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 people protesting the U.S. deployment to the Middle East rallied at a 
busy downtown intersection Thursday afternoon, chastising what what they called 
the sole reason for American forces in Saudi Arabia: Oil. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush has created a drift towards war that will be tough to pull back 
from," said Rick Nadeau, one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"When American boys start coming home in body bags, then (Americans) will start 
questioning it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nadeau, former director of Greenpeace in San Diego and leader of an Aug. 24 
Mideast rally outside the Federal Building that drew more than 200, said 
Thursday's protest was the first show by a new San Diego umbrella group formed 
to oppose U.S. intervention in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Coalition for Peace in the Middle East, with members from 20 groups -- 
including the 1,200-member Peace Resource Center of San Diego and groups 
associated with the Greens, an environmental group -- was formed to push for 
withdrawal of U.S. troops in the Mideast, Nadeau said. 
</P>
<P>
During rush hour, the protesters stood on both sides of the entrance to 
California 163 at 11th Avenue and A Street, including a triangular median 
between the ramp to Interstate 5 and California 163 entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Diego police officers, who said they were concerned about the group's 
proximity to traffic, asked the protesters to move from the median, which they 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Nadeau said the deployment was "an ideal issue" to bring two causes -- 
environmental and peace activism -- together. 
</P>
<P>
"If we stay addicted to oil, we are going to have to go to war to get it," he 
said.

SCRIPPS REPORTS GROUNDBREAKING SEPTIC SHOCK STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life-threatening shock after bacterial infections occurs because a natural 
protein in the blood helps bacterial toxins bind to a specific site on the wall 
of infection-fighting cells, researchers in San Diego and New York have found. 
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest earlier ways in which doctors might eventually be able to 
block the cascade of chemical reactions that lead to septic shock. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that whatever basic research we've done will provide new opportunities 
for therapy in a disease where effective therapy has not been available," said 
Richard J. Ulevitch, a biochemist at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic. 
"The type of work that's required to take this research to a therapeutic stage 
is pretty clear now." 
</P>
<P>
Ulevitch was the chief author on one of two papers delineating the findings, 
which are published in today's edition of the journal Science. The lead author 
on the companion paper was Samuel Wright, a cell biologist at Rockefeller 
University in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Others involved in the work at Scripps were John Mathison, Peter Tobias and Dr. 
Ralph Schumann. Collaborators elsewhere included R.A. Ramos at Rockefeller; and 
S.R. Leong, G.W. Flaggs and P.W. Gray at Genentech Inc. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Septic shock occurs in 50,000 to 100,000 Americans every year, said Dr. John 
Harlan, chief of hematology at the University of Washington Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
It can occur after a primary bacterial infection or a secondary infection 
acquired after a patient has been hospitalized for cancer, AIDS, trauma or 
surgery. Characterized by plummeting blood pressure and organ failure, septic 
shock almost invariably leads to death once it reaches the advanced stages, 
Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big problem," Harlan said. "So any intervention that would reduce 
mortality is welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Molecular-level studies over the last few years have shown that, in infection 
with certain kinds of common bacteria, septic shock occurs because of 
endotoxins, fat-sugar molecules from the bacteria's cell wall, Ulevitch 
explained. This leads to an overabundance of a natural inflammatory chemical, 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF). A little bit of TNF at an infection site helps the 
body fight off the infection; too much produces septic shock. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until the Scripps/Rockefeller research published today that two 
key events preceding the release of TNF were known: 
</P>
<P>
* For the endotoxin to do its damage, it must first be bound chemically to a 
natural protein in the blood, which the researchers named lipopolysaccharide 
binding protein. 
</P>
<P>
* After they bind together, the combination molecule attaches to the outside of 
infection-fighting monocyte cells via a protein structure known as CD14. 
</P>
<P>
The function of this CD14 "receptor" protein had not been known before now. 
</P>
<P>
It is groundbreaking work to find out what such receptors do in the body, noted 
Ian Trowbridge, an immunologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these (receptor) molecules were characterized on the basis of 
structure and were thought to be important, but the real key over the last 
couple of years has been to try to find out what these molecules do," 
Trowbridge said. "And this is another example of something that's clearly of 
tremendous functional importance." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are clinical trials of drugs that would block TNF released by 
the body in response to bacterial endotoxins, Harlan noted. However, it would 
be better to block the process at a point before TNF is produced at all, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Scripps/Rockefeller work provides a preliminary target for a mechanism to 
do this, by using proteins called monoclonal antibodies to block either the 
lipopolysaccharide binding protein or the CD14 receptor itself. 
</P>
<P>
Finding effective ways to deal with septic shock is increasing in importance 
because of a marked increase over the last decade in septicemia, accumulation 
of bacteria in the blood that can lead to septic shock. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, fewer than 10% of infectious disease patients released from hospitals 
in the United States had a septicemia diagnosis. By 1987, that had risen to 
25%, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
Ulevitch said his current work is being watched closely by Johnson &amp; 
Johnson Co., which has an option on marketing rights to certain research 
developed at Scripps. But much of the basic science leading up to the current 
work was done under National Institutes of Health grants going as far back as 
1974.

HOSPITAL WORKERS APPROVE UNION; BALLOTS CONTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nurses, pharmacists, dietitians and other medical professionals at San Diego 
General Hospital have voted, 32-30, to form a union, but the outcome is 
uncertain because of three contested ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came at an election last Friday on whether the 87 employees eligible 
for membership should be represented by the California Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
However, a National Labor Relations Board investigation of the contested 
ballots will take at least another month, said Bob Petering, acting resident 
officer for the NLRB in San Diego. Management and employees disagree on whether 
the three persons who cast the ballots were eligible to participate in the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Once NLRB completes that investigation, final resolution of the union issue 
could be further delayed if either side contests the result or if protests 
about other aspects of the election are filed, Petering said. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly called Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, San Diego General is a 
Southeast San Diego facility that serves a largely poor community. It has had 
financial troubles since it was built in 1972, and last year was sold to a 
group of investors. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Molotsky, a union organizer, said employees at the hospital sought 
union help because of fears over continuing budget problems after its sale. In 
addition to salaries, other issues are potential layoffs and personnel policies 
such as the lack of a "career ladder" to give staff members incentive to stay, 
Molotsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that we're not going to make all the monetary gains we want, but 
we'll make some," said Vicki Cavataio, a nurse in the intensive care unit. "We 
need protection from whimsical policy applications." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital management declined to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to reserve judgment or comment until after the results of the 
challenges are handled by legal counsel," said Norm Martin, administrator and 
chief financial officer for the hospital.

OPPONENTS OF PLANNED LANDFILL FEAR CONTAMINATION OF GROUND WATER; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BUT FOR INDIANS OF THE CAMPO RESERVATION THE PROJECT IS A 
LAST-DITCH ECONOMIC CHANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nearly one year ago, Tribal Chairman Ralph Goff looked out his window at the 
inhospitable highlands that make up the Campo Indian Reservation and considered 
the promise of landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a whole lot you can do out here," he said, gesturing toward the 
15,000-acre reservation, one of the poorest corners of southeastern San Diego 
County, that is home to more than 200 Mission Indians. There isn't enough 
traffic to support a truck stop, he said. Bingo is an unlikely money-maker in 
that remote a locale. Trash, he said, is the reservation's best hope for 
economic survival. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all for it," he said of a proposal -- vehemently opposed by the 
surrounding community -- to build a landfill on Indian land. "We'll make sure 
it's done right." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Goff stands on the brink of getting his way. Earlier this month, the Campo 
Band of Mission Indians contracted with an Ohio waste management company to 
build a 600-acre landfill and trash recycling plant worth $15 million to $22 
million on their land. 
</P>
<P>
The tribe has begun the process of obtaining approval from the U.S. Bureau of 
Indian Affairs. And if all goes as planned, the dump will begin accepting up to 
3,000 tons of trash a day by mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Mid-American Waste Systems Inc., a 5-year-old 
Columbus-based company, gains the rights to operate the landfill until it is 
full of 30 million tons of waste -- probably about 40 years. In return, said a 
spokesman for the tribe, the Indians will receive a "substantial" up-front 
payment, monthly royalties once the plant is built and first dibs on jobs at 
the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"Full employment is a primary goal for the tribe, and we think there will be a 
job for everyone that wants one," said Kevin Gover, an Albuquerque-based lawyer 
who is representing the Campo tribe. He refused to specify how much money the 
tribe will receive, but said, "We think there will be sufficient revenue going 
to the tribe to allow (it) to build a viable economic base." 
</P>
<P>
The signing of the contract comes as several San Diego County landfills are 
nearing capacity, sending civic leaders scrambling to find new sites. The city 
and county of San Diego have included the Campo reservation on a list of 10 
possible sites to replace the Miramar, Sycamore and Otay landfills. All three 
are expected to close within a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also comes amid a battle over a controversial bill, sponsored by 
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego), that would require some Indian 
tribes to abide by strict state regulations when planning garbage dumps on 
their sovereign lands. Sovereignty places the land outside the jurisdiction of 
the county, the state and even the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed the Legislature last month, would require state 
intervention only in cases where there is reason to believe there would be a 
"spill-over" effect on surrounding non-Indian land. But even Peace's chief of 
staff, David Takashima, predicts the bill will be vetoed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that the odds are at this point against this," Takashima said. 
"But there's always a glimmer of hope." 
</P>
<P>
All this comes as a blow to Donna Tisdale, a rancher who lives within view of 
the proposed dump site. For more than a year, as the Campo tribe has considered 
various bids from several waste management companies, Tisdale and dozens of her 
neighbors have fought tirelessly to protect their ground water by trying to 
block plans for a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Tisdale and her neighbors -- and the Mission Indians themselves -- are 
completely dependent on well water. The nearest water district is in Alpine, 
about 40 miles west. So protecting that water has become a labor of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Tisdale has talked to Mike Patton, a vice president at Mid-American Waste 
Systems. She has heard him describe the safety precautions his company takes to 
prevent the leeching of toxics into the water table -- from multiple protective 
liners to methane detection systems to ground water monitoring. She has heard 
the claims that this will be the best, most state-of-the-art landfill in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't impress us at all," she said flatly. She has done her homework on 
Patton's company, she says, and is concerned that of its 14 landfills in five 
states, the company bought 13 already built -- so the Campo landfill would be 
only the second fully constructed by Mid-American. 
</P>
<P>
Patton confirmed that, but said the company's reputation and track record is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
"We take very good care of the communities that we're in and very good care of 
the environment," he said. "We use the best available technology. We don't risk 
contaminating the water." 
</P>
<P>
Patton confirmed that, in keeping with the Indians' claim to full sovereignty 
for the lands, neither his company nor the tribe will apply for state or local 
government permits to build the waste facility. But he said the landfill will 
exceed federal and state environmental standards and called the dump's 
opponents uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not fully aware of what can be done," he said. "I'm not going to 
contend that any (protective) liner in the world is foolproof, because it's 
not. Nothing is guaranteed. But you don't have all your assets riding on one 
safety factor. There is more than one line of defense." 
</P>
<P>
Gover, the tribe's lawyer, said that one-quarter of the money the tribe 
receives will be used to regulate the landfill and to ensure it is built and 
run in accordance with strict environmental safeguards. Economically desperate, 
he said, the Indians have come to this solution after much soul-searching. But 
they are determined to execute it well. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if there were some (other) sort of venture that was viable, it would 
require capital to start," Gover said. "We could not find another industry that 
was willing to come in and capitalize up front other than the waste industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The tribe considered many options. They come to it with great reluctance and a 
sense of regret that this was what they have to do to develop an economy on 
their reservation," he said. "But if this is what we have to do, we sure as 
hell are going to do it right."

CHARGES OF BIAS BRING CALL FOR PROBE OF CARLSBAD HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A member of an advisory board to the county office of education is requesting 
an investigation into charges of discrimination at Carlsbad High School, based 
on reports that Latino students have been routinely singled out for 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to county Supt. Thomas Boysen on Wednesday, Roberto Martinez, a 
member of the Latino Advisory Committee of the office of education and a 
well-known activist in the county, said he had received complaints from Latino 
and immigrant students who claimed that they have been unduly harassed by 
campus security and receive harsher discipline than white students. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that with the Latino dropout rate being what it is, near 50%, 
that these kids aren't being given a fair chance or an equal education and 
we're going to lose them," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said six Carlsbad High students talked to him in April about their 
complaints, which include overcrowded English as a Second Language classes and 
harassment by campus security at sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
"Security watches them more than white kids," Martinez said. "If several white 
kids are standing in a group, security won't do anything. But if several Latino 
kids stand together, they separate them or kick them off the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
One of the youths, Adrian Hidalgo, said that assistant principal Kevin Edwards 
had accused him of having a gun in his locker, even though Hidalgo insisted 
that he did not even have a locker. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me not to talk about the gun with anybody except my family," Hidalgo 
said. "Then he threatened me, said he would kick me out of Carlsbad High School 
if I told anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said he is both outraged and frustrated by the accusations made against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged because of the lack of substance of these allegations," Edwards 
said. "I'm still faced with the same set of circumstances where I am obligated 
to provide the confidentiality of the situation. I wish I could say something 
about it, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said he welcomed an investigation as an opportunity to give his side of 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of this kind of investigation because I believe I will have an 
opportunity sometime to share what is really at the bottom of this," Edwards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that it's not the first time that Carlsbad Unified has been 
tainted by accusations of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I have received previous complaints from Anglo parents who said that the 
schools in Carlsbad are being segregated," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the district considered, but then withdrew a proposal that would 
have transferred white students to two predominantly Latino elementary schools 
from a school that was 85.5% white. 
</P>
<P>
The district is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's 
office for civil rights for possible violations in connection with its 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I will ask the county office of education to specifically to look into 
Carlsbad High School as well as any of the schools that we feel discriminate 
against Hispanic children in Carlsbad," Martinez said. "We're prepared to go 
all the way, whatever that means." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's request for an investigation will be considered at the next meeting 
of the Latino Advisory Committee on Oct. 22.

3 MEXICANS ARRESTED IN HEAD SHAVING AND ROBBERY OF MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police arrested three Mexican men Thursday who they believe shave the 
heads and destroy the clothes of illegal immigrants when they can't pay a 
smuggler to be ferried farther north. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, all Mexican citizens, were arrested after an illegal immigrant 
who had just had his head shaved flagged down a passing police car and led the 
officers to the house where it happened, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
All three were booked into County Jail on suspicion of robbery and assault with 
a deadly weapon and are being held in lieu of $25,000 bail, a jail spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They are Romero Montecinos Varcenas, 30; Martin de la Cruz Sanchez, 23, and 
Geraldo Ortiz Perez, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe Thursday's incident is tied to a string of seven 
similar assaults where undocumented immigrants have reported being taken to a 
house somewhere in San Diego, being robbed, having their heads shaved and then 
having their trousers ripped apart. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to humiliate them so that any smuggler who sees them says, 'I'm not going 
to transport this guy, he doesn't pay,' " said Sgt. Art Palmer. "The word's out 
on the street that if you see a guy with a shaved head, he made an arrangement 
with a smuggler to smuggle him and then wouldn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
When officers went into the house, 60 other illegal immigrants were found 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a drop house," Palmer said. Carloads of illegal immigrants are smuggled 
across the border, he said, and taken to the house, where financial 
arrangements are made to farm them out to other smugglers who can take them 
north. 
</P>
<P>
But those who have no money, instead of simply being put out to make their own 
way, are "marked" by the head shaving and ripped trousers. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests pleased local activists, who say the head shaving is just another 
indignity heaped on the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"These are sick thrill seekers getting their kicks out of humiliating people," 
said Roberto Martinez, head of the American Friends Service Committee in San 
Diego, a Quaker service organization. "These migrant workers are subjected to 
so much humiliation as it is, and to add this on top of it is just sick." 
</P>
<P>
Police say they were able to make the arrests Thursday because 20-year-old 
Javier Garcia Robles of Juarez, Mexico, came running out of a house at 42nd and 
Market streets with his head shaved and flagged down officers Jack Knish and 
Kurt Grube, who were patrolling in their police cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
The men in the house had tried to take money from Robles but when they found 
out he didn't have any, they shaved his head, cut off his trouser legs and were 
getting ready to dump him somewhere in San Diego when he managed to escape, 
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Two barber shop-type electrical shavers were found in the house. The illegal 
immigrants were turned over to U.S. Border Patrol agents, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police were also able to track down four other immigrants from Mexico 
who had apparently been victimized at the same house. 
</P>
<P>
The four, who had their heads shaved, had been picked up by Border Patrol 
agents Wednesday night after being dumped off in Chula Vista wearing nothing 
but their underwear. They were sent back to Mexico, and at the Mexican 
immigration office in Tijuana, San Diego Police Lt. Raul Bejarano, who was 
handling other police business, noticed them. 
</P>
<P>
The men are scheduled to be returned to San Diego to testify in the case, 
Robinson said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A GOOD DEAL, IF IT DOESN'T BACKFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one rather remarkable day this week, two of San Diego's most longstanding 
environmental disputes ended in compromises that left just about everyone 
involved satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Consummation of the long-delayed negotiations to preserve the Famosa Slough in 
Ocean Beach is testament to the staying power of a handful of dedicated 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to allow construction of the 3,360-home Miramar Ranch North 
housing project near Scripps Ranch -- also an apparent win for area residents, 
environmentalists, the developer and City Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt -- 
raises some long-term considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year battle over Miramar Ranch North is one of those intra-community 
issues that proves that all politics are local. Before this garden-variety 
community-versus-developer struggle over the undeveloped hills on Miramar 
Lake's north shore ended, it had served as a rallying point for the city's 
environmental movement, which drew strength from the successful 1989 
grass-roots campaign to stop the original project. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed environmental group helped defeat entrenched pro-development 
City Councilman Ed Struiksma and elect his opponent Linda Bernhardt, 
transforming the balance of power on the council. And now the new agreement is 
sure to become one of Bernhardt's top issues as she attempts to avoid a recall 
motivated by her role in the city's recent reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
The good news: Developer McMillin-BCED will build schools and parks and a badly 
needed east-west route between Poway and Interstate 15. Only 80 homes will be 
visible from the lake. Housing around the lake will be much less dense than 
first planned. 
</P>
<P>
Credit goes to the Save Miramar Lake Committee for hanging tough, then 
compromising when it wrested the best deal possible; to Bernhardt for keeping 
the pressure on McMillin; to McMillin for continuing to seek a deal, and to the 
city for finding a way out of a lawsuit filed by McMillin. 
</P>
<P>
But one city concession is troubling. In the agreement, the city gave McMillin 
as much as $24 million in credits toward citywide impact fees that it hasn't 
enacted yet. 
</P>
<P>
How many other developers will seek trade-offs on such fees -- if they are 
enacted next month -- in return for concessions? Will the city find itself 
tempted to trade fees that would pay for citywide infrastructure in favor of 
badly needed local facilities such as schools and parks? 
</P>
<P>
Officials involved say those concessions were a one-time-only deal. That 
posture is a wise one.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR WHOM DO THESE ROADS TOLL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists stuck in Orange County traffic tie-ups who have yearned for alternate 
routes will soon have some -- if they are willing to pay the price. Within the 
next several years there may be no fewer than five new freeways to help ease 
the traffic crunch, although "free" is hardly the apt designation for the 
relief roads. The proposed routes will be toll roads, available to drivers at a 
price every time they use them. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the San Joaquin Hills, Eastern and Foothill Transportation 
corridors, which will be built with public funds, were approved as toll roads. 
Last week, the state approved two more toll roads for Orange County, one 10 
miles along the median strip of the Riverside Freeway from the Costa Mesa 
Freeway to the Riverside County line, and the other 11.2 miles down the middle 
of the Santa Ana River from the Santa Ana Freeway to the Corona del Mar 
Freeway. In a rare public-private partnership, they will be built on public 
land by private consortiums that will deed them to the state and then lease 
them back. The builders will charge a toll to cover their costs and profit. No 
federal or state funds are to be spent on the projects, which must still pass 
environmental muster. 
</P>
<P>
Charging tolls is one way to build needed traffic lanes given the shortage of 
federal, state and local road funds and county residents' refusal to vote 
additional local taxes for road and transit projects. But the private tollways 
must truly be "private" roads that don't wind up raiding the public treasury to 
bail out builders if the roads don't turn out to be the routes to revenue that 
they expect. They must also be affordable to use. Although the two new toll 
roads are less public than the others, public rights of way are still involved 
and the tolls should not be set so high that they become economic roadblocks 
that keep middle- and lower-income motorists from using them. Most of the toll 
roads opened around the nation recently have set tolls between eight and nine 
cents per mile. Tolls on the new Orange County roads are expected to range from 
10 to 20 cents a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Will Orange County motorists pay that price and turn out in enough numbers to 
make the roads profitable? That is the gamble the consortiums are taking. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Orange County residents continue to balk at paying higher taxes for 
road improvements, it seems reasonable and fitting that they have the option of 
paying for more roads with a direct user fee. But if they reject that, too, it 
must be the private sector for whom the bill tolls.

Upstaged: Joan Collins returned to the London theater in Noel Coward's "Private 
Lives," only to leave the audience and the critics raving about a supporting 
performer, Sara Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
"A star is born and steals the show from Joan Collins," The Daily Mail said 
after the Wednesday-night opening at the Aldwych Theater. Critic Jack Tinker 
said Crowe "gave this show's most bankable star a runaway lesson in the 
essential elements of a classic Coward performance." How was Crowe taking it? 
Said her publicist: "How would you like to be known as the actress who upstaged 
Joan Collins?" Collins, 57, was last on the London stage a decade ago. BETH

'GoodFellas' on the Streets: Pirated video copies of "GoodFellas" were being 
sold on the streets of New York last week before the new Warner Bros. film ever 
hit the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Warner Bros. has started bringing civil suits against video 
outlets. The first was filed this week against a Bronx video retailer. A court 
order also allows for the seizure of any pirate cassettes of "GoodFellas" in 
the New York area. Investigative units of the Motion Picture Assn. of America 
and a private investigation firm are searching for pirate copies. BETH KLEID

A Dry Run: An avant-garde theater company was ordered to stop performing "The 
Cardinal Detoxes" or face eviction by the landlord: the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of New York. The play by Thomas M. Disch, drama critic of The 
Nation, is a 35-minute monologue about an archbishop who has been placed in a 
church-run detoxification center because he has killed a pregnant woman in an 
auto accident while driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
According to the church, the RAPP Theater Co. agreed in its lease not to 
present such works in the building, a former parochial school. But R. Jeffrey 
Cohen, the theater company's founder and artistic director, called the 
archdiocese's threat an attempt at censorship and promised to fight it in 
court. BETH KLEID

Waiting for Godfather: Movie buffs who've been waiting 16 years for another 
entry in Francis Coppola's "Godfather" series will have a to wait a little bit 
longer for "The Godfather, Part III." Paramount Pictures has moved the opening 
date of the film from Nov. 21 to Christmas Day. The $50-million-plus gangster 
epic, which reunites Coppola with stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, was shot in 
Italy and New York last winter and spring and recently went back into 
production for two weeks of additional shooting. BETH KLEID

'DON'T TELL HER IT'S ME' COULD USE TALENT BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Don't Tell Her It's Me (citywide) is so dreadful you have to wonder what such 
established players as Steve Guttenberg, Jami Gertz, Shelley Long and Kyle 
MacLachlan, in accepting this script, have turned down that could have been any 
worse. The same goes for director Malcolm Mowbray, best known for "A Private 
Function," one of the funniest British comedies of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
What was it that attracted these talented people to Sarah Bird's adaptation of 
her novel "The Boyfriend School?" In his initial scenes, Guttenberg is 
virtually unrecognizable -- thanks to Andy Schoneberg's special makeup effects 
-- as a pale, puffy, overweight, completely bald young cartoonist named Gus who 
is recovering from Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor his romance-novelist sister Lizzie (Long) are shown to be aware 
that it is a kind of miracle that he has survived. Instead, Gus is feeling 
sorry for himself for his temporarily unattractive appearance. Meaning to cheer 
him up, Lizzie introduces him to Gertz's Emily, a journalist who is doing an 
article on her. Given Gus' bad toupee and Emily's ignorance of his illness, she 
is understandably unimpressed, but it's love at first sight for Gus and Lizzie 
sets about whipping him back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
In due time Gus regains his pre-disease appearance, but that's not enough for 
the inventive Lizzie. She insists that he must pass himself off as a dashing 
New Zealand biker, complete with Kiwi accent and long hair, in order to sweep 
Emily off her feet. 
</P>
<P>
Enough already. Surely you get the idea by now that "Don't Tell Her It's Me," 
which wastes its beautiful Charleston, S.C., settings as surely as it does its 
actors, is a mite contrived. Worse than that, it's cruel and stupid at 
virtually every turn. What do we make of Lizzie, a mother who calls her young 
daughter "Piglet"? 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, furthermore, the child (played by Caroline and Sally Lund, 
apparently identical twins) is nearly mute when her mother spells out in 
clinical detail the potentially fatal consequences of her every act of childish 
curiosity. Why is Emily made to seem so dumb as to not see through the 
transparent caddishness of her editor (MacLachlan)? Why ever was this 
pointless, tasteless film made in the first place? 
</P>

GRACE UNDER PRESSURE IN THE WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Cry in the Wilderness" ( Beverly Connection) is a fine family film, an 
appealing survival-in-the-wilderness saga of much natural beauty and minimal 
sentimentality. Young Jared Rushton capably carries the film almost entirely by 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
As he boards a small plane bound for a Canadian forest where his father works 
on an oil rig, Brian Robeson (Rushton), who is nearly 13, is handed a hatchet 
in a leather holster as a goodby gift from his mother (Pamela Sue Martin). 
Little does she realize that she has given her son a tool that could spell the 
difference between his life and death. For shortly after takeoff, the plane's 
bleary-eyed, unshaven pilot (Ned Beatty, in a good cameo) suffers a fatal heart 
attack. Very swiftly Brian finds himself crash-landed in a remote lake. 
</P>
<P>
Bright and sturdy, he soon learns to trust to instinct and logic in his 
struggle for survival. Adapted by Gary Paulsen and Catherine Cyran from 
Paulsen's prize-winning novel "Hatchet," "A Cry in the Wilderness" gains 
dimension through its deft flashbacks in which we discover that Brian's parents 
have recently divorced, leaving him confused and bitter. The urgent matters of 
food, shelter and defense against predatory animals allow Brian to gain 
perspective toward his troubled emotional state. Rage and fear gradually give 
way to resourcefulness and resilience; Brian finds he has little time for 
self-pity and learns to take pleasure in his growing mastery of his 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Mark Griffiths with gracefulness and a sense of commitment, "A Cry 
in the Wilderness" reflects imagination, thoughtfulness and sound judgment from 
start to finish. Brian's predicament is made completely credible yet is not 
presented in such a harsh light as to terrify small children. Yet the very real 
dangers he confronts are not glossed over; Brian may be surrounded by glorious 
forests and mountain ranges, but he has not landed in some benign Garden of 
Eden. There are so few films even remotely suitable for kids anymore that "A 
Cry in the Wilderness" (rated PG because a few scenes may be too intense for 
toddlers) is especially welcome.

'NARROW MARGIN'S' THRILL IS DURING ITS TRAIN-TOP CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Narrow Margin"(selected theaters) is a rip-roaring movie if you like train 
chases -- or smoke. If you like a growing attraction between consulting adults; 
nice, salty or even unsalty banter, or any sense of richness of character you'd 
be better off home with a good Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hyams is writer, director and cinematographer here, reworking Richard 
Fleischer's 1952 B-movie suspense classic. In this, Carol Hunnicut (Anne 
Archer), a recently divorced publishing company editor with an off-screen young 
son, lets herself be fixed up on a blind date with hot-shot lawyer Michael 
Tarlow (J. T. Walsh). 
</P>
<P>
In a decidedly marginal device for this day and age, he invites her up to his 
hotel suite, pre-dinner, while he picks up an important phone call and, wonder 
of wonders, she goes. It is a lovely suite; what it has in common with the 
movie's other interiors, district attorneys' workmanlike offices, club cars, 
tiny Canadian railroad stations or remote mountain cabins is that it's filled 
with this darn smoke. 
</P>
<P>
We probably have Ridley Scott to thank for the popularity of this effect, in 
movies like "The Duellists" or "Blade Runner" it made perfect sense. But 
"Narrow Margin" (rated R, apparently for violence) is nothing if not a 
hard-edge train thriller and to swathe it in so much atmospheric murk that 
audiences are going to suspect the premature arrival of cataracts seems 
counterproductive, at the very least. 
</P>
<P>
Archer freshens up interminably in that hotel bathroom, enough for her date to 
be dispatched by his gangland associates and for her to witness it, unseen. 
Terrified, she leaves for a remote Canadian cabin, tracked by a resolute L.A. 
deputy district attorney, Robert Caulfield (Gene Hackman), determined to 
persuade her to come back and testify. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin is less safe than anyone -- but the audience -- imagined it would be, 
and the chase is on. Hackman and Archer manage to get on a train winding 
through the spectacular Canadian Rockies, but so do two of the baddies. At 
least two, although just which one of the passengers or crew might also be 
involved is part of the suspense. The other part is that the mobsters still 
aren't sure what Archer looks like, leading to possible confusion with another 
attractive passenger (Susan Hogan), desperate to pick up the unattached 
Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
Hackman, who's never without his wire-rimmed glasses nor his consummate, 
incorruptible professionalism as a D.A., dodges, distracts, shoots and even 
debates with the mobsters, led by the urbane, bearded James B. Sikking. There 
are few actors around better at steely small talk than Hackman, but what he 
can't do is breathe a breath of life into his supposedly deepening 
conversations with Archer; it's simply not there on the page. At one low level 
in script common sense, Hackman even appropriates a toy gun from a pint-size 
fellow passenger, coaxing the boy in a conversation that would have been 
overheard by everyone else in the sleeping car -- villains included. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is the train chase, and it's a beaut. All very well in his 
action thrillers to have Sean Connery leaping from car to car -- somehow that's 
part of the territory. Hackman we've followed through some pretty hairy 
physical action, from Popeye Doyle on out. But Anne Archer is the 
quintessential us up there, riveted to the spot or looking sensibly terrified 
in some of the undoubled scenes on top of the train. This stuff is marvelous, 
and there isn't a wisp of smoke in sight.

GOLDBLUM RISES ABOVE 'THE TALL GUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Goldblum has been in better movies than "The Tall Guy" but he's never been 
funnier. 
</P>
<P>
As Dexter King, an expatriate American actor in London, Goldblum has the 
agility and the bug-eyed apprehension of a great clown. With the exception of 
Steve Martin, Goldblum is probably the best physical comic actor in the movies. 
It's not just that his movements are a surprise to us. They look like they're a 
surprise to him, too. Goldblum is constantly perking himself into new realms of 
neuromuscular amazements. It's like watching a one-man slapstick ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter has been loitering for years as the straight man to a hyper-obnoxious 
comic, Ron Anderson (Rowan Atkinson), whose West End revue is a grab bag of 
low-grade music hall vaudeville. Seized on stage by an uncontrollable case of 
hay fever, Dexter falls in love with the tart nurse (Emma Thompson) who gives 
him his allergy shots. Revivified, he ditches the revue and finds new 
employment -- as the lead in a serious musical version of "The Elephant Man" 
entitled "Elephant!" 
</P>
<P>
What keeps "The Tall Guy" (selected theaters) consistently amiable is the 
affection the filmmakers have for the rowdy, posturing life of the theater. 
Director Mel Smith and screenwriter Richard Curtis have written and performed 
together on the stage and on television (most notably on the BBC's "Not the 
Nine O'Clock News"), and they work up a series of satirical jibes at everything 
from Benny Hill-style low comedy to Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals. 
</P>
<P>
The "Elephant!" stuff, for example, isn't just a one-joke idea. Smith and 
Curtis actually stage a half dozen numbers, including the finale, where a 
chorus chants "Somewhere up in heaven is an angel with big ears." As satire of 
the musical theater, the "Elephant!" sequences rival Mel Brooks' "Springtime 
for Hitler" numbers in "The Producers." 
</P>
<P>
If the rest of the film (rated R for nudity and mild sexual situations) had 
been up to this level of invention, it might have been a classic. But there are 
a lot of wayward, misfired jokes, good ideas that aren't timed well, bad ideas 
that aren't timed well. Smith loses his comic touch whenever he ventures 
outside the music hall -- his take-off on Richard Lester's movie shenanigans is 
particularly woozy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Goldblum (literally) towers above it all. With his long limbs, he is as 
lithe as a katydid and matched well with Emma Thompson, whose no-nonsense 
crispness almost succeeds in making British hauteur seem sexy. It's probably no 
accident that Goldblum's most popular part was the title role in "The Fly." He 
has a buggy, off-kilter quality that makes him perfect for roles of surpassing 
oddness. That's why he is a great Elephant Man, too. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe someone should consider making the musical for real. Just make sure it 
stars Goldblum and that it's a comedy.

VOCAL GYMNASTICS UNDERCUT MORGANA KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morgana King may be the most stylized singer this side of Betty Carter. The 
veteran performer's opening night set at the Cabaret at the Improv Wednesday 
night underscored the utter uniqueness of her style, as well as some of its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sticking closely to standards like "The Lady Is a Tramp," "Easy Living" and her 
trademark pieces, "Lazy Afternoon" and "A Taste of Honey," King sang with a 
characteristic mixture of quirky oddities and rhythmic virtues. 
</P>
<P>
Her up-tempo rhythm pieces were direct and on the mark. Despite a physical 
tendency toward tense grimacing when she got into a swinging groove, there was 
no denying the momentum and sheer energy of her vocal drive. 
</P>
<P>
But King spent far more time -- as she always has -- soaring up into nasally, 
almost whistling head tones. The effect, on first hearing, was dramatically 
impressive, one of the most singular sounds in jazz vocals. But the impact soon 
faded away, in direct proportion to her tendency to overuse the technique on 
the climax of virtually every number. 
</P>
<P>
One kept hoping for a more equitable balance -- of the sort that was apparent 
on pieces like "Give Me the Simple Life" and "Corcovado," in which her superb 
rhythmic faculties received up-front, prominent display. As audience-pleasing 
as her soprano gymnastics may be, King would be a vastly better-grounded, more 
broadly effective performer if she balanced them with a larger helping of her 
even more forceful jazz skills. DON HECKMAN

STAGE BEAT: HAMPTON'S EARLY TREATISE ON THE BATTLES OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Hampton is several playwrights in one. He writes of complex 
political conundrums ("Savages," "The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H."). He 
adapts, with finesse, foreign classics ("Tales From the Vienna Woods," "The 
Wild Duck"). 
</P>
<P>
And he explores how people use each other in a sexual food chain ("Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses," another adaptation). The progenitor of the sly "Liaisons" is 
Hampton's 1976 play about contemporary young Londoners, "Treats," at the Rose 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The prey is Ann, played with wavering accent but Glenda Jackson-like fortitude 
by Lucy Boryer. She has discarded her rapacious boyfriend, Dave (Michael 
Wallenstein), for a rather limp alternative named Patrick (Donald Robinson 
Gordon). But only the strong survive in "Treats." Dave, never one to accept a 
simple "no," verbally bullies Patrick into submission. 
</P>
<P>
The tables are turned, with perfect Hampton symmetry, and Patrick becomes the 
outsider trying to get back in. This is delicious sexual battling, even if the 
young Hampton stacked the deck too neatly in Dave's favor. Patrick never has a 
chance (Gordon lays his neuroses bare with delirious precision), though 
Wallenstein's Dave isn't quite the gobbling big fish he should be. Ferdinand 
Lewis' production, while only just competent, serves up "Treats" with all the 
cynical trimmings intact. 
</P>
<P>
 At 318 Lincoln Blvd., Venice, on Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until 
Sept. 29. $12; (213) 288-6834.

'Devil's Advocate' at Celebration 
</P>
<P>
Talk about cynical. Giancarlo Stampalia's "Devil's Advocate," at the 
Celebration Theatre, takes Hollywood at face value -- as a town where the only 
ones who matter are the ones who survive. The rest might as well be at the 
bottom of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
That is where super-agent and lawyer Joseph Winterowd (Christopher Nixon) has 
deposited one of his victims, but he is more accustomed to fashioning 
associates' lives than he is to killing them. His big plans for future star 
Gregory Dane (Kevin Kildow) include major billing and keeping Dane's gay life 
style in the closet. Winterowd's trusty accomplice (Carolyn Kimball) provides 
her less-than-zero daughter (Catherine Davis Cox) as Dane's wife. But 
Winterowd's ex, Katherine (Sarah Lilly) is about to screw up the works. 
</P>
<P>
Stampalia's formula is film noir, just as the formula for his previous 
"Gentleman's Gentleman" was Wildean comedy. He's a good enough writer not to 
need any form but his own, yet he revels in noir here, as if James M. Cain were 
re-writing John Webster. 
</P>
<P>
He directs that way, too: Few scenes are longer than a minute, but, thanks to a 
disciplined pacing with sharp blackouts, they collectively build up a sense of 
inescapable evil. Nixon has the surest grasp of this, while Kildow is an ideal 
innocent. The women uneasily sway between campy and serious. 
</P>
<P>
 At 426 N. Hoover St., on Sept. 25, Oct. 2-3, 9-10. $5; (213) 666-8669.

'Sunday Show' With The Groundlings 
</P>
<P>
Like a ballclub with a major league outfit and a farm system to support it, The 
Groundlings have a first team that plays prime time and a second unit on 
Sundays. The idea is to groom the Sunday group before they move up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
But the current "Sunday Show" has it all over the Friday-Saturday "Full Frontal 
Groundlings." Even with the usual caveat emptor -- that the line-up of skits 
and improvs changes from week to week -- director Cathy Shambley's current 
bunch of Groundlings is one of the best in some time. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the evening relies on written, well-honed scenes, leaving the 
brief improvs to the end. Things start off strong with "New Kids on the Eastern 
Bloc" and stay strong. TV, as usual, is a big source: "Wide World of Sports" 
anchors host a party as if they're still on the air; a product to promote chest 
hair growth is pitched; a "Baywatch" lampoon "rescues" a female audience 
member. 
</P>
<P>
The show is also aware that there's life beyond TV: out-of work lawyers, like 
undocumented workers, flag down clients on the street; stylish luncheoners 
contend with enormous slices of watermelon; male and female celibates find true 
love. This is a bright 14-member ensemble, but the guiding light is the 
writing, led by Carolyn Omine, Michael Caldwell, Mike Hitchcock, Jim Wise and 
Vic Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7307 Melrose Ave., on Sundays, 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $11; (213) 
934-9700.

'Double Double' at Tiffany Theatre 
</P>
<P>
L.A. has its trademark TV-oriented theater, New York has its trademark 
overproduced, empty extravaganzas, and London's West End has its trademark 
actor-oriented genre pieces. "Sleuth" is an example, and "Double Double," by 
Eric Elice and actor Roger Rees, is "Sleuth's" banal stepchild. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason a show like this exists is to make money, but the unevenness of 
Claudia A. Weitsman's Tiffany Theatre production makes you wonder if that can 
happen. The heart of the problem is Nicole Orth-Pallavicini as a just-widowed 
woman who claims to a picked-up stranger (Rudolph Willrich) that she needs him 
to stand in for her dead husband so she can collect on his trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
What's the problem? Orth-Pallavicini can't make her widow sound the least bit 
sincere, undercutting the plot's credibility at every turn. Several turns 
later, even the plot goes blotto as Elice and Rees desperately try to wrap 
things up. David Scaglione's set shakes a lot from the action, but Willrich 
stands his ground as a man of surprising cleverness.

7 Characters an Hour in 'Crying Out Loud' 
</P>
<P>
Is an hour enough time for one actor to dig inside seven distinct characters? 
Madeleine Comora's and Mariangela Pino's "For Crying Out Loud" suggests not; 
but as actress Pino announced before the performance, she and Comora are asking 
for audience comments. 
</P>
<P>
So it's still in progress, like these women. Except for Margaret, an 
Englishwoman obsessed with death and disaster, and Alyce, a homeless Vietnam 
War veteran, they're profiles in courage -- or at least a courageous exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Pino is best at allowing the tough mask to fall away to show the underlying 
loneliness or hurt. She can cover a range of dialects, though the sheer number 
of them threatens to turn the show into a showcase. Comora and Pino, with 
director Aled Davies, need to decide which women to flesh out more, and which 
to leave aside for another play.

Thomas F. Bradac, artistic director of the financially troubled Grove 
Shakespeare Festival, got a bundle of good news Wednesday afternoon when his 
wife, Anne, gave birth to a 9 lb., 8 oz. daughter at Kaiser Permanente Medical 
Center in Anaheim. They've named her Caitlin. Bradac was called out of a 
meeting Tuesday morning about the Grove's cash problems to take his wife to the 
hospital.

JAZZ NOTES: KKJZ FORMAT CHANGE SPELLS END OF AN ERA; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: ITS SWITCH TO CLASSICAL MUSIC MARKS THE FIRST TIME THE L.A. IS WITHOUT A 
COMMERCIAL JAZZ CHANNEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When KKJZ-AM (540) changed formats last Friday afternoon, it was the end of an 
era: It was the first time since the mid-'50s that Los Angeles and Orange 
County were without a commercial jazz outlet. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour jazz station had offered the same format formerly heard on sister 
station KKGO-FM (105.1) -- before the latter station's changeover to 
all-classical programming on Jan. 1. Over the years, the AM station featured 
such on-air personalities as Chuck Niles, the late Jim Gosa, Sam Fields, Gary 
Owens, Tolly Strode, Jay Rich, Tommy Bee, Gerald Wilson, Dennis Smith and this 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Saul Levine, president of KKGO/KKJZ, cited financial losses as the reason for 
the shutdown of KKJZ, which is back on the air, simulcasting KKGO's format, but 
will reemerge with new call letters and a new format on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't receive any support from either listeners or advertisers," said 
Levine. "Nine months had gone by (since KKJZ took over KKGO's jazz format), we 
hoped for some kind of audience, any kind of audience, even a .1 (Arbitron 
ratings) share, but it simply failed to materialize." 
</P>
<P>
KKJZ had broadcast from transmitters near Apple Valley and its signal was 
strongest in Orange County and the beach cities. Listeners in the greater Los 
Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley, KKJZ's audience base, often 
complained about not being able to receive it consistently during daytime 
hours. They found the station all but nonexistent during the evening, when most 
AM stations are required by the Federal Communications Commission to reduce 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disheartening to be there, talking to yourself. We had contests and no 
one would call in. That happened lots of times," said Dave Meyer, who worked at 
both KKGO and KKJZ. 
</P>
<P>
Levine tried to get permission from the FCC to both move his transmitter to 
Costa Mesa and receive a power increase, but there's currently a freeze on 
modifications to AM stations and the FCC is not accepting any such 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it became impossible to obtain advertisers, said Levine. "We just 
reached the point where the sales department couldn't sell it and national 
(account) sales reps refused to present it. So before I dropped it, I called 
KLON (the Southland's major non-commercial station at 88.1 FM), as I was very 
concerned about the fate of our two veterans, Sam Fields and Chuck Niles, both 
of whom have been with me for more than 20 years." When KLON's general manager 
Rick Lewis expressed an interest in the announcers, Levine said he felt more 
comfortable in doing "what I had to do economically with dropping the format." 
</P>
<P>
As yet, neither announcer has been hired by KLON, but they are meeting with 
Lewis today. "I don't know what will transpire," said Lewis. "We have a very 
good staff here that's built the kind of tradition that they would be 
interested in." 
</P>
<P>
KLON's program director, Ken Borgers, was ecstatic at the possibility of having 
Niles on his air staff. "We'd love to have him, who wouldn't?" Borgers said. 
"It's akin to being in the baseball announcing business and finding out Vin 
Scully is available." 
</P>
<P>
Also let go were KKJZ's full and part-time announcers -- Steve Henderson Jr., 
Bob Stone, Joe Huser and Nick Tyler. "I've let other station's know they were 
available, and that they're certainly qualified to work in the market," said 
Cal Milner, KKGO/KKJZ operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
Niles found the whole situation unnerving. "It was really weird when I walked 
into the studio and found out the engineer had pulled the plug," said Niles, 
who has been with Levine for 25 years, referring to Friday's shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that he's had various disagreements with Levine through the years, 
Niles said working at KKGO/KKJZ a "totally ambivalent" situation. "I mean, it 
was 25 years. I was the 'Last of the Mohegans' ," he said. "Whether I hated 
(Saul) or loved him, if it hadn't have been for him, I wouldn't have been in 
jazz. I have to assume that nobody else would have done what he did. When we 
sat down and reminisced about the station, I cried." Levine started the 
station's forerunner, KBCA, in 1960 as a 24-hour FM jazz outlet, and kept that 
format for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Levine has donated KKJZ's jazz library to KLON. "We're very grateful for having 
him make that accessible to the listening public. Saul's been very gracious and 
generous with us," said Lewis. 
</P>

BRECHTIAN BROADSIDE BY ACTORS' GANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We can only hope that Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soliel, last here for the 
'84 Olympic Arts Festival, might return someday. (Not likely.) 
</P>
<P>
We can only pray that El Gran Circo Teatro de Chile, just here for the L.A. 
Festival, might return someday. (More likely. Maybe.) 
</P>
<P>
But, after what Los Angeles' own Actors' Gang is currently displaying at the 
Odyssey Theatre with its production of Bertolt Brecht's "The Good Woman of 
Setzuan," hopes and prayers are beside the point. If El Gran Circo proved that 
it's Chile's carrier of the great Mnouchkine tradition, then the Gang is 
proving that it's the American equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
Through growing surges (like "Carnage") and growing pains (like "The Big 
Show"), the nearly decade-old Gang, with "Good Woman," has blossomed into a 
unit to take on the world. A day after seeing El Gran Circo's extraordinary "La 
Negra Ester," there was the Gang equaling -- and sometimes surpassing -- the 
Chileans. 
</P>
<P>
The parallels were almost spooky. "Ester" is about a prostitute, is staged on a 
resonantly "poor" set of wood planks, has a fantastically inventive live band 
that plays the music and the sound effects, and sings with actors who switch 
costumes, make-up and character faster than you can say "commedia dell'arte." 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins-directed "Good Woman" has all these, and more: a play that arguably 
marks the pinnacle of Brecht's powers, and a passionate political core that 
serves as bedrock, not soap box. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, this is Brecht as Brecht wanted it: for the masses. Robbins 
is aiming for emotional directness, but within a ritualistic style. He 
remembers that while Brecht's Theater of Alienation was about the alienation 
Out There, it was also about humanizing the audience In Here. 
</P>
<P>
Brecht fills his imaginary Chinese city (and the heavens above, home to three 
devious gods) with so much injustice, that justice is precious. Forced to 
embody and confront both, Shen Te (Shannon Holt), is a prostitute blessed with 
monetary providence and unable to control her instinct for charity. Neither 
Brecht nor his English translator, Eric Bentley, who collaborated in 
neighboring Santa Monica, spell out how Shen Te becomes Shui Ta, her wily 
"cousin" who knows how to run a business. 
</P>
<P>
Holt and Robbins have come up with their own solutions, adding haunting, 
psychological dimensions that the text only hints at. It begins with simple, 
powerful costume changes, and one of Xander Berkeley's expressively 
physicalized masks which follow Dario Fo's dictum that "the mask is not 
intended to mask." It ends with a staggering acting display by Holt, becoming a 
good woman who dangerously tests her moral limits. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang the water seller (Brent Hinkley) reports to the gods (the 
hilariously evil trio -- also masked -- of Jeff Foster, Dean Robinson and 
Michael Rivkin) on the good woman's struggle. Hinkley plays him as a bedraggled 
Everyman, trying and failing miserably to befriend Shen Te. Brian Brophy's Yang 
Sun wants Shen Te as a life preserver and a twisted affirmation of his 
maleness, with Lisa Moncure as his mother cajoling him with gleeful amorality. 
</P>
<P>
Moncure typifies the dazzling artfulness here, as she switches from seedy Mrs. 
Yang into Shen Te's slick landlady with invisible speed. She has a lot of 
company on this theatrical fast track: Foster, Robinson, Rivkin, Brophy, Jack 
Black, Steven Porter, Evie Peck and Tricia Parks. Cari Dean Whittemore, Kate 
Mulligan and Patti Tippo lead the spongers who hang around Shen Te like a bad 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
This is theater about acting, with production gloss kept spare, yet seldom has 
a spare show seemed so rich. Richard Hoover's set is a simple frame of wood 
ladders and platforms which Garrett Caine's lights turn into outer space or a 
hellish factory. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Teguns' fine costumes are ingeniously utilitarian. Music supervisor David 
Robbins, with pieces by Darryl Tewes, Ernesto Salcedo, Carey Fosse and Keythe 
Farley, creates a vast sonic universe, from tougher-than-Weill songs to a 
rainstorm. These emerge from an array of instruments, some played by actors on 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Observers may protest that, with the "Miss Saigon" storm over appropriate 
ethnic casting, any current "Good Woman" should boast a largely Asian cast. 
Robbins chose not to go that direction, which doesn't prevent someone else from 
doing so. What direction he did choose has produced magic. That is what finally 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 
p.m., until Oct. 19. $10-$12; (213) 477-2055.

UNFULFILLED PROMISES AT CUCINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Can a restaurant be judged by the art it displays? 
</P>
<P>
This question came to mind recently in Pasadena's Old Town when I was visiting 
Amedeo Cucina. In a former incarnation the place was the Italian Fisherman. A 
year ago, Amedeo Costantino, the Fisherman's owner, closed down his clubby, 
pricey restaurant, gutted the place and reopened as this upscale yet more 
casual cucina. 
</P>
<P>
It looks and feels like a corporate exercise in trendiness. There's an open 
kitchen. There's ceiling truss. There are pasta and pizza, risotto and 
radicchio, carpaccio, too. And there's original art displayed. 
</P>
<P>
I had ample time to study the art one night both before and after the orders 
were taken at my table. When we sat down, we'd been given two pretty and tasty 
crostini, crisp little toasts topped with chopped tomato and basil, and we ate 
them right away. Our hunger piqued, we diverted ourselves at first by looking 
around at the other diners, and then at the mid-sized paintings hung about the 
room. In their favor, the paintings were unpretentious and earnestly executed. 
Otherwise, there wasn't much to recommend the work. "Let's hope the food's 
better than the art," my friend said as we waited . . . and waited. 
</P>
<P>
For a while it seemed that we would never get to judge the food. Eventually, a 
waiter spoke crossly to a busperson and we received some warm, crusty bread for 
dipping into some herbed olive oil. When, finally, our appetizers arrived, I 
was happy to see my friend happily eating his grilled eggplant with cheese, 
which was peppery and tasty. 
</P>
<P>
My salad, however, confused me. I'd ordered mixed field greens and was 
expecting the sort of lettuces most other restaurants serve when a field is 
advertised as the source of the greens -- things like mesclun, lambs quarters, 
chicory, dandelion, or some exotic mint. But this salad was made of iceberg and 
romaine, exactly the kind of salad found in a coffee shop, complete with grated 
carrot and shredded red cabbage. Thinking there had been a mistake, I told the 
waiter. "I had the field greens salad. Unless I'm mistaken, these aren't field 
greens." 
</P>
<P>
"You're right," he said. A good five minutes later, another salad arrived and 
it looked exactly like the first salad, only fluffed up a bit. I said no more. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the food and service at Amedeo's is very much like its art: 
aspirations are very grand, but they generally far exceed results. A waiter, 
for example, very professionally takes our orders without notes, and then, the 
wrong food arrives. And the menu makes promises that are rarely realized. The 
gnocchi al pesto turns out to be gluey dumplings in a pool of a thick, rich 
cheesy cream sauce flecked with basil. The tirami su is 90% coffee-drizzled 
ladyfingers bound together with the scantest amount of mascarpone cheese. One 
night's expensive special, described as extra-large Hawaiian scampi, was 
actually pretty skimpy. Once we got the shrimp out of their sizable shells, 
there was hardly any meat. What's worse, the shrimp was dry and burnt-tasting. 
Another time, we're told that the kitchen ran out of the T-bone for the Mini 
Steak alla Fiorentina -- will a New York do? Fine, but the New York is 
overcooked, tasteless and so tough it seem impossible that the meat was 
marinated as promised on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
If you happen to find yourself eating at Amedeo Cucina, it may be helpful to 
know that the rotisserie-cooked chicken is passable. And while the Italian 
sausage with roasted peppers may not come on a "bed" of polenta as promised, 
it's good and the meager little squares of fried polenta on the side are quite 
nice too. 
</P>
<P>
Between the paintings on the wall and the food on the plate, there's a lack of 
discernment at work in Amedeo Cucina. After all, radicchio, open kitchens and 
original art are no substitute for inspired cooking, considerate service and 
prices commensurate with the quality of the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Amedeo Cucina, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. (818) 792-2236. Open for lunch 
Monday through Friday; dinner seven days. Reservations suggested. All major 
credit cards. Full bar. Dinner for two, food only, $30 to $70.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: IT WASN'T BROKE, SO THEY FIXED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reopening of Dominick's, 8715 Beverly Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 
657-8314, is a swell thing. But a lot of people around town are nervous. They 
worry: "How am I going to get into this place?" 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, Dominick's was practically a private club, and not solely for 
reasons of exclusivity -- the place was tiny. Still is. There are something 
like 10 tables in the whole place. 
</P>
<P>
Not a lot seems to have changed at Dominick's -- and that's the point. The 
place was designed to look as it did years ago, to erase all memories of the 
infamous remodel of '88, when Dominick's went pastel. (It didn't work -- 
imagine walking into Musso's and saying, "OK, if we get rid of the wood 
paneling we can really lighten this place up.") 
</P>
<P>
To get the look exactly right, production designer Richard Sylbert, creator of 
the color-drenched period look in "Dick Tracy," redid the redo. The result: a 
restaurant that doesn't seem designed. Where most retro restaurants resemble a 
cartoon version of the era they aspire to, Dominick's simply is as it was: a 
dark, masculine, red-leather-booth kind of place, only slightly less funky. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is a throwback too; food never was the point here. There are steaks, 
chops (with your choice of mint jelly or bearnaise), a Caesar salad, a pickled 
herring appetizer and a totally '40s house salad with chunks of salami, cubes 
of some unidentifiable orange cheese, bits of blue cheese and radish slices. 
Vegetable sides tend toward various potatoes and creamed spinach. Blackboard 
specials are a little more modern. And Dominick's makes an excellent martini. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the old customers have been coming in," a waitress says over the 
sound of a '40s swing tune on the jukebox. "They say it looks just the same . . 
. except for the missing moose head." LAURIE OCHOA

EERIE SERIAL KILLINGS HAVE SAN DIEGO WOMEN ON EDGE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are hiding their knives, avoiding daytime showers, changing their locks, 
keeping baseball bats beside their beds. They are afraid to show their faces on 
television or allow their names to be used in print. 
</P>
<P>
Women in the San Diego neighborhoods of University City and Clairemont are 
frantic over reports that a serial killer has fatally stabbed five women since 
January, two of them last week. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as everyone tries to hide it, people are really frightened," said Jack 
Edison, who lives with two women in Clairemont on the street where two of the 
murders occurred. "I'm a guy and it even bothers me. There's someone out there 
who is wacko." 
</P>
<P>
The killings have fit an eerie pattern: Four of the five victims are brunettes 
between 18 and 21, all stabbed between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. after their killer 
entered through open or unlocked doors. The fifth is the 42-year-old mother of 
one of the women, whom the killer did not expect to be home, police suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Some had just showered before they were killed. Three were slain within a 
two-block area of Clairemont. The two most recent stabbings occurred three 
miles away in University City. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a level of security here that people used to take for granted," said 
Richard Madsen, a professor of sociology at UC San Diego who lives in 
University City. "Now that's gone." 
</P>
<P>
After the third murder, in April, police released a composite drawing of a 
suspect -- a black man, 14 to 23 years old, with close-cropped hair, a medium 
build and 5 feet 7 to 5 feet 10 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
Although they did not change the drawing after the latest murders, police now 
are hedging on their description: The suspect may not be black but dark 
skinned. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are complaints that police are harassing blacks near the sites of 
the murders and taking their photographs. On Thursday, police officials denied 
the charges, saying they were simply conducting an aggressive investigation. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 detectives working full time on the case and extra patrols roaming 
neighborhoods in both areas, police are calling the investigation the largest 
in San Diego's history. 
</P>
<P>
They are working on a dozen different theories. Among them: The killer staked 
out his victims before attacking; the killer rode a bus line that connects all 
four murder sites; he delivered flyers in the neighborhood; he was a service 
repairman, or homeless, or a gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Police in this city are used to highly publicized murders: A team of city, 
county and state investigators has been working for two years on the cases of 
43 women, mostly transients or prostitutes, killed since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But they are not used to the public reaction generated by the University 
City-Clairemont killings. Since Sept. 13, dispatchers have been swamped with 
calls from more than 600 tipsters, many claiming to have seen the killer.

When law enforcement officials arranged a neighborhood meeting this week in 
University City to discuss safety precautions, more than 800 alarmed people 
showed up, filling the auditorium and spilling outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Police have assigned five full-time community service workers to help residents 
make sure their homes are secure. Normally, only two are assigned and they do 
five checks per week. Lately, they have been doing about 15 a day. 
</P>
<P>
To protect their homes, residents are emptying hardware stores of locks and 
security systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Door locks and window guards are flying out of here," said Connie Johnson, 
assistant manager of the Home Depot in Clairemont. "We've had to air-freight 
our orders. Some of these people are getting to the panic stage." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Ainslie, who sells window screens affixed with burglar alarms to about 
140 alarm companies throughout San Diego, said sales to stores in University 
City "have gone sky high." 
</P>
<P>
So have gun sales, especially to women. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Seals, owner of A &amp; W Guns, said many of the women who have recently 
bought guns from his shop chose revolvers and other small handguns -- 
"something small and simple, easy to handle," Seals said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Chief Cal Krosch said women should be cautious but should not 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
"I suggest to people that they cannot change their lifestyles," Krosch said. 
"You've got to continue living your life. There's no reason to turn it upside 
down. Life's too short. 
</P>
<P>
The killings started in January. Tiffany Paige Schultz, the first victim, was a 
20-year-old student at San Diego State who moonlighted as a nude dancer at a 
local nightclub. She was stabbed more than 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz lived on Cowley Way, just two blocks from where Janene Marie Weinhold, 
21, a UC San Diego student, was murdered the next month. Weinhold, who was 
doing her laundry and baking cookies, was stabbed more than 30 times, according 
to authorities and her father. 
</P>
<P>
The third to die was Holly Suzanne Tarr, an 18-year-old high school student and 
aspiring actress who had come to visit her brother from her hometown of Okemos, 
Mich. She had left the Buena Vista Gardens swimming pool for home and had just 
showered when she was killed, her family said. Police said some of the other 
women had showered shortly before they were killed but would not specify who 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
The latest victims were Pamela Clark, 42, and her 18-year-old daughter, Amber, 
who were found stabbed to death inside their University City home. Amber Clark 
bore a striking resemblance, police say, to the three earlier victims. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the killer used kitchen knives taken from the homes in all but 
the first murder. 
</P>
<P>
Many women in the University City-Clairemont area are so frightened that they 
could be next that none of those interviewed Thursday would allow their full 
names to be published. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara, a 41-year-old mother, said she is keeping her 15- and 13-year-old 
daughters out of school "to have them closer to me." Fearful of being home 
during the morning hours when the killer is believed to attack, she takes her 
daughters out of the house every day. On Thursday, they went bowling. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives have been changed drastically by this," said the woman, who lives in 
Clairemont. "We live in fear of something happening."

International efforts to further isolate Iraq moved forward Thursday when the 
Olympic Council of Asia voted to expel the Iraqi national team from the Asian 
Games, and the United Nations struggled with the final wording on a resolution 
to impose an air embargo on Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In the Iraqi capital, President Saddam Hussein videotaped a message to be 
televised for the American public, apparently designed as a rebuttal to 
President Bush's speech to the Iraqi people that was shown earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's official news agency did not disclose the content of Hussein's speech, 
but Information Minister Latif Jasim said the tape has been given to "concerned 
American personalities" for broadcast in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Council vote in Beijing, conducted by secret ballot, was 27 to 3 in 
favor of barring Iraq from the games and suspending it from the council. There 
were five abstentions, one invalid ballot and two members absent. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to political concerns, the vote was influenced by personal factors 
because the previous head of the council, Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, was 
killed in the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Thursday's meeting began with 
all delegates, including the Iraqis, standing for a moment of silence in memory 
of the sheik. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, his son, Ahmed al Fahd al Sabah, said that Kuwaiti athletes 
"feel now that the whole world and Asia are with them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council labored to produce a draft resolution on 
an air blockade amid political pressures and quibbles over details. 
</P>
<P>
A new snag arose Thursday when, according to one diplomat, the United States 
asked for a change in the agreement hammered out thus far among five permanent 
members of the Security Council. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition that 
he not be identified, declined to specify the requested change. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, striding out of the council chamber, 
deflected all questions about the air embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them is right," he told a reporter who asked which is the correct 
version of numerous drafts which have surfaced during the negotiations among 
the five. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Ambassador Yves Fortier, whose country is one of the 10 non-permanent 
members of the council, predicted overwhelming support for the embargo, 
although he professed to know none of the details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We voted an embargo, and it's working as far as movements by sea and land are 
concerned, but we do have evidence that there are loopholes by air," Fortier 
said. "We want to plug those loopholes, and I have every confidence that the 
unity of the council will be maintained." 
</P>
<P>
Although the permanent Security Council members had reached agreement in 
principle on an air embargo Monday, ambassadors of the five nations -- the 
United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- met for three hours 
at the French mission Wednesday night without being able to tie up the final 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what issues were still holding up presentation of a draft resolution to 
the other 10 Security Council members, one diplomat explained that seemingly 
petty details can still be important. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody agrees that an embargo should require inspection of planes going 
into Iraq, but some think it unnecessary to inspect planes coming out," said 
the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's doubt about something going in on a plane carrying humanitarian 
goods exempted from the embargo, who's going to decide? There has to be a clear 
system if we're going to start using force to intercept civilian planes that 
are suspected of violations," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Some participants in the discussions reported that French delegates, who 
demanded further council action after Iraqi troops invaded their ambassador's 
residence in Kuwait last week, have asked that a vote be held off until the 
arrival of President Francois Mitterrand on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish Ambassador Marjatta Rasi, chairman of the Security Council's sanctions 
committee, said a vote may even be postponed until later next week, when 
foreign ministers will be in attendance for the opening of the U.N. General 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov, the council president, earlier had 
predicted a vote by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a senior Bush Administration official said the United States 
supports the proposal for an air blockade, although he conceded it would be 
difficult to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
"There are complications in an air blockade that you don't have with a sea 
blockade," the official said. "You can shoot the rudder or propeller off a ship 
and it doesn't sink. You can't do the same thing with an aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Thursday night postponed a vote on a $2-billion plan to 
ease the effects on Jordan of the anti-Iraqi trade and arms embargo already in 
place. Jordan, a major trading partner of Iraq, has espoused its neighbor's 
cause politically but accepted the council's sanctions orders and claims to 
have been hardest hit by the trade ban. 
</P>
<P>
Early today, the ruling Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council issued a hard-line 
statement that reiterated Hussein's refusal to retreat from occupied Kuwait. 
"Let everybody understand that this battle is going to become the mother (and 
father) or all battles," said the Iraqi statement, which added that there is 
"not a single chance" for withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi information minister, meanwhile, said he expects "reciprocal 
treatment" from American broadcasters because Iraq had allowed Bush's speech to 
be aired on Iraqi TV. In any event, he said, if no one airs the message, Iraq 
would find "alternate ways" to transmit it. 
</P>
<P>
The White House declined to offer advice to American networks about whether to 
air the taped message. White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that if Iraq 
gave U.S. officials a copy of the tape, they would take it "out of diplomatic 
courtesy." But Popadiuk suggested Iraq could just as well hand over copies of 
the tape directly to U.S. networks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the four major U.S. television networks said as of Thursday 
night that they had not received any Iraqi video. Only one network, CNN, said 
it expects to air the video in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasoning is that the world is not far from a state of war, and Saddam 
Hussein is a crucial figure in that," said Eason Jordon, CNN's manager of 
international news. "We feel like what he has to say is important." 
</P>
<P>
The other three networks said they intend to make a decision only after 
reviewing the tape. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.N. 
Ambassador Pickering complained that U.S. delinquency in paying its dues to the 
international organization "could hobble our ability to mount an effective U.N. 
response to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and the effort to capitalize on 
the progress we have made on other issues." 
</P>
<P>
The United States currently owes $520 million in regular assessments, plus $150 
million for special peacekeeping costs. During much of the Reagan 
Administration, conservatives complained that the General Assembly was hostile 
to American views of the Third World and Israel. Congress cut payment of 
regular dues by half, pending a presidential finding that the United Nations 
had reformed its spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the past few years, U.N. attitudes toward the United States have 
warmed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Asian Games officials reported that 43 athletes from the Kuwaiti 
national team had arrived to participate in the competition that begins 
Saturday. When Iraq invaded Kuwait, most of Kuwait's national team was trapped 
in the country. The 43 had been training elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi soccer team that came early for other events will head home, but the 
rest of the Iraqi team had not yet arrived in China. 
</P>
<P>
Zafar Imam, deputy secretary general of the Bangladesh Olympic Assn., said his 
nation was among those voting against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much in favor of Kuwait, because they (Iraq) invaded Kuwait, they 
destroyed the office of the Olympic Council of Asia and they killed the 
president of the Olympic Council of Asia," Imam said in an interview after the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials responded to the vote with anger. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi National Olympic Committee statement called the vote "a clear and 
flagrant violation of the (Olympic Committee of Asia) constitution and all its 
principles and values of fair treatment for all members." It said the action 
"will push our sports and Olympic institutions to paths that will jeopardize 
their unity and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein, who met Wednesday with King Hassan II of 
Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria, will carry the "thoughts, 
views and expectations" expressed at that meeting to Iraq, Algeria Radio said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports in Amman, the Jordanian capital, about the 
outcome of meeting of the three leaders. 
</P>
<P>
According to one source, the three leaders will propose to Saddam Hussein that 
he withdraw his troops from Kuwait and that elections be conducted there six 
months later to determine the oil-rich state's future. 
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian official said that the three will try to work out a formula for 
Iraqi withdrawal linked to discussions later on other Middle East problems, 
including the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
put forth another proposal, which calls for talks involving Iraq's Hussein, 
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the U.N. secretary general, Javier Perez de 
Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has been one of Iraq's strongest supporters since the invasion of 
Kuwait, and the parameters of the talks suggested by Arafat differ in no way 
from what Iraq's Hussein has offered: no guaranteed withdrawal from Kuwait and 
a linkage of all Middle East conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials say they are pessimistic about the chances of King 
Hussein's latest mission succeeding. A previous effort ended two weeks ago with 
Iraq's Hussein flatly rejecting the notion of pulling out of Kuwait. 
</P>

SAUDIS TO SHOP AROUND IF U.S. BALKS ON ARMS 
</P>

<P>
With opposition to an arms sale of more than $20 billion to Saudi Arabia 
emerging in Congress, the Saudi government served notice Thursday that it will 
buy weapons elsewhere if the United States backs away from an earlier decision 
to make the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia is going to increase its long-term defense forces, and the 
question is not whether the arms will be bought, but where they will be 
bought," said Fred Dutton, a longtime Washington representative of the Saudi 
government. "If the U.S. is not prepared to make the sale, so be it. The Saudis 
would respect that, but the purchase would go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the strength of the White House commitment to the deal came 
this week when a top State Department official promised House members opposed 
to the sale that their concerns would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, after lobbying by the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee soured Congress on a proposed $7-billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, 
the Saudis turned to Britain and made a $20-billion arms purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators, including Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California, a 
staunch supporter of Israel, have proposed that the Administration lease to the 
Saudis some of the more expensive and sophisticated weaponry that they need to 
defend against the Iraqi military threat. In building its arsenal, Israel has 
leased rather than purchased some of its weapons from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, in a Senate speech, said that he and several other senators are 
proposing that the weapons package be in two parts. 
</P>
<P>
The first would consist of weapons to be delivered immediately to strengthen 
the Saudis' military defense against Iraq and to help protect U.S. troops now 
deployed in Saudi Arabia. The second part, consisting of F-15 aircraft, 
helicopters and modified tanks, would be leased until the current crisis in the 
Persian Gulf ends, then be turned back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Leasing would not help Saudi Arabia in the long range in defending against the 
continuing Iraqi military threat," Dutton declared. "The Saudis don't see why 
they shouldn't be allowed to purchase the weapons when they are prepared to pay 
in full. The fact is the Israelis lease because they can't afford to purchase 
all the weapons they want." 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis, who last week were assured by Bush Administration officials that 
they had signed off on the arms package, obviously were nettled by reports of 
congressional opposition and suggestions by congressional aides that the 
Administration may be considering scaling back the size of the package even 
before it is introduced in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Their concern was heightened Thursday when, even though a highly placed source 
said that the sale "will go forward," the White House publicly declined to 
speculate on whether the size of the package may be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of discussing this internally within the government as 
well as consulting with the Congress," said White House Deputy Press Secretary 
Roman Popadiuk. "It's too premature to start categorizing something as either 
moving forward or moving back. We have not made an internal government decision 
in terms of the scale." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale would be in addition to $2.2 billion in fighter jets and 
other arms sold to the Saudis last month after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The massive arms package, which would be the largest U.S. military sale in 
history -- almost three times as large as the previous record of $8 billion, 
which also went to the Saudis -- would provide immediate delivery of at least 
24 F-15 fighters, as many as 300 M-1 tanks, several hundred Bradley armored 
fighting vehicles, 48 Apache attack helicopters and hundreds of air-to-air 
missiles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some concern about the proposed sale was voiced in the House as well as the 
Senate. And Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger promised House 
members that the Administration would take into account any concerns voiced in 
Congress about the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Matthew McHugh (D-N.Y.) told Eagleburger that he fears that the sale will 
intensify the Middle East arms race and that the United States will wind up 
paying for additional military aid to Israel, which now totals $1.8 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, like previous administrations, is committed to 
maintaining Israel's "qualitative military edge" over the Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concern that the Administration may consider scaling back the arms 
package, a spokesman for the Saudi Embassy said that Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney had reassured the Saudis that the Administration still plans to 
introduce the original package. 
</P>
<P>
And a senior White House official, who declined to be identified, said in an 
interview: "The package will go forward. The only question is timing and 
tactics and dealing with Congress. The Administration consensus still supports 
the package." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the sale were disclosed by Administration officials Sept. 14. At that 
time officials said they expected the proposal to be sent to Congress by the 
end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis worry that the longer the Administration delays sending the package 
to Congress, the more opposition will mount and the greater the chance that 
President Bush may consider reducing the size of the package. 
</P>
<P>
Anxiety in Israel about the proposed sale also has been a major factor in the 
Administration's handling of the issue. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens 
told Defense Secretary Cheney on Monday that Israel wants more U.S. military 
aid to compensate for any weapons sold to the Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with reporters after a meeting with Cheney at the Pentagon, Arens said: 
"I think a very large-scale sale of advanced equipment to the Saudis without 
adequate compensation for Israel could upset the military balance in the area 
and that would be destabilizing." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney promised Arens that Israel's "qualitative military edge" over the Arab 
states in the Middle East will be maintained despite the arms sale, an 
Administration official said.

Whenever thunder rumbles and wind blows, Leroy Cummings gets icy shivers. His 
wife, Bertha, hides. "I can't take it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds bring back the furious day Hurricane Hugo dismantled their home and 
lives, along with thousands of others. A year has passed since the storm 
ravaged coastal South Carolina, but for many residents the fear, pain and 
apprehension are a lingering, everyday legacy. 
</P>
<P>
The Cummingses -- he is 71, and she is 70 -- now live in a house trailer, with 
four foster children. Most furnishings were donated. While their physical 
losses were devastating, the emotional damage seems appallingly larger. Dabbing 
away tears, Leroy Cummings said he asked himself for days: "By the 21st of the 
month (the anniversary of Hugo) will it happen again?" 
</P>
<P>
There are other legacies of that fateful day. South Carolina lost $1.4 billion 
worth of timber, much of which still lies on the ground, rotting and raising 
fears of forest fires for years to come. Lawsuits involving insurance claims 
and contractors will clog the court system. Meanwhile, in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands and Puerto Rico, where the storm hit on Sept. 17 and 18, officials say 
they are rebuilding apace, laying underground telephone wiring and putting up 
hurricane-proof structures to replace the inferior ones that were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"The recovery is going very well," said Bent Lawaetz, president of the Virgin 
Islands Senate. Once the rebuilding is completed in a couple years, "we will be 
in better condition than we were," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in Charleston, "the most extraordinary building boom in the city's 
history" is under way, said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., noting especially the 
massive refurbishing of the city's elegant old homes. 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, particularly the elderly, the poor, and those in dusty 
hamlets outside Charleston, there is no silver lining, only the agonizing task 
of getting from one day to the next. 
</P>
<P>
"In the rural areas, we still have a good way to go," said Riley, adding that 
he encourages people to seek counseling for their fears. "People are not likely 
to come up to you and talk about it, but you know it's there." 
</P>
<P>
As residents pause to remember on today's anniversary of the storm and ponder 
the possibility of another hurricane sweeping in from the Atlantic, coping 
becomes more difficult for some, say officials of the state Department of 
Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane victims "are going to have an unusually long recovery period" said 
Nancy Carter, state clinical coordinator for emergency preparedness at the 
department, which operates a counseling program called Hugo Outreach Support 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
Some victims say the year since Hugo's 140-m.p.h. winds swept into the state, 
killing 29 people and causing an estimated $6 billion in damages, has already 
been an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
In Mt. Pleasant, James Swinton, 72, who limps heavily and speaks in the soft, 
lyrical accent of coastal South Carolinians, said, "I don't feel safe," 
expressing a feeling he has had ever since he returned the day after the storm 
to find his home wrecked. "Things could happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people around here who suffered through Hugo had never seen a 
hurricane before, although coastal thunderstorms were common. Now that they are 
painfully aware of how powerful and dangerous hurricanes can be, they are more 
cautious than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyper-vigilant" is what Frederic Medway, professor of psychology at the 
University of South Carolina, calls this behavior. "I don't think a large 
number of people living near the coast are having hurricane parties anymore," 
he said, referring to an age-old practice of partying while storms threaten. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the hurricane season progresses this year, many people watch weather 
reports with unprecedented apprehensiveness. In stores all over the area, there 
were runs on radios and batteries when a tropical storm headed north toward the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
Experts liken problems of hurricane survivors to those of combat veterans who 
experience post-war stress. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Hartley, professor of social work at the University of South Carolina, said 
that right after Hugo, peoples' "initial reaction was shock" at their losses. 
"Now, there's a delayed reaction that says, 'Things can happen to me. We're all 
vulnerable.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tears are still common a year later. 
</P>
<P>
In McClellanville, Gladys Shepherd, 67, told a visitor that she cried for two 
weeks after the storm, adding: "Off and on, I cry now. As long as I live, I 
will talk about Hugo." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, James, who is 73 years old, said, "You never forget it." He 
compared the hurricane to his combat duty as an infantryman in Africa during 
World War II, asserting that Hugo was worse than Adolf Hitler's army. "Those 
Germans didn't scare me as much as Hugo did," he said. "I had a chance with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
There is apparently something mystical about the one-year anniversary, as if it 
signals a need to close out an awful chapter in people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Joyner, who leads a team of 11 mental health counselors working out of a 
Charleston office, said the anniversary has triggered an avalanche of requests 
to help fix roofs and repair homes, problems that are stacked on top of the 
emotional ones her team is supposed to address. 
</P>
<P>
The link between solving the physical problems and emotional problems is 
inextricable. Thus, the Federal Emergency Management Agency funds both the 
mental health programs and grants to help people make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The sense of powerlessness seems to pervade the Hugo victims. 
</P>
<P>
In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Ernestina Villegas, acting director of FEMA's 
individual and family grant program, said that the storm "affected quite a few 
children. When they hear a wave or the sky is too dark, they get very scared." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive rebuilding, Virgin Island residents sense that true 
recovery is out of their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Bent Lawaetz, the Senate president, noted that rising costs of jet fuel that 
drive up airplane fares, combined with the slackening U.S. economy, threaten to 
cut tourism, which accounts for half the employment on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is beyond my control: the U.S. economy and the Iraq 
situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in South Carolina, Leroy and Bertha Cummings did not want to live in a 
cramped mobile home, but on fixed income with a variety of health problems, he 
said, "I had to turn to a trailer. I had to have some place to live." 
</P>
<P>
At $29,000, the plain brown trailer was affordable, although it is so hot, he 
said, that "we have to stay outside 'til the mosquitoes run us in." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Wells, a counselor who makes weekly rounds around this area, told 
of the single mother who huddled in a corner with her daughter through Hugo, 
hearing the air conditioner blow out of a window and through an opposite wall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Wells said, "She reports nightmares. She's stuck. No motivation. Life had 
never gotten really tough, then all of a sudden, blam! People who didn't have 
good coping skills went under." 
</P>
<P>
The rest are trying to stay afloat. They do it in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
If you talk long enough, just about everybody who went through the storm will 
pull out memories of the way life was before Hugo. Many show photographs of the 
devastation and progressive snapshots of their climb back from it. 
</P>
<P>
James and Gladys Shepherd's trailer sits next to their storm-damaged house. 
Hoping to move back in next month, they showed a visitor through the two-story 
frame home and talked excitedly of having relatives visit again. The good times 
will be back, they hope. 
</P>
<P>
But something has changed. Like many others, they vow not to ever have as much 
to lose as they lost to Hugo -- even though Gladys is a self-avowed "pack rat." 
It is as if they are paring down their things to make themselves small targets 
for any future tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I live," said James Shepherd, "I don't ever want as much as I had 
before."

AWOL?: State Board of Equalization member William Bennett, a Democrat seeking 
reelection, missed two of his board's monthly meetings this summer and his 
opponent is milking it for all it's worth. Unable to get any media interest in 
Bennett's absentee record, Republican Jeff Wallack decided what works for 
missing children might work for missing politicians. So he began handing out 
milk cartons with Bennett's picture and a physical description pasted on the 
side. A caption underneath suggests: "If anyone has seen this man in the 
performance of his public duties . . . " they are to call Wallack's campaign 
office. Bennett, who did show up at the board's latest meeting, shrugged off 
the criticism. "The absence of board members is not an infrequent occurrence," 
he said. Indeed, board member Paul Carpenter has missed the last two meetings 
while he attended his federal court trial in which he was found guilty on 
racketeering, extortion and conspiracy charges.

Friends Forever: During the occasionally testy Democratic primary for governor, 
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos could be counted on to savage his predecessor 
Dianne Feinstein at every turn. Especially loud was Agnos' denunciation of 
Feinstein's handling of the city budget. Regularly, he lamented that she had 
left him with a $174-million budget deficit to clean up. So who was it that 
Agnos was broadly praising at a San Francisco fund-raiser last week? None other 
than Dianne Feinstein, now the party nominee. "Some people say that the real 
test of leadership is whether you leave your own imprint on the place where you 
worked or the city that you represented," Agnos was quoted by the San Francisco 
Chronicle as saying. "By that standard, San Francisco never had a better mayor 
than Dianne Feinstein." Agnos credited his conversion to that common 
post-primary affliction, party unity.

Mayor Sonny Bono seems to be getting a little bored with that seething 
political caldron known as Palm Springs. "If I made a move, I would decide for 
the Senate," the former restaurateur, singer and television star mused 
recently. "At this point," he said, "I have to really question whether for 
another four years I want to just continue being mayor of Palm Springs." 
Without being specific, Bono said he had talked with U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
about his ambitions. If Republican Wilson wins his bid for governor, he could 
be in a position to choose his Senate replacement. Meanwhile, Bono is honing 
his skills for the road. He returned last week from a promotional trip for his 
new line of chocolate chip cookies.

ARCHEOLOGIST FOLLOWS IN FOOTSTEPS OF DESERT INDIANS 
</P>

<P>
Archeologist Mike Mitchell picked up charred bone fragments along the ancient 
Indian trail in this remote stretch of Riverside County desert. 
</P>
<P>
"These are deer or bighorn sheep bones more than likely barbecued and eaten by 
Indians a long, long time ago," mused Mitchell, 48, an archeologist with the 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was following what he described as a footpath, "perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 
years old," that snakes across the barren desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The trail was covered with desert varnish, a patina formed by a combination of 
the oxidation of iron and manganese interacting with a microorganism, lighter 
than the older coloration of the stones and rocks embracing it. 
</P>
<P>
It was one segment of a sophisticated network of ancient Indian trails 
preserved in this land of little rain and sizzling sun, undisturbed and seldom 
visited by man. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel McCarthy, 42, a UC Riverside archeologist and coordinator for the 
California Archeology Inventory, has been studying and cataloguing Indian 
trails in the deserts of Inyo, San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties 
in California and Yuma County in Arizona for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy has mapped 70 miles of the aborigine footpaths, the longest segment 
running 6 1/2 miles. The trails, he said, are remnants of hundreds of miles of 
prehistoric arteries of travel and trade crisscrossing the Southern California 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian trails are mentioned in the literature of the Old West, but no one has 
taken an inventory of the footpaths, recording evidence of people traveling 
over the same ground for centuries to get from one place to another," explained 
McCarthy, who has undertaken that task. 
</P>
<P>
There are more Indian trails remaining on the California and Arizona deserts 
than anywhere else in America because of the unique preservation qualities in 
this arid country, the archeologist noted. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the trails across the desert were still used by Colorado River Indians 
as recently as 75 years ago. McCarthy has been gathering information about the 
footpaths from the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, there are still Colorado River Indians alive who walked the 
trails with their parents and others when they were very young. They remember 
walking across the desert following the trails from one water source to another 
as their ancestors did. The trails have great sentimental meaning to them," 
McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Indians would walk as far as 30 miles a day. They would stop over at 
springs where trees and plants flourished and game animals gathered. 
</P>
<P>
"They would eat mesquite and palm seeds, cactus fruit, feed on deer, bighorn 
sheep, rabbit and other animals," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Indian trails are petroglyphs (rock carvings) and pictographs (rock 
paintings) of geometric designs, abstract images and human, animal, snake and 
insect figures. 
</P>
<P>
There also are rock alignments along the trails resembling humans and animals. 
And there are intaglios, large figures made by pushing aside rocks and stones 
covered with desert varnish to expose lighter soil. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to get an idea of the age of the trails from the type of broken 
pottery and other artifacts found along the paths, noted McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Many trails obviously have been eroded and washed away. Some have been damaged 
or destroyed by off-road vehicles. Until now there have been no attempts to 
save, protect and preserve the trails from modern man's incursions. Fortunately 
most of the trails are in relatively inaccessible areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot manage something unless you know what is out there. Most people on 
encountering the trails are unaware they are products of many feet traveling 
over the same ground for centuries. In some places the foot traffic was so 
heavy it wore the bedrock down to form a path." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy is hoping that the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service 
administrators of the desert where the trails are found will someday set aside 
some of the segments and provide information and access to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to use your imagination and envision Indians through the centuries 
tramping across the desert. The paths are . . . another clue to the 
understanding of prehistoric man's existence in Southern California," said 
McCarthy.

NASA will delay a fifth launch attempt for the shuttle Columbia until at least 
late November, after the scheduled launches of the shuttles Discovery and 
Atlantis, the space agency announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials also are debating the possibility of delaying another fueling 
test for Columbia until after Discovery's planned Oct. 5 liftoff because of 
problems in obtaining a fuel line valve to replace one that malfunctioned 
during the shuttle's aborted fueling Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovery and Atlantis are operational orbiters with no known or suspected 
defects," said William Lenoir, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's associate administrator for spaceflight. "Our highest priority 
is going to be to resume flights with Discovery and Atlantis as scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
He said a new launch date for Columbia will not be set until after a hydrogen 
leak is found and fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was grounded Monday when hydrogen began building up in the shuttle's 
engine compartment. Later, during a series of tests, a fuel line valve leading 
to main engine No. 2 would not close properly on command.

INFIGHTING SEEN AS IMPERILING A DEFICIT ACCORD;

BUDGET: PREELECTION ATTACKS MAY BE SO BITTER AS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS 
ANY DEAL. DOLE SUGGESTS PUTTING CAPITAL GAINS IN A SEPARATE BILL.

<TEXT>
<P>
Even as negotiators continue to grope for a budget agreement, congressional 
Republicans and Democrats have escalated a political blame-game with an eye on 
the approaching November elections. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush has been steering clear of partisan attacks, in large 
part to avoid alienating Democrats at a time of international crisis, members 
of Congress have shown no such compunction. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) attempted to break the deadlocked 
budget "summit" negotiations by suggesting that the proposal to cut capital 
gains taxes, favored by Bush, be dropped from any deficit-reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the capital gains issue and some relatively non-controversial tax 
breaks for businesses and self-employed persons should be considered in 
separate legislation that would include revenue-raising measures to offset 
losses from the tax cuts. But the idea is not expected to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said on a 
television call-in show that a capital gains tax cut should be enacted as part 
of a deficit package. He made it clear later, however, that it would have to be 
part of a "fair and progressive" combination of tax provisions. Similar calls 
to pair a capital gains tax cut with higher taxes for the wealthy already have 
failed to sway Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, rather than cutting the deficit, members of both parties seem 
more interested in cutting up their adversaries. One result of the sharp 
infighting may be that neither the Senate nor the House will be prepared to 
approve a deal even if the negotiators are able to bridge the remaining wide 
gaps. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the acrimony on both sides, an agreement is very, very hard to find," 
said a Republican who has been following the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the break-off last Monday night of budget negotiations being held 
at Andrews Air Force Base, Democrats were pounding a populist theme. They 
alleged that Bush's insistence on reduced capital gains taxes -- which they 
contend would bring a windfall for the rich -- is the last obstacle to an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Belatedly responding, Republicans argued that "recession Democrats" want to 
raise taxes so high that they would strangle an already shaky economy. 
Moreover, they defended their attempt to lower the tax on profits from the sale 
of stocks and other assets as the only job-creating proposal on the bargaining 
table. Steps would be taken to make sure wealthy taxpayers got no advantage 
from the package, GOP leaders declared. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrats demanded that their negotiators fashion a Democratic 
deficit-reduction plan and present it to Bush on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't cave in on our principles just to save their bacon," said Rep. Vic 
Fazio (D-Sacramento), vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, reflecting the 
angry mood of rank-and-file Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Republicans, unhappy even with GOP negotiators' tentative approval 
of some excise taxes, responded with a call to "junk the summit" and simply 
slash Democrats' favorite spending programs to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the budget talks gave widely varying and distinctly partisan 
appraisals of the outlook for an accord as the days dwindle down before 
automatic Gramm-Rudman spending cuts take effect on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress has been minuscule," Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said as he pointed 
the finger at Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"We have narrowed the gap significantly in most areas," Majority Leader 
Mitchell said in his appraisal of the same talks. "I think it can be promptly 
reconciled in all areas once we settle the tax issue." 
</P>
<P>
An examination of the last offers exchanged between negotiators at Andrews Air 
Force Base indicates that Frenzel's pessimism is closer to reality than 
Mitchell's optimism. The last-known Democratic proposal did not provide 
five-year spending reduction figures for defense or domestic programs, for 
example. And there was a vast $42-billion gap between the two sides' energy tax 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there was no meeting of the minds on how to reshape the Medicare 
program, a politically sensitive factor in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But it suited Democrats' partisan interests to portray what they called a 
"soak-the-poor" capital gains tax cut as the sole sticking point in the 
4-month-old bargaining. That's how key Democrats, including Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) and his top lieutenants in the House, described the stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Study Group, which includes most of the House Democrats, 
distributed poll results this week indicating strong public disapproval of a 
capital gains tax cut and broad support for the Democrats' efforts to raise 
taxes on the wealthiest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to take this issue to the country," one Midwestern Democrat said, 
alluding to the coming congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
However, more cautious Democrats in the Senate said that they want no part of a 
Democratic deficit-cutting plan that would raise taxes and cut spending unless 
it has the support of President Bush and the Republicans, because any such plan 
will involve politically painful decisions. 
</P>

But Republican summit participants claimed an advantage for the GOP proposal on 
grounds that a cut in capital gains taxes would spur investment, create jobs 
and help avoid a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"If we argue jobs and lower taxes and Democrats argue class envy, we win," one 
GOP strategist said, indicating his party's theme in the blame-game. 
</P>
<P>
However, a poll made public Thursday by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News 
indicated no political advantage for the White House or the 
Democratic-controlled Congress in the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
When asked who would be mostly to blame if there were no agreement on deficit 
reduction, 34% said the Bush Administration, 31% said Democrats in Congress and 
17% said both equally.

Radio newsman Atef Gawad says he felt his heart "bouncing" when, while 
broadcasting his evening show on Aug. 1, he received a telephone tip that Iraqi 
troops had just crossed the border heading south. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 minutes, Gawad, the Egyptian-born program director of the Arab Network 
of America, which has its headquarters here in Maryland, simply sat on the 
information, trying frantically to get confirmation while teasing his listeners 
with promises of "a very important announcement" to come soon. 
</P>
<P>
Then he earned a footnote in the chronicles of the Persian Gulf crisis: He 
scooped the world on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Gawad's brush with history has brought new fame, to him and to the year-old 
Arab Network of America, which beams daytime broadcasts to the thousands of 
Arab-Americans in the Washington metropolitan area from its studios 40 miles 
from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
It also has left him with a lingering fear -- he has received death threats 
from three Arab-American callers who say that his coverage was biased against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't bias," he said with a shrug. "I was reporting the invasion of a 
small country." 
</P>
<P>
Gawad said he did not take the first phone threat too seriously, but the two 
that followed made him nervous enough to call the FBI. Since then, he has 
changed his phone number and swapped cars with friends. He varies his route to 
and from work. 
</P>
<P>
When he awoke one recent morning to find his car missing from the street, he 
immediately called the police and reported that it probably had been stolen by 
disgruntled Arab-Americans. He was told it had been towed away because it was 
illegally parked. 
</P>
<P>
"See what it has done to me?" he said, laughing. "I have become paranoid. I 
suspect everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Not many people have heard of the Arab Network, although it recently expanded 
to provide programming for radio stations in Detroit and Chicago, where there 
also are large Arab-American communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the boondocks," Mohammed Bedrawi, the network's Saudi-born founder 
and owner, said as he gave directions to a visitor at the network's small 
studio in the upper story of a two-story house. "You have to take the mule 
path." 
</P>
<P>
The tiny network rents air time. The station here is so inconspicuous that even 
the staff at the physician's office below is not sure where it is. 
</P>
<P>
Gawad said he is not sure why he suddenly decided to go ahead with the report, 
even before receiving the confirmation for which he had been waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed the time had come," he said. "I didn't know I was the first 
person in the world to broadcast news of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but I 
knew the gravity of the situation. My heart was bouncing." 
</P>
<P>
Gawad, who holds a doctorate in international relations from the London School 
of Economics, insists that he anticipated the Iraqi invasion -- a claim that 
few Western officials can credibly make -- by carefully monitoring events in 
the Middle East by means of short-wave radio. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a bellicose speech on July 17, 
the anniversary of his coup in Iraq, hinted broadly at the coming conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the language Saddam Hussein used, and I thought how extremely 
unusual it was, and I thought to myself it was going to lead to something 
serious," Gawad said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that immediately after broadcasting news of the invasion, he called the 
editor of a Kuwaiti newspaper for comment. It was about 12:30 a.m. Kuwait time, 
and the editor was skeptical -- until he looked out the window and saw Iraqi 
tanks surrounding his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke the poor guy up to war," Gawad said. 
</P>
<P>
For Gawad, who spent eight years as a broadcast reporter, first at Radio Cairo 
and then with the British Broadcasting Corp., the thrill of getting a world 
scoop is still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"We take great pride in the fact that we broke the news three hours before 
President Bush was informed -- and five hours before CNN reported the story," 
he said.

NATO SHOULD DO MORE TO HELP GULF EFFORT, ITS TOP OFFICIAL SAYS

Manfred Woerner, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
declared Thursday that the alliance could play a wider role in areas of 
conflict that affect vital Western interests such as the present Persian Gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Woerner had put on record his "personal opinion" 
that NATO could and should do more to support the U.S.-led multinational force 
in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Woerner spoke out at a top-level NATO seminar called to examine the role of the 
40-year-old alliance in the aftermath of the Cold War and the end of the threat 
of a massive Soviet ground attack in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that in the United States and elsewhere, critics have 
complained that more of the 16 NATO countries should contribute troops and 
financial support for the forces deployed to counter the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO treaty prohibits the use of force beyond the territory of member 
countries. Individual governments are free to act as they wish in support of 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody thinks NATO must respond to all global challenges," Woerner said, but 
when "vital Western interests" are at stake "can we afford to be limited to 
consultations?" 
</P>
<P>
He argued that NATO members should share the burden of providing military and 
economic support in an equitable fashion. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question, he said, that Persian Gulf oil is essential to NATO 
members. And he said the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait represents a moral, military 
and economic challenge that must be met. 
</P>
<P>
The price of "allowing Iraq to escape with impunity will be paid, sooner or 
later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In supporting U.N. sanctions against Iraq, he said, the alliance was acting 
within the provisions of its charter. 
</P>
<P>
William H. Taft IV, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told the assembly: "There is 
considerable disappointment in the U.S. with the original contribution of the 
allies, the scale and importance of their effort . . . but in the last couple 
of days, the allies came to the same conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Taft pointed out that U.S. public opinion does not often make a distinction 
between the alliance and its member countries and that as separate entities 
they could support U.S. policy in the gulf if they chose to do so.

ARAB TRUCK DRIVERS STALLED BY U.N. SANCTIONS;

TRADE: JORDAN'S BELATED DECISION TO HALT MOST DEALINGS WITH IRAQ DELIVERS A

RUWEISHED, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mahmoud the fertilizer truck driver could go neither forward into Jordan nor 
back to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials told Mahmoud that no imports from Iraq are being allowed 
under U.N rules. Furthermore, in a fit of zeal, they refused to grant him a 
permit to turn around and take the fertilizer back to Iraq. Exports, they 
explained, are also prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
So for nearly two weeks, the stocky truck driver has been languishing in a kind 
of personal limbo at the Ruweished border crossing into Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it seem right to you that I cannot go in or go home?" he asked reporters 
at midweek. "If they want to enforce the punishment on Iraq, fine, but not to 
the point of craziness." 
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud's dilemma results from Jordan's decision, made after a long delay, to 
apply U.N. trade sanctions designed to pressure Iraq into withdrawing from 
conquered Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Under intense pressure from the West, Jordan has begun to restrict the flow of 
goods through its desert corridor into Iraq, to reduce it to "insignificant 
leakage," in the words of a Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Amman has posted a pair of observers at Ruweished to watch 
the comings and goings and make sure no significant breach takes place. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for trade with Iraq was reduced dramatically by the U.S.-led 
blockade of Aqaba, Jordan's port on the Red Sea. But it was still possible for 
made-in-Jordan products to be shipped overland to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's decision to comply with the U.N. sanctions, made known by way of a 
secret memo sent to government offices, has been minimized in Jordan in order 
to avoid upsetting the largely pro-Iraqi population. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing goes across," customs official Nabil Endawi said. "It is forbidden." 
</P>
<P>
More precisely, oil is still trucked in from Iraq to Jordan in repayment of a 
debt. Jordan has asked for an exception to Iraqi oil because the country is 
heavily dependent on it. The United States has been willing to look the other 
way because no money changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
Some food moves into Iraq, but the long convoys of grain trucks from Aqaba have 
disappeared. Silos at the blockaded port are empty. 
</P>
<P>
Truck drivers see themselves as victims of the sanctions, and they are unhappy 
about it. Farid Ali, whose truck was waiting in the lane reserved for vehicles 
heading for Iraq, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Before the sanctions, there was no room to park in this lot, so many trucks 
were around. Now look. Hardly anyone is here and most of the trucks are empty." 
</P>
<P>
Ali's truck was loaded with cotton, and officials told him it could not pass. 
Another truck brought chemicals, but their drivers declined to talk with 
reporters, except to say, "We are with Saddam" -- Iraq's President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the dozen or so vehicles were empty, heading to Iraq to pick up the 
furniture of refugees fleeing Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Few heavy trucks come up the road to Ruweished from Aqaba or Amman. Tire repair 
shops have closed and mechanics put in half a day at most. 
</P>
<P>
With the political decision discreetly out of the way, Jordan is bracing for 
economic hardship. In normal circumstances about half of Jordan's farm and 
manufacturing production is exported to Iraq, and estimates of what the embargo 
will cost Jordan this year range up to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Europe and Japan are expected to help, but U.S. aid is in question. King 
Hussein's support for Iraq in the crisis over Kuwait has angered several 
members of Congress. And this was not helped by the appearance in Amman this 
week of radicals calling for an attack on U.S. interests everywhere in the 
event of war. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, George Habash, the head of a Marxist faction of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, warned of terrorist reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment our finger is touching the trigger," he told reporters. "We 
will shoot the first moment Iraq is subjected to any aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Western observers in Jordan say the country's declining economic prospects will 
probably compel King Hussein to permit more and more such rhetoric, even while 
trying to keep street protests under control. 
</P>
<P>
The king was faced with food riots last year and has since tried to make room 
for wider political expression -- expression that includes Palestinian 
radicalism. 
</P>
<P>
"He will have to open the safety valve further," a West European diplomat 
commented. "The blame for economic problems will inevitably fall on the West 
since few people in Jordan openly blame Saddam Hussein for anything."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late July, about a week before Congress began its summer recess, President 
Bush and Republican members of Congress decided at a breakfast meeting that for 
one more week Bush would take the political "high road," particularly when 
discussing the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
After a week, if the budget summit produced no tangible results, all bets were 
off. Bush would feel free to make partisan attacks, and in his political 
appearances would use the White House bully pulpit to blame the Democrats for 
the failure to agree on reducing the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan was dynamited by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the massive 
deployment of American GIs. Nearly two months later, even though he faces the 
last, crucial weeks of the congressional election campaign, Bush is being 
forced to tread lightly. 
</P>
<P>
The White House has shown an ever greater sensitivity toward partisan rhetoric 
that could divide the nation as Bush seeks a powerful display of national unity 
for his Persian Gulf policy. 
</P>
<P>
"What George Bush would risk in becoming too zealous a partisan would be the 
unprecedented support he's getting in Congress" for Operation Desert Shield, 
said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University in New 
Jersey and an expert on the presidency and its relations with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The President's low-key approach was readily apparent this week on a Western 
political swing, when he campaigned for Rep. Hank Brown, who is seeking to 
represent Colorado in the U.S. Senate, and when he raised $4.4 million in 
California for Sen. Pete Wilson's gubernatorial campaign and for the state 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating his moderated tenor in San Francisco, Bush left the Democrats 
alone and stressed Wilson's "brand of environmental activism." In that arena, 
the President said, the candidate "holds a position of conviction, not 
convenience." 
</P>
<P>
It was a far cry from the George Bush who by many accounts slashed and burned 
his way through much of the 1988 presidential campaign, hurling to crowds at 
political rallies the red meat of angry attacks and trying to link his opponent 
in the public mind with, for example, convicted killer Willie Horton. 
</P>
<P>
"The sort of rhetoric available in 1988 is not really acceptable today," a 
senior White House official said in explaining the difference in tone now. 
</P>
<P>
The unresolved budget talks and the extremely uncertain situation in the 
Persian Gulf have had "a tempering influence" on the President's political 
message, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're more aware of the need to keep things together, and so they tend to 
mute the partisan rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
The decision about whether to stick with the more statesmanlike approach or to 
reactivate partisan attacks is complicated by mixed signals from the 
electorate. Voters in Massachusetts and Oklahoma have sent unmistakable signals 
of strong anti-incumbent sentiments, yet a crisis on the international scene 
generally tends to favor current officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, White House officials believe that they have little choice 
but to follow an approach to the Nov. 6 elections that leaves little room for 
sharp attacks on the Democrats, in exchange for cementing support behind the 
Persian Gulf deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, said one, "it's a very easy trade to not be able to slash and burn as 
much" in exchange for a supportive electorate. 
</P>
<P>
But the swap has come at a price. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Democrats have scored points with the public in the budget 
battle in recent weeks. One Republican adviser lamented their success in 
presenting what he described as the image of a President thwarting a solution 
to the deficit problem "to bestow benefits on the rich" by insisting on a cut 
in the capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sound-bite massacre," said Mitch Daniels, a political adviser in the 
Ronald Reagan White House. 
</P>
<P>
But the toned-down approach will last only so long, some at the White House 
say. 
</P>
<P>
As Election Day nears and the President shifts his focus from well-heeled 
fund-raising dinners to more public rallies, it is likely that he will develop 
a tougher edge to his campaigning, one White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way we're going to go," said the official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. "Some things are going to change as we move along. This will evolve 
and sharpen as we get closer to Nov. 6." 
</P>
<P>
The "wild card" Persian Gulf situation, however, has made it "very difficult to 
map out a seamless strategy" for Bush to follow in each of the weeks leading up 
to the election, the aide said. At this point, he and other White House 
insiders report, they have mapped out the days the President will travel -- and 
to some extent the candidates for whom he will campaign. But the message he 
will deliver, beyond exhorting the voters to turn out for Republicans, remains 
up in the air.

As he pondered his prospects from his sprawling campaign office one afternoon 
this week, underdog Oregon Democratic Senate candidate Harry Lonsdale took 
inspiration from electoral events a continent away. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at John Silber in Massachusetts," said Lonsdale, a businessman making his 
first bid for public office against popular incumbent Republican Mark O. 
Hatfield. From coast to coast, Lonsdale said, voters are "looking for change." 
</P>
<P>
Lonsdale has plenty of company in that assessment. The stunning victory of 
Boston University President John R. Silber in this week's Massachusetts 
gubernatorial primary -- combined with the equally surprising triumph of U.S. 
Atty. William F. Weld in the GOP contest -- has quickened the conviction among 
some political analysts that 1990 could be the year of the outsider. 
</P>
<P>
It may turn out that way, but it would be much more likely if more outsiders 
were actually on ballots. With voters appearing increasingly unhappy about 
politics as usual, politicians everywhere are fashioning themselves as 
outsiders. But true outsiders such as Lonsdale and Silber remain the 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
This year, like most years, the vast majority of people seeking high political 
office in the major states have already held political office. That means that 
even if an anti-incumbent tide develops on Election Day -- a prospect on which 
analysts remain divided -- the principal beneficiaries will be other career 
politicians, House members trying to move up to the Senate, state officeholders 
and mayors looking to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
When given the opportunity this year, voters have frequently welcomed 
candidates whose appeal is based on their lack of political experience -- a 
point resoundingly underscored by Silber's anti-Establishment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Oklahoma Democrats chose businessman David Walters over U.S. Rep. 
Wes Watkins as their gubernatorial candidate. Earlier this year, Republican 
primary voters in Arkansas, Arizona and Minnesota also picked outsider 
businessmen over politicians in gubernatorial primaries, as did Rhode Island 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Republicans nominated for governor entrepreneur Clayton W. Williams Jr. 
-- whose distance from ordinary politicians is best calculated in the kind of 
measurements astronomers use to express the distances between galaxies. And in 
Louisiana, former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke -- perhaps the ultimate 
outsider -- has shown surprising strength in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
But in Iowa, Kansas, Alaska and Illinois gubernatorial primaries, voters 
rejected outsiders. Insurgents made strong bids for the Republican Senate 
nomination in Michigan and the Democratic Senate nod in Colorado, but finally 
lost to experienced politicians running with the support of local party 
leaders. Last week in New Hampshire a wealthy businessman promising a fresh 
approach ran third in the Democratic Senate primary -- behind winner John A. 
Durkin, a former U.S. senator, and the mayor of Nashua. 
</P>
<P>
In many more races, voters have never had the opportunity to consider 
outsiders. As a result, in a year when a fresh look is turning heads, voters in 
most states will select from among the familiar. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Texas, the most competitive major state gubernatorial 
races this year -- including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Oregon, 
Iowa, Illinois and California -- are contests between veteran politicians. And 
the most hotly contested Senate races -- those in Hawaii, Nebraska, Iowa, 
Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Montana and North Carolina -- involve candidates 
who have already held executive or legislative office. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, this phenomenon reflects the advantages that politicians have 
in competitive primaries with inexperienced and little-known newcomers. But 
often it has more to do with the way the national parties and leading 
fund-raisers search out potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have grown more receptive to non-traditional candidates in recent 
years, both parties still focus their candidate recruitment efforts on proven 
electoral commodities. "When you're filling a pigeon hole," said Michelle M. 
Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors' Assn., "you find a 
pigeon." 
</P>
<P>
As experienced campaigners, politicians from lower-ballot offices are 
considered less likely to wilt under the spotlight of Senate and gubernatorial 
races than outsiders such as Silber and Williams -- both of whom have detonated 
verbal land mines with astounding frequency during their brief political 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, experienced politicians, because they have established 
networks of support, are seen as the most capable of raising the huge sums it 
takes to run for office. Outsiders can face a vicious cycle, because they lack 
the embrace of respected party figures they often have difficulty raising 
money. Also, the lack of fund-raising success causes the press to dismiss them 
as marginal candidates unworthy of serious attention. 
</P>
<P>
Given that dilemma, it's not surprising that most successful outsiders of 
recent years have been businessmen who lavished their own money on their 
campaigns. Clayton Williams has had the loosest wallet this year, but Democrats 
Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Herbert Kohl of Wisconsin have won Senate 
seats in recent years by pounding opponents with their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
For outsider candidates, the biggest hurdle is convincing voters they have the 
experience to manage government, pollsters say. But this year, the widespread 
belief that politicians have mismanaged government may open voters to new 
approaches -- especially in the gubernatorial races where the many businessmen 
on the ballot are promising to apply their management experience to clean up 
the mess. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a real sense that outsiders -- if they have a plan -- are being 
listened to with greater credibility than the politicians are," Davis said.

A Boeing 707 crashed and caught fire Thursday while taking off en route to an 
aircraft graveyard at nearby Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, killing one crew 
member and injuring two others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was taking off from Pinal Air Park when it made a sharp right turn 
and the right wing hit the ground, said David Fowler, president of the 
Evergreen Air Center Inc., which operates the airport for Pinal County.

LUXURY STORES HELP CUSTOMERS LAUNDER MONEY, U.S. AGENTS FIND

Undercover agents said Thursday that a nine-city investigation shows it is 
ridiculously easy to launder money by buying cars, jewelry and other luxuries 
for cash from stores that ignore reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the most shocking testimony I've heard in my 12 years in the 
U.S. Congress," Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.) said at a House hearing after 
congressional investigators had delivered their report. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate salesmen, rug sellers and other dealers in high-cost items proved 
willing to help them get around a law requiring a report to the Internal 
Revenue Service of any cash transaction over $10,000, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
They told a House Ways and Means panel that they posed as purchasers with cash 
and a passion for anonymity, arranging to buy items worth $4.2 million from 79 
businesses in nine states over five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Agents Barney Gomez and Leigh Jackson said they always insisted they did not 
want their names sent to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall results of our investigation were quite astonishing and indicated 
to us a blatant and knowing disregard for the filing requirements," Gomez said 
at the oversight subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Representatives from 76 of the 79 businesses we visited expressed both a 
willingness to accept cash in excess of $10,000 for the sale of an item and not 
report it to the IRS and to register the sale under a false name, a company 
name or as a 'cash sale,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by subcommittee Chairman J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), Gomez said 
that just three reports of cash transactions in excess of $10,000 have been 
filed thus far this year in the cocaine-plagued District of Columbia. By 
comparison, 200 have been filed in Virginia and 209 in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of this investigation are appalling," Pickle said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a whole category of people who are willing to take cash for almost 
anything," Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) said. "This is shameful." 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, they visited businesses in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, 
Detroit, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, New York, San Antonio and the nation's 
capital.

HIGH RURAL-AREA SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOUND

Rural areas have arrest rates for drug- and alcohol-related offenses as high as 
cities do, according to government researchers, who recommend that rural states 
pool their resources to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, in a report released Thursday by several 
rural-state senators, found also that most prison inmates in sparsely populated 
states have abused alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Substance abuse is so common among inmates that treatment programs are 
"completely overwhelmed," the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a problem in the rural parts of this country," Sen. Kent Conrad 
(D-N.D.) said. "It's not just an urban problem. We need resources to deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
GAO investigators agreed, noting that "public, scholarly and policy-maker 
attention" has been focused on "high-intensity" drug zones in major cities and 
along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
"Much less attention has been paid to less densely populated rural areas 
farther removed from the coasts or the country's southern border," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rural areas and small towns have lower arrest rates for illegal drug use but 
higher rates for alcohol-related offenses. Total arrest rates for substance 
abuse are as high in rural areas as in cities, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
In studies of prison systems in Arkansas, Iowa, Montana and North Dakota, 
researchers found that the majority of inmates have problems with substance 
abuse. Ninety-one percent of Montana's inmates had abused alcohol or drugs, as 
had 75% in Iowa, 73% in North Dakota and 71% in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
The senators complained that formulas passed by Congress in 1988 tended to give 
urban areas more than their fair share of federal funding for drug interdiction 
and treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure we're not discriminated against," Sen. Dale Bumpers 
(D-Ark.) said. "We feel as strongly about the drug problem as anybody does." 
</P>
<P>
Rural drug programs cost more to run because of the relatively small number of 
clients, and rural areas have difficulty finding and retaining experienced 
staff.

BUSINESSES CONNIVE IN MONEY LAUNDERING, PANEL REPORTS

Congressional investigators said businesses are routinely conniving with 
customers to circumvent money-laundering laws requiring large cash transactions 
be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses from across our land are willing to assist others in laundering 
money and evading taxes for a quick buck," said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), 
chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1984 law, businesses are required to report to the IRS all transactions 
that involve more than $10,000 in cash. The purpose was to help the IRS 
identify taxpayers with large cash incomes that might otherwise be 
under-reported. 
</P>
<P>
However, the subcommittee investigators found that car dealers, jewelers, yacht 
salesmen and others are willing to ignore the law in order to make big cash 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It is shocking that businesses throughout the country are routinely conniving 
with customers to violate the law," Pickle said during a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee investigators reported on their visits to 79 businesses 
nationwide.

CRIME FEARS CRAMP NEW YORKERS' STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: CAUTION IS THE WATCHWORD AS LURID SLAYINGS GRAB HEADLINES. BUT SOME 
OFFICIALS INSIST THE CITY IS NOT THAT DANGEROUS, NOR THE SITUATION NEW.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fueled by a series of spectacular incidents and constant media attention 
ranging from the cover of Time and People magazines to local tabloids and 
television, fear of crime is changing the way many New Yorkers live. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other residents, Herbert J. Sturz, a former deputy mayor for criminal 
justice, has routinely put "mugger's money" for potential holdup men in his 
pocket when he goes out late at night. But even that precaution is no longer 
reassuring to Stutz, who has stopped taking late night walks from his upper 
East Side Manhattan apartment to purchase the first edition of his morning 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think crime is a real consideration in neighborhoods that used to feel 
secure," said Michael Taylor, president of Precision Films Inc., who lives just 
a few blocks away from Sturz. Taylor no longer rides the subway. His 
14-year-old son Matthew never takes a ball to play basketball at a nearby 
public school -- one of the most desirable in Manhattan -- because roaming 
young gangs steal athletic equipment. Several of Matthew's friends have been 
mugged on a playground further uptown. 
</P>
<P>
David Baker went jogging around the Central Park reservoir well after dark last 
Sunday night. When he returned to his upper West Side Manhattan apartment, his 
wife clearly was worried about him. She wouldn't have reacted that way a year 
ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, a 3rd-degree black belt in Shorin Ryu karate, is director of the Midtown 
Karate Dojo in Manhattan. He said that during the summer, enrollment at his 
school increased by 35%. Some other schools also report larger than usual 
numbers of students signing up for the martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
These fears of random violence are magnified in poorer neighborhoods, where 
crime is much more prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
The fact New York last year ranked ninth in homicide statistics below such 
cities as Washington, Detroit, New Orleans and Dallas seems largely ignored in 
the face of all the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Crime, always a front-page item here, has received unparalleled attention in 
recent days. Brian Watkins, a 22-year-old tourist from Provo, Utah, was stabbed 
to death Sept. 2 in the subway trying to protect his mother from a gang who 
wanted money to go dancing. Three days earlier, a deputy district attorney was 
slain in a random shooting in the Bronx and a Brooklyn politician was shot to 
death. Earlier in the month, three teen-agers were convicted in the gang rape 
of a woman jogger in Central Park in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show violent crime rising rapidly in Manhattan -- up 25.3% 
for homicides, 19.2% for robberies and 15.5% for assaults compared to three 
years ago. The statistics mirror trends in the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Subway crime is particularly threatening to many riders. For the first six 
months of this year, overall felonies in the subway system rose 17% while 
robberies increased by 22%. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a high level of violent rampant crime in the city and it is very 
disturbing to people," said Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau. "People 
are very concerned about it, and they have a right to be concerned about it. 
But that does not mean that people should leave the city." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in private and public conversations, the topic of leaving seems 
at least as high as during the dark days of New York's fiscal crisis of the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A poll of 1,000 New Yorkers taken for Time magazine and Cable News Network by 
Yankelovich Clancy Shulman accompanied a Time cover story this month highly 
critical of the city. The poll found 59% would move somewhere else if they 
could select where they could live. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents have mixed their perceptions of crime with performance 
appraisals of Mayor David N. Dinkins, who promised during his campaign last 
year to become the toughest mayor on crime the city has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mayor's critics charge that he has been slow to anger and even 
slower to react to the crime crisis, more concerned about matters of style than 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins has responded by seeking to mobilize clergymen and neighborhood groups 
in a crusade against crime, and ordering Police Commissioner Lee Brown to come 
up with plans by Oct. 1 to increase the number of officers on the streets. He 
also has shared with New Yorkers his own fear of what it was like to be robbed 
at gunpoint while working in a Harlem liquor store 38 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This week he said that recent concern about crime was based on well-publicized 
incidents and attacks in neighborhoods outside of poor minority areas of the 
city, where the problems of crime and violence are not new. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had this problem, and now I guess it has gone beyond our borders and 
others have become concerned," Dinkins said in a radio interview on a New York 
station with a largely minority audience. "Fact of the matter is we have been 
concerned since day one." 
</P>
<P>
Morgenthau said the crime wave really started in 1985 -- well before the 
Dinkins Administration. He now fears the chorus of calls for more street police 
will come at the expense of detectives who are badly needed for investigations 
and other components of the criminal justice system, including the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for reelection, called for hiring 5,000 
more policemen but has promised no additional state funds. U.S. Sen. Alfonse M. 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) argued that 4,400 more police could be hired by putting off 
repairs on roads, bridges and subways.

DOCTORS BACK OFF SURGERY FOR BOY

<P>
It now appears that the parents of a 6-year-old Hmong boy will not be pressured 
into having court-ordered surgery to correct his club feet and a congenitally 
defective hip after all. State and federal judges have said that Kou Xiong 
should have the surgery over the objections of his parents because the 
afflictions will leave him a cripple for life if not corrected. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fresno County Social Services officials said that, despite a court 
order for the surgery, they have been unable to find a doctor willing to 
perform the operations without the parents' cooperation. Kou's parents went to 
court to keep the county from forcing the restoration operations. They 
contended that their religious beliefs hold that their son's feet were 
misshapen because God made them that way to atone for an ancestor's sins.

BRAZIL TRIES TO RID YANOMAMI INDIAN LANDS OF GOLD PROSPECTORS; 
</P>
<P>
AMAZON: THE INTRUDERS BRING THE THREAT OF DISEASE AND RAVAGE HUNTING GROUNDS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Delays in government help for Brazil's beleaguered Yanomami Indians have 
permitted thousands of invading gold prospectors to remain on Indian homelands, 
exposing the Yanomamis to disease and ravaging their traditional hunting 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 5, armed prospectors entered a Yanomami village and killed two 
Indians, including a chieftain known as Lourenco. Indians killed two 
prospectors in the clash, which reflected the deadly nature of the struggle 
over Yanomami lands. 
</P>
<P>
Indian rights advocates in Brazil say that since 1987, 1,000 to 2,000 of 
Brazil's 9,000 Yanomamis have died from disease or malnutrition as a result of 
the prospector invasion. Because they are the largest group among the dwindling 
native peoples of the Brazilian Amazon region, the struggle of the Yanomamis 
has drawn international attention. 
</P>
<P>
In January, police acting on a court order began removing about 20,000 
prospectors from the Yanomami lands, which extend along the Venezuelan border 
of Roraima state in far northwestern Brazil. But last week, officials in the 
independent attorney general's office in Brasilia said that between 2,000 and 
3,000 prospectors remain in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds, heavy seasonal rains and political maneuvering are some of the 
reasons given for delays in evicting prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials now say they are preparing a final push that will remove 
all unwelcome outsiders from the area of 36,000 square miles. A health program 
for the Indians is to be carried out at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Most of about $2 million in funding for the project, called Operation Yanomami, 
has been tied up for weeks in bureaucratic red tape at the Economics Ministry. 
The operation is being planned by the National Indian Foundation, a government 
agency known as Funai. 
</P>
<P>
Cantidio Guerreiro Guimaraes, a retired air force sergeant who was appointed 
president of the agency in August, said the money will soon be released and 
that the operation will begin this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the rains to cease for us to (complete) the removal of the 
prospectors," Guimaraes said. "They are going to be removed by helicopter and 
left outside the area." He said equipment used by prospecting groups, including 
airplanes and dredges, will be confiscated if found in the Yanomami area. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Guimaraes said, "We want to finish the operation, leave the 
area free (of prospectors), by the 28th of December." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that it may take 20 years for Yanomami hunting grounds to recover 
from depredation by the prospectors, who have deforested large areas, polluted 
rivers with mercury and torn up river beds in their search for gold. Mining 
activity and environmental damage have severely reduced the availability of 
vital fish and game. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, those areas are going to be of very little use to the Yanomami Indians, 
because they are practically destroyed," Guimaraes said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Carlos Libanio, executive secretary of a liberal lobbying group called 
Nucleus for Indian Rights, said President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took 
office in March, has not taken strong action against the invading prospectors 
for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors and gold traders are powerful interest groups in Roraima state 
politics. According to Libanio, Collor wants them to support his allies in Oct. 
3 elections for state offices and the national Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernardo Cabral, Collor's justice minister, said the president is 
firmly on the side of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"President Collor's objective is to treat Indian reservations as a kind of 
sanctuary," Cabral said. "The Collor government is not going to permit 
prospectors to continue invading Indian territory, carrying diseases into the 
Indian territory."

A RASH OF SEWAGE SPILLS PLAGUES OLD OXNARD LINE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING 31 RELEASES SINCE MAY SAY ONE 
CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS THE SYSTEM LACKS ANY INCLINES TO HELP MOVE THE 
EFFLUENT.

<P>
In the last four months, the Oxnard sewer system has released more than 10,700 
gallons of sewage, some of it raw and untreated, onto city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The number of spills is far higher than any other city in the county and 
worries both city and county officials, who blame an aging sewer system that 
was built on flat terrain with no inclines to help move the sewage. 
</P>
<P>
County officials recently investigated the Oxnard system after receiving 
reports of eight sewage releases during August. However, the investigation 
found no link among the spills. 
</P>
<P>
Between May 21 and Sept. 9, there were 31 sewage spills in Oxnard -- from one 
gallon to 3,000 gallons -- according to county reports. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, there was only one other sewage spill in the county: a 
2,000-gallon spill in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Because industries sometimes dump hazardous wastes into the city's sewage 
system, the spills are a potential health danger, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of spills in Oxnard worries the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, board spokesman John Lewis said. However, the board will only 
assess fines on a city if a spill larger than 1,000 gallons pollutes a river, 
lake or ocean, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The water quality control board can levy fines of up to $5,000 a day for such 
spills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has had four spills of more than 1,000 gallons since May, 
none have gone directly into a river, lake or ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"True, the number of occasions is a concern to us, but we realize they are 
working with an old system," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the Oxnard system are almost 90 years old, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Williamson, a supervisor for the county Environmental Health Department, 
said the August spills prompted his department to investigate the city's 
system, but all the releases appeared to be "separate and isolated." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that Oxnard sits in the middle of a flat plain, and 
sewer pipes tend to back up because the system does not have hills and valleys 
to move the sewage to the city's treatment plant on 6001 S. Perkins Road, said 
Tim Nanson, Oxnard's acting public works director. 
</P>
<P>
Most other cities in the county were built on hills or inclines, and without 
the help of gravity, "it's going to be difficult to keep the sewer line going," 
said Terry Gilday, a technical supervisor for the county Environmental Health 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nanson pointed out that Oxnard's system also serves Point Mugu and Port Hueneme 
and processes about 17 million gallons of sewage a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the size of the city and nature of the situation, some type of 
spill is always likely to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high number of spills, most complaints to the city about the sewers 
are from businesses or apartment complexes where a stoppage begins, said Robert 
Montgomery, a city environmental health supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
He said few residents complain because they don't recognize a sewage spill when 
they see it. "The average citizen may see water along the side of the street, 
and they think it's just storm water or something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Manion, who lives in the 5200 block of Whitecap Street, had no problem 
recognizing a 50-gallon spill near his home earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just oozing water, and it really smelled," he said. "It was definitely 
sewage." 
</P>
<P>
Manion said he called the city to complain and within 25 minutes the mess was 
cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
"The city did a good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to county records, 3,000 gallons of sewage spilled last month in 
front of the Channel Islands Village Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Lange, the general manager of the apartment complex, saw that spill 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city cleaned up the mess quickly, but he complained that soon 
afterward he received a bill of almost $700 from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If something happens like that, the city is responsible," he said. "I 
shouldn't have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Lange said the problem was in the city's sewer system. However, the city said 
it bills residents if they were responsible for the backup. 
</P>
<P>
On May 22, about 1,000 gallons of raw sewage seeped out of a manhole and onto 
the streets in the 3000 block of Via Marina Avenue. The sewage was treated with 
chlorine and washed into a storm drain that empties into Mandalay Bay. Tests of 
the water revealed bacteria counts 160 times the state's standard for safe 
water for swimming, but no warning notices were posted because the bay is 
usually not used for swimming, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria dissipated within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The county Environmental Health Department drafts weekly reports on all 
"illegal discharges of hazardous waste that are likely to cause substantial 
injury to public health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
According to those reports, most of the spills in the last four months were 
less than 100 gallons and occurred in residential and commercial neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of spills is high, Nanson said, there were far more three 
years ago before the city automated the 23 pumps that keep the sewage moving 
through the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, city workers drove from pump to pump to make sure they were 
operating correctly, Nanson said. The city is working on a project to replace 
three of those pumps with one large pump near the treatment plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even with this improvement, spills are unavoidable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Oxnard is responsible for cleanup, and the county checks to make 
sure the job is done properly, Gilday said. "So far, the city has done a fairly 
good job," he said.

MEMOS DETAIL POLICE RESPONSE TO DRUG RAID; 
</P>
<P>
SUIT: TWO CONFIDENTIAL LAPD DOCUMENTS SHOW MID-LEVEL OFFICERS UNDERPLAYED THEIR 
MISTAKES WHILE OTHERS TRIED TO CIRCUMVENT AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the questionable police conduct in the drug raid at 39th Street and Dalton 
Avenue began to dawn on the Los Angeles Police Department's hierarchy, various 
supervisors went to great pains to blame each other, a key lieutenant was 
advised to "keep a lid" on the case, and not a single police division "was 
willing to claim responsibility" for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
That chain of events is detailed in two confidential management memos that 
analyzed why police officers got out of hand, leaving two apartment buildings a 
shambles in the August, 1988, drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
The memos, including one to Chief Daryl F. Gates from Assistant Chief Robert 
Vernon, provide insight into how some mid-level police officials initially 
underplayed their mistakes in the raid in southwest Los Angeles, and how others 
attempted to circumvent an internal police investigation by blaming gangs for 
trashing the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the desire for aggressive law enforcement, tempered by 
respect for the law and basic human rights, was not properly instilled in a 
balanced manner in the police officers," Vernon advised Gates. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers' improper conduct and supervisors' failure to take corrective 
action is inexcusable," he wrote. "However, management must acknowledge its 
fair share of the blame. The personnel problems and chain of command confusion 
were well known by area command staff, yet they were allowed to continue." 
</P>
<P>
The memos surfaced publicly earlier this month as exhibits in a lawsuit filed 
in U.S. District Court, where owners of some of the apartment buildings are 
suing the city of Los Angeles, the Police Department, individual officers and 
top city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment owners' attorney, Stephen Yagman, obtained the documents only 
after securing a court order, despite the city's contention that the memos were 
privileged because their public dissemination would violate the rights of some 
of the police officers involved in the raid. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also had refused to release the memos because a protective order 
banning their release remains in effect in Los Angeles Municipal Court, where 
four of the officers are standing trial on criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
In a sometimes heated, sometimes comical hearing Thursday before U.S. 
Magistrate Joseph Reichmann, Yagman argued that dozens of police officers are 
either refusing to attend or walking out of hearings where they were summoned 
to give sworn depositions. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Yagman said that out of 30 to 40 depositions scheduled for this 
week, "only three or four officers have shown up." 
</P>
<P>
He alleged that even top police managers, including Vernon, Deputy Chief 
William Rathburn and Cmdr. Ernest Curtsinger, evaded his depositions that had 
been set for that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, the lawyer said, "I was advised that Curtsinger was in 
Florida, Rathburn was on a 10-day vacation, and Vernon either was on vacation 
or couldn't be there." 
</P>
<P>
He also contended that other officers are refusing to answer questions about 
the twomanagement memos, as well as allegations that some officers were 
encouraged by a captain to "kick ass" in fighting gangs and that officers later 
ordered dozens of people detained at the site to march out of the apartments 
"whistling the tune to 'The Andy Griffith Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
"This is a police department out of control and these hidden documents are 
basically evidence of that," Yagman told the magistrate. He referred to the top 
police administrators as "Nazis" and said their conduct in trying to shield the 
memos was both "cynical and reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
Visibly irritated, Deputy City Atty. David Hotchkiss, who is representing the 
police brass in the civil lawsuit, angrily replied that he resented Yagman's 
characterizations. "I'll be damned if I'll be labeled like Mr. Yagman suggests 
as being fraudulent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hotchkiss said police officers have attempted to comply with deposition 
notices, but that Yagman has been extremely difficult to deal with and has 
acted in a rude and unprofessional manner. He described an incident Wednesday 
at Yagman's law office in Venice, where he said the attorney "slammed the door 
of his office in my face." 
</P>
<P>
James Wilson, an attorney for Capt. Thomas D. Elfmont, the highest ranking of 
four officers being criminally prosecuted in state court for the raid, told the 
magistrate he objected to Yagman's description of police officers as "Nazis." 
Wilson quipped that there are more Democrats and Republicans in the Police 
Department than Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
In a rejoinder that drew loud laughter in the courtroom, Yagman fired back: "I 
was always under the impression that Republicans and Nazis were one in the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the hearing, Reichmann directed the two sides to clear up their 
difficulties and resume the deposition process. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 police officers took part in the raid in two apartment buildings near 
the intersection of 39th Street and Dalton Avenue. Apartment residents later 
complained that police, armed with a battering ram, tore apart the apartment 
units, destroyed appliances and other property, and spray-painted "LAPD Rules" 
on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Gates conceded in June, 1989, that three dozen officers were being disciplined 
for their roles in the raid, an acknowledgment the chief made two months after 
receiving Assistant Chief Vernon's "executive summary and management analysis" 
of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In that memo, Vernon implied that some officers attempted to cover up their 
misconduct, noting that Capt. Terrence Dyment of the department's Internal 
Affairs Division, which investigates police wrongdoing, was not told of the 
incident for several days. 
</P>
<P>
"Capt. Dyment was initially led to believe that gang members were responsible 
for much of the damage and IAD assistance would not be needed," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon also advised Gates that "repeated failures to follow the chain of 
command and fix responsibility at all levels . . . caused confusion and 
frustration during both the planning and execution" of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
"Each level of supervision and command within OSB (the department's South 
Bureau Operations division) realized, or should have realized, that the chain 
of command was routinely violated and responsibility was not clear," the 
assistant chief wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wrote that because the raid was conducted by officers from various 
patrols and units, there was initial confusion and finger pointing as to who 
was most responsible and which commands should shoulder the blame. Vernon also 
strongly chastised Elfmont, noting that he had been repeatedly warned not to 
incite his officers to go too far during drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
A second memo written in March, 1989, by two administrative sergeants and sent 
to Cmdr. George Morrison, the Police Department's chief of staff, detailed how 
some commanding officers claimed they did not know of the raid until hearing it 
from the news media, and that "one to three weeks" went by before they realized 
some of their subordinates were involved. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the report said, Capt. Robert McVey, acting commanding officer of the 
South Bureau Operations division, "stated that he did not receive any 
notification about the Dalton Street incident prior to, during, or after the 
search warrant was served." 
</P>
<P>
The report also describes a conversation between Elfmont and then-Lt. Enrique 
Hernandez, acting commanding officer of the Southwest patrol division. "Lt. 
Hernandez stated that Capt. Elfmont told him to initiate an investigation but 
to 'keep a lid' on the incident," the report said.

BLUE LINE TRAIN KILLS WOMAN, 66, CROSSING TRACKS; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: MOTHER OF 11 BECOMES FIRST FATALITY SINCE NEW COMMUTER LIGHT RAIL 
LINE OPENED IN JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Watts woman became the first fatality on the new light rail line between Los 
Angeles and Long Beach when she was struck by a train Wednesday evening while 
crossing the tracks at an intersection within sight of her house. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Ceballos, 66, was on her way to church at about 5:30 p.m. when she was hit 
head-on by a southbound, Blue Line train traveling at full speed through the 
crossing at Century Boulevard and South Graham Avenue, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the accident, some insisting the warning 
lights and gates were not operating when the train entered the intersection and 
others saying they were. 
</P>
<P>
"She walked right into the train. The arms were down. The red lights were 
blinking," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Sharon Madison, who was on 
the train as part of a routine security patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Madison emphatically dismissed reports that the line's warning signals had not 
worked as they should. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," she said. "I don't know if she didn't hear it. I don't know 
if she didn't see it or saw it and panicked. 
</P>
<P>
"We were passing Century Boulevard," the sergeant continued. "The train was 
beginning to brake and we didn't know why. The driver was laying on the horn. 
We looked out the window to see what the problem was and I saw her (the victim) 
bouncing along the train." 
</P>
<P>
The train stopped just beyond the intersection and Madison said she ran back to 
find Ceballos on top of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of 11, Ceballos died a short time later at Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, which built the 19-mile-long line. 
</P>
<P>
The accident -- which disrupted service for about 45 minutes -- was the most 
serious on the line since it opened with much fanfare in July. 
</P>
<P>
"This just absolutely stunned us," said Stephanie Brady, the commission's media 
relations director. "I don't understand why she didn't heed the warning signs. 
We're confident we made every possible allowance -- noise, lights, horns -- to 
warn of coming trains." 
</P>
<P>
Brady said there have been a few minor brushes between cars and trains since 
the system got under way. A teen-ager lost several toes while playing a game of 
"dare" with a train near downtown Los Angeles in late July. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's fatality will be investigated by both Los Angeles police and the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District, which operates the system. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who attended church almost daily, lived with one of her children in 
the 9900 block of South Graham Avenue just a few feet behind another family 
house that faces the light rail tracks. As twilight fell Wednesday, family 
members stood in the dusty front yard, tears wetting their faces. 
</P>
<P>
"A little boy, he told me, your mother is over there," said one of Ceballos' 
sons, Magdaleno Barrientos. He went to the tracks to find out what happened. 
"And they (authorities) say, 'Stay over there.' " 
</P>
<P>
A granddaughter said that Ceballos had neither hearing nor sight problems. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who said they saw the accident maintained that the warning gates 
lining both sides of the crossing did not come down until after the train 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"The gates weren't down. The horns weren't blowing at all," said Clara Domingo, 
who was getting into her car when Ceballos was struck nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But on the other side of the tracks, Manuel Jaramillio, a security guard at an 
apartment complex, backed up Madison's account. 
</P>
<P>
"The gates were down. The lights were going. The driver was blowing his horn. I 
was wondering if she was going to take that chance," said Jaramillio, who 
regularly watches the sleek new cars as they whisk between Los Angeles and Long 
Beach at 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillio said he often sees pedestrians take risks at the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"They like to play tag, it seems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While wooden gates block the path of cars when a train passes through the 
Century and Graham intersection, there is room for pedestrians to walk by the 
gates and past warning lights and bells onto the four tracks, which carry both 
freight trains and the Blue Line cars.

PATROL: POLICE ROLL AGAINST CRIME IN HOLLYWOOD. THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE 
OFFICERS' MOBILITY AND STOP CRIME BY SNEAKING UP ON WRONGDOERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sgt. Jim Blum loaded his 9-millimeter Beretta pistol, checked the gears and 
brakes on his 18-speed mountain bicycle and quietly pedaled Thursday night into 
Los Angeles police history. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 p.m., Blum and nine other Hollywood Division officers launched the 
department's first full-time urban patrol on bicycles. The goal: to increase 
the officers' mobility and stop crime by sneaking up on drug dealers, purse 
snatchers and other wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
As he prepared for his first bike patrol, Blum, 36, said the chief 
crime-stopping advantage of a bicycle is simply being on wheels in the open 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on a bike, you can hear crime, you see it, you smell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And it's easier to surprise crooks. After all, Blum asked, "when's the last 
time you saw a cop on a bike?" 
</P>
<P>
The patrols will operate on the streets around Highland Avenue and Hollywood 
Boulevard -- an area with "hot spots" of narcotic sales and street 
prostitution. Burglaries from vehicles and assaults on the camera-toting 
tourists who visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame are also common. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is not the first city to establish bicycle patrols. Seattle 
pioneered the tactic in 1987. Now, 28 pedaling cops patrol citywide. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department established a bicycle 
patrol in neighboring West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Some LAPD officers also patrol the bike paths at Venice Beach. But Thursday's 
action marks the first use of bicycles in an urban setting of alleys and 
speeding vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Police and city officials will assess the unit's effectiveness in three to six 
months. Blum said more bicycle units could be created to patrol in other police 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The officers chosen to participate in the program -- all volunteers -- 
underwent 32 hours of training to learn to negotiate through the heavy weekend 
traffic of cruisers. Since they will be pedaling for almost an entire 
eight-hour shift, they also worked on their physical conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Burt Feldtz, 26, seemed a little apprehensive about his new assignment. 
But mostly, he was eager to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have a steel cage around you like in a car," he said. "But as long 
as we keep our eyes open, I think we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Before departing, Blum gave Feldtz and the other officers a quick pep talk at 
the Hollywood Division station house. 
</P>
<P>
"Be good to the good guys," he told his troops. "And book the bad people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And let's have some fun out there." 
</P>
<P>
A short while later, the eight policemen and two policewomen guided their bikes 
north on Wilcox Avenue toward Sunset Boulevard, illuminated by the headlights 
of passing automobiles. Almost immediately, they were greeted by the surprised 
stares of passersby. 
</P>
<P>
One tough-talking teen-ager standing at the corner of Sunset and Wilcox said he 
didn't much like the idea of cops on bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in cars. That's bad enough," he said. "Now you won't be able to go 
anywhere. It's not going to be as free as it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Raymundo Camacho, 18, interjected: "They're going to get tired. I can't last on 
a bike more than four hours. What are we going to see them riding next? 
Skateboards?" 
</P>
<P>
By late Thursday, no arrests had been reported by the bike patrol.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARENTS TO BE REUNITED WITH KIDNAPED BABY 
BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood couple were to be reunited Thursday with their kidnaped 1-year-old 
son, who was recovered in Florida after he was allegedly spirited away last 
month by his baby-sitter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Marta and Miguel Perez, both 24, were flown to Miami to pick up their son, 
Raul, after police discovered the infant living with the baby-sitter and her 
boyfriend in a Miami apartment, said Hollywood Division detective Mike Fino.

The baby-sitter, Rosa Posada, 34, was arrested and booked into Dade County Jail 
on suspicion of kidnaping. Posada is expected to be returned to Los Angeles to 
face charges after an extradition hearing Friday, said Fino. Her boyfriend was 
not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Fino said Posada took Raul from his Hollywood home the evening of Aug. 23 
because, although she had been hired to baby-sit the infant and his brother 
only two days before, "she had developed an attraction with the child and 
wanted to raise him."

<P>
The Moorpark school board -- invited to a meeting with the City Council to try 
to resolve a two-year dispute over the sale of a school -- agreed to meet but 
not in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Patty Waters said the district is willing to negotiate but not 
at a joint session. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is five board members in one room and five council members in 
another, with our written proposals presented to them by our attorney, and they 
respond through their attorney." 
</P>
<P>
The school district and the city have battled over the downtown school property 
for more than two years, and each agency has sued the other. The district wants 
to develop the property with high-density housing, while the city contends that 
such development would bring too much traffic to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be suicide for the school district to go into an open meeting with 
the city with the current lawsuits," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Eloise Brown said she was astonished when she heard the district's 
newest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"My thinking right now is that we send another letter to them asking for a 
joint meeting. They most certainly couldn't have read the first one. I say, 
let's go through this exercise again." GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

A search team scouring the Angeles National Forest Thursday discovered the 
charred wreckage of a private plane that had been missing since Wednesday. The 
body of the pilot was reported found in the wreckage. 
</P>

The cream-colored Piper 28 was found at Deer Springs Branch in Eaton Canyon, 
near Mt. Wilson, by 70-year-old retired Air Force Lt. Col. Keith Kelly, who is 
a member of a Civil Air Patrol search-and-rescue team. Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies confirmed one body was found in the wreckage, believed to be 
that of the pilot, 64-year-old Floyd McCollough. 
</P>
<P>
McCollough, of El Centro, took off from Burbank Airport Wednesday afternoon 
headed for the Imperial Airport but never arrived, Civil Air Patrol spokesman

TRENCH CAVE-IN KILLS RANCH HAND 
</P>

<P>
A Fillmore ranch hand died after being buried alive Thursday when a 
seven-foot-deep irrigation trench collapsed on him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Casas, 58, was buried beneath three feet of dirt and mud for about 15 
minutes before rescuers reached him and took him to Ventura County Medical 
Center, Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said, adding that Casas died during surgery 
three hours after the 10:25 a.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health later sent inspectors 
to the citrus farm on California 126 to investigate, said Rick Rise, division 
spokesman in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Rivcom Corp., which operates the ranch four miles west of Fillmore, could face 
severe fines if the trench walls were not braced as required by industrial 
safety laws, Rise said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, Casas was repairing an irrigation pipe at the 
bottom of the wet trench, which was about 4 feet wide by 20 feet long, Fillmore 
Fire Chief Pat Askren said. 
</P>
<P>
Casas was crouched down welding an under-section of the pipe when the sandy 
walls of the trench gave way and covered him, Askren said. 
</P>
<P>
A co-worker began digging furiously to find Casas while a second co-worker 
drove to the nearest phone three miles away, Askren said. Rescue workers dug 
Casas out about 15 minutes later, but their efforts to revive him were 
complicated by the presence of mud in his air passages, Askren said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AFTER VIOLENT PARTY, HOTEL GETS WARNING ON 
PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood city attorney's office has sent a sharply worded letter to the 
hotel where a party erupted in violence earlier this month, threatening 
prosecution if hotel officials do not comply with occupancy limits or get city 
permits for future gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are still investigating whether the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel on 
South Prairie Avenue violated city law by failing to get a permit for the Sept. 
1 party that left one guest dead and several injured. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials said in a statement that several discrepancies in the 
Days Inn booking process may have contributed to the outbreak of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Edward Vincent expressed anger at hotel manager Kay Hong's comment that 
part of the reason for the violence was the neighborhood where the hotel was 
located, which she called a "hot spot." Vincent said the police investigation 
has found that the party-goers were from out of town.

ARRESTS BY TORRANCE POLICE MAY BE BREAK IN ROLEX ROBBERIES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: MAN IS ACCUSED OF ROBBING TWO ATTORNEYS. POLICE ALSO RECOVER WATCHES 
FROM A JEWELER WHO WAS BOOKED ON SUSPICION OF RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY.

<P>
A man arrested by Torrance detectives on suspicion of robbing two attorneys may 
be linked to a series of Rolex watch robberies throughout the county, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they also have arrested a Los Angeles jeweler in connection with 
the case and confiscated 91 watches from his store, including 11 Rolexes. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Newman, 25, of Los Angeles was taken into custody last Friday after his 
fingerprints were found in the Torrance office of attorney John Cheroske, who 
had been robbed at gunpoint two days earlier by a man pretending to be a 
prospective client. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, who was arraigned Wednesday, pleaded not guilty to two robbery counts, 
one count of attempted murder, two counts of assault with a firearm and two 
counts of being an ex-convict with a gun. He was ordered held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Torrance detectives arrested the jeweler, Farhad Keshmiri, 
25, of Los Angeles, on suspicion of receiving stolen property, Sgt. Dennis 
Addington said. Cheroske's $12,000 Rolex watch was recovered in Keshmiri's 
downtown Los Angeles jewelry store, called Jewelry 2000, Addington said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also confiscated 10 other Rolex watches -- several of which showed signs 
of serial number tampering -- and about 80 other types of watches. In addition, 
detectives took several items of gold jewelry in an effort to match them to 
other robbery cases, Addington said. 
</P>
<P>
Keshmiri was released on $2,500 bail, Addington said. 
</P>
<P>
While police were investigating whether Keshmiri is tied to the series of Rolex 
robberies that have plagued the Los Angeles area for about a year, Addington 
said they believe Newman is. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many in Los Angeles County that we, of course, can't tie 
every one of them together, but I think there is a link with some other cases," 
Addington said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not say how many Rolex robberies they believe Newman was 
involved in. 
</P>
<P>
The first robbery Newman has been charged with committing took place in the 
Marina del Rey area on Sept. 5, Deputy Dist. Atty. Julie Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Encino attorney David Kenner, 48, told police he received a call from a man who 
asked for Kenner's assistance in turning himself in to police on an outstanding 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner agreed to meet the man in the parking lot of the Black Whale restaurant 
in the 3000 block of Washington Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Kenner arrived, a man rode up on a red motorcycle, wearing a 
helmet, leather gloves and a thick, leather jacket. 
</P>
<P>
The man got into Kenner's car and pulled a gun and a pair of handcuffs from his 
pockets, Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
After the man had taken Kenner's $20,000 Rolex, a ring and a bracelet, he 
demanded that Kenner handcuff himself to the steering wheel, Sulman said. 
Kenner refused and, when the man was distracted by a car pulling into the 
parking lot, Kenner rolled out the driver's door and began to run. 
</P>
<P>
Sulman said Kenner looked back and saw the man pull the gun's trigger several 
times. It failed to fire. 
</P>
<P>
As another car came into the lot, the man ran to his motorcycle and fled, 
Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kenner told police he could not get a good look at the man because of 
the helmet, he saw a scar below the man's right eye. Newman has such a scar, 
Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 12, a man went to Cheroske's office, saying he wanted the attorney 
present when he turned himself in to police on an outstanding warrant. During a 
private conference, however, he pulled a gun, Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who had identified himself as Rodney Abbott, used a washcloth and a 
necktie to gag Cheroske, Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
The man took Cheroske's gold Rolex, gold necklace, a pinkie ring, a gold money 
clip and $600 cash, and then nonchalantly left, Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sulman said Cheroske told police that the man had a scar below his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say they found Newman's fingerprints on a clipboard where he had 
signed in when entering the office.

13-YEAR-OLD SLAIN IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: AUTHORITIES SAY THE EAST LOS ANGELES YOUNGSTER'S LIFE WAS PROBABLY 
SNUFFED OUT AS A RESULT OF TURF WARFARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An eighth-grader walking home from school in East Los Angeles was shot to death 
by gunmen who fired at him from a passing car Thursday, in an incident that 
authorities said probably was the result of gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Adolfo Aguirre, 13, fell dying onto the sidewalk as children and 
fellow students from Belvedere Junior High School gathered around. A bullet had 
hit him in the upper arm and passed into his chest; he was pronounced dead a 
short time later at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Residents along Blanchard Street, where the shooting took place at about 3:30 
p.m., said they heard two shots, then looked outside and saw the boy lying in a 
stream of blood. 
</P>
<P>
One resident told investigators he heard the screeching of car tires right 
after the shots. 
</P>
<P>
The hilly neighborhood in the City Terrace area is territory for two gangs who 
residents say regularly fight over turf. Investigators, as well as several 
teen-agers in the area, said they believed the shooters were from one gang and 
the victim from the other gang. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it was gangs," said Sgt. Stuart A. Reed of the sheriff's Homicide 
Division, adding that the dead boy had been "identified as an associate of 
gangs" by the department's gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
One youngster, perched on a bicycle, described himself as a friend of Adolfo's 
and said the young victim had joined the gang only within the last week. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were seeking as a witness a companion of Adolfo's who may have 
been walking with him when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo's family and neighbors painted a different picture of the boy. They 
described him as a courteous youngster who had told his mother he wanted to be 
a policeman and who was preparing to escort his cousin this weekend in a 
celebration of her 15th birthday, a traditional rite of passage in Latino 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The boy worked summers with his father, a gardener originally from Mexico, and 
rarely went out at night, his mother and uncles said. 
</P>
<P>
"He would come home from school every day at 3:30, and he just didn't leave 
again," his mother, Melecia Aguirre, said on the front steps of her apartment, 
her eyes reddened from crying. "If he had been in a gang, I wouldn't have had 
him here, home, every night." 
</P>
<P>
When Adolfo was shot, one of his classmates ran seven blocks to the apartment 
building to tell Melecia Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nothing more than a victim of the gangsterism. An innocent victim," 
said Adolfo's uncle, Galdino Gomez of Covina, who had arrived to comfort the 
boy's mother. "There was never any sign that he was in a gang. If you ask me, 
it is the innocents who fall." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives questioned residents of Blanchard Street late Thursday in 
a search for witnesses. Reed said many people appeared reluctant to speak to 
investigators out of fear of gang retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 18 gang murders in East Los Angeles this year, Reed said. While 
Adolfo's death stood out because of his young age, the sergeant said it is 
increasingly common to see younger gang members -- even at ages "in the single 
digits."

MOTHER OF SLAIN GIRL SEIZED IN DRUG RAID; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: WOMAN AND TWO OTHERS ARE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT NEWHALL HOME. HER 
DAUGHTER HAD BEEN SEXUALLY MOLESTED AND MURDERED LAST YEAR.

A woman whose plight gained statewide attention last year after her missing 
7-year-old daughter was found sexually molested and strangled in a neighbor's 
house was charged Thursday with drug possession, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hodges, 43, of Apple Valley and two others were arrested Tuesday night 
when Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies raided the Newhall house where she 
formerly lived with her daughter, Sara Nan. Hodges was visiting the home at the 
time of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies seized a quarter pound of methamphetamine, a gun and $5,000 in 
cash, said Deputy Gabe Ramirez. Arrested with Hodges were Don Hall, 38, and his 
sister, Mary Alexander, 39, who live in the home in the 24900 block of 
Alderbrook Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they found a small quantity of methamphetamine in Hodges' purse 
and she was charged with possession of the drug, commonly referred to as speed. 
Deputies said they believe the larger quantity of drugs belonged to Hall and 
Alexander, who were charged with the sale of methamphetamine. An investigator 
said there was no evidence Hodges was involved in the sales of drugs at the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges and Hall pleaded not guilty Thursday in Newhall Municipal Court. 
Alexander's arraignment is set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges lived with Alexander in the Alderbrook Drive house in March, 1989, when 
her daughter disappeared while playing outside. She became the subject of a 
massive search by deputies and community volunteers for three days before her 
body was found March 26 in a neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had been sexually molested and strangled and her body was stuffed 
behind the headboard of a water bed. Fourteen-year-old Curtiss Cooper was 
arrested, later pleaded guilty to killing the girl and was sentenced to 25 
years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance and death of the girl touched the community and dozens of 
strangers helped search for her, attended her funeral and contributed to a fund 
to pay her funeral costs. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after the tragedy, Sara Nan's father, Wallace S. Mann, who was 
separated from Hodges, committed suicide on the girl's grave. Investigators 
concluded that Mann, 36, was distraught over his daughter's slaying and the 
breakup of his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said Linda Hodges' arrest this week came after a two-month 
investigation of activities at the house on Alderbrook Drive. A narcotics 
investigator said the investigation was begun after deputies received numerous 
complaints from neighbors that drugs were being sold at the house. 
</P>
<P>
An investigator, who asked not to be identified, said Hodges was often seen at 
the house during the investigation and was believed to have remained close 
friends with the two other suspects after moving to Apple Valley last year. The 
investigator said Hodges was doing yardwork at the house at the time 
investigators arrived Tuesday night with a search warrant for the property. 
</P>
<P>
He said Hodges was arrested at least once before for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone said deputies found three-tenths of a gram of 
methamphetamine and a bag containing cotton balls soaked with liquid 
methamphetamine in Hodges' purse. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a good usable quantity but not enough to imply sales," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter pound of the drug found in the house could be worth as much as 
$3,750 if sold on the street, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, who has one other daughter, was being held at the sheriff's station 
jail in Valencia in lieu of $5,000 bail. No bail was set for Hall because his 
arrest violated his parole for a conviction of possession of narcotics for 
sale, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander was released on $15,000 bail. Her husband, Robert Alexander, was shot 
to death by a sheriff's deputy in 1983 after a struggle erupted when he was 
arrested on suspicion of possession of narcotics paraphernalia.

HOTEL -- SITE OF FATAL PARTY -- IS GIVEN WARNING 
</P>

<P>
The Inglewood city attorney's office has sent a sharply worded letter to the 
hotel where a party erupted in violence earlier this month, threatening 
prosecution if hotel officials do not comply with occupancy limits or get city 
permits for future gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are still investigating whether the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel on 
South Prairie Avenue violated city law by failing to get a permit for the Sept. 
1 party that left one guest dead and several injured. However, city officials 
said, several discrepancies in the Days Inn booking process may have 
contributed to the outbreak of violence. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said organizers of the party had not filled in or signed the 
part of the rental agreement asking that maximum attendance be stated. They 
also said that the violence broke out after the 1:30 a.m. completion time noted 
on the contract and that attendance was well beyond the 80-person capacity of 
the party room. 
</P>
<P>
The Sept. 1 party was organized as a $5-a-head birthday celebration featuring 
several local rap artists, according to police. The crowd had swelled to more 
than 300 people at about 2 a.m. Saturday, when a dispute over use of the 
microphone led to bottle-throwing, fighting and gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the incident, Mayor Edward Vincent called a meeting for Oct. 1 with 
all operators of major hotels and other party facilities in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to let the rest know that this slipshod way of doing business will 
not be tolerated in Inglewood, especially when human lives are at stake," 
Vincent said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, he said rap concerts in particular should be closely monitored 
because of their tendency to lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any rap things here unless it's closely supervised," Vincent 
said. "It's not the rapper that's the problem, but the people that it draws." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor expressed anger at hotel manager Kay Hong's comment, reported in The 
Times, that part of the reason for the violence was the hotel's neighborhood, 
which she called a "hot spot." Vincent said the police investigation has found 
that the party-goers were from other areas, including Chino, Dana Point, 
Compton and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hong said Thursday that the hotel is working diligently to prevent future 
outbreaks, even though they may be beyond the hotel's control. She said she has 
been working with the city Fire Department, which has begun nightly checks of 
the hotel for possible code violations, and plans to screen organizers of 
future parties more closely and require them to pay for security. 
</P>
<P>
Hong said Vincent's criticisms of the hotel show he does not have a clear 
picture of the incident and is basing his information on rumors. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has already turned down requests for parties at the facility, even 
though it is hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Garland Hardeman, whose district includes the hotel, said he 
supports the mayor's meeting of hotel operators but believes the city should 
not portray the Days Inn, the city's largest hotel, as an adversary. Hardeman 
said he will attempt to assist the hotel in booking business events so it does 
not have to rely on private parties. 
</P>
<P>
When the birthday party turned violent, more than 200 officers from several 
police agencies were called in to conduct a room-by-room search of the 10-story 
hotel. Roderick Williams, a 22-year-old Los Angeles rap musician, died after he 
was struck by a car in the hotel parking lot during the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested six men after the party on suspicion of murder but later 
released them all. The investigative report of the incident, which includes 
interviews with more than 300 people, has been turned over to the district 
attorney's office for review. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lee, the head of Lee Hotel Inc., said Wednesday that he sold the hotel 
to Days Inn in 1989 after owning it for several years and has nothing more to 
do with it. However, Hong identified Lee as the owner, and a Days Inn 
spokeswoman said the hotel is owned by a private party, whom she declined to 
name.

EL SEGUNDO LOSES BID TO INTERVENE IN HYPERION DECREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has denied a motion by El Segundo to intervene in the 1987 
consent decree that has led to a major long-term expansion project at the 
Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. The work is necessary for Hyperion to comply 
with the decree's requirement that the plant achieve full secondary sewage 
treatment by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in El Segundo, which borders Hyperion, fear that the expansion will 
cause environmental and health problems for residents. The city sought to 
become a party to the decree so it could participate fully in court decisions 
made about the project. But federal Judge Harry Pregerson, who is supervising 
the consent decree, ruled that the intervention was not timely because the 
Hyperion case began in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Pregerson, however, granted the city "friend of the court" status, which 
permits it to bring concerns about Hyperion to the court's attention. However, 
the city may not make motions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In its request to intervene, which Pregerson ruled on without oral argument, 
the city contended the action was proper because El Segundo did not learn the 
extent of the Hyperion expansion until last year. El Segundo's request was 
opposed by the city of Los Angeles, which is a party to the consent decree 
along with state and federal environmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased the city will have a voice in the proceedings, although we 
think we should have a stronger voice," said City Atty. Leland Dolley. 
</P>
<P>
But John Haggarty, a deputy Los Angeles city attorney, agreed with the court. 
"There already is a judgment. Nothing is to be served by (El Segundo) coming in 
now," he said.

MAYOR INSISTS SANTA CLARITA'S GROWTH IS UNDER CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy on Thursday defended the City Council's 
growth policies, saying that, contrary to allegations by City Hall critics, 
Santa Clarita has allowed little growth since it incorporated in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy, in a wide-ranging "state of the city" address during a public forum at 
City Hall, said the council had fulfilled pledges made during the incorporation 
battle three years ago to control the quantity and quality of growth in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The council has allowed about 680 new housing units each year in the 
40-square-mile city, Darcy said. By comparison, 49-square-mile Thousand Oaks, 
which has a stringent growth-control ordinance, allows 650 units a year, she 
said. Even so, a strong anti-growth sentiment persists in Santa Clarita, where 
a citizens' group is drafting a growth-control initiative to present to the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy and her council colleagues have said residents often mistakenly blame 
Santa Clarita for developments that were approved by the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors just before incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said Thursday that Santa Clarita will continue to monitor -- and perhaps 
fight -- developments planned outside the city limits. The council recently 
sued the supervisors to block a 2,555-unit expansion of the giant Stevenson 
Ranch development, saying that the project's environmental impact report was 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"You may see more of these actions if we have to," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said recent controversies have been painful but necessary experiences for 
a young city still learning the art of home rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our council members have had to face emotional turmoil, including 
myself," Darcy said. Last month, for example, the council, heavily criticized 
by the public for ousting popular parks Commissioner Laurene Weste, reappointed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
The council has tried to allow broad public debate on controversial issues even 
though that debate may split citizens into rival camps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"While much of the controversy can be heart-wrenching for those involved, I 
truly believe it is a necessary part of the process and one we must go through 
to include the greatest amount of citizen participation," she said.

SANTA CLARITA, FIRM NEAR AGREEMENT ON CITY AID FOR 1ST MAJOR RETAIL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita and Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. officials are expected to 
announce today an agreement that would provide city financial aid for the 
company's proposed Valencia Town Center, the first major retail outlet in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said Thursday morning that an agreement had been reached by 
city and company officials who had been negotiating since July. 
</P>
<P>
But a few hours later city officials said they were still hammering out final 
details of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very close," city spokeswoman Gail Foy said. Foy and Marlee Lauffer, a 
Newhall Land spokeswoman, declined to discuss what had sidetracked the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Any agreement is subject to approval by the City Council. That approval could 
come as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land, the Santa Clarita Valley's largest developer, in July asked the 
city to issue bonds to pay for $12.8 million in road improvements in and around 
the 80-acre mall. 
</P>
<P>
A Newhall Land consultant said the $180-million project could not proceed 
without city financing. The bonds would be paid off with sales taxes generated 
by the mall and would not require the city to dip into its treasury, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council rejected the request for $12.8 million and ordered city staff 
members to negotiate a lower figure. As an enticement, Newhall Land has offered 
to let the city annex about 150 acres of company property. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have urged the city to turn its back on the company, saying 
local government should not subsidize a private enterprise, especially one as 
influential as Newhall Land. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials countered that many California cities, including Burbank and 
Palmdale, have agreed to subsidize new malls by floating bonds that will be 
paid off with sales taxes.

WEEKENDER: LOOKING AT THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT -- AND THE JUNK THAT POLLUTES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of South Bay residents revel in beach-going. They sun, swim, play 
volleyball, walk, jog or poke around tide pools. But how many are willing to 
spend a few hours cleaning those sandy and rocky places they love to visit? 
</P>
<P>
That question will be answered Saturday morning, when volunteers will be asked 
to bring gloves and pitch in to remove debris from the tide pools of San Pedro 
to the sands of Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the various cleanups say they don't know how many people will 
show up, but they're encouraged by sign-ups by corporate employees and members 
of service and garden clubs, senior citizens groups, and the Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, there were approximately 60 volunteers that came out, and we hope 
that increases this year," said Carol Belser, a recreation employee in Hermosa 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Some beaches will have contests or displays to add a little fun to the work of 
filling bags with such debris as cans, plastic bags, fragments of fishing nets, 
and cast-off appliance and vehicle parts. 
</P>
<P>
However, those boosting the cleanup effort are mostly counting on the devotion 
of people who don't like their beaches to look like watery dumps. Mike Schaadt, 
exhibits director at the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, said litterers 
provoke "a certain amount of disgust." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "there are people down there to care, to take a modicum of pride 
that can make a difference. The enjoyment is seeing how much better a place can 
look." 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday cleanup marks the nationwide Coastweeks program, which was 
organized by marine-related scientific and environmental organizations, and the 
California Coastal Commission's Adopt-A-Beach Day. 
</P>
<P>
Belser said that in addition to being a cleanup, the day aims to make people 
aware of beaches and the importance of caring for them. "They're our natural 
resource," she said. "People clean the beach, give something back to it and 
learn something about it." 
</P>
<P>
* The Cabrillo museum at 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro, will coordinate 
the cleanup of the Point Fermin Refuge, which stretches along the coast south 
of the museum. Volunteers will gather at 10 a.m. for two hours of 
trash-gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Vogel, the museum's educational curator, said the tide pools and rocky 
beach within the refuge become repositories for debris thrown from yachts and 
commercial ships -- down to the small resin beads used to slide cargo 
containers aboard ships. The cliffs above the beach invite people to toss over 
surprising trash. 
</P>
<P>
"People are at the end of the world as far as they're concerned," he said. 
"We're getting bottles, street signs, and real estate signs and flags." 
</P>
<P>
During last year's cleanup, a mural depicting tide-pool life was painted on the 
remnants of a military bunker. It has been all but obliterated by graffiti, and 
people will be invited to help repaint it during the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Competitive spirits will be aroused at noon with a contest to select what Vogel 
calls "five of the funkiest garbage items discovered." Judging by last year's 
collection -- which netted a refrigerator compressor and part of a street 
barricade that still had a light attached -- Vogel said the contest should be 
lively. 
</P>
<P>
The day ends with the showing of films on beaches and tide pools at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society is organizing the 
cleanup of San Pedro's Royal Palms Beach, located at Western Avenue and Paseo 
del Mar. Volunteers will meet at 8 a.m. at the bottom of the road down to the 
rocky beach. The cleanup will last until noon. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Zembrano, a Cal State Long Beach marine lab technician who is heading the 
event, said the first cleanup last year netted everything from clothing to 
drinking straws. "How much we clean depends on how many show up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Torrance Beach, located south of Riviera Village in Redondo Beach, will be 
cleaned between 9 a.m. and noon. Volunteers will meet at the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
* In Redondo Beach, volunteers will meet at the Redondo Pier at 9 a.m. The 
cleanup will last until noon. 
</P>
<P>
* Hermosa Beach holds its cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon, with volunteers 
gathering at the city pier. Belser said more than 1,200 pounds of trash was 
collected on the beach last year, much of it recyclable cans and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
Recyclable items found this year will be taken to Hermosa Valley School, which 
is having a recycling drive Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
During the cleanup, Los Angeles County lifeguards and the Cabrillo museum will 
have displays and provide information. Children will be entertained with a 
scavenger hunt. 
</P>
<P>
* In Manhattan Beach, the cleanup -- from 9 a.m. to noon -- begins at the 
Manhattan Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
One aim of this year's beach cleanup is to identify the type of trash being 
dumped. Vogel said this will help the Center for Marine Conservation, which 
works to protect the ocean, to pinpoint where marine debris is coming from and 
take steps to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said the object is to develop educational material aimed at "the people 
who are responsible" for the trash. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to focus peoples' attention on the coastal environment," he 
said. GERALD FARIS

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUSTICES REJECT COUNTY'S PRISON LAND CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal by Los Angeles 
County challenging a lower court ruling that allowed land acquisition for a 
planned Lancaster prison while legal challenges against the prison were 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
In an order issued Thursday, the court also lifted a stay it imposed on the 
state last month to prevent the acquisition of the 252-acre site while the 
justices decided whether to hear the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The lower court ruling in July had forced state officials to cancel a call for 
bids on a contract to grade the site. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Jonathan Crane said the impact of the ruling is lessened 
by the fact that on Monday a Superior Court judge will hear arguments on 
environmental lawsuits filed by the county and city of Lancaster against the 
prison. That hearing could result in a judge's order permitting construction to 
continue, or in a temporary or permanent prohibition against further 
construction work, according to lawyers on both sides.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: U.S. OKS MONEY FOR PACOIMA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has authorized funding for 
a community center in the San Fernando Gardens housing development in Pacoima, 
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's office announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the project's $941,000 cost is being funded through loans and 
grants from the Community Development Department and money from the 
councilman's discretionary fund. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been difficulties and obstacles in moving this project forward," 
Bernardi said. "Having the full funding needed on hand is a major milestone." 
</P>
<P>
The community center will house job-training and placement programs, classes in 
English and literacy, and scouting and senior citizen activities. Construction 
is expected to begin by March and will take six to nine months, according to 
Joseph Shuldiner, executive director of the city Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people live in the project at 10995 Lehigh Ave., which was 
built in 1955.

PASSENGER IN CAR IS SHOT, KILLED NEAR GALLERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old man was shot and killed late Wednesday as he rode in a car on 
Hawthorne Boulevard near the South Bay Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police are searching for a suspect who they say flashed a gang sign 
before firing three shots at a nearby car in the 17500 block of Hawthorne 
Boulevard at about 11:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Daryl James Webb, who was in the front passenger seat, was a 
Compton native stationed with the Air Force in the Las Vegas area, a relative 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He was home on leave to visit his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Webb and three friends had gone to the South Bay Bowl, a Redondo Beach bowling 
alley just south of the Galleria, Torrance police said. 
</P>
<P>
When they were leaving, they noticed a man and woman in the parking lot, police 
said. Webb's group drove south on Hawthorne Boulevard and then made a U-turn 
into the northbound lane, said Torrance Sgt. Ron Traber. The couple were in a 
car near them, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Some comments were exchanged. The suspect then flashed a gang sign and fired at 
the car in which Webb was a passenger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb was pronounced dead from gunshot wounds at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects' vehicle was a 1982 or 1983 light-blue, two-door Chevy Monte 
Carlo, Buick Regal or Oldsmobile Cutlass, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A relative said Webb had no gang affiliations. In fact, she said, he was 
studying law enforcement in the Air Force and hoped to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Webb is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and an 11-month-old son.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS TOURNEY A TOP DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills will be the site of one of the nation's premier 
Division II women's volleyball fields this week when it plays host to the 
nine-team Dominguez Hills Invitational Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day tourney features five of the top 20 teams in Division II, led by 
No. 1-ranked Sacramento State, No. 3 Regis College of Colorado, No. 8 UC 
Riverside, No. 11 Cal Poly Pomona and No. 14 Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-pool format, each team will play twice today and then shift into 
winners' and losers' brackets Saturday, with the six best teams forming one 
round robin and the bottom three another. The championship game is scheduled 
for 7:30 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The three opening-round pools will consist of Riverside, Cal State Los Angeles 
and Alaska-Anchorage; Sacramento, Pomona and Dominguez Hills; and Regis, Sonoma 
and Chapman. Play begins at 2 p.m. today and 10 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-7 Lady Toros picked up all three of their victories last week at the La 
Verne Tournament. Their improvement coincided with the emergence of freshman 
setter Jeanna Price. The newcomer from Lake Elsinore set a school record with 
50 assists against Elizabethtown, needing only four games to reach that total. 
The old school mark of 43 assists had been set in a five-game match. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll probably break that record soon, too," said Coach Nancy Fortner. "We're 
a better team (than previously), so we have longer rallies, and she just goes 
after more balls." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the rise for the young Lady Toros is sophomore hitter Lourdes Estrada, 
who tops the team in kill percentage and has 10 service aces, and freshman 
hitter Gale Derricott, who is first in kills (33) and digs (28). Sophomore 
Angie Hamer has 27 kills and 23 digs. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner starts only one senior, Julie Berthiaume. "This (tournament) is tough 
competition," the coach said. "Realistically, we're going to have to work real 
hard to advance in our pool. I'm hoping to give some of these teams some 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team, which started 0-8 last year, is 
off to a 4-6 start this year despite a tough early schedule. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't get any easier for new Coach Steve Stratos' improving team as the 
Lions travel to Boulder, Colo., for the start of the Coors Light Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
In round-robin play, the Lions open against host Colorado (3-6) today. On 
Saturday, they face Florida State (7-2) and 20th-ranked Wyoming (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, the Lions return to Gersten Pavilion to play second-ranked UCLA 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola was buoyed last week by the return to form of all-conference hitter 
Kerry House and the return to the lineup of Dana Bragado. 
</P>
<P>
House, on the mend from an injury, had 31 kills and 16 digs in a five-game 
victory over UC Irvine and 17 kills and 14 digs in a four-game loss to Long 
Beach State, the nation's ninth-rated team. 
</P>
<P>
House's performance boosted her into the West Coast Conference lead in digs 
average at 3.97. She also improved to fourth in kill average at 4.16. 
</P>
<P>
In third place, just ahead of House in kills, is Loyola freshman Deanna 
Doolittle at 4.25. She leads the Lions with 12 service aces and is second in 
digs. Setter Anita Irwin leads the Lions with an assist average of 10.3, good 
for third in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's improved volleyball play is indicative of an upward trend in the West 
Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The WCC, which began conference play five years ago, is off to its best start 
with a composite record of 46-32 through last weekend, despite playing a 
tougher schedule. Pepperdine has broken into the national Top 20 at No. 14, and 
all eight conference teams have at least four victories. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, WCC schools won only one-third of their first 61 matches. The year 
before, the WCC got off to a 13-35 start -- a 27% winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
The road wasn't kind last week to the Dominguez Hills women's soccer team, 
which went 1-3 against several tough opponents away from home. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros' No. 2 preseason ranking was probably based more on reputation 
than performance. They played competitively despite their record last week, but 
losses to two Division II opponents may have dealt an early blow to their 
chances to return to postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros, who take a 3-3 record into Saturday's 2 p.m. home game against 
U.S. International University, suffered a 3-1 loss at traditional Northern 
California power Sonoma State, then were upset, 1-0, the following day at UC 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
They returned to Southern California to play two Division I opponents, 
recording a 1-0 victory over UC Irvine, then losing, 2-0, at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's soccer team (2-3) plays host to Grand 
Canyon College at 3:30 today, then travels to Cal State Northridge for a 6 p.m. 
game Sunday. Northridge, a traditional foe, upgraded to Division I this season 
and is no longer in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. . . . Dominguez 
Hills forward Martin Mira earned his 14th assist last week to tie the school 
career record. . . . The Loyola Marymount soccer team plays host to powerful 
University of San Francisco at 3 p.m. Monday.

SOUTHWEST IS READY TO BATTLE HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. Southwest College had a week between games, but Coach Henry Washington 
says his club is ready to meet cross-town rival Harbor in Saturday's Western 
State Conference football opener at Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 1-0 entering the 7:30 p.m. game. Southwest defeated Rio Hondo, 
21-7, on Sept. 8 and Harbor slipped by Victor Valley, 14-7, last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down there and Harbor is a little better than they were last year," 
Washington said. "They do a good job defensively. They're a team to be reckoned 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Cougars defeated the Seahawks, 30-12, and went on to enjoy their 
best season ever and their first postseason bowl. Harbor, under first-year 
Coach Don Weems, finished 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Baham (Serra High) is going into his second season as the Seahawks' 
quarterback and running back Bill Harris (Long Beach Poly) is the key to 
Harbor's running game. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound sophomore scored a touchdown 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Craig Manigo looked nervous in Southwest's opener, but Washington 
thinks the sophomore is ready to overcome his jitters. The Cougars are ranked 
No. 12 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to go and see how we fit in to this conference," he said. "I 
really expect a great football game and it will be a good test for us. We think 
we're pretty good, but we'll see on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
John Featherstone says his El Camino football team is still exhausted from last 
week's 33-32 victory over Taft. That however, isn't enough to stop the Warriors 
from getting pumped up for Saturday's Mission Conference opener against 
visiting Saddleback at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very hard week for us because we had a very physical game 
against Taft," Featherstone said. "The kids are very tired and very beat up, 
but the word letdown doesn't exist on this team. We cannot afford to be any 
less intense for this game." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (2-0) slipped to No. 2 in the state rankings after Bakersfield 
defeated Navarro College of Texas, 44-8, on Saturday and moved into the No. 1 
spot. But the Warriors moved up from No. 11 to No. 3 in this week's national 
rankings. The Gauchos are unranked. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback will have a difficult time containing El Camino's productive offense 
which is second in the Mission Conference with 948 yards. Warrior quarterback 
Rod Harvey is second to Palomar's Brett Salisbury in passing. The 6-foot-1, 
170-pound sophomore from Morningside High has completed 30 of 44 passes for 488 
yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback lost to Santa Monica, 33-16, in its opener.

RECEIVER'S LOOK IS HAIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES: REEVES SHOWCASES HIS EXOTIC HAIRCUTS AND RECEIVING SKILLS 
FOR EL CAMINO. 
</P>

<P>
Bryan Reeves likes to sport a new look before every football game. He says it 
helps him prepare to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old El Camino College wide receiver shaved his mustache and beard 
before the Warriors' opener against Ventura. Before last week's game against 
Taft, the former Carson High all-star got a flattop with a thick line shaved 
down the side. He also put lines through his right eyebrow by plucking it with 
tweezers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of shaving off all my hair before this week's game," Reeves said 
before practice Tuesday. "I just like a fresh look before every game." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves' look on the field, however, has a sameness to it. He's always quick, 
composed and intense. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season in mid-November, fans will have seen an array of 
exotic haircuts and solid performances from Reeves, who transferred to El 
Camino this fall after a redshirt season at Arizona State University. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a tremendous job for us so far," said El Camino Coach John 
Featherstone. "He's a very enthusiastic player and an excellent practice 
player. His work ethic is tremendous, and he's a tireless individual. He never 
has a letdown. Even his blocking is impressive." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's sophomore quarterback, Rod Harvey, says Reeves is a gifted athlete 
whose vehemence serves as a boost for other players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always up," Harvey said. "I have a lot of confidence in Bryan because he 
has a great ability to catch the ball. He runs under the ball very well." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 180-pound Reeves, who also returns punts and kickoffs, says his 
goal this season is to catch at least one touchdown pass in every game. So far 
he's done that. 
</P>
<P>
In El Camino's 48-26 victory over Ventura College, in which passing accounted 
for only 174 of the Warriors' 518 yards of offense, Reeves caught one of their 
two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 33-32 victory over visiting Taft, Reeves caught four passes for 
178 yards and a touchdown and was named one of the Mission Conference players 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, Reeves predicted that he'd get this kind of notoriety. 
But he thought it would happen at a big-time football school, not at a junior 
college. 
</P>
<P>
On graduating from Carson, Reeves was one of the nation's most sought-after 
wide receivers. In 1987, his senior year, he had 41 catches for 883 yards and 
11 touchdowns. He was all-star quarterback George Malauulu's favorite target on 
an 11-1 Carson team that reached the City 4-A finals for the second consecutive 
year. Reeves was one of six Carson players named to The Times' South Bay 
All-Star Team. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan is one of the best receivers around," says Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, 
who ranks Reeves alongside three former Colt receivers playing in the National 
Football League: Wesley Walker (New York Jets), Mike Wilson (San Francisco 
49ers) and Derek Hill (Pittsburgh Steelers). 
</P>
<P>
Reeves was offered scholarships to practically every college in the Pacific 10 
and Big Eight conferences. He took recruiting trips to New Mexico, Alabama and 
Nebraska before visiting Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to go to Arizona State because I remember when I was in 10th 
grade Arizona State beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl," Reeves said. "They never 
showed that much interest until the end. I had one more trip left and I was 
going to Washington State, but ASU called at the last minute and I went there." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves' college career was delayed by an injury he suffered during a high 
school all-star game in July, 1988. The injury, which tore cartilage in his 
left knee and required surgery, kept him out during the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of rehabilitation, Reeves was anxious to play again. He enrolled 
at Arizona State in 1989 and worked out with the football team last spring. But 
he left at the end of spring practice when Arizona State Coach Larry Marmie 
told him that he wouldn't play much this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy in front of me was a redshirt freshman, and I feel I was just as good 
as he is if not better," Reeves said. "I feel I'm good enough and I should be 
playing. I don't have to sit behind anybody. I just want to play. I want to 
play pro football, and to do that you have to play college football, not just 
sit." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said he also had problems away from football at Arizona State. He 
partied too much, got bad grades and was involved in a brawl at a fraternity 
party. 
</P>
<P>
He says the altercation started when a group of white fraternity members yelled 
racial slurs at him and about 15 other black football players. 
</P>
<P>
"First I was in trouble with my grades, then that big fight," Reeves said. "I 
guess I didn't make a very good first impression at ASU." 
</P>
<P>
In May, when classes ended at Arizona State, Reeves returned home to Carson and 
had a talk with Featherstone, who had recruited him as a high school senior. 
</P>
<P>
The coach warned Reeves that he'd have to battle three talented sophomore 
receivers, Shannon Thompson, Steve Danzy and Marquis Owns, for a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
At first Reeves hesitated to make the move, but not because of the fierce 
competition at his position. His family was opposed to the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I had talked it over with my mom, and I told her I didn't want to go back," 
Reeves said. "It was a difficult decision because everyone -- my mom, my aunt, 
my cousins -- said it was a step backwards. They thought it was better if I 
stayed at Arizona and got an education." 
</P>
<P>
Marmie, entering his third year as the Sun Devils' coach, says Reeves is a 
talented player whose time will eventually come. 
</P>
<P>
"He suffered an injury that really set him back," Marmie said. "It seemed like 
he never really fully recovered from that enough to get substantial playing 
time. He felt it was in his best interest to go to a JC to develop, and I feel 
he's got enough talent to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone disagrees with Marmie about Reeves' injury. "I've seen no signs of 
a weak knee," he said. "I think Bryan has one small weakness, and that's that 
he doesn't have blazing speed. But his speed is good and solid. He's fast 
enough to beat you deep." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone says it's too early to completely evaluate Reeves, but he likes 
what he's seen so far. Especially since Reeves brought along his buddy, running 
back Anthony Daigle, from Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Daigle, a 5-foot-11, 195-pounder from Northern California, was similarly 
disappointed about playing time. Reeves persuaded Daigle, also a redshirt 
freshman, to transfer to El Camino. Both athletes live with Reeves' family in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
In the Warriors' opener against Ventura, Daigle scored three touchdowns and 
rushed for 177 yards on 20 carries. Last week he rushed for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"They were two very pleasant surprises for us," Featherstone said. "Very 
pleasant!" 
</P>
<P>
Reeves says he'll play at a four-year college once he's done at El Camino. The 
communication major would like to attend USC or UCLA so that he can stay in his 
home area, where off-the-wall hairdos and eyebrow designs aren't so rare.

Xerox Wins Round in Court: U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater overturned a 
$9-million judgment a jury awarded to a San Antonio woman in an 
age-discrimination suit against Xerox Corp. Fitzwater, who presided over the 
civil trial in Dallas, indicated that he believed that the evidence failed to 
show that Xerox had demoted Elizabeth Layman, 48, because of her age, or that 
she had been lured to California with a false promise of a comparable job. "I 
think the judge is wrong," said Layman's attorney, Larry Macon, "and I am 
hopeful that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans will restore a 
very clear jury decision."

Donald Trump Misses Payment on Airline: The financier hopes to delay payments 
on $245 million in loans for his Trump Shuttle, after already missing a payment 
of $1.1 million, a top aide said. Trump and two assistants have met with 
officials from Citibank, asking the bank to restructure debt payments on the 
shuttle, which provides service on the Boston-New York-Washington corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Like other airlines, the shuttle has been hurt by rising fuel costs and a 
slowing economy. Citibank officials "have been very encouraging so far in 
helping us through these problems," said Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial 
officer of the Trump Organization. He was one of the Trump officials who 
participated in the meeting. Citibank declined comment, citing the 
confidentiality of its dealings with customers.

A Polly Peck official who spoke on condition of anonymity said trading was 
suspended to stop what appeared to be a free fall in the stock. It was unclear 
when trading would resume. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials declined to confirm or deny rumors that ran through the 
market Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck's shares were trading at 108 pence, or about $2.02, when trading was 
suspended at about 2:30 p.m. London time, down from the Wednesday closing price 
of 243 pence, or $4.54. More than 15 million shares changed hands before the 
suspension took effect. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck has been the focus of British newspaper reports that have alleged 
that its stock price may have been supported illegally.

N.Y. Post Buyouts: Noted sports columnist Peter Vecsey and 78 others will leave 
the newspaper under a buyout plan that was part of a $19-million union 
concession package designed to keep the paper alive. 
</P>
<P>
Vecsey will write a column for USA Today. The Newspaper Guild resignations, 
which were voluntary, mean the Post will lose close to 200 of its 960 workers. 
Agreements last week called for 100 forced resignations from the 263-member 
drivers union and five from the Post's 17 paper handlers. The Post said about 
half the Guild resignations were from the newsroom, which translates to about a 
third of the news staff.

DEMOCRATS ACCUSE BUSH OFFICIALS ON S&amp;L MESS;

THRIFTS: SEVERAL SENATORS CHARGE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S 
HANDLING OF THE BURGEONING FIASCO.

<P>
Senate Banking Committee Democrats accused Bush Administration officials 
Thursday of harboring "conflicts of interest" in their management of the 
escalating savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Waving copies of a five-year-old lawsuit unearthed by committee staff members, 
Sen. Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.) asked the official in charge of the S&amp;L 
cleanup why his agency hired a San Diego accounting firm once sued for 
negligence in the collapse of San Marino Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wirth, the accounting firm was retained as a contractor by 
Resolution Trust Corp. to help investigate a series of rushed takeovers of 
failed thrifts in late 1988 that will cost taxpayers an estimated $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate accusation, Sen. Robert Kerry (D-Neb.) cited previous reports 
that a top RTC official was "a good friend" of a Washington lobbyist who 
represented one of the biggest beneficiaries of the controversial 1988 deals. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry, hinting that "insiders" and "sweet deals" were involved in the 1988 
takeovers, demanded to know why RTC Executive Director David C. Cooke had met 
with the lobbyist, Robert J. Thompson, "within six days" of enactment of the 
S&amp;L bailout legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the pointed questioning, RTC Chairman L. William Seidman bluntly 
dismissed as "baloney" the assertion that his executive director had a close 
relationship with the thrift buyer who was represented by Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I knew about the meeting between Cooke and Thompson," Seidman 
snapped. "I asked him to meet with them when they (the buyer group) purchased 
the banks." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said he could not address in detail Wirth's disclosure that the San 
Diego accounting firm, McGladrey &amp; Pullen, had once been sued by the 
government in connection with its audits of the failed San Marino thrift. 
</P>
<P>
McGladrey &amp; Pullen was one of six firms hired by Seidman's agencies as 
contractors to help investigate the 1988 deals, which were arranged by 
regulators in an effort to place a number of troubled thrifts into the hands of 
new owners. 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee disclosures, McGladrey &amp; Pullen was sued in 1985 
by San Marino Savings shareholders and the now-defunct Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan Deposit Insurance Corp., which had taken over the failed thrift in late 
1984. Other parties, including the former officers and directors of the thrift, 
also were sued. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit against McGladrey &amp; Pullen accused the accounting firm of 
negligence in connection with reports it had issued on the state of San 
Marino's assets in 1982. Those reports turned out to be inaccurate, the 
committee information indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The suit eventually was settled for an undisclosed amount. A source close to 
the case said the aggregate settlement from all defendants was "upwards of $20 
million," but he declined to say how much of that sum was paid by McGladrey. 
</P>
<P>
William Roelle, director of RTC's resolutions and operations division, told the 
Banking Committee that the suit had been settled for a "small" amount and that 
the RTC general counsel concluded that the issue was of little significance and 
not worth pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman promised to look into the matter and report back to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC chairman said a report examining the 1988 deals is being prepared by 
the agency and should be presented to Congress in November. He said any 
evidence of fraud or wrongdoing in the deals could allow the government to 
rescind improper contracts. But he cautioned that untainted contracts, however 
costly in hindsight, could not legally be undone. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth, meanwhile, demanded that the Bush Administration promptly make a formal 
request for RTC funding for the next fiscal year. In House testimony earlier 
this week, Seidman said the agency's working capital has dwindled to $13 
billion and warned that S&amp;L takeover operations would stop if another $60 
billion in working capital is not made available for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Including operating expenses, the agency will need $100 billion during the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, said Seidman, adding that a formal RTC 
operating plan for next year was forwarded to the Treasury Department "about 
two weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard nothing from Treasury," complained Wirth. "I am astonished we 
haven't received a request for $100 billion from Treasury. Are they waiting for 
the budget negotiations to be over? Are they trying to put responsibility on 
Congress if RTC has to close down? They are the Administration. They were 
elected and have the responsibility to do this and not try to waffle out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"We should have a formal request," Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. (D-Mich.) said. He noted, however, that appropriate committees in both 
houses already know how much Seidman thinks he needs to keep RTC going.

SECURITY PACIFIC LIKELY TO BUY MERCURY S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Federal regulators are expected to announce today that they have sold insolvent 
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan to Security Pacific Corp., which outbid several 
other institutions for the Orange County thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Thursday that the Los Angeles-based holding company for 
Security Pacific National Bank earlier this week won the bidding to acquire 
Huntington Beach-based Mercury's 24 branches and most of its $2 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The branches are expected to be reopened Monday as offices of Security Pacific. 
Deposits will continue to be insured by the federal government up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury was declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators in February. It 
has been operated since then under auspices of the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
federal agency charged with selling or liquidating government-run S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale is completed today, it would mark one of the quickest sales of a 
thrift under RTC supervision. The agency is overseeing several hundred S&amp;Ls 
nationally, including 18 that have been offered for sale in California since 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Carpenter, a banking consultant with Southport/Carpenter Group in Santa 
Ana, said several of his firm's clients were active bidders for Mercury and 
valued the thrift for what is widely considered one of the industry's better 
branch networks and customer bases. 
</P>
<P>
Other bidders reportedly included Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly 
Hills, American Savings Bank of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal 
Savings Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Security Pacific confirmed Thursday that the company, with nearly 
$95 billion in assets, had submitted a bid for Mercury. They declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific has been shopping for troubled thrifts this year. In June, the 
company acquired 83 branches of Simi Valley-based Gibraltar Savings. 
</P>
<P>
At RTC regional headquarters in Denver, spokesman Kevin Shields would not 
identify the winning bidder.

In a late wave of buying that left many traders befuddled, crude oil futures 
shot up Thursday to record highs, soaring nearly $2 a barrel to $35 before 
falling back. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, to 
be delivered in October closed at $34.71, up $1.53, on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. That shattered the Merc's previous record close of $33.63 reached 
only on Monday, when the previous trading high of $33.75 was also matched. 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast was relatively quiet, and no other major news reports seemed 
responsible for triggering the increase in prices, traders said. Oil prices in 
European markets fell slightly in lackluster trading; the light volume was 
attributed to observance of the Jewish New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in New York prices "took everybody by surprise," said James 
Fiedler, a vice president at ED&amp;F Man International Futures Inc., a New 
York brokerage. Prices "took off an hour before the close." 
</P>
<P>
Refined petroleum products also rose sharply at the Merc. October heating oil 
rose 3.33 cents to 91.86 cents a gallon on forecasts of a colder than normal 
fall, which would increase demand. Reports of gasoline refineries closing for 
scheduled maintenance helped raise the price of October unleaded gasoline by 
1.64 cents to 91.54 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the last day of trading in October crude oil futures contracts, 
and many traders had expected weaker prices as speculators and others who did 
not want to take delivery of the oil would have been forced to sell. Those who 
wanted to roll over their October contracts into November would have been 
forced to sell as well. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many traders earlier may have sold October oil contracts "short," 
expecting to buy back the contracts later at lower prices and thus profit from 
the decline. But instead of falling, crude oil prices kept rising, forcing 
short sellers to buy October contracts or face greater losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Some buying came in, and it looked like it was the shorts," said Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
"Strange things happen on the last day a contract ends," said Kevin Kelly, 
manager of futures trading at Chevron International in San Francisco. "It's 
hard to explain this one." 
</P>
<P>
With the end of trading in October oil futures, the market shifted its 
attention to November contracts, Kelly said. November crude rose by 45 cents to 
$33.42 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still in a bull market," Kelly said, but he declined to offer specific 
forecasts. "We are in uncharted waters, making the predictions game even 
tougher."

HELMS TO REPLACE COOLEY AS SEAFIRST CEO

Richard P. Cooley, 66, who helped BankAmerica Corp. turn the once-struggling 
Seafirst Corp. into one of the San Francisco banking firm's most profitable 
units, announced that he is retiring as head of the Seattle unit at year-end. 
Cooley is chairman and chief executive of Seafirst Corp. and Seattle-First 
National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Luke Helms, 46, president of Seafirst's Seattle-First National Bank, will 
succeed Cooley, who led Seafirst for seven years. Kevin B. Ferrell, 43, a Bank 
of America senior vice president, will succeed Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley helped engineer the sale of Seafirst to BankAmerica for $125 million in 
cash and $94 million in stock in 1983, after a rash of problem energy loans had 
Seafirst reeling. At the time, it was the largest interstate bank purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The energy loans caused a $90.2-million loss at Seafirst in 1982. Much of the 
red ink resulted from loans that Seafirst bought from the scandal-plagued Penn 
Square Bank in Oklahoma City, which failed in one of the banking industry's 
biggest debacles. JAMES BATES

DAYTON HUDSON RESTORES PLANNED PARENTHOOD GIFT

The Dayton Hudson Foundation on Thursday reversed an earlier decision and 
approved an $18,000 grant for a community education program of Planned 
Parenthood of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood will allocate the foundation's contribution to a restricted 
public education fund and, at Dayton Hudson's request, will add a separate line 
item sub-category for the program in its audit, the foundation said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Mayeda, Dayton Hudson Foundation chair, said neither the Dayton Hudson 
Corp. nor its foundation is taking a position on abortion rights with 
Thursday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken and will not take a position on abortion," she said in a 
statement. "Our contributions have never been nor will they be used to finance 
abortion services. We are satisfied that we can make this grant without taking 
a position on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation decided last month to end 22 years of financial support of 
Planned Parenthood for educational programs intended to prevent teen-age 
pregnancy. A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman said then that the move was an attempt 
to distance the foundation from the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
But about two weeks ago, Dayton said it would reconsider the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier developments prompted protests by pro-choice groups. Some customers 
tore up their credit cards and protested outside a Dayton Hudson outlet in 
Edina. Women's groups announced plans to boycott Dayton's, Target and other 
stores owned by the Minneapolis-based retailer during the Christmas season if 
the foundation did not restore funding. 
</P>
<P>
The $18,000 grant is the same amount that the foundation contributed last year.

'PEAKS' PILOT STIRS EMMY JURY DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: PANELISTS SAY THEY DISCUSSED WHETHER TWO-HOUR 'TWIN PEAKS' PILOT 
BELONGED IN THE SAME DIRECTING CATEGORY AS REGULAR ONE-HOUR DRAMATIC SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now comes another twist in the saga of "Twin Peaks," the cult soap opera that 
was blanked in major categories presented on Sunday's Emmy Awards telecast. 
</P>
<P>
According to three panelists on the jury of peers that selected best director 
of a drama series, the question of whether the blockbuster two-hour pilot of 
"Twin Peaks" should have been included in the same category as four regular 
one-hour episodes of other series was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the panelists, Allan Arkush, told The Times that the discussion -- which 
also included other matters -- had no bearing on the voting outcome, in which 
"Twin Peaks" director David Lynch lost. "There was no sense in the room of 
should we or shouldn't we vote for David Lynch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the conversation concerned the matching of regular episodes 
against pilots, which often have more production advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue came up whether David Lynch had any advantages in creating a 
two-hour pilot," said Arkush. Lynch lost to two directors who tied as winners 
-- Thomas Carter of "Equal Justice" and Scott Winant of "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good sense that David was not going to win," said Janet Davidson, 
another panelist. "It doesn't diminish David's work. It was just (in) the wrong 
category." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, when asked about the discussion that his episode had provoked, said 
through a spokeswoman Thursday: "I don't think that had anything to do with 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson added that the situation was like "comparing someone who had created 
something from scratch" to others whose job was "continuing an image." She said 
that she wrote a letter expressing her views to the Academy of Television Arts 
&amp; Sciences, which presents the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
David Phinney, another judge on the panel, which had about eight to 10 members, 
said, "As far as I was concerned, it didn't make any difference. If the academy 
saw fit to include a two-hour pilot, I was going to vote on that basis. In some 
cases, you would think that would give the pilot an advantage in being 
determined best show. (But) we were not voting on best show. We were voting on 
the best directing job -- not the best director." 
</P>
<P>
Phinney also emphasized, "None of us knew what the other ones voted for." 
</P>
<P>
While Phinney said that he didn't feel the "Twin Peaks" pilot was wrongly 
included, he added that he personally favored "a different category for 
pilots." But he conceded that this could open the door to creating other 
specialized categories as well. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Emmy for best direction of a drama series went to Gregory Hoblit 
for the two-hour pilot of "L.A. Law." In 1979, another award for best direction 
of a drama series was given to Jackie Cooper for the pilot of "The White 
Shadow." 
</P>
<P>
According to John Leverence, awards director of the TV Academy, Rule 3C 
governing the honors says: "The length of the episode selected for contest 
entry may exceed, by as much as double, the standard running time of the 
series' episode. If the episode is in two parts, both parts may be selected (as 
long as they do not cumulatively exceed twice the running time of the series' 
episode)." 
</P>
<P>
Leverence said that the "Twin Peaks" pilot "was effectively a two-parter in 
terms of length." The rationale for the rule, he added, is that if a show is a 
two-parter, it is still a "single program unit (and) there is a certain 
dramatic arc to the program which the academy feels ought to be respected and 
viewed in its entirety. To effectively cut the program into the hour increment 
would be to disrupt the panel's sense of the dramatic arc. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to take these pilots and break them away from the series, then you 
would have to put them into the drama special category, which is essentially a 
movie-of-the-week." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson suggested that would be the proper place: "I was personally opposed to 
including David Lynch's work in that category (direction of a drama series). It 
should be with the two-hour movie-of-the-week. And there is a separate category 
for that. It's comparing different species. One person has eight days to shoot, 
the other 25. You can't compare that." 
</P>
<P>
Since the "Twin Peaks" pilot was a point of discussion in at least this one 
panel, there could be some question of whether similar concerns on other panels 
helped to deflate the showing of the series, which had led all programs with 14 
nominations. But in fact, the pilot did win the only two Emmys that "Twin 
Peaks" got -- in costume design, where Patricia Norris was honored, and 
editing, where Duwayne Dunham earned an award. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the question of whether pilots pitted against regular episodes is like 
comparing apples and oranges sparked lively views on the matter from the 
panelists, probably reflecting some TV industry views. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that a pilot is a different animal than a regular episode," said 
Phinney. "You usually have a much larger budget, and it's to sell a series. 
Generally, there is a little more care put into the pilot than a regular 
one-hour show. It's showing the network what they can expect. 
</P>
<P>
"And unlike an episode, you don't have the next one coming down the chute 
behind you, where you have to finish on Tuesday because something is coming on 
Wednesday. So the pressure is off and you're putting your best foot forward." 
</P>
<P>
Arkush, co-executive producer of the new NBC series "Parenthood," also noted 
that such points had risen, but said that "even though I'm not a big fan" of 
"Twin Peaks," he argued the flip side of making a pilot: 
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking, when you're doing a pilot, you have all these people 
breathing down your neck, the scrutiny of the network. There's so much at 
stake. They've invested so much money. You're constantly being second-guessed 
on casting and there's the problem of new characters and it's like trying to 
make a movie, and you have a lot more exposition to get across than in an 
average episode."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: WAR IS HELL, BUT 'CIVIL WAR' IS SPLENDID; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ON SUNDAY, PBS FIRES THE FIRST SALVO OF ITS 11-HOUR MINISERIES, A 
SCINTILLATING MASTERPIECE NOT TO BE MISSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern novelist Robert Penn Warren tells us in "All the Kings Men" that no 
one is truly innocent, that even high-minded actions can result in evil. 
</P>
<P>
Probably no television program in recent times echoes this more than "The Civil 
War" on PBS. Ken Burns' 11-hour account of the War Between the States is an 
ironic masterpiece. It's as scintillating and utterly seductive as television 
gets, a Yankee Doodle Dandy of a historical extravanganza from a man who 
combines a scholar's appreciation of fact with a filmmaker's eye and 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
The miniseries will be broadcast Sunday through Thursday at 8 p.m. on Channels 
28, 15 and 24, and at 9 p.m. on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
If quality triumphs, "The Civil War" will march through five nights of prime 
time the way William Tecumseh Sherman marched to the sea, leveling everything 
in its path. It is that good. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civil War" is a chronological narrative that unfurls simply yet creatively 
and artfully. There are sound effects, but only one major re-creation: Unseen 
actors read lines from the comedy that Abraham Lincoln was watching at Ford's 
Theater when he was mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth. As laughter in the 
theater swells, a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, history springs to vibrant life here from thousands of photographs 
-- armies of photographers followed the Union and Confederate armies -- 
enhanced by approximately 900 first-person quotes from war letters, diaries and 
memoirs. The unseen readers range from Sam Waterston as Lincoln to Jason 
Robards as Ulysses S. Grant, from Julie Harris as Mary Chestnut to Morgan 
Freeman as Frederick Douglass, from Jody Powell as Stonewall Jackson to Studs 
Terkel as Benjamin F. Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Although drawing from numerous consultants for his research, Burns disdains 
talking heads and uses only a few authorities as on-camera commentators, 
principally historian Shelby Foote, whose soft Southernese becomes almost a 
secondary narration. 
</P>
<P>
There is no finer historical documentary maker in America than Burns, whose 
previous topics have included the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty. 
Consider his task here: Create a living history on the screen without having 
footage of that history. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, his great genius as a visual storyteller is his ability to draw 
fluidity from stillness. His camera pans charred, swollen bodies as if it were 
Lincoln's own eyes wearily surveying the battlefield. Sometimes the camera 
seems to come almost from within the old photographs that Burns is shooting, 
starting at the center and then ever-so-slowly pulling back, or vice versa, 
creating a sense of motion. All the while, bugles or drums or cannon or horse 
hoofs or shouts or moans or readings or music come across the sound track. 
</P>
<P>
The sights and sounds are beautifully mixed. Jay Ungar's mournful "Ashokan 
Farewell" interweaves the entire production, and "Jacob's Ladder," "The Battle 
Hymn of the Republic" and other songs, since passed down like genes from 
generation to generation, set moods and tones. 
</P>
<P>
Burns presents the war from infinite perspectives -- the personal stories of 
both major and minor figures, the famous and the anonymous becoming the strands 
of a richly detailed historical tapestry. Hardly an aspect of the conflict, no 
matter how small, goes unmentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Threading all of these diverse elements, meanwhile, is David McCullough's 
narration, a hint of poignancy in his flat, Everyman's voice. 
</P>
<P>
If "The Civil War" has a serious flaw, it's Burns' failure at times to see 
enough of the past in the present. 
</P>
<P>
The point is made -- through the words of Douglass and others -- that the 
Emancipation Proclamation freed blacks from slavery, but not from 
discrimination, a condition that continued to prevail during the South's 
ensuing white supremacy years and that remains a sore that festers nationwide 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In other ways, however, historical links to the present are unexplored. For 
Foote to almost cavalierly dismiss Sherman as "the first modern general" 
because of the way his Union troops waged ruthless war on innocent Confederate 
civilians while marching southward, for example, suggests tacit approval of 
acts as indefensible as the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War had its own massacres. In the first installment Sunday, Burns 
sets the stage for Southern secession and war. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1850s, the United States resembled a giant picture puzzle whose 
pieces were loosening and falling away. McCullough: "By 1860, the last year of 
peace, one out of seven Americans belonged to another American." As the 
nation's "sleeping serpent" of slavery finally uncoils, war clouds thicken and 
hover ominously. 
</P>
<P>
On April 12, 1861, Southern artillery fires on Northern troops inside Ft. 
Sumter off the coast of South Carolina, officially beginning the war that Foote 
says defined America like no other event in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Like all wars, this one produced its own brand of nervous humor, and Burns 
spreads it liberally. A Confederate soldier observes about reticent Union 
commander Gen. George McClellan at Sharpsburg: "McClellan had brought superior 
forces . . . but he had also brought himself." 
</P>
<P>
One is especially struck by the initial fervor on both sides -- entire towns 
signing up, and Army companies, in a forerunner of contemporary gangs, brashly 
calling themselves "Thrashers" or "Desperadoes" or "Killers" -- and how this 
seems a metaphor for all war. 
</P>
<P>
Yet jubilance here is eclipsed by death, as weapons exceed tactics and the 
bravery of soldiers often exceeds the ability of their officers to lead them. 
As a result, the carnage is appalling. 
</P>
<P>
In this bloody universe, the air is thick with cannon balls, and soldiers 
crouch behind walls of their own dead. And from the diary of someone recalling 
the Battle of Shiloh in 1862: "Everywhere wounded men lay in agony. Neither 
army had yet devised a system for gathering or caring for them on the field. 
Scores of wounded collapsed and died drinking from a mud hole near the peach 
orchard, staining the water red. It began to rain, and flashes of lightening 
showed hogs feeding on the ungathered dead." 
</P>
<P>
Even more indelible are the photos: 
</P>
<P>
* Amputated limbs stacked like firewood. 
</P>
<P>
* Rigid, twisted bodies, their "fixed eyes staring at the sky." 
</P>
<P>
* Three eyeless skulls resting together on the earth, neither who they once 
were nor whose side they fought on mattering any longer. 
</P>
<P>
* The infamous Confederate prison near Andersonville, Ga., its skeletal inmates 
appearing too weak even to move. 
</P>
<P>
The moment of the entire series, though, is a sequence depicting the pivotal 
1863 defeat of Robert E. Lee's Confederate army at Gettysburg -- the battle was 
a war in itself -- that cost both sides dearly. It ends with Waterston reading 
Lincoln's famed Gettysburg address as photographs of battlefield dead dissolve 
to ancient newsreel footage of white-haired Gettysburg veterans many years 
later revisiting this place where their comrades fell. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's Lincoln's assassination as a grim postscript to four years of 
war that have just ended. The dying President is moved from Ford's to a 
boarding house across the street, where he sinks like the sun, a brightness 
suddenly gone. 
</P>
<P>
It's one more memory that you take away from these 11 hours and another reason 
why, more than just a program, "The Civil War" is an event.

GOLDBLUM GETS PHYSICAL IN 'TALL GUY'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: KNOWN FOR HIS NEUROTIC SIDEKICK ROLES, THE VERSATILE ACTOR EXHIBITS 
PROWESS AT SLAPSTICK COMEDY IN HIS LATEST FILM.

Jeff Goldblum rushes into his publicists' Beverly Hills office and apologizes 
profusely for being late. (He called twice from his car phone to keep us 
abreast of his pending arrival). The tall, rangy actor who capped off 10 years 
of quirky character parts with a critically acclaimed performance as the doomed 
scientist in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of "The Fly," Goldblum is here 
today to discuss his newest film, "The Tall Guy." 
</P>
<P>
The story of a shy, awkward American actor who moves to Britain with dreams of 
glory on the London stage, "The Tall Guy" is a broad comedy in the vaudevillian 
tradition of the British music hall (we're talking very broad comedy here -- 
the film features a pair of singing underwear). 
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of British comedian Mel Smith, Goldblum proves himself 
adept at physical comedy, handling pratfalls, sneezing fits and a wildly 
choreographed love scene with remarkable skill. Recently seen in "Twisted 
Obsession," a dark erotic tale, and the HBO film "Framed," Goldblum is capable 
of great stylistic leaps. 
</P>
<P>
"I was attracted to 'The Tall Guy' because I found the script touching and it 
made me laugh," says the 38-year-old actor. "Originally it was called 'Camden 
Town Boy,' so I had to Americanize the part a bit because I didn't relate to 
the character initially. 
</P>
<P>
"Not knowing how to ask a girl for a date, not being sure if I'm attractive -- 
those aren't great problems for me in my own life (Goldblum is married to 
actress Geena Davis). I didn't want to play the guy as a complete loser, so I 
tried to ride a delicate line and imagined how I'd feel if I were down on my 
professional luck -- and that wasn't hard for me to get in touch with," he adds 
with a rueful laugh. "I've had a miraculous career, but I do know what 
disappointment means." 
</P>
<P>
While Goldblum points out that his career hasn't been without low moments, he 
has actually charted an unusually consistent course from his childhood in 
Pittsburgh to starring roles in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
One of two children born to a prosperous Pittsburgh couple, Goldblum was a 
natural clown from the time he was a child: "I've had a sense of my own charm 
since I was very young." 
</P>
<P>
He made his stage debut in the fifth grade in a Gilbert and Sullivan 
production, and he remembers his performance at his bar mitzvah as "quite good 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Goldblum clearly had the consciousness of an actor from an early age, and as a 
teen-ager spent summers studying acting at Carnegie-Mellon University. By the 
time he was 17, he had persuaded his parents to set him up in an apartment in 
New York so he could study with legendary acting coach Sandy Meisner. 
</P>
<P>
His film career blossomed quickly thereafter. First noticed portraying a cocky 
young actor in the 1976 film "Next Stop Greenwich Village," Goldblum was 
launched toward a string of juicy character roles. 
</P>
<P>
Though his riveting dramatic performance in "The Fly" would seem to have opened 
new doors, his choices have continued to be offbeat and he followed "The Fly" 
with two wildly improbable comedies, "Vibes" and "Earth Girls Are Easy"; "The 
Tall Guy" continues in that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed trying to be funny and, being fairly athletic, I have a 
feeling for physical comedy," he says. "Ultimately, however, this movie is more 
than a comedy: It's about love and conquering your fears so that you'll be able 
to connect with people. This is one of the great lessons of life I'm still 
learning. For me, the important things in life are few and I keep dealing with 
the same issues over and over. 
</P>
<P>
"And for me, acting is very much like a form of therapy -- a very healthy form. 
To be a good actor takes a great degree of health, yet one acts as a result of 
certain deprivations in their life. In order to act, you have to be open, 
receptive, sensitive and intuitive enough to get what another person is saying. 
That's a fabulous model for living and it's fantastic to get to practice it 
under the imaginary circumstances of acting." 
</P>
<P>
The down side of acting is, of course, the cult of fame that hangs like a weird 
distorting fog over the movie industry. People revere actors not so much for 
the work they do -- in fact, most people know very little about the actual work 
of acting -- but rather, actors fascinate us for the simple fact that they've 
made themselves known. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking from my own experience -- which I'm sure has something to do with 
this epidemic obsession with fame -- I think we're all starved for recognition. 
I don't know what's lacking in the parenting most of us experience, but it 
seems that from an early age most people feel starved for recognition. And I 
suppose fame seems like a solution to that hunger. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he sees himself evolving as an actor, Goldblum says: "I see a steady 
progression in my work. It is a skill that improves with practice, but at the 
same time, there's magic involved, and things occur that I don't understand. In 
the end, the things I don't understand are the technique. Inviting magic in -- 
that's the technique. Bad acting -- and bad living -- is mechanical acting. 
Inspired acting -- and living -- is spontaneous and it requires a lot of faith. 
And that's the religion of acting -- having enough faith to surrender to 
chance. Life isn't always cordial to that trust and it tries to police us into 
submission, but I've found that vigilance in the pursuit of faith and magic is 
spiritual money in the bank."

'MISPLACED' CRITIQUES PROMISED LAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elzbieta Czyzewska, the Polish film and stage star who provided the inspiration 
for Oscar-nominated Sally Kirkland's title role in "Anna" a few years back, has 
a leading role herself in Louis Yansen's "Misplaced" (Monica 4-Plex), a warm 
and incisive independent production of modest budget and impressive impact. 
</P>
<P>
Czyzewska and John Cameron Mitchell -- his Polish accent is as flawless as 
Kirkland's Czech accent was in "Anna" -- play mother and son, Halina and Jacek 
Nowak, who depart an increasingly ominous Warsaw in 1981 for a Washington 
suburb, where Czyzewska's mother (Viveca Lindfors) and half-sister (Deirdre 
O'Connell) and her husband, David (John Christopher Jones), live. 
</P>
<P>
The emigrant struggle to build a new life in an alien land is familiar enough, 
but the observations of Yansen, for whom the film is semi-autobiographical, and 
co-writer Thomas DeWolfe are especially revealing, giving us a picture of 
contemporary America through the eyes of newcomers that doesn't pull punches. 
</P>
<P>
The kids at Jacek's school are spoiled, self-absorbed and thoughtlessly cruel. 
The women at Voice of America, where Halina lands a job as a cleaning woman, 
are condescending and self-important. Both mother and son face a very nearly 
overwhelming challenge in winning acceptance and opportunities worthy of them. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters is that Jacek, a promising 17-year-old violinist, is 
coming of age just as his mother, who left her marriage behind in Poland, is 
drifting into an affair with an affable blue-collar man (Drew Snyder) from 
Arkansas, to the youth's disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
"Misplaced," which marks Yansen's feature debut, is longer on substance than 
style. That's scarcely a sin, however, considering how many pictures are all 
style and no content. What's more, its characters are exceptionally well-drawn 
and beautifully played. Czyzewska conveys the underlying weariness and near 
despair of the persistent Halina, and Mitchell's Jacek, the film's primary 
figure, is achingly proud and vulnerable. Lindfors' fiery grandmother has an 
innate beauty and elegance that time and decades of working as a charwoman 
cannot dim. Kellie Overbey is lovely as a high-school girl who proves to be not 
so shallow as she first seems. 
</P>
<P>
"Misplaced" comes alive in its telling details. Jacek, for example, is 
outfitted at the local mall for his first day at school by the well-meaning 
David only to have his clothes put down with a single phrase: "K mart."

RICCARDO CHAILLY MAINTAINS A ROMANTIC VISION; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE FIRST NON-DUTCH MUSIC DIRECTOR OF THE CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA HAS 
ALSO EXPANDED THE REPERTORY TO INCLUDE NEW WORKS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, one of the Netherlands' great 
cultural treasures and one of the world's most critically acclaimed and 
recorded orchestras, is an institution steeped in tradition. Ever since the 
days of Willem Mengelberg, who led the orchestra from 1895 to 1945, the 
orchestra has honed a signature sound especially admired in music of the late 
Romantic period. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, during the centennial year of the orchestra, controversy was 
stirred when Riccardo Chailly, an Italian conductor and new-music proponent, 
took over as music director. With the exception of a three-year co-director 
stint by German conductor Eugen Jochum in the early '60s, it was the first time 
a non-Dutchman held that position. 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy was short-lived. The orchestra not only maintained its 
stature, but has expanded its repertory with more music written recently -- 
including a just-released recording of Berio's "Sinfonia." 
</P>
<P>
"Music is an international language with the same frontiers the world over," 
said Chailly, 37, in a telephone conversation from Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fundamental skill for musicians to express all the various styles of 
music-making. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience in Amsterdam is very intellectual and international. I sense no 
problems with anyone that a non-Dutch conductor has taken over the post. The 
orchestra members themselves democratically voted me in." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night in the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Chailly (pronounced 
shy-YEE) brought the orchestra back for its fifth visit to the Southland, its 
last appearance occurring five years ago under Bernard Haitink. 
</P>
<P>
The program tonight is Schumann's Symphony No. 4 and Mahler's "Das Lied von der 
Erde" with mezzo-soprano Jard van Nes and tenor Goesta Winbergh as soloists. 
The orchestra will perform two more programs in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
at the Music Center Saturday and Sunday with music by Rossini, Schubert, 
Brahms, Prokofiev, Beethoven and the Dutch composer Bernard Wagenaar. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation with the orchestra is a combination of two things," Chailly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the great historical background which includes a large emphasis on 
late Romantic works -- Mengelberg often invited Gustav Mahler to conduct the 
orchestra, creating a special relationship with that composer. And, by 
character, it has always been an orchestra which has looked forward. I'm trying 
to maintain both of these aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of all, the tradition of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra is one of 
commitment, of working daily and always trying to improve on what it had done 
before. The acoustics inside the Concertgebouw (hall) are particularly good for 
late Romantic works, which has over the years helped create the traditional 
sound and repertory." 
</P>
<P>
Mengelberg's half-century stay with the orchestra grounded the orchestra's 
expertise in its repertory, which continued under the tenures of Van Beinum 
(1945-59) and Haitink (1961-88). Chailly said that he has no intention of 
trying to slight this tradition, but has added contemporary music to the agenda 
and is trying to perform works by lesser-known Dutch composers, such as 
Wagenaar. 
</P>

"I have been accused of wanting to play only avant-garde music. That's not 
true," he said. "If it's good music then it's worth playing whether it's 
avant-garde or Romantic. 
</P>
<P>
"The orchestra's woodwind section is especially perceptive to avant-garde 
music. They are all part of the Netherlands Wind Ensemble, which for the past 
20 years has been completely dedicated to new music."

Chailly, the son of an Italian composer who began conducting at 14, has formed 
an almost spiritual relationship with the city of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
"I love everything about that city," he said. "I like the way the city is 
designed from the old center, newer sections layered outward from it. You can 
get to any place you want by just walking. 
</P>
<P>
"And after I had moved into my new house in Amsterdam, I discovered that it was 
designed by the same architect who designed the Concertgebouw. To me, that was 
a miracle."

CUT, UNCUT: If a federal budget isn't agreed upon by Oct. 1, the FAA plans to 
furlough air traffic controllers and cancel thousands of flights a day at 40 
major airports. John Wayne was on that list until Thursday, but the FAA decided 
it could handle normal traffic there, even with furloughs. . . . Look for big 
cuts at LAX, however. If furloughs are ordered, controllers could handle only 
57% of peak-hours traffic. Cathy Curtis and Bob Schwartz

SURROGATE SISTERS: One way to discourage the strife in surrogate mother cases 
like Anna Johnson's (A1) is for women with fertility problems to turn to their 
sisters, says one specialist. . . . Dr. Ricardo Asch, director of the Center 
for Reproductive Health at UCI Medical Center, says asking a sister to bear 
your child can preclude the combative and possessive emotions that sometimes 
arise in hired surrogates. . . . But not always. Custody fights between sisters 
have occurred in South Africa and England, Asch says. "Maybe we'll never be 
able to prevent it entirely." Cathy Curtis and Bob Schwartz

KILLER ART: Portraits of notorious murderers, to be exhibited in Fullerton next 
week, have already received an Orange County-style welcome: complaints that the 
pictures will erode community morals. . . . The portraits were drawn for a 
series of 40 tongue-in-cheek trading cards and include such Southland killers 
as Richard (Night Stalker) Ramirez, above. Some parents have called the Get 
Lost gallery and threatened to picket if the portraits are displayed. There are 
no plans to cancel, the gallery says. Cathy Curtis and Bob Schwartz

FOUR RACES TO WATCH IN THE FALL; 
</P>
<P>
72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The combatants: Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) faces a political 
newcomer in Democrat Tom Umberg. Incumbents are usually safe, but Democrats 
consider this race one of their best chances this year to unseat a Republican 
because Pringle is sitting in the only district in Orange County that is not 
dominated by GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
Key issues: This district includes some of the county's most notorious drug and 
gang neighborhoods, so both candidates are fighting hard for the title of crime 
fighter. Umberg has attacked Pringle for his connection to the hiring of 
uniformed guards at polling places in his 1988 campaign. Pringle calls Umberg a 
carpetbagger for moving into the area so he could run for office. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Look for a close and muddy campaign. Also, watch how the candidates 
appeal to minority communities since this district the county's largest Latino 
and Vietnamese communities. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign funds as of 6/30: 
</P>
<P>
Pringle: $103,000 
</P>
<P>
Umberg: $24,000 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Attorney 
</P>
<P>
The combatants: James G. Enright, the chief deputy, is taking on his 
boss-by-appointment, Michael R. Cappizzi, who was the protege of longtime Dist. 
Atty. Cecil Hicks, have been adversaries within the office for years. Enright 
was second-in-command as chief deputy, but Capizzi wielded all the power as 
Hick's right-hand man. Most of the staff backs Capizzi, who was appointed 
district attorney by county supervisors in January. 
</P>
<P>
Key issue: Enright is trying to depict Capizzi as the politician's choice, 
claiming that Hicks and Capizzi engineered Capizzi's appointment. Capizzi said 
he will run only on his record and not attack Enright during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Most court house observers see Capizzi as being hard to beat, but they 
say Enright's surprisingly strong showing in the June primary might give him 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign funds as of 6/30: 
</P>
<P>
Enright: $18,102 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi: $140.541 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor, District 2 
</P>
<P>
The combatants: Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder faces a tenacious but underfunded 
challenge from Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer. Wieder has won the 
endorsement of local conservative Republican clubs; one reason was her recent 
opposition to Measure M, the proposed transportation sales tax. Since she 
supported the measure until June, that could leave her open to charges of 
inconsistency from Neugebauer, who has always opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Key issue: Wieder. She took a beating in a 1988 congressional race after she 
was caught lying about her resume. Neugebauer will try to capitalize on that. 
The two candidates also differ on abortion: Neugebauer calls herself 
"pro-life," while an upcoming Wieder fund-raiser bills the supervisor as the 
county's "only Republican pro-choice candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Wieder holds the reins. If she stays out of trouble, she's the 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign funds as of 6/30: 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer: $3,014 
</P>
<P>
Wieder: $15,812 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Superintendent of Schools 
</P>
<P>
The combatants: Longtime incumbent Robert D. Peterson faces an upstart effort 
by political neophyte John F. Dean, a Whittier College Professor. Dean has 
tapped resentment toward Peterson, but the incumbent is a scrappy and 
experienced politician. 
</P>
<P>
Key issue: Money. Both campaigns are running on fumes, and each candidate has 
been forced to dip into his personal accounts: Peterson has spent $20,000 of 
his own cash, Dean has contributed $30,000 to his own campaign. With such an 
obscure office, whoever has more money will have a big edge. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: They're scheduled to meet face to face in a forum at the Irvine Hilton 
on Oct. 10. Look for tough campaigning all the way to Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign funds as of 6/30: 
</P>
<P>
Peterson: $2,266 
</P>
<P>
Dean: $10,439

HUSBAND IS FOCUS OF INVESTIGATION IN POISON DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PROSECUTORS HAVEN'T YET SAID THE CASE INVOLVES FOUL PLAY AND NO CHARGES 
HAVE BEEN FILED. RICHARD OVERTON'S LAWYER DOUBTS LEGAL ACTION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard K. Overton of Dana Point, a mathematics and computer specialist and 
part-time college professor, is under investigation in the 1988 
cyanide-poisoning death of his wife, Jan Overton, a prominent South County 
school board member. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed, and prosecutors have yet to say publicly they are 
certain that Jan Overton died of foul play. But Overton has been under intense 
investigation by the Orange County Sheriff's Department for the past year, and 
a decision on whether to file charges against him could be made within the next 
several weeks, according to informed sources. 
</P>
<P>
Although the case has already been turned over to the district attorney's 
office for prosecution, sheriff's investigators were still conducting 
interviews with potential witnesses and pursuing other evidence this week. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney hired by Overton confirmed Thursday that the district attorney's 
office has been investigating his client in connection with the death and that 
he discussed the matter with prosecutors this week. But attorney Robert D. 
Chatterton said he is not convinced that his client will ever be charged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been more than a year; if they really think he is a suspect, why haven't 
they charged him with anything?" Chatterton said. 
</P>
<P>
Overton, 62, told The Times last week that any suggestion he killed his wife is 
"so wild and preposterous" that he would not discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying for 2 1/2 years to resume and rebuild our lives," Overton 
said. "I'm not going to revive any more of that pain by commenting on 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials searched Overton's home more than a year ago, but 
affidavits and records related to that search have been sealed under court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Chatterton acknowledged that more than a hundred computer 
disks were seized during the house search, plus some diaries and personal 
papers. Many of those personal effects still remain in the custody of law 
enforcement officials. But Chatterton said he did not believe anything of 
consequence regarding Jan Overton's death was found. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton said law enforcement authorities have refused to tell him where the 
investigation stands or whether charges would be brought against his client. 
But he predicted that it would not be any time soon, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take (prosecutors) at least another two months to make a decision on 
who, if anyone, is responsible for her death," Chatterton said. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Overton, 46, vice president of the Capistrano Unified School District, died 
unexpectedly at the Overton home on Jan. 24, 1988, as she prepared to leave for 
a family outing. Paramedics temporarily revived her, but she was pronounced 
dead upon arrival at San Clemente General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of six children and stepchildren was a former president of the 
Orange County School Boards Assn. and had served on the state School Boards 
Assn. Delegate Assembly. She had been a member of the Capistrano school board 
for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of her death was undetermined for several months. "Natural causes . . 
. pending investigation," the original death certificate stated. 
</P>
<P>
But in February, 1989, the coroner's office revealed publicly for the first 
time that she had died of cyanide poison. 
</P>
<P>
After a tip to the coroner's office, Sheriff's Department's homicide 
investigators were asked to look into the Overton death in July, 1988. It was 
in December, 1988, that her death certificate was amended to include cyanide as 
the cause of death. The public revelation came two months later. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, investigators have been quiet about the case except to say that 
no arrests had been made. Law enforcement authorities have refused to say who 
provided the tip to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton, Overton's attorney, said he believes that someone with an ax to 
grind against Overton has tried to stir up recent media interest in his client 
as a suspect. But the lawyer added that it would be misleading for anyone to 
believe that Overton feared a pending arrest just because he hired a lawyer to 
represent him in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to search your house, you have to assume that you are at 
least some sort of suspect," Chatterton said. "And only a dummy would not 
consider hiring a lawyer under those circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The Overton case has been assigned to Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher W. Evans, 
who declined to comment because "it's a case still pending investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton said he was in contact with Evans on Wednesday about the case but 
learned nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
Overton lists his current occupation as a consultant and professor. He had 
previously worked as a psychologist and has taught mathematics or computer 
courses at Cal State Long Beach and UC Irvine. In 1988, he taught managerial 
courses at USC. But in papers he filed with the county that year, he identified 
himself primarily as "a businessman. I have served major corporations, helping 
them increase their productivity through the human-oriented use of computers." 
He is also the author of a book on mathematical theory. 
</P>
<P>
Overton's first wife, Dorothy Boyer, filed for divorce against him in 1968, 
claiming "extreme cruelty and grievous mental and physical suffering." Boyer 
declined to discuss the issue because of their four children. Overton had a 
fifth child by a second wife. Richard and Jan Overton had one child, a son, 
Eric, now an adult. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators have been tight-lipped about any possible motive for 
Overton's death, numerous people who were close to Jan Overton say that the 
couple were having some marital problems in the year before her death. One 
neighbor described Jan Overton as "a wonderful woman who loved an afternoon of 
coffee and backgammon when she wasn't working." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Overton had worked for a computer company for several years, and in the 
later years of her life, ran her own computer business out of her home, friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Overton had run for his late wife's seat on the school board in 1988 after her 
death. Several of her friends who were upset with him over the couple's alleged 
marriage difficulties said they were secretly delighted when he made a poor 
showing and finished in the bottom half among seven candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Overton is described by people who know him as quiet and polite. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the 1988 school board election was Crystal Kochendorfer, active 
in parent-teacher activities in the district. She described Overton as "always 
a gentleman. I thought he would have done better in the election than he did." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement of qualifications to voters in the school board race, Overton 
stated: "I know our community. I've lived here for 25 years. My children have 
attended (the district's) schools since the first grade. And, of course, Jan 
shared many of her experiences on the board with me." 
</P>
<P>
During the last years of her life, Jan Overton was troubled with nagging health 
problems. One friend remembers a knee operation a few years earlier. Several 
others said she suffered greatly from a skin rash, the cause of which doctors 
had been unable to pinpoint. 
</P>
<P>
But one close friend who said she talked to her less than 24 hours before her 
death said she was cheerful and appeared to be in good health. 
</P>
<P>
When news of the cyanide findings were first published, Richard Overton was 
quoted in The Times as saying: "It's still hard to realize Jan is gone. Now 
this comes along. It's really just impossible to believe."

DANA PARSONS: BABY BOY NEEDS A NAME AND PARENTS, NOT LEGAL COUNSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let us pause to celebrate the birth of a child. Even in the face of the 
foolishness of adults, it's always a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Let's also give thanks he's not old enough to read the newspapers or watch 
television news. If he could, he'd no doubt high-tail it outta here. This may 
be the first kid in history whose first words aren't goo-goo or da-da, but "I 
wanna see my lawyer!" 
</P>
<P>
We're talking, of course, about Baby Boy Johnson, a great name for a rookie 
slugger just up from Triple A but not for a newborn infant. He deserves a real 
name, a real home and real parents -- not the legal sideshow that he's been 
born into. 
</P>
<P>
That decision will come and unless the law has gone coconuts, the baby will be 
turned over to Cris and Mark Calvert, his genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
Baby Boy was born Wednesday, delivered into the world by Anna Johnson, who 
signed on as a surrogate mother for the Calverts for $10,000 because Cris 
Calvert is biologically unable to carry a fetus. All sides agree that, barring 
the unforeseen, the baby is the genetic product of Mark and Cris. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson, a co-worker of Cris Calvert's, says she "bonded" with the child 
while pregnant and wants custody. Indeed, she's been breast-feeding Baby Boy. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's dueling press conferences, both sides laid out their claims to 
the child. Sometime today, a judge is expected to award temporary custody, 
pending a trial for permanent custody. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Johnson's attorneys say the original surrogacy contract is invalid, 
because such contracts by their very nature are illegal. As the birth mother, 
Richard C. Gilbert said, Anna Johnson is legally entitled to sole custody. But, 
Gilbert said, Johnson would agree to "shared parenting" of Baby Boy for life. 
To get the ball rolling, if the Calverts want to send over five prospective 
names, Johnson would be happy to select one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier claims that Johnson made about the Calverts' unfitness to be the 
baby's parents are being washed away in the spirit of compromise. "All is 
forgiven," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert called it conciliation; it sounded like backtracking from a case that 
just isn't going to stand up. 
</P>
<P>
But while the Calverts may have logic on their side, you have to wonder about 
their wisdom. Mark Calvert acknowledged Thursday that he and his wife didn't 
know Johnson had previously had two miscarriages and two stillborn children. 
</P>
<P>
Calvert also said he'd rather put Baby Boy in a foster home than let Anna 
Johnson have custody. Keep in mind that this is the woman to whom they 
entrusted the birth of their child. Let's hope the Calverts make better 
judgments about their son's future than they did about the circumstances of his 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps with time, this case will work itself out. 
</P>
<P>
Had these three taken more time to check each other out -- instead of making a 
decision as if they were buying a new washer and dryer -- none of this would 
have happened. The history of surrogacy in recent years is full of cases in 
which the surrogate mother developed a friendship with the parents. 
</P>
<P>
It'd be nice to envision a future when the Calverts and their son would be 
friends with Johnson, mindful of her special role in their life. But no court 
can order them to become friends. They'll have to do that in private, away from 
the glare of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you think I'm callous to Anna Johnson's claim of bonding with Baby Boy. 
I'm not. It's just that hers is a hard case to prove. None of us can get inside 
her mind. We can, however, reasonably assume that she didn't enter into this 
arrangement because she wanted another child or to "bond" with the Calverts' 
child. Whatever bonding that happened did so as an unforeseen byproduct of the 
pregnancy. On that basis, should she be given custody of someone else's child? 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't compute. 
</P>
<P>
We have only her word that she has, in fact, bonded with this baby at all. All 
we know for sure is that she agreed to deliver the child in exchange for money. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Fagen, co-director of the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly 
Hills, says it's wrong to assume that surrogate mothers automatically bond with 
the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Fagen says, studies indicate that "the mind-set of the surrogate when 
she becomes pregnant, from the very beginning, is that the child is not hers, 
which sets up a different psychological condition to the pregnancy. . . ." And 
in most cases, Fagen said, the surrogate "is out of the picture" after the 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all the legalisms and posturing on both sides, Johnson's 
attorney did say something Thursday with which I'm in total agreement. 
Referring to the upcoming custody case, Gilbert said: "I hope the Lord is with 
the judge on this case." 
</P>
<P>
Amen, brother. 
</P>
<P>
And to Baby Boy, I'd add a personal wish. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, kid. You're gonna need it.

MURDER IN THE SLAYING OF 12-YEAR-OLD GEMA MARIE.

<P>
A judge found 14-year-old Richard Hubler of Anaheim guilty of second-degree 
murder Thursday in the shooting death of his 12-year-old sister during what 
prosecutors said was an argument over the use of a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"You are going to have to face the decision that you are responsible for this 
act," Superior Court Judge Robert E. Thomas told the youth. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler, who was already on probation for two earlier gun-related incidents, had 
claimed the June 14 shooting of his sister Gema Marie was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
The judge found that while Hubler did not intentionally shoot his sister, he 
was guilty of second-degree murder by "implied malice" because he knew the gun 
had been malfunctioning before he pointed it at his sister and pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas may have inadvertently added to an outburst from the defendant's many 
family members and supporters by announcing that the penalty would be 25 years 
to life at a California Youth Authority facility. He acknowledged to lawyers 
later that he misspoke; the penalty can only be 15 years to life, with a 
possible two years added for the use of a gun. Formal sentencing is set for 
Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney said Hubler would probably serve seven years 
before he is released. He pointed out that the Youth Authority sets its own 
parameters for sentencing, giving itself wide latitude in releasing a youth 
earlier or keeping him confined up to age 25. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler called 911 from the family's Anaheim Shores home during the noon hour on 
June 14 and reported that intruders had shot his sister in her bedroom. He 
later admitted he had shot her. But he insisted that he thought the gun was 
empty when he aimed it at his sister and pulled the trigger while "messing 
around." 
</P>
<P>
The girl was shot once in the head and died four days later, never regaining 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler was already on probation for shooting another youth with a BB gun and 
getting caught with a .357 magnum handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas, noting Hubler's fascination with guns, described him as a virtual 
"repository" for firearms. The teen-ager had possessed at least six weapons in 
recent years and was known among his friends as someone who could saw off the 
stocks of shotguns and rifles to make them less bulky to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler had sawed off the stock of a .22-caliber rifle the night before the 
shooting of his sister, causing the loading spring to malfunction. That became 
a critical issue in the court's decision between second-degree murder and 
involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler told police that even before he shot his sister, he had been surprised 
when a bullet ejected after he thought he had already unloaded the gun. Hubler 
blamed the shooting on the spring malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with prosecutors' arguments that Hubler's knowledge that the 
gun could malfunction elevated the crime from involuntary manslaughter to 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
"The question we have to ask ourselves," the judge said, looking at Hubler's 
family and supporters, "would I, as a person, point any weapon at another 
person and pull the trigger? What is it that a person has on his mind when he 
performs that act?" 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that except for deputy marshals present, "probably no one in 
this courtroom" had ever aimed a firearm at someone and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Hubler deliberately shot his sister, but sought only 
second-degree murder because there was no evidence the act was premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler and his girlfriend had been on the phone from 11:35 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. 
the day of the shooting. Gema Marie had told her boyfriend she would call him 
at noon, which was why she was trying to get her brother off the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler's girlfriend told police that he shot the rifle twice while on the 
telephone after she dared him to. Then later, the girlfriend said, she heard 
the brother and sister arguing over the phone, with Hubler finally shouting to 
Gema Marie: "Shut up or I'll shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
The girlfriend later recanted the statement on the witness stand, but police 
had a tape recording of it, and it was played in court. 
</P>
<P>
In juvenile cases, judges decide a verdict without a jury. Thomas noted that 
this case was an especially emotional one because the victim's family was also 
the family of the defendant. Thomas took a brief recess before announcing his 
verdict, saying he wanted to give everyone a chance to view his decision with a 
clear head. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Romney said later he believed Thomas' ruling was the correct one. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are no victors in this one," Romney said. "This one was a tragedy 
from beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
Hubler's parents, James and Marie, did not want to discuss the verdict with 
reporters. Marie Hubler and many of Hubler's friends became so upset with news 
photographers in the hallway that a bailiff had to come out to ensure order. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Sharon Petrosini berated photographers for not having 
compassion for the family and refused to discuss the verdict with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"You simply cannot understand what this family has been through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
During a videotaped interview with police shortly after the shooting, Hubler 
had said that his sister's death had caused him to give up guns for good. 
</P>
<P>
"No you won't," Carl Martin, a police investigator, told him. "You're 
fascinated with guns." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's the last time I'm ever going to aim a gun at anyone, I'll tell 
you that," Hubler said.

NEW PLANNER PICKED AFTER INVESTIGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
After a one-week delay, City Council members voted unanimously this week to 
fill a vacancy on the city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The council was scheduled to approve the appointment of resident Mark Murphy to 
the five-member commission last week but postponed the decision after a group 
of residents questioned the council's selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Terry Sargeant, who applied for the position but was not chosen, 
questioned whether Murphy's qualifications were better than her own. Two other 
residents charged that Murphy's resume reached the city clerk's office after 
the Sept. 4 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Following an investigation by the city attorney's office, Mayor Don E. Smith 
said that Murphy's resume had been "lost in the shuffle" but actually was on 
file for months. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a question of qualifications because (Murphy) has proven his 
abilities," Smith said. "But people have the right to question the process." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 33, is a senior sales representative for the Apollo Systems Division of 
Hewlett-Packard in Irvine. He earned a bachelor of science degree and a 
master's degree from the University of Southern California. Both degrees were 
in business administration. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy previously served on the Orange Centennial Commission. He will fill the 
vacancy left by the Sept. 18 resignation of Commissioner Don Greek. GREG

MEETING PLANNED ON HOLLY-SEACLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission has scheduled a special meeting Monday to consider 
adopting the development agreement for the sprawling Holly-Seacliff 
development, a project being proposed by a subsidiary of the city's largest 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the agreement would lock in the developer's right to build the 
project in return for the company making certain public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, however, is contingent on the agreement being completed by 5 p.m. 
Monday. Officials said they plan to work overtime this week to complete it, but 
if any unforeseen problems arise, it could push negotiations past the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Despite protests by Chairwoman Geri Ortega not to rush approval of the 
agreement, four commissioners said they support holding the special hearing 
Monday. They argued that the commission should bring the issue to the City 
Council as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have no say in this matter," said Commissioner Jan Shomaker. "The 
City Council will be making the ultimate decision, so I'd like to see it 
expedited." 
</P>
<P>
After this week's commission meeting, Ortega said she believes that a majority 
of her colleagues want to adopt the agreement as a favor to the developer, a 
subsidiary of the Huntington Beach Co. That company is the city's largest and 
most influential landholder. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission does not approve the plan by next week, the agreement may not 
go before the council until after the Nov. 6 election. And since three 
incumbents, all considered pro-development councilmen, are stepping down, some 
observers believe that the developer is hoping to sign an agreement before the 
new council takes office. 
</P>
<P>
In other action this week, the commission also rescheduled its consideration of 
the environmental impact report on the controversial Pierside Village project. 
</P>
<P>
That hearing, which was postponed while city planners try to resolve several 
issues with the developer and respond to all public comments made in the 
report, is now set for the commission's regular meeting on Oct. 2. JOHN PENNER

COUNCIL APPROVES NEW TREE ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of discussion and debate, City Council members approved a new tree 
ordinance this week, setting up procedures for trimming and removing trees on 
city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance, which takes effect in 30 days, holds the city responsible 
for trimming trees located on city-owned parkways and gives the city control 
over removing trees and planting replacements. That replaces the old system, 
which allowed residents to do those tasks, if they first received city 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
The council passed the plan on a 3-1 vote, with Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Daly, who voted for the ordinance, lauded the parks department 
for updating its existing tree program. 
</P>
<P>
"Some street trees don't look very good. We need to fix that," Daly said. "And 
I think this is a good first step." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William D. Ehrle cast the only vote against the plan. "I think it's 
not enforceable and really a contradiction," Ehrle said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents who met with parks department officials drafting the 
ordinance expressed their own displeasure with the final product, which they 
said concentrates too much authority over trees in the city's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't answer any questions, and it doesn't please anyone who went to 
those meetings," said Joe White, who lives on Broadway, where about three dozen 
70-year-old oak and ash trees were razed earlier this year. "There's a need to 
change the ordinance; however, I don't think this ordinance is the one." 
</P>
<P>
White was one of a few residents who spoke against the ordinance at the City 
Council meeting this week. Those opposed were primarily concerned that the city 
did not create a special board to handle appeals of city staff decisions 
regarding trees. 
</P>
<P>
The residents had instead lobbied for a group of citizens and city officials to 
have the last word in cases where residents disagreed with the staff about its 
plans for certain trees. LISA MASCARO

WRONG-WAY DRIVER, 2 OTHERS KILLED IN HEAD-ON COLLISION

<P>
Three Orange County residents were killed early Thursday in a head-on collision 
involving a wrong-way driver suspected of being drunk, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of a van heading the wrong way on eastbound 7th Street was 
identified as Choong Kim, 47, of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Kim was taken to St. Mary's Medical Center in Long Beach with critical 
injuries, but died about nine hours after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Two other victims in the 2 a.m. crash, the driver of a Fiat and his female 
passenger, died at the scene, a stretch of 7th Street just west of its junction 
with the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiat driver was identified as Augustine Moreno, 18, of Santa Ana, and his 
passenger was Guadalupe Romero-Mendoza, 21, Long Beach Police Detective Don 
Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell said Kim is suspected of drunk driving and that his autopsy will 
include toxicological tests for alcohol and drugs. Results will not be 
available for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other details of the fatal accident remained sketchy, Terrell said, because it 
is not clear how and where Kim entered the eastbound lanes of 7th Street, 
before striking Moreno's car about 160 feet west of where the road spans the 
San Gabriel River channel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not real positive where he came from," Terrell said. "There are no cross 
streets in that area." 
</P>
<P>
The portion of 7th Street where the accident occured has a 30-foot-wide earthen 
divider, with the two westbound lanes on a grade about six to eight feet higher 
than the two eastbound lanes where the Fiat and the van collided, Terrell said. 
Both cars were traveling at speeds well over 40 m.p.h., in the far left lane, 
he said.

RAIN HOLDS OFF AND COOLNESS PREVAILS IN PRELUDE TO FALL; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SUNDAY MARKS THE ADVENT OF AUTUMN AND THE WET SEASON. WEATHERMAN SAYS 
IT WILL STAY DRY FOR A WHILE.

Orange County residents were treated to a prelude to fall Thursday as 
temperatures dipped into the mid-70s and overcast skies threatened rain. 
</P>
<P>
Though little, if any, rain is expected to fall this weekend, the cooler 
temperatures are expected to stick around for a while -- that is, unless the 
Santa Ana winds start to blow. 
</P>
<P>
Beach-goers couldn't tell much of a difference between summer and autumn 
weather Thursday as people made their way to parks and beaches for a moment in 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no comparison with the weather, the climate, the view," Philadelphian 
Robert Klug, 59, said as he took in the ocean view from Laguna Beach's Heisler 
Park. "Personally, I would say the weather (here) was ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Fall begins Sunday, the day that also officially marks the beginning of this 
year's much-needed rainy season. But meteorologist Marty McKewon of 
WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times, said Thursday that he 
doesn't expect to see the kind of rains necessary to relieve drought-stricken 
areas any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're calling for normal temperatures and drier than normal precipitation -- 
which isn't good news, I know -- for the next month," McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
Weather for this weekend, however, is expected to be a bit cooler than normal. 
McKewon said the upper-level low pressure that has carried a 20% chance of rain 
for Orange County today is expected to move northward Saturday. By Sunday, the 
skies should be clear, leaving only the cooler temperatures behind to greet the 
first day of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 20% chance of rain Thursday, no rain was recorded in the county. In 
fact, no rain has been recorded all month, unlike traditional September 
readings of about a quarter of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
The average high temperature for September is about 82 degrees while Thursday's 
high was 74. Temperatures are expected to remain about 5 to 7 degrees cooler 
than normal through the weekend, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
While the change of seasons is not heralded in Southern California by a carpet 
of brilliantly colored leaves, there are subtle signs of change. For example, 
brown hills turn green after the first rains and California flowers begin to 
bloom, said Charles O'Neill, museum scientist for the UC Irvine arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I hear from people who don't know is always, 'Southern 
California doesn't have a change of seasons.' That's just not true," O'Neill 
said. "There is a definite change of seasons here. Southern Californians who 
live here can sense the change, just as those from the East can, only theirs is 
more drastic with the snow." 
</P>
<P>
And the subtle change is just fine with visitors to Laguna Beach's Heisler 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the East Coast, New York, this is just a treasure," said 16-year 
Laguna Niguel resident Charlotte Lockwood, 75, as she rested from her walk 
along the shore Thursday. "Today, I thought I'd just come down and enjoy it 
fully."

Local environmentalists and city officials attempting to keep development out 
of Laguna Canyon learned Thursday evening the appraised value of the 2,150-acre 
canyon site owned by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
But negotiators for the preservationists and the company refused to disclose 
that figure -- estimated earlier at about $100 million -- after a closed-door 
session with the land appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with this professionally," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry as 
he emerged from the meeting. "We are all staying at the table together. We are 
going to attempt to do the best we can to resolve the issue of Laguna Canyon. 
That mood has not been altered by tonight's information." 
</P>
<P>
All of the parties involved in the negotiations contributed to the cost of the 
appraisal, conducted by Gary Vogt, but the Irvine Co. picked up a majority of 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Laguna Laurel Advisory Committee, an aggregate of all interested 
parties, plan to discuss the appraiser's report with their respective boards 
and resume talks on a buyout agreement Monday evening. The Laguna Beach City 
Council plans a special closed-door session this evening to discuss its next 
step in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday night's meeting, some committee members expressed optimism that 
an agreement would be worked out for the purchase of the Laguna Laurel land, 
located between El Toro Road and Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
But built into that optimism was the hope by some participants that the Irvine 
Co.'s asking price would be lower than the appraisal figure, that the company 
would contribute more than what has already been promised, and that the city 
would be given a long payment period. 
</P>
<P>
Giving up on the land is not a viable option, Gentry said in an interview 
before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to walk away from the table," he said. "We are all committed to 
making this work." 
</P>
<P>
But with identifiable funding sources totaling only about $45 million, Gentry 
conceded that any purchase price over $60 million might be difficult for the 
city to meet. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Phillips, the executive director of two environmental groups leading 
the preservation effort, agreed that a lot of progress had been made in the 
talks, particularly since the two sides were not on speaking terms a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, hoped for an affordable price from the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. has placed on the table a 10-year purchase plan, with $10 
million to be contributed by the company at the end of that period. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Orange County Board of Supervisors agreed in principle 
to also donate $10 million. Laguna Beach voters will be asked on the Nov. 6 
ballot to approve a $20-million bond issue for land acquisition, and the city 
is hoping to receive another $5 million in state parkland funds.

NUGGETS SIGN WOLF TO OFFER SHEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Denver Nuggets signed free agent Joe Wolf to an offer sheet Thursday, 
giving the Clippers 15 days to match the deal, worth more than $2 million for 
the next two years, or lose their former first-round draft choice without 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The package is believed to guarantee Wolf about $1.8 million over two seasons, 
including a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
There also are $200,000 in incentive clauses and an option year is worth $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers, set against 39.5% shooting in 1989-90, may price Wolf out of the 
Clippers' range. Wolf, about to begin his fourth NBA season, averaged 17.2 
minutes last season, although he played in 77 games, more than any other 
Clipper except Charles Smith, who played in 78. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good contract for Joe," said Mark Portnoy, Wolf's agent. "The way 
they (the Clippers) used him last year, I don't know if they'll pay this kind 
of money. But we'll wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf had perhaps his best game of the season at Denver, a 19-point, 
nine-rebound showing Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
In the next meeting at Denver, he made seven of nine shots for 17 points, and 
on April 20 against Seattle, coached then by Bernie Bickerstaff, the Nuggets' 
new general manager, the 6-foot-10 forward made three of six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls also showed interest in Wolf, Portnoy said, as did two teams 
in Europe. The Nuggets are looking to add size to a team that has one 7-footer, 
Blair Rasmussen, and only one other player is as tall as 6-10, unsigned rookie 
Terry Mills.

TENNIS: U.S. AND AUSTRIAN PLAYERS PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES IN DAVIS CUP 
SEMIFINAL. CHANG PLAYS MUSTER, THEN AGASSI FACES SKOFF.

<P>
For the Americans, who have momentarily quit feuding and having their feelings 
hurt, the Davis Cup match that begins today at a converted soccer stadium on 
the banks of the Danube is a chance to reach the finals for the first time in 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
For the Austrians, who have temporarily stopped calling each other names, the 
best-of-five competition is something like a Holy Day of National Recognition, 
the biggest sports event in years that is not performed on skis. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that these contentious teams, each with its resident free spirit, are 
meeting in a soccer stadium is also considered a redemption for the Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, their proud national soccer team lost in the opening round of the 
European Championships to some place called the Faroe Islands, a Danish 
protectorate somewhere in the mists north of Scotland. A few days later, the 
Austrian coach was fired. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Austrians, who a few years ago didn't know a tennis ball from the 
Viennese steamed dumpling, semmelknodel, have turned to their battling tennis 
trio of Thomas Muster, Horst Skoff and Alex Antonitsch to restore national 
pride lost ingloriously on the bleak isles. 
</P>
<P>
Skoff, 22, whose girlfriend was the 1988 Miss World, is the free spirit. A few 
years ago, Skoff called Muster, 24, something bad. As a result, the two leading 
lights of Austrian tennis barely spoke. Skoff claimed it was because Muster, a 
laconic sort, couldn't manage a complete sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian Davis Cup captain Filip Krajcik, explaining that it is difficult 
having two tennis stars in a country as small as Austria, said Muster and Skoff 
had some kind of rapprochement in Spain last February when the Austrians beat a 
tough Spanish team, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The American team of Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and doubles players Jim Pugh 
and Rick Leach, has also had its share of turmoil, mainly between Agassi and 
team captain Tom Gorman, who dared to criticize Agassi's sense of "commitment" 
after the U.S. team lost to West Germany in the semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
But at the draw for the order of matches Thursday in a marble ballroom of the 
Austrian Imperial Palace, Agassi said the quibble has been ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Gore had some differences a while ago, but we have come many steps 
since then," he said, looking like an Indian prince at an English public 
school, with his long, tinted hair, earrings and regulation Davis Cup blue 
blazer and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, as Agassi practiced looping topspin forehands on the 
new clay court in the 15,000-seat Prater soccer stadium, Gorman actually 
offered his young star a few words of friendly advice. Agassi smiled back 
tolerantly . 
</P>
<P>
Even if old wounds have healed, the match will not be a waltz or walk in the 
Vienna Woods for the Americans, mainly because the playing surface is clay, the 
Austrians' favorite. Muster, a muscular, hard-hitting baseline player, has not 
lost on clay in 22 Davis Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not kidding myself," Krajcik said, "This team is mediocre on another 
surface. We have had the luck to play all of our matches this year (against 
Spain and Italy) on clay." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the clay factor, veteran tennis commentator Bud Collins rates the 
Austrians slight favorites. 
</P>
<P>
However, Agassi was quick to mention in the prematch news conference that the 
Americans are no slouches on clay either. Two years ago, Chang won the French 
Open on the famous red clay of Roland Garros Stadium. This year, Agassi was 
runner-up, losing to clay specialist Andres Gomez of Ecuador in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Chang seemed particularly nationalistic about the duel with Austria, comparing 
the challenge to something worthy of Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Rambo movie, one man on a court against another man and 15,000 
people in the crowd," he said. "It will be very intense." 
</P>
<P>
According to the draw at the Hofburg Palace, Chang will open today with a 
singles match against Muster, whom he has never played. This was considered a 
break for the Austrian team, since Muster will be paired with Antonitsch in 
Saturday's doubles match. 
</P>
<P>
If Muster had drawn the second match of the day instead of the first, he faced 
the possibility of playing late this evening or, even worse, continuing the 
match Saturday morning before playing doubles. 
</P>
<P>
In the second singles match today, Agassi will play Skoff, a stylish clay court 
player with a powerful forehand who has always been in the shadow of Muster, 
the most accomplished Austrian player ever. 
</P>
<P>
Krajcik says Skoff has a chance against Agassi if he can rise to the quality of 
tennis he played in a grueling Davis Cup victory over Sweden's Mats Wilander 
last year. Skoff beat Wilander, 6-7, 7-6, 1-6, 6-4, 9-7, in a five-hour match. 
</P>
<P>
Most people believe that for Austria to win, Muster must win both of his 
singles matches and Skoff must beat Chang. Leach and Pugh, the Wimbledon 
doubles champions, are heavy favorites over the Muster-Antonitsch team, 
although the Americans have not played well recently on clay. 
</P>
<P>
If Chang wins the first match today, the Americans are likely to win the series 
and advance to the finals Nov. 30-Dec. 2. The young Californian considers 
himself an underdog but seems to delight in the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I am an underdog, I think that puts more pressure on Thomas (Muster)," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Skoff, never one to overestimate the talents of his fellow Austrian, 
predicted Muster will have a tough time with Chang. "I think it is going to be 
a long, physical match," Skoff said. "And Chang is in terrific shape. Of 
course, so is Thomas. I hope Thomas will win, but I think it will be long." 
</P>
<P>
The United States was last in the Davis Cup finals in 1984, when it lost to 
Sweden. It last won in 1983, against France.

NCAA PUTS FLORIDA TEAMS ON TWO YEARS' PROBATION 
</P>

<P>
The University of Florida was placed on NCAA probation for the second time in 
six years Thursday, and school officials were upset that the punishment 
included a postseason ban for this year's football team. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA chose to impose less than the minimum proscribed penalties in a case 
of major violations. The bowl ban for this season was the only punishment of 
the football program, and there was no ban on television appearances for either 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
The Gators also will not be eligible for the Southeastern Conference football 
championship because an SEC rule prevents teams that are ineligible for a bowl 
game to win the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball program's scholarships will be restricted, and it must repay at 
least $287,000 in revenue from the 1988 NCAA tournament because guard Vernon 
Maxwell played while he was ineligible. The Gators will be permitted 13 
scholarships in 1991-92, two fewer than the maximum, and 14 scholarships in 
1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
First-year football Coach Steve Spurrier said the bowl ban was a more severe 
penalty than Florida deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a clean-run program in the last four or five years," Spurrier 
said. "There's been no cash payments, no buying tickets of players, no 
falsifying of transcripts." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the ruling, the NCAA cited former basketball Coach Norm Sloan and 
former football Coach Galen Hall, both fired last October, for unethical 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Smrt, director of enforcement for the NCAA, said the case was unique 
because the school took significant corrective steps after the investigation 
was disclosed. For that reason, Smrt said, the five-member Committee on 
Infractions did not impose the minimum proscribed penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum penalties could have also included restrictions on postseason 
basketball, recruiting in both sports and television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Florida even faced the remote possibility of having its football and basketball 
programs shut down by the "death penalty." But even though the school escaped 
severe sanctions, university president John Lombardi took exception to the 
postseason ban on this year's football team, which is 2-0 and ranked No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not entirely comfortable with a set of penalties that appear to us to . 
. . penalize the innocent for the sins of a prior generation," Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly difficult when you recognize that these players and these 
coaches are now in the middle of their season, and these penalties at this time 
in their season appear to us to be a particularly difficult blow to accept." 
</P>
<P>
The school has 15 days to appeal the sanctions or ask that the ban on the 
football team be delayed. Neither Lombardi nor Athletic Director Bill 
Arnsparger would say whether the school will appeal.

Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, topped 
a list of a dozen athletes selected Thursday to compete on the U.S. Bobsled 
National Team for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Team selections were based on a nationwide, six-item fitness test conducted in 
July and a week-long series of push training clinics that concluded Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes were judged on their performances on a simulated track. 
</P>
<P>
"The push track is the best means of testing athletes before putting them on 
ice," said Tony Carlino, head coach for USA Bobsled. 
</P>
<P>
The also team includes: Brian Shimer, Naples, Fla.; Chuck Leonowicz, Clifton 
Park, N.Y.; James Womack, Brunswick, Ga.; Jeff Woodard, Schenectady, N.Y.; 
Bryan Leturgez, Cedar Lake, Ind.; Chris Conrad, San Juan Capistrano; Carey 
Winslett, San Antonio; Todd Snevely, Burnt Hills, N.Y.; Peter Blount, Orlando, 
Fla.; Chris Green, Plymouth, Pa., and Greg Harrell, Laurel, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic trials have not yet been formally announced, but U.S. bobsled officials 
said they hope to select a team by next March. 
</P>
<P>
Raider receiver Willie Gault was in the running for a spot on the team. He 
scored high on fitness tests but was not selected because his football schedule 
conflicts with that of the bobsledders.

LIONS' TAYLOR BANNED FROM LEAGUE

<P>
Cornerback Terry Taylor of the Detroit Lions became the seventh NFL player to 
be banned from the league for life when the league banished him after he tested 
positive for illegal substances for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor, who is in his seventh season, can apply for reinstatement in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
He was suspended for four games in 1988 while playing for the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round draft pick in 1984, Taylor, 29, was a starter for most of his 
seasons with the Seahawks before being traded to the Lions in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons released quarterback Gilbert Renfroe for the fourth time 
this season when they re-signed defensive back William Evers. 
</P>
<P>
Evers, a rookie from Florida A&amp;M, was signed last week and played against 
Detroit because cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Charles Dimry were injured. He 
was released and Renfroe re-signed this week when it appeared the two defensive 
backs were healing. But with safety Brian Jordan now hobbling, the numbers game 
got Renfroe again.

After being activated Monday, quarterback Steve Beuerlein hasn't been told 
whether he will play in the Raiders' game against the Pittsburgh Steelers 
Sunday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything," Beuerlein said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out about the activation through (the media). And things still haven't 
changed around here. I'm working with the scout team. Until I'm told anything 
else, I'm just trying to get myself better every day at practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been told anything about the game or what the plans are. I'm just 
resigned to the fact that if I go out here every day and keep confident and 
positive, things are going to work out." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein, who had a two-week roster exemption, said the Raiders never told him 
they were activating him. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents called me up and told me they had heard on a radio broadcast, and 
then I read in the paper the next day that I had been activated. That's the way 
I found out about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Raider defense, ranked 10th in the NFL last season, is eighth this season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raider offense, ranked 19th last season, is 23rd this season, far 
behind the No. 1 Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jay Schroeder, who had a quarterback rating of 60.3 last season 
after throwing eight touchdown passes and 13 interceptions, has improved to 
87.1 this season, fourth-best in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Raider center Don Mosebar and nose guard Bob Golic, who have 
ankle injuries, are listed as probable for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh free safety Thomas Everett is questionable with a head injury; 
quarterback Bubby Brister (knee injury) and guard Terry Long (hip injury) are 
probable. CHRIS BAKER

PARKER ALWAYS HAS BEEN A QUICK STARTER; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: HUNTINGTON BEACH NATIVE IS A LATE BLOOMER WHO DID NOT PLAY IN 
HIGH SCHOOL. HE HAS MADE AN IMPACT ON THE BUFFALO BILLS AS A ROOKIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the Buffalo Bills' newest offensive linemen doesn't know the meaning of 
one of the most common terms in football: the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Parker, a third-round draft pick from the University of Arizona, wouldn't 
know what to do if he were sent there. He's had virtually no experience with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie offensive linemen in the NFL usually are brought along slowly, but 
Parker made a good first impression, then started at left tackle in place of 
holdout Will Wolford in each of the team's four exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
"(Parker) has unshakeably earned a starting spot, something that is very, very 
hard to do," said Tom Bresnahan, Buffalo's offensive line coach. "(He is) a 
very talented guy, who's obviously had the benefit of good instruction and no 
bad habits." 
</P>
<P>
When the regular season began and Wolford signed and reclaimed left tackle, 
Parker was moved to right guard, where he started in the Bills' victory over 
the Indianapolis Colts in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
He's been there since. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a late bloomer. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach native never rode the bench at Edison High, simply because 
he didn't play organized sports there. 
</P>
<P>
He got his first taste of football only after friends and coaches at Golden 
West College in Huntington Beach talked him into trying out for the team. After 
playing backup offensive tackle his first year, Parker started every game for 
the Rustlers during the 1987 season, then was offered scholarships by four-year 
schools all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
And after starting every game in his two seasons at Arizona, Parker was chosen 
All-Pacific 10 last year and invited to play in the Senior Bowl at Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 6 and 305 pounds, Parker has size, but his coaches say that his 
attitude may be the key to his success. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big, huge guy with tremendous athletic tools," Bresnahan said. "His 
temperament toward the game, is as good . . . as I've ever been around in my 
years of coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ray Shackleford, coach at Golden West: "He had a lot of just innate, 
native ability to begin with. He can run . . . you can't coach that. He's got 
good speed, he's got good feet, he's got real good quickness. He's explosive, 
he has the right temperament. He has a lot of things all big guys don't have. 
You get a guy with that kind of talent, then you can coach him and the coaching 
is going to be rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
Parker figures his late start in football might have worked to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I didn't play in high school," he said. "I don't have to worry about 
the injuries or burnout that a lot of guys face at this stage in their career. 
One of the things I hated about high school athletics was the cockiness of some 
of the athletes. I had a good high school life without football, got to view it 
from both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Parker also doesn't take much of the credit for his ability. He says his 
coaches have been the driving force behind his success. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Dennis) Dixon was hard on me," Parker said of his former line coach at 
Golden West. "He kept me down to earth, made me learn the game." 
</P>
<P>
Parker's speed has been recognized as one of his major assets. Ron McBride, 
former offensive line coach at Arizona and now head coach at the University of 
Utah, recruited Parker for the Wildcats and clocked him at 4.9 seconds in the 
40-yard dash, fast for a man his size. 
</P>
<P>
Parker showed that speed in an exhibition against the Chicago Bears when he 
saved a touchdown by chasing down cornerback Maurice Douglass in the fourth 
quarter and putting him out of bounds at the two-yard line after Douglass had 
intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn's a real athletic guy, very skilled for the position he plays," McBride 
said. "It's not just his size. He's got good feet and he's tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
During training camp, Parker worked opposite defensive end Bruce Smith and held 
his own. Smith, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, is considered one of the best 
in the league at his position. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected something from him, but nobody here expected him to perform as 
well as this," Bresnahan said. "He certainly is a plus for us. . . . I expect 
he'll have a remarkable career."

ROBINSON UNSURE ABOUT TAILBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sticking to his stance that all three tailbacks will be treated equally for 
now, Ram Coach John Robinson said he has not made a decision yet about his 
starter at that position. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we usually flip a coin on Saturday nights, usually wait till then," 
Robinson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to play them all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't thought much about them. I'm serious about all of them 
playing -- Cleveland Gary has played less because he's played hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Curt Warner has run the most from tailback but Gary, coming off a back injury, 
seems to be ready to take more of the load. Gaston Green is the other man in 
the mix. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said there will be a decision made today about whether to sign an 
extra kicker because of Mike Lansford's sore lower leg. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is leaning that way and the second kicker may well be John Carney, who 
has survived two days of workouts with several other kickers. 
</P>
<P>
Carney edged out Teddy Garcia in a field-goal workout Wednesday, although 
Garcia was better on kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lansford figures to kick Sunday, Robinson is concerned that Lansford 
will reinjure the leg during the game. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams do sign Carney, or anyone else, they would have to cut a player or 
put someone on the injured-reserve list. TIM KAWAKAMI

IT'S STARTING TO COME TOGETHER FOR HUSKIES' BRUNELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homer Smith, UCLA's offensive coordinator, knows a good quarterback when he 
sees one, so it didn't take him long to realize that Mark Brunell had 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
Smith discovered Brunell, then a sophomore at St. Joseph High in Santa Maria, 
at Bruin Coach Terry Donahue's football camp in 1985. Smith pulled aside 
Brunell's high school coach and told him the youngster had talent. 
</P>
<P>
"From then on, football became Mark's real love," said Dave Brunell, Mark's 
father and the St. Joseph athletic director and baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
What did Smith see in Brunell? 
</P>
<P>
"There was just a naturalness about the kid and a work ethic," Smith said. "And 
he had a lot of poise." 
</P>
<P>
This poise has been severely tested since Brunell became Washington's starting 
quarterback this season. A 6-foot-2, 205-pound sophomore, Brunell has made his 
share of mistakes in the Huskies' first two games. 
</P>
<P>
Brunell was so confused that he lined up behind guard Dean Kirkland instead of 
center Ed Cunningham and tried to take a snap in last Saturday's 20-14 victory 
over Purdue at West Lafayette, Ind. He didn't realize his mistake until a 
Boilermaker defensive lineman told him he was standing in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of funny because the center started laughing," Brunell said. "But 
I'm not the first guy to do that. John Elway did it. All those butts look 
alike." 
</P>
<P>
On another play, Brunell tripped and fell after taking a snap. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the mistakes have affected his self-confidence, Brunell said: "If you 
lose your confidence, what else do you have? You've got to keep that 
confidence. If you don't have it, you might as well not step on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Brunell is confident that he'll eliminate his mistakes when Washington (2-0) 
plays USC (2-0) Saturday at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only played two games and he's made some mistakes that two-game players 
make," said Gary Pinkel, the Huskies' offensive coordinator and quarterback 
coach. "I think he's going to be very good." 
</P>
<P>
Recruited by Stanford, California, UCLA and USC, Brunell almost became a 
Trojan, but chose Washington after he made a recruiting trip to USC. Todd 
Marinovich was on the same trip. 
</P>
<P>
Did Brunell go to Washington because he knew Marinovich was headed for USC and 
he didn't want to be a backup quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what his intentions were," Brunell said. "I wanted to go to a 
place that I liked the best, and if SC was the place I wanted to go, I would 
have gone there. But I'm glad that I came to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked everything about Washington, and there were some things about SC that 
really didn't attract me. For a lot of people, SC could be a dream, but one 
thing that didn't seem like a dream was living in downtown L.A. I'm not ripping 
L.A., but I'm not really from the city. I'm from farther north and I really 
enjoyed the city of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"My SC trip was a bit different. I'm not knocking SC, but it just seemed like I 
was one of the many caught up in the shuffle. And Washington treated me really 
special." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, Brunell and Bret Johnson were the top three quarterbacks in 
Southern California in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, after becoming a starter as a redshirt freshman last season, led 
the Trojans to a 9-2-1 record, including a Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Brunell, after playing behind Cary Conklin last season, has become the Huskies' 
starter this season. Conklin became a Washington Redskin. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson started at UCLA last season but struggled as the Bruins went 3-7-1. He 
left school after being demoted last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We recruited all three of them," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "They were three 
quality quarterbacks that everybody was scrambling for. Johnson was the first 
guy who committed (to UCLA). We were sitting there and we thought we could lose 
them both and come up with zero. We knew we weren't going to get both 
(Marinovich and Brunell), so it was a matter of which guy made a complete and 
total commitment, and Todd happened to be that guy. But we felt any one of them 
could come in here and be successful in our offense. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think Mark has proven that. He has an extremely strong arm. I think the 
thing that stands out is his outstanding speed. People don't run him down. He's 
a great scrambler, and they're running the option more with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's playing very well, and I know that as the season goes on, he's 
going to be a major part of the Washington offense." 
</P>
<P>
Although Marinovich and Brunell are both left-handed, Brunell said they have 
different styles. "Todd and I are different kinds of quarterbacks," Brunell 
said. "I think Todd would rather sit back there in the pocket and throw, but if 
there's an opening, I'll take off and run." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich has become one of the nation's top passers, having thrown for 3,155 
yards with 20 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in his career. Brunell has 
struggled, completing 35.3% of his passes -- 18 of 51 -- for 215 yards with two 
touchdowns and two interceptions. He completed seven of 27 passes for 66 yards 
with one interception and one touchdown in a 20-17 season-opening victory over 
San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Although Marinovich has been the better passer, Brunell may be the better 
runner. Pinkel said Brunell accelerates faster than former Husky quarterbacks 
Warren Moon (now with the Houston Oilers) and Chris Chandler (now with the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers). 
</P>
<P>
Brunell ran for 76 yards against Purdue, including 47 for a touchdown, the most 
single-game rushing yardage by a Washington quarterback in the 16 seasons that 
Don James has been the Huskies' coach. Brunell, who also had a 47-yard run 
against San Jose State, has rushed for 140 yards and one touchdown in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith is impressed with Brunell's running. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got most of his rushing yardage just on scrambles," the USC coach said. 
"He's very, very fast. He doesn't just have good speed, he's got great speed. 
You look on the film, and he's outrunning Purdue's safety. He explodes down the 
field, and before you know it, he's in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
James said it's too early to compare Brunell to Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the comparison should be made once Mark has 12 games under his belt," 
James said. "There's no comparison right now. But if you take Marinovich a year 
ago at this time, there were a lot of questions. But they were able to win, and 
they brought him along. When it got down to where it really fell on his 
shoulders, then that's when he came through. He just got better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Brunell, a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher at Bell High, was named the 
Los Angeles City baseball player of the year in 1969 after he compiled a 12-3 
record and a 1.01 earned-run average. "It must have been a real weak year," he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly that. Also on the 1969 All-City team was Dwight Evans of 
Chatsworth High, who went on to play for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was drafted by the Kansas City Royals, Dave Brunell decided to 
attend Cerritos College for two years before transferring to Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, where he had arm problems. After the birth of his first son, Mark, in 
1970, the elder Brunell decided to concentrate on coaching and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
He moved the family to Santa Maria, where he got a job coaching baseball and 
teaching at St. Joseph High in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Like his father, Mark Brunell was also a good baseball player, making All-CIF 
as a pitcher/first baseman. But football was his first love. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brunell passed for 5,893 yards and 11 touchdowns in high school and led 
his team to the CIF final as a junior and to the semifinals as a senior. His 
younger brother, Matt, 15, has replaced him as St. Joseph's starting 
quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brunell still receives moral support from his father. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Brunell was at Husky Stadium when his son made his debut as the Huskies' 
starting quarterback against San Jose State three weeks ago, and he plans to 
attend Saturday's game against the Trojans. They speak by telephone three or 
four times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his father makes any suggestions, Mark Brunell said: "He just tells me 
to keep my cool no matter what happens, and keep confident. He's just real 
supportive. He's a dad and that's what they're supposed to do. . . . And any 
time I'm down or up, I'll talk to him. It's good to have a dad like that."

TRAINER FACING ACCUSATIONS AFTER DECEMBER RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Bruce Headley is facing an accusation by the California Horse Racing 
Board that syringes and an unauthorized medication were found in his Santa 
Anita barn during a multi-agency raid last Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Headley also faces misdemeanor charges in Santa Anita Municipal Court for the 
possession of 13 fighting cocks discovered in the same raid, which was 
conducted by the Arcadia Police Dept., agents of the State Humane Assn. and 
CHRB investigators. 
</P>
<P>
After five pre-trial postponements requested by defense attorneys, Headley has 
a court hearing scheduled today in Monrovia on the misdemeanor counts. It is 
unclear, however, why the CHRB has waited nine months to take action on the 
alleged discovery of syringes and unauthorized medication, which was said to be 
Filybol, an anabolic steroid not known for use in racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
Unless given permission from the board of stewards -- as in the case of a 
diabetic requiring insulin shots -- no one other than a licensed veterinarian 
is permitted to possess a syringe in a California race track stable area. 
</P>
<P>
CHRB Executive Secretary Dennis Hutcheson, who assumed his post in August, said 
he expedited the accusation as soon as the full facts of the case came to his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that my predecessor (Leonard Foote) was waiting for the case to 
be completed in the courts before bringing a CHRB action against Mr. Headley," 
Hutcheson said. "I wanted to deal with it as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Headley, one of the best-known trainers on the California circuit, claims no 
knowledge of the birds or the items listed in the CHRB accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't buy them, I don't own them, I know nothing about them," Headley said. 
"Unfortunately, though, the trainer-insurer rule holds me responsible for 
anything found in my barn. It's just a shame that something like this comes 
along when I've had such a clean record." 
</P>
<P>
Headley has had no significant rulings against him in 31 years as a trainer, 
during which time he has handled such major stakes winners as Variety Road, 
Johnica, Stylish Winner and Silveyville while training for such respected 
clients as Kjell Qvale, Buddy Johnston and John Mabee. Files of the Assn. of 
Racing Commissioners International show Headley with only one minor medication 
violation, occuring in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, Headley goes to the other extreme when it comes to medicating his 
horses," a local track veterinarian said. "He's always been very reluctant to 
even use much Bute." 
</P>
<P>
Hutcheson said the case would be presented before an administrative law judge, 
and that a hearing date would be set soon. Penalties for such violations 
usually carry some kind of suspension or, in extreme cases, revocation of 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert Forgnone will represent Headley in the racing board case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still investigating the statements made in the accusations," Forgnone 
said. "However, Bruce has assured me that he is innocent of any of the charges 
in the accusation. I trust that we'll be able to establish evidence to support 
his position." 
</P>
<P>
Thad Ackel is giving Great Communicator another chance to prove he still 
belongs in major league racing. 
</P>
<P>
Ackel, trainer and part owner of the 1988 Breeders' Cup Turf hero, has shipped 
the gelding to Shreveport, La., for Saturday's $200,000 Louisiana Downs 
Handicap at 1 3/8 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Ackel has given the mount to Chris McCarron, who replaces Ray Sibille, Great 
Communicator's jockey in his last 23 starts. Their last winning collaboration 
came in the Hollywood Turf Handicap in May 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been loyal to Ray for a long time, but it was time for a change," Ackel 
said from Louisiana. "I just hope Chris rides him with a lot of faith and 
doesn't pay too much attention to his recent past performance lines. He's 
hitting the ground sound all the way around, his coat looks magnificent and 
he's working better than I ever remember." 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator, 7, is North America's leading active money-winner with a 
bankroll of more than $2.8 million. However, he has lost all three of his 1990 
starts without displaying a trace of the fight that characterized his 
victories. In his most recent outing, the Del Mar Handicap on Labor Day, he 
finished last in the field of 12. 
</P>
<P>
"He tore off a front shoe in that race," Ackel said. "I'm sure that's when he 
lost his rhythm. Of course, I didn't know it until afterwards. When I saw him 
coming through the stretch, I thought, 'Uh-oh, he's hurt himself again.' 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, school's not out yet on the old boy. I spent $6,000 
to ship him here because I think he's still got a winning race in him." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye will be in New Jersey tonight to ride Silver Ending in the 
$300,000 Pegasus Handicap at the Meadowlands. Saturday, he will ride Gorgeous 
in the $200,000 Ruffian Handicap at Belmont Park, and Sunday he will be at 
Louisiana Downs to ride Cee's Tizzy in the $1-million Super Derby. 
</P>

SECURITY PACIFIC WINS BIDDING FOR MERCURY; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: REGULATORS ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THE SALE OF THE INSOLVENT 
S&amp;L'S 24 BRANCHES AND $2 BILLION IN ASSETS TODAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators are expected to announce today the government sale of 
insolvent Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. to Los Angeles-based Security 
Pacific Corp., which outbid several other institutions for the Orange County 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Thursday that the holding company for Security Pacific 
National Bank earlier this week won the bidding to acquire Huntington 
Beach-based Mercury's 24 branches and most of its $2 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The branches are expected to be reopened Monday as offices of Security Pacific. 
Deposits will continue to be insured by the federal government up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, headquartered in Huntington Beach, was declared insolvent and seized 
by federal regulators in February. It has been operated since then under 
auspices of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with selling 
or liquidating government-run S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale is completed today, it would mark one of the quickest sales ever of 
a thrift under RTC supervision. The agency is overseeing several hundred 
S&amp;Ls nationally, including 18 that have been offered for sale in California 
since June. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Carpenter, a banking consultant with Southport/Carpenter Group in Santa 
Ana, said that several of his firm's clients were active bidders for Mercury 
and valued the thrift for what is widely considered one of the industry's 
better branch networks and customer bases. 
</P>
<P>
Other bidders reportedly included Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly 
Hills, American Savings Bank of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal 
Savings Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Security Pacific confirmed Thursday that the company, with nearly 
$95 billion in assets, had submitted a bid for Mercury. They declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific has been shopping for troubled thrifts this year. In June, the 
company acquired 83 branches of Gibraltar S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
At RTC regional headquarters in Denver, spokesman Kevin Shields would not 
identify the winning bidder but confirmed that Mercury would be sold this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical government sale of an insolvent thrift, the government keeps the 
S&amp;L's bad loans, repossessed real estate and other "bad" assets while the 
acquiring institution gets the offices, equipment, deposits, and the "good" 
loans, real estate and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, founded in 1964, had grown to nearly $5 billion in assets by the 
mid-1980s and was considered a fairly conservative S&amp;L that eschewed some 
of the more unusual investments possible under California's liberal thrift 
investment laws at the time and stuck with single-family mortgage lending. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury began reducing its assets in the late 1980s to help it meet tightening 
government controls on capital. By the time it was seized in February, the 
S&amp;L had $2.2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The losses that led to its insolvency didn't come from the insider dealing and 
speculative investing that caused the ruin of many of the nation's S&amp;Ls. 
Mercury was hurt by new federal accounting rules that required it to reduce the 
value of a number of investments on its books and set aside capital-depleting 
reserves to cover the difference.

A SUGGESTION TO PICK UP FARM WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: PROFESSOR URGES FARMERS TO ORGANIZE JOB BANKS AND SHARE TEMPORARY 
EMPLOYEES TO EASE LAYOFF PROBLEM.

<TEXT>
<P>
A college professor has urged farmers to organize employee job banks to improve 
the lot of their workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Mason, who runs the Center for Agricultural Business at Fresno State 
University, said the idea would be to share employees wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
That way, workers wouldn't get laid off so often, which is a constant problem 
in agriculture. Mason said a survey he and Fresno State Prof. Andrew Alvarado 
conducted indicates Central California farm workers hold jobs less than five 
months out of the year, on average. 
</P>
<P>
"There's significant unemployment among the farm worker population," Mason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Growers would need fewer workers overall and wouldn't have to provide as much 
housing, Mason told the national Commission on Agricultural Workers, which is 
studying effects of the 1986 Amnesty Act on farms and farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Mason offered other bits of advice on ways growers can improve their 
relationships with workers. 
</P>
<P>
One recommendation was simply to "train supervisors better." 
</P>
<P>
Mason also cautioned that the trend to get workers through labor contractors 
who then handle the reams of paperwork can lead to farmers showing "less 
interest in your work force." 
</P>
<P>
He told the commission that statistics show California's farm labor force is 
concentrated among a relatively few large-scale growers and in a small number 
of labor-intensive crops, such as fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of workers don't work much, earning less than $1,000 a year," he added. 
"The puzzle is, who are these people?" 
</P>
<P>
The commission took testimony for two days in Visalia as part of a process of 
recommending changes in the agricultural provisions of the Amnesty Act. Another 
California hearing will be held in Imperial Valley in early December and a 
third either in Sacramento or Monterey next spring.

CANCER-DRUG LAB ONCOTECH FILES FOR FIRST SALE OF STOCK

<P>
Oncotech Inc., a small, money-losing laboratory here that helps doctors select 
the most effective chemotherapy for cancer patients, filed papers Thursday 
seeking approval for its initial sale of stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
In a registration filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Oncotech 
is seeking to raise about $10 million by selling 1.3 million shares of common 
stock at a price of between $7 and $9 per share. The company said it plans to 
use proceeds from the sale to expand its business. 
</P>
<P>
After the offering, Oncotech would have just over 3.3 million common shares 
outstanding with the remaining shares owned by venture capital companies and 
Oncotech employees, said Paul G. Kanan, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Oncotech was founded in 1985 by Dr. Larry Weisenthal, an oncologist and 
pharmacologist, and Dr. Robert Nagourney, an oncologist and hematologist. In 
1987, the company attracted a group of venture capital firms, led by Southern 
California Ventures of Irvine, which provided about $6 million in start-up 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Oncotech has lost $5.4 million since its founding, including a loss of $1 
million on revenue of $700,000 in the first six months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Kanan said the company expects the losses to continue at least through 1991 as 
the firm continues to invest substantial sums in research and development and 
establishment of a national sales network. 
</P>
<P>
Oncotech is one of a handful of laboratories, Kanan said, capable of testing 
the relative effectiveness of various drugs on cancerous tumors sent by 
hospitals across the country. Drugs used to treat cancer should be carefully 
selected, Kanan said, because their effectiveness differs from patient to 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Another part of Oncotech's business, Kanan said, is working with pharmaceutical 
companies to develop new cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The tumor specimens received by the laboratory are used to research the 
effectiveness of new drugs.

JOSEPH N. BELL: SCHOOLS GETTING BUM RAP, NEWPORT PRINCIPAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the qualities especially impressive about Dennis Evans is that he not 
only resents what he considers the bum rap being laid on public education these 
days, but he takes on the critics as well. Head to head. One on one. Something 
a lot of public educators -- who generally prefer to play it closer to the 
chest -- are reluctant to do. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who is the principal at Newport Harbor High School (and a very different 
breed from some of the administrators I remember when my kids were going to 
public school in Orange County 25 years ago) asked me rhetorically the other 
day: "Why do we accept the fact that we get what we pay for in every other area 
except public education?" 
</P>
<P>
We had been looking at a batch of recent headlines in Orange County newspapers 
that I carried into Evans' office with me. They were universally bad news. "SAT 
Scores Plummet to All-Time Low." "Many Freshmen Lack Basic Study Skills for 
College." "U.S. Education Doesn't Make the Grade." "America's Toughest 
Assignment: Solving the Education Crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Evans shook his head. "I know my perspective is limited," he said, "but some of 
this rhetoric is pretty excessive. Crisis. Plummet. Come on. This kind of talk 
is political. The educational reform bandwagon is rolling, and politicians are 
all climbing aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we're hearing so much these days about such reforms as schools 
competing for students and the use of parents as classroom teachers. Public 
education ranks right up there with popular music, dressing styles and TV 
stardom in terms of its susceptibility to faddism. These quick fixes are just 
ways for politicians to avoid infusing the system with enough money to make it 
work properly." 
</P>
<P>
Whether you agree or not, this kind of straight talk is highly refreshing -- 
and it is why I turned to Evans in looking for an Orange County professional 
educator to respond, as the new school year starts, to the growing shrillness 
of the critics of public education. 
</P>
<P>
I got a strong taste of this directness last year when Evans sent me a copy of 
an open letter he had written in the aftermath of the attacks by Christian 
fundamentalist groups, led by the Rev. Louis Sheldon, on the curriculum of 
Corona del Mar High School psychology teacher Mike Marino. Those attacks 
resulted in the forced removal of certain instructional units and materials 
from courses in psychology and family life. That incident was cited in a recent 
study by a liberal Washington organization called People for the American Way 
that named three right-wing groups -- two of them based in Orange County -- as 
leading a growing effort to censor course content in public schools. I asked 
Evans if the heat from these groups had intensified since they scored some 
points in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District last year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Evans: "Maybe some good came of it because it has been relatively quiet 
here ever since. I suppose there's some perverse value to us that Lou Sheldon 
has been busy acquiring a national reputation so there has been no focus on our 
district since last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, efforts at the local level are to get something out of the 
curriculum. They've been concentrating lately at the state and national levels 
where the effort is to get things like prayer and creationism in. 
</P>
<P>
"But one of the results these people achieved would seem to me the opposite of 
what they said they wanted. We have lots of very conservative teachers who in 
the past would talk about reproduction in appropriate classes in a general way 
and move on. Now, because of the new law lobbied through by these 
fundamentalist groups, our teachers either have to avoid this subject 
altogether or deal with it in the 10 steps required by law -- which forces 
teachers to go into a lot more detail than they otherwise would have." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is offered up matter-of-factly and without rancor. Evans is a tall, 
lanky, graying, composed, feet-on-the-table type who neither dodges questions 
nor makes speeches. But when he is annoyed, you know it. And he is plenty 
annoyed about what he considered a lot of widespread misconceptions about 
public education. Here's what he had to say about some of the more pervasive 
ones: 
</P>
<P>
The virtues of free marketplace competition that would offer a choice of 
schools would improve education. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach has been extolled by the President of the United States and 
various corporate gurus, but Evans said it is a case of apples and oranges. "In 
the business world," he said, "the relationship between competition and quality 
is a function of profit. Competition may sometimes allow the consumer to save 
money, but the product or service may still remain shoddy. When you truly want 
a high quality product, you must pay for it -- and we're not in the fast-food 
business in education." 
</P>
<P>
We need to apply better business precepts to our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Evans: "It's a supreme irony that some of the most strident criticism of 
public education comes from corporate America, which offers up such current 
role models as Lincoln Savings and Eastern Airlines. But we would be happy for 
a Chrysler-type bailout that would dump that kind of money on our schools. Try 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Given the chance, parents would make wise choices between schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What evidence," Evans asked, "exists to support this politically attractive 
myth? Certainly most parents will be highly motivated to make a wise choice of 
schools. But isn't it more reasonable to assume that marketing, packaging and 
advertising will dictate school choice? Unfortunately, good intentions are no 
guarantee of good decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Lay groups protect us from our professional educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans thinks this shibboleth has been stood on its head. "Why," he asked, "has 
no one examined the part played by lay decision-makers in helping create the 
problems public education deals with today? It may be heretical to suggest that 
lay legislators and school board members are not the best sources for 
educational decision-making or that neighborhood council members would do well 
to concentrate on their own children, but perhaps we have reached a point in 
time when heresy is what is needed." 
</P>
<P>
The quality of teachers is falling off drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this is an attractive area in which to live," Evans said, "we've got 
outstanding people coming into the teaching profession here. Dynamite people. 
Enthusiastic, eloquent, articulate people. I don't know that that scenario 
plays out in urban schools, but it is happening here. But because of the 
teachers' lack of income and status -- somewhere below firemen -- there still 
has to be some feeling of altruism to go into this field." 
</P>
<P>
Parents are abrogating their educational responsibilities to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any great changes in the level of parental desire to help their 
children to the best education possible," Evans said. "It's the circumstances 
of their lifestyles that have changed. It's especially tough in single-parent 
families. It's easy for critics to say that parents should give more time to 
their kids, but a lot of them are at the survival level. It's also hogwash -- 
at least in my experience -- that some minority groups don't care about their 
kids' education. They do care." 
</P>
<P>
Evans tends to take the long view in assessing the problems of public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"Action and reaction tend to ebb and flow," he said. "In the '60s and '70s, 
when we were infected by the desire to be relevant, our teachers did bring some 
things into the curriculum that were challengeable. When those influences 
started to wane, the pendulum swung the other way and legitimate things were 
attacked. I tell my teachers that if they can achieve the same educational 
objective with less volatile methods, I prefer that. But if this is the only 
way to get it across, then do it -- but be prepared for the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"When public education professionals say things aren't all that bad, we're 
accused of being self-serving. But educational problems must be looked at 
school-by-school and site-by-site. There is very little bridge between the 
problems of inner-city schools and what we deal with here -- and it's important 
that we not paint everybody with the same brush." 
</P>
<P>
It's also important that educators assert their professionalism and get off the 
defensive to press their own views on what needs to be done to jack up public 
education. Evans isn't denying the need for reform. He'd just like to see the 
professionals have a clear shot at designing the reforms -- and enough money to 
carry them through. It's a legitimate point of view that needs to be heard.

* Reagan Redux: San Diego radio talk show host Michael Reagan says his father, 
Ronald Reagan, and stepmother, Nancy, are distraught about the latest broadside 
from daughter Patti Davis -- a magazine article in which she blames the Reagan 
presidency for exacerbating the homeless problem. "If she wasn't writing 
articles and books about her father, she would probably be homeless herself 
because that's how she's making her money," Michael, the adopted son of Reagan 
and Jane Wyman, said.

* Peace Making: Talk-show host Larry King has been invited to a weekend in the 
Poconos with the Pennsylvania beauty queen he denounced as ugly on a TV show. 
The Tamiment Resort sent Mailgrams to King and Marla Wynne, who made the finals 
of the Miss America pageant while King was a judge. The resort's weekend 
includes a "love match of tennis," riding a bicycle built for two and dinner 
with a special dessert called "Beauty and the Beast." King has apologized for 
his remark.

* Book Turn: Cable television mogul Ted Turner's company has released its first 
book, "Portrait of Great Britain and Northern Ireland," a glossy, 190-page 
coffee-table volume depicting the countries' people and landscapes. The next 
Turner book will be "Kisses," celebrating famous kisses of American stars taken 
from film classics.

sailed unopposed through the primary election. The Democrat is seeking a third 
term representing parts of Boston and nearby Cambridge. On Tuesday, Kennedy and 
his wife, Sheila Rauch, filed for a no-fault divorce. The financial and 
settlement papers were sealed by the judge. Kennedy, 37, and his wife, 40, 
separated in February, 1989, and have twin 9-year-old sons. Kennedy is the

STYLE: PICK CLOTHES THAT CONVEY MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND, CONSULTANTS SAY

<P>
In her casual mustard-colored suit, matching beads and belt, Jennifer Melles 
does not look in need of a fashion make over. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she has come to Brea Mall in search of a new style, participating in a 
wardrobe workshop with image consultants Diane Parente and Alyce Parsons, 
authors of "Universal Style -- Dress for Who You Are and What You Want." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be elegant," Melles tells the duo, sitting at a table set up in 
the center of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, let's play," Parente says. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately the two consultants jump up from the table and begin sifting 
through a rack of clothing and accessories they had gathered from stores 
throughout the mall. Off comes Melles' casual jacket for a more classically 
tailored olive blazer with a wide, black belt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to pretend this matches your skirt," Parsons says. 
</P>
<P>
Parente finds a barrette to tack up the loose tendrils of Melles' French twist, 
giving her a smoother hair style. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if we have earrings that could make her less sporty?" Parsons asks. 
She finds the perfect pair on the earlobes of a bystander. Melles' gold-hoop 
earrings are quickly replaced by large button-style ones. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the consultants have transformed Melles' sporty look into a 
streamlined, elegant style. 
</P>
<P>
"I look so different -- it's nice," says Melles, peering into a hand mirror. 
"The earrings are really big. I probably wouldn't have picked them myself. But 
they look very good. I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
Parente and Parsons have developed a fashion philosophy based on the notion 
that clothes convey distinct messages about the wearer. 
</P>
<P>
Put on a loose blouse with a lace collar, and you'll be seen as caring, warm 
and nurturing, goes their theory. Don a double-breasted blazer, and you'll be 
seen as responsible and reliable -- ready to do battle in the board room. 
</P>
<P>
In their new "Universal Style" book, unveiled at the mall, they have outlined 
seven fashion styles -- sporty, feminine, dramatic, traditional, alluring, 
creative and elegant -- that reflect different aspects of one's personality. 
</P>
<P>
"Every style has a message," Parsons says. "You want clothes that say what you 
want them to say." 
</P>
<P>
A woman who dresses in a feminine style, for instance, gives off a 
non-threatening message that makes others feel at ease, according to the 
authors. She favors full and flowing skirts, dresses with detailed collars and 
shoulders and loose-fitting, modest tops. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the look, the experts point out a mall executive wearing a lace 
collar over her pink blouse and pleated navy skirt. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, one who favors the alluring style likes clothes that don't hide or 
conceal the body. 
</P>
<P>
"Make it tight," Parente suggests. "Donna Karan has given the look 
credibility." Karan's leggings and body suits are examples of the alluring 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "it's not a great business look," Parente warns. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons and Parente say clothes should match one's profession and goals as well 
as personality. An interior designer, for instance, should develop a creative 
style that combines clothes in a nonconforming way to demonstrate her artistic 
instincts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to dress very dramatic," Parsons says. The dramatic style, which 
projects a bold and confident image, calls for clothes with exaggerated color 
contrast and asymmetric or architectural designs, such as jackets with wide 
shoulders and over-scaled lapels coupled with narrow skirts. 
</P>
<P>
Both women wore black and white tunic-style knit dresses to the workshop, but 
subtle differences in their dramatic attire gave clues to their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons sported a cream and black-knit tunic dress with pearl button earrings. 
The dress originally had wide, loose sleeves which she had altered for a more 
fitted look. 
</P>
<P>
"The elegant style is a really pared-down, clean look," she says. "You need to 
get rid of extra details." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the sporty style, Parente wore a looser knit dress with a long, 
flowing cardigan that had big pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Every woman has two or three styles she can combine for an individual look, say 
the authors. 
</P>
<P>
"Some women aren't sure what they want their clothes to say about them," 
Parsons says. "Style is determined by how you spend your time, your 
personality, your goals and priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Most err by mixing up too many conflicting styles. They'll wear a sporty suit 
with creative earrings and elegant shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"Or they dress on one note so it's monotonous. The clothing doesn't capture all 
of the woman," Parsons says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most businesswomen dress too safe," Parente adds. "They can keep the suit but 
change their earrings, shoes and top and give their outfit a little more 
spunk." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, who lives in Saratoga, Calif., and Parente, who lives in Marin, 
Calif., met eight years ago through an image consulting association. Together 
they have trained image consultants and their Universal Style concept evolved 
from their work. Their book will be used at community colleges, including 
Saddleback and Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The two have trained more than 100 merchant sales associates at Brea Mall to 
implement their ideas long after they've returned to their Northern California 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
By studying a shopper's style, merchants can pick up valuable clues about what 
types of clothes she might buy and how she shops, Parsons says. 
</P>
<P>
"When a sporty woman comes in, they'll know to give her lots of choices. Sporty 
women want to get in and out of there fast," she says. "A feminine woman will 
be much more ponderous. She might spend a couple of hours in the store. Once 
the merchants know that, they'll leave them alone." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 stores in the mall have adopted the Universal Style program, and 
Parente and Parsons have charted out which of those stores cater to distinct 
styles. At Ann Taylor, for example, the pair found sporty, traditional and 
elegant styles, while at Bebe they found alluring, creative and dramatic looks. 
</P>
<P>
A calendar of events and a Universal Style directory of participating merchants 
can be found at the mall's information booth in Center Court. The mall will 
provide a free personal shopping service through Sept. 30 with Kathryn Hasan, a 
personal shopper who uses the Universal Style concept.

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nurturing the growth of a community orchestra takes not only a lot of support 
from the public it serves but also a bit of imagination. These days, the Garden 
Grove Symphony seems to be enjoying both. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the orchestra brings Won-Sik Lim, conductor for the Korean Broadcast 
Service in Seoul as well as the Inchon City Symphony, to its podium as part of 
an exchange program. In November, the Garden Grove Symphony's conductor, Edward 
Peterson, will travel to Korea to conduct the Inchon City group. 
</P>
<P>
It is the community orchestra's third such exchange with another country, the 
previous two involving conductors from Bulgaria and France. This year, the 
exchange is sponsored by the Hamni Bank, one of the many Korean businesses with 
a large branch in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, when I visited California, I just happened to come and listen to 
the Garden Grove Symphony," remembered Lim, in a telephone conversation from 
his hotel in Orange earlier this week. "After the concert, I discussed with 
Peterson the idea of making the exchange. We both agreed it would benefit both 
orchestras and communities." 
</P>
<P>
The program includes the U.S. premiere of the Fantasy for Orchestra, by Korean 
composer Woo Jong Gap (who will attend the performance), as well as local 
soprano Yang Hae-Jeong singing an aria from Verdi's "Nabucco" and a folk song. 
Also to be performed are Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with soloist Elisa Lee 
Koljonen and Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to find a honcho from Korea, and I think we did," said Yaakov 
Dvir-Djerassi, general manager of the Garden Grove Symphony, about his guest 
conductor. "I mean, you take one look at him, and you know right away that you 
don't want to mess with him." 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we wanted to do something for the Korean population in Garden Grove," 
he added, noting that the city is No. 2 in the United States in terms of the 
number of Korean businesses based there. "This is a good chance to pay homage 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
At 71, Lim has had a long and successful career, though most Americans are 
probably unaware of his activities due to the general paucity of information in 
the West regarding Asian musical accomplishments. A conducting student before 
World War II at the Tokyo Conservatory and a small Russian school in Manchuria, 
Lim came to the United States in the late '40s to study conducting with Dean 
Dixon at Juilliard and Serge Koussevitzky at Tanglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"What's our programming like in Korea? It's just like the New York 
Philharmonic," Lim said with much laughter. Actually, he said, "it's different 
in Korea than it is here in America because there is a lot more activity 
considering the size of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea, 15 different cities have large orchestras, and there are about 100 
different music schools. There are about five different major concert halls in 
Seoul, and they all have concerts every night." 
</P>
<P>
This proliferation of activity since the second World War may come as a 
surprise to some. But Lim points to the high level of support that the Korean 
government gives to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Orchestras are, of course, difficult to keep and maintain," he observed. "But 
in Korea, the cities themselves own and operate the orchestras, so it's not 
necessary to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean we don't have plenty of problems. The musicians argue for a 
raise in salary every year. And the orchestra itself can't touch the money from 
ticket sales because it belongs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"But the situation in America works as long as people support the arts. So I 
hope everyone will support the Garden Grove Symphony, because it is serving a 
very important function." 
</P>
<P>
 Won-Sik Lim conducts the Garden Grove Symphony in music by Mendelssohn, 
Tchaikovsky, Verdi and Korean composer Woo Jong Gap at 8 p.m. in the Don Wash 
Auditorium, 11271 Stanford Ave., Garden Grove. Tickets: $10 to $25. 
Information: (714) 534-1103.

MORNING REPORT: HAMMER HURTS RIVALS

M.C. Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" continues its reign as Billboard 
magazine pop chart champ, with 16 weeks at No. 1. The album has sold more than 
5 million copies, with Hammer's tour helping to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-rock band Queensryche is the big pop chart surprise, zooming up to No. 
10 in just two weeks. Warrant's "Cherry Pie," definitely on its way to the Top 
10, entered the chart at No. 33. Another surprise: Country singer Garth Brooks' 
new one, "No Fences," jumped from No. 52 to No. 32. Nelson, a duo made up of 
the late Ricky Nelson's sons, tops the pop singles chart with "Love and 
Affection." 
</P>
<P>
* George Michael's new album debuted at a lofty No. 22. It's a shoo-in to make 
the Top 5 -- and could take the top spot.

His father died; his girlfriend dumped him. And the up-and-down career of the 
struggling actor was definitely down. 
</P>
<P>
Not good things in Paul T. Murray's past. But, as he prepares his literary 
catharsis for the stage, they may spell good things in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a condensed version of all the things I've gone through in 11 years in 
Hollywood," Murray of Studio City said about his one-man play "Let's Get the 
Hell Atta Here." Directed by Robert Mearns, the show opens Nov. 2 at the Third 
Stage in Burbank. "It's a comedy, but it shows my anger toward the business," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, however, has enjoyed his share of success. He has appeared on TV's 
"Beauty and the Beast" and in several low-budget films. He has high 
expectations for his new play: "There's no question it will be a hit." 
</P>
<P>
As the fall theater season opens in the San Fernando Valley, similar optimism 
abounds. Revivals of popular shows and original material present a broad range 
of stage selections. Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
"Coney Island Arias," by Jake Coffone, is a comedy about a man whose Italian 
machismo runs into conflict with his wife and daughter. It opens Oct. 5 at the

<P>
"Come Blow Your Horn," the Neil Simon work, will be directed by Edgar Weinstock 
from Oct. 19 through Dec. 2 at the Granada Theatre in Granada Hills. It tells 
the story of a son who quits his father's business to move into his own 
apartment. When his younger brother tries to join him, the parents have a fit. 
</P>
<P>
"Veronica's Room," by Ira Levin, a psychological thriller about a young woman 
from the Midwest who finds herself embroiled in a family mystery, runs from 
Oct. 12 through Dec. 30 at the Richard Basehart Playhouse in Woodland Hills.

</P>
<P>
"Love and Kisses" is a comedy about a man's elopement with a childhood 
sweetheart; meanwhile, his sister marries an older, stuffy banker. Directed by 
Jackie Cowgill, it runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 24 at the Glendale Center 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Bein' with Behan," the one-man presentation about the life of Irish playwright 
Brendan Behan, starring Michael L. Kavanagh, will open an eight-week run Oct. 
12 at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys. The play, adapted by Kavanagh from 
Behan's writings, focuses on his struggling writing days in Paris, his 
membership in the Irish Republican Army and his eventual success in New York. 
Directed by Bruce Heighley, it may move to off-Broadway next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"A View From the Bridge," an Arthur Miller play about loyalty and jealousy in 
New York City in 1954, opens Nov. 8 at the Gnu Theatre in North Hollywood. The 
play's lead character exposes some illegal aliens because he is jealous of his 
niece's love for one of them. Jeff Seymour directs. 
</P>
<P>
"Bell, Book and Candle," John van Druten's comedy about a woman who puts a 
spell on her neighbor to make him fall in love with her, runs from Nov. 9 
through Nov. 24 at the Woodland Hills Community Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Philadelphia, Here I Come," by Brian Friel, is a comedy about a young Irish 
boy the night before he leaves for Philadelphia. The play, featuring frequent 
flashbacks to his life, opens Nov. 7 at the Richard Basehart Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Carnival," a revival of the 1961 Broadway musical that won the N.Y. Drama 
Critics award as the best that year, is about a young girl who finds love in a 
French circus. Directed by Dom Salinaro with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill, 
it opens Nov. 23 at the Group Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Postcards" is a musical about three lifelong friends who, after many 
years, get reacquainted at a restaurant and give their lives new perspective. 
It runs from Oct. 25 through Dec. 16 at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks. 
Craig Carnelia did the music and lyrics; Monique Reymond directs. 
</P>
<P>
"Crimes of the Heart," the Beth Henley play about three sisters brought 
together when the youngest attempts to murder her husband, runs Sept. 21

<P>
ART: AREA GALLERIES PLAN A VARIETY OF THEMED GROUP EXHIBITIONS AND SOLO SHOWS 
AND TRY TO OVERCOME WESTSIDE COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
If art activity in the San Fernando Valley hasn't exactly kept pace with the 
continuing Westside explosion, local galleries at least have maintained a 
steady presence with widespread exhibitions displaying a diversity of interests 
and medias. And this fall is no different with a collection of themed group art 
exhibitions and solo shows in area galleries. 
</P>
<P>
But spreading fine art through the Valley has remained a struggle in several 
ways, with gallery closings outpacing openings even on busy Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started talking about operating a gallery in the Valley, a lot of 
people said it was a cultural wasteland," said Scott Canty, art curator for the 
municipal satellite galleries, which includes the Artspace Gallery in Woodland 
Hills. "And I told them to picture me as water to the wasteland, so that the 
culture can grow. But I'm finding that it takes more than two years. It takes a 
longer time to develop a relationship with the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a prejudice," Canty added. "Santa Monica and the West L.A. area 
is a very enriched area with a lot of people in higher-income brackets. If I 
was a gallery, why should I open up a gallery in Encino or Woodland Hills, when 
there is already a base in the Westside?" 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Artspace continues with its 2-year-old tradition of presenting 
emerging artists with "Elements." The show, which opened last week, includes 
work by Los Angeles-area painters Marilyn Duzy, Pamela Holmes and Jean Togood, 
colored pencil drawings by Dara Mark, photographic works by Sant Subagh K. 
Khalsa and rock and wood sculpture by Karlin Wong. 
</P>
<P>
All the works in the show incorporate images of nature. Duzy's large canvases 
depict nature's scope and power with raging fires, a storm-swept ocean and 
grain-covered fields, while Khalsa's photographic works offer desolate areas 
invaded by technology. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be in a show where the work really isn't competing on any sort of 
philosophical basis," said Mark, whose own drawings of California's subtle 
seasonal changes were made over the course of a year by returning to the same 
outdoor vantage point. "It feels that everybody is in agreement that it's 
important to look at the environment, to relate to it." 
</P>
<P>
After "Elements" closes Oct. 6, Artspace will present a group exhibit of 
spiritual work called "Of the Spirit," from Oct. 22 to Dec. 1. Described by 
Canty as "art that transcends into the realm of angels and truth," the 
exhibition will include painters Dan Callis and Michael Schrauzer, sculptor 
Roger Feldman and muralist Kent Twitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Artspace is located at 21800 Oxnard St., in Woodland Hills. It is open noon to 
5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays. For more information, call (818) 716-2786. 
</P>
<P>
Diverse perspectives on photographic portraiture are presented in "The Real and 
Unreal" at Burbank's Photo Art Gallery through Oct. 31. The exhibition, 
spotlighting the work of artists Ken Miller, Gordon Mark and the solo-named A. 
Frasheski and Jeff, offer wildly divergent directions of photography. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was curating, I was looking at the literalist and expressionist in 
portraiture," said gallery director Eileen Webb. "Some of it is very abstract." 
</P>
<P>
She compared the work of Miller, and its stark documentation of the 
deterioration of San Francisco's underclass, with the photographs of Diane 
Arbus. By contrast, Jeff, whose work is displayed at the New York Museum of 
Modern Art, is often clouded under layers of hand-coloring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost difficult to recognize its original photographic content," she 
said. "There are little elements that come through. But it is so vigorously 
colored that there is a tension between the two." 
</P>
<P>
The Photo Art Gallery, located at 150 S. San Fernando Road, is open 9 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 10 
a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays, and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. 
Sundays. For additional information, call (818) 846-0673. 
</P>
<P>
Another themed exhibit is on view through Nov. 18 at the Finegood Art Gallery, 
at the Bernard Milken Jewish Community campus in West Hills. Titled 
"Spirituality: Visions + Viewpoints," the collection of paintings interpret 
spirituality in connection with the current Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashana and 
Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
The final collection of paintings by Yona Brand, Rachelle Mark and Adrianne 
Prober were chosen along the same standards as other, non-religious exhibitions 
at the gallery, said Marlene Streit, co-chairwoman of the event, and who is 
also guiding a group show of 25, mostly local artists, at the Toluca Lake 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent was to bring out this time of spirituality, reflection and 
meditation. Each of the artists has their own vision of what spirituality is," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Finegood Art Gallery, located at the Bernard Milken Jewish Community 
Campus, 22622 Vanowen St., is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 
1 to 5 p.m. Sundays. For more information, call (818) 716-1100. 
</P>
<P>
At the Installations One Gallery in Encino, a 10-year retrospective of original 
works by Los Angeles Times editorial illustrator Richard Milholland will be the 
subject of his first local solo exhibition since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The art world considers this simply illustration," said Steven Lee Stinnett, 
the show's director-curator. "But they are really reacting to the idea. They 
haven't seen the work." 
</P>
<P>
Stinnett said that out of a collection of 300 illustrations, he expected to be 
showing at least 60 on the gallery's walls until the show's conclusion Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The work is a lyrical, sometimes blunt collection of images of faces and hands, 
critical portraits of such world figures as Idi Amin, that Stinnett compared to 
the work of the noted Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always had a sort of surrealistic bent to his work. It's an unusual 
blend of traditional rendering and surrealism. The work tends to be a little on 
the dark side." 
</P>
<P>
"The Color and Pattern Show," a group exhibition of abstract art by 12 local 
painters, follows the Milholland show at the gallery Oct. 18, continuing 
through Nov. 10. Gallery hours at the Installations One Gallery, located at 
15821 Ventura Blvd., in the Encino Terrace Center, are currently 10 a.m. to 8 
p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays. For more information, 
call (818) 789-9706. 
</P>
<P>
Further east along the boulevard, the Tower Gallery will spotlight artist 
Samantha October, who specializes in idealized oil portraits of pop music 
figures. For a few days beginning Oct. 25, the mixture of 25 black and white 
and colorful images will replace the variety of limited-edition prints that 
hang above sculptures in the gallery's front space. 
</P>
<P>
While the Sherman Oaks gallery devotes most of its space to prints by such 
nationally distributed artists as Erte and Michael Parkes, Tower has often 
presented work with a pop music slant. Graphic prints and paintings by crooner 
Tony Bennett and rockers John Lennon and Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood have 
been the subject of earlier events at the gallery, which is an offshoot of the 
large Tower Records chain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a type of link to people's earlier years, when they were young adults," 
said gallery director Barry Smith. "Now these individuals are 30, 35 or 40 
years old, and professionals. And this is something they can identify with." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 15, the Tower Gallery will host a reception and book signing for 
veteran animator Chuck Jones, while offering original and limited-edition cels 
from his work with Warner Bros. and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Smith added that he is also attempting to steer the gallery's direction more 
toward original, local art. Among the earliest beneficiaries is Irish-born 
artist Amanda Watt, whose bright, energetic still-lifes spill excitedly off the 
canvas and onto their surrounding frames. 
</P>
<P>
But in the three years of the Tower Gallery's existence, Smith said, he's 
watched local galleries struggle to find an audience and survive. In the last 
year, he said, two Ventura Boulevard galleries, L.A. Art and Gallery Nicole, 
went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a shame," Smith said. "I would welcome other galleries in the 
vicinity. It would be good for the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
The Tower Gallery, at 14523 Ventura Blvd., is open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays, 
11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. Sundays. For more information, 
call (818) 995-4278.

FRESHMAN TO START AT SAFETY AGAINST BYU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Safety Chris Johnson, a freshman redshirt from Crawford High, will get a chance 
to learn what the phrase "baptism of fire" means Saturday afternoon. Aztec 
Coach Al Luginbill announced Thursday that Johnson will start his first 
collegiate game against Heisman Trophy candidate Ty Detmer of BYU. After three 
games, Detmer is throwing for an average of 413.7 yards and three touchdowns a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson beat out senior David Cooper for the starting spot. "Chris has done 
more things correctly than David has," Luginbill said. "We feel that Chris is 
much better (in the open field) than Morey (Paul) or David." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if facing the rocket arm of Detmer is too much to ask of a freshman, 
Luginbill said: "He's at a spot where he's not asked to do a hell of a lot. If 
he stays focused, he'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said more than anything he likes the athletic ability of Johnson, a 
6-foot, 190 pounder. "He was a quarterback in high school ,and he also played 
point guard on the basketball team and averaged 20 points a game. He just has 
some very good instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he was generally pleased with his team's practice habits this 
week. "We spent the week on San Diego State. If this team's mind is on CBS or 
playing in Provo, we're in trouble." . . . Running back Tommy Booker, who is 
slowed by an ankle injury, will make the trip but is not expected to play 
unless the other three Aztec running backs go down. . . . Freshman linebacker 
Jamal Duff will also make the trip, but is definitely out with a deep thigh 
bruise. . . . Sophomore safety Zac Stokes is healthy after coming back from an 
injured shoulder, but Luginbill said he did not get enough work in practice 
this week and will not play. DAVE MCKIBBEN

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;

<P>
GRANADA HILLS BACK NOT QUITE FIT FOR RUSHING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While playing last season on the junior varsity basketball team at Granada 
Hills High, Brett Washington stood out from the rest of the team. It seems the 
school was unable to locate a pair of shorts large enough to fit Washington, 
now a 6-foot, 235-pound senior. 
</P>
<P>
So . . . Washington wore walking shorts. 
</P>
<P>
He has now experienced the other end of the sartorial spectrum. In Granada 
Hills' 26-10 victory over Lynwood last week, Washington said his baggy uniform 
pants slowed him on a breakaway run of 89 yards. 
</P>
<P>
His sprint, which started at the Highlander one-yard line and broke open a 
19-10 game, ended prematurely when he was dragged down at the Lynwood 10. 
</P>
<P>
"He said his knee pads were sliding down to his ankles," Granada Hills co-Coach 
Tom Harp said, only half-kidding. "He said he wasn't getting the flexibility he 
needed at the knees." 
</P>
<P>
So far and yet so close. The 89-yard jaunt tied a school record for longest run 
from the line of scrimmage, set by Kurt Schumacher against Bell in 1974. And if 
anybody is wondering who wears the pants at Granada Hills, well, don't expect 
Washington to experience a similar problem in Saturday's showdown with Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"If (pants) are the difference between a 90-yard run and a 100-yarder," Harp 
said, "then we'll find him what he wants."

Read it and weep: Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer likes to stay on top of the local 
prep scene, reading as much as he can about the best teams and players in the 
Southland. His desk and office walls, for instance, are cluttered with yellowed 
photographs and news clippings. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become increasingly difficult for Schaeffer to find anything dealing 
with his own team, which this season was moved from the 3-A Division Valley 
Pac-8 Conference to the 4-A Northwest Valley Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer said that upon inspecting a recent City Section overview in Cal-Hi 
Sports, not a word was written about the Regents, who might have difficulty at 
the 4-A level. 
</P>
<P>
"There was something in there about every other team in the conference," he 
said. "But nothing about us. Not a word. That hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Starr brights: San Fernando assistant Troy Starr refers to the group as the 
"Super Sophs" and says they will provide a foundation that will form the core 
of the team for two more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great group of kids," said Starr, San Fernando's defensive coordinator. 
"And there isn't a (troublemaker) in the whole group. These guys will be around 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
As many as five 10th-graders were on the field defensively in San Fernando's 
23-0 defeat of Fremont last week. Leading the way was Amon Flanagan, a 5-10, 
175-pound sophomore who played at outside linebacker and recorded two sacks of 
All-City quarterback Quincy Guy. Flanagan had six tackles overall. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomores Johnnie Brown, Shannon Gallien, Anthony Murray and Mike Anderson 
also played defensively, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Kennedy Coach Bob Francola, on linebacker Bobby Rodgers' 82-yard 
wrong-way interception return that resulted in a safety and Narbonne's only 
points in a 36-2 Kennedy victory: "It didn't really bother me until I watched 
the film and saw there were three of our guys out front blocking for him." 
</P>
<P>
No sophomore jinx: Margarito Casillas of Hoover prefers racing with the big 
boys. The Tornado sophomore pleaded with cross-country Coach Greg Switzer to 
run in the senior race at the Woodbridge Invitational on Saturday in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to run in the sophomore race but he insisted he run in the senior 
race," Switzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Casillas got his wish -- and made his mark. He toured the three-mile circuit at 
Woodbridge High in 15:43 -- a personal best -- and placed 11th out of 126 
finishers. Eddie Salinas of Santa Ana Saddleback won in 15:15. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very aware of what it takes to be successful," said Switzer, adding that 
a freshman season with 1990 Hoover graduates Eliazar Herrera (UCLA) and 
Creighton Harris (Wisconsin) inspired Casillas to continue running. 
</P>
<P>
Now he might be a favorite for the Pacific League title. As a freshman he timed 
17:08 at Mt. San Antonio College, the venue of the Southern Section 
championships, and 9:51 for 3,200 meters in track. 
</P>
<P>
Outside shooter: More than two years ago as an eighth-grader, David Ulloa was 
heavily recruited by Switzer, but Ulloa opted to play basketball at the school 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"He avoided me like the plague," Switzer said. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, though, Ulloa, a junior and a starting guard for the Tornadoes, 
"chose to broaden his athletic background," Switzer said. "He just showed up 
and said he wanted to run cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
In his first race, the Woodbridge Invitational, Switzer instructed his newest 
protege: "I told him to go out there and relax and finish. You're going to 
experience a whole different world of pain from basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Ulloa, however, took exception to the advice. 
</P>
<P>
"He said to me, 'You don't think I can do this?' " Switzer recalled. "He 
pointed his finger at me and told me, 'I'm going to prove you wrong. I'm going 
to win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ulloa timed 16:00 but finished fourth in the junior race. Terrel Reyes of 
Lakewood won in 15:09. 
</P>
<P>
Underestimated dept.: Westlake cross-country runner Jeannie Rothman set a 
modest preseason goal for herself: crack the 18-minute barrier on a three-mile 
course. 
</P>
<P>
In the Woodbridge Invitational on Saturday, Rothman, a senior, made 18 minutes 
look like her warmup pace as she shattered her own expectations, running 17:23 
to finish second to Agoura's Deena Drossin (17:04). 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country shuffle: Casey Jones, who coached Quartz Hill to a third-place 
finish in the Golden League last year, hopes the addition of two transfers will 
help the Rebels contend with two-time defending champion Canyon for the league 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bedortha, a sophomore from league-rival Palmdale, finished seventh in the 
league finals last year as a freshman and timed 15:56 for three miles in the 
summer. Senior Clark Goodrich, from Camarillo, was the No. 8 runner for the 
1989 state Division I champion Scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to fit right into our scoring five," said Jones, noting that the 
Rebels' Sept. 29 meeting with Canyon, Palmdale and Saugus at College of the 
Canyons could determine the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Reviving the spirit: Paraclete, which won only two football games last season 
and was 0-5 in Desert-Inyo (Large) League play, has outscored its opponents in 
two games, 52-0. 
</P>
<P>
"(The program) just needed somebody to come in and bring it together," said 
first-year Coach Jim Nottoli, an All-Southern Section wide receiver at 
Paraclete in 1981 who was hired a month before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
"It has sort of lost the school spirit over the past years. We're trying to get 
the student body back and involved. Last week was probably the biggest student 
turnout we've had at a home game since when I was player." 
</P>
<P>
Still struggling: Antelope Valley won the Southern Section Coastal Conference 
championship in 1988 and had made nine consecutive playoff appearances in the 
1980s until last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the Antelopes have won only three of their past 12 games, including an 0-2 
start this season. "The bottom fell out athletic-wise when our (1988) senior 
class graduated," Coach Brent Newcomb said. "We're counting on some younger 
players. Our whole defense is underclassmen." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of three starters to injuries also has hurt the Antelopes. Lineman Dan 
Dinsmore and sophomore fullback Ryan Braddick are sidelined with knee injuries 
and junior quarterback Mike Fossati has a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
A tough preseason schedule makes Newcomb's job even tougher. In the next three 
weeks the Antelopes will face Division I powers Redlands and Loyola and 
Division II power El Toro. All three are ranked in the top 10 in their 
respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Dedication: Westlake's defensive unit has dedicated the season to Dave Weisman, 
a starting linebacker in 1989 who is sitting out this season because of a back 
injury sustained in an automobile accident over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"He had worked so hard (last season), we felt we owed it to him," linebacker 
Vince Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake players have scribbled Weisman's number (51) on pads, and receiver 
Erik Holcomb wears Weisman's practice jersey during workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm honored," Weisman said. "It's hard to accept not being able to play. I did 
my best and it's hard to take."

HOLLYWOOD SIGN INTO OIL WAR

<P>
In a stealthy, early morning protest over the deployment of U.S. troops to 
Saudi Arabia, a group of artists today altered the landmark HOLLYWOOD sign to 
read "OIL WAR." 
</P>
<P>
"We did it to bring attention to the potential war situation in the Middle 
East," said a spokesman for Artists for Social Responsibility who would 
identify himself only as "Danny." 
</P>
<P>
He said 10 group members took about three hours to alter the sign, using 
harnesses to climb the letters. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police pulled down the sheeting that had been draped over the 
50-foot letters before 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We seriously believe we should be spending money on alternate energy sources, 
becoming more energy self-sufficient rather than going to war so we can have 
cheap oil that does nothing but pollute the environment," he said.

KEATING'S BAIL STILL $5 MILLION; OTHER DEFENDANTS GET REDUCTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge today rejected appeals to reduce Charles H. Keating 
Jr.'s $5-million bail and sent him back to county jail to await arraignment on 
a 42-count state grand jury indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Gary Klausner reduced the $1-million bail set for each of three 
co-defendants but rejected arguments that Keating was not a flight risk and 
that it hadn't been shown the alleged crimes were serious. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a picture painted here . . . of a person who has creditors 
knocking at the door," the judge said at the end of a bail-reduction hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Keating is the central figure in the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, 
which was owned by Keating's holding company, American Continental Corp. of 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also noted the many other legal actions against Keating, calling them 
"significant reasons not to stick around."

<P>
A cache of weapons -- including guns, grenades and an anti-tank rocket launcher 
-- was seized at a boarded up farmhouse in Lancaster and two men were arrested 
after sheriff's deputies followed up on a tip from an informant, authorities 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the farmhouse in a secluded area of the 3500 block of 
East Avenue J-8 may have been intended to be used as a drug lab, but it was 
unknown why such a large stockpile of weapons was kept there, Deputy Mary 
Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sundahl and Edward Coleman, both 40-year-old Lancaster residents, were 
arrested on suspicion of possession of explosive devices and were being held in 
lieu of $70,000 bail each at the sheriff's Antelope Valley station.

An Oxnard man was arrested at the Burbank Airport after security officers 
discovered he was attempting to carry two guns, a knife and a small amount of 
drugs onto a commercial flight to Oakland, Burbank police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Schwab, 43, was arrested at 6 p.m. Thursday at the U.S. Air gate after 
airport security officers spotted a knife in his briefcase as it went through 
an X-ray screening machine, Burbank Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab was then detained and the briefcase was opened. Officers found two 
handguns, one of which was dismantled, ammunition for the guns, the knife and 
plastic bags containing small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession and was taken to Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center because he complained of chest pains during 
the arrest, Goldberg said. According to a police report on the incident, Schwab 
told police he was under medication for an unspecified illness and had 
forgotten he had the weapons in the briefcase.

Defense consultant William M. Galvin was sentenced to 32 months in prison today 
for bribing two senior Pentagon officials to influence the awarding of 
lucrative military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin, 59, a major figure in the defense procurement scandal, was also fined 
$10,000 by U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va., on his 
guilty plea to conspiracy, bribery and tax evasion. 
</P>

With another 32-month prison term given to a former Unisys Corp. executive, 
Galvin's sentence was the longest imposed in the long-running investigation of

EXXON KNEW HAZELWOOD WAS UNFIT, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
OIL SPILL: DETAILED COURT DOCUMENTS ALLEGE THE COMPANY WAS AWARE THE VALDEZ HAD 
CREW PROBLEMS, BUT DID NOTHING.

New court documents allege that fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood 
"regularly hosted drinking parties" on Exxon tankers before the disastrous 
Alaska oil spill and that Exxon had evidence showing that the skipper and 
helmsman were unfit for duty when the tanker smashed into Bligh Reef last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department filed 300 pages of documents in its criminal case 
against Exxon just as U.S. District Court closed late Thursday, and prosecutors 
in the environmental crimes section later released the 2-inch stack of papers 
filed to substantiate the criminal charges against the oil giant. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are seeking dismissal of a five-count indictment charging the 
Exxon Corp. and its subsidiary, Exxon Shipping Co., with violating the Clean 
Water Act, the Refuse Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Ports and 
Waterways Safety Act and the Dangerous Cargo Act by spilling 11 million gallons 
of oil, killing tens of thousands of wild animals in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers provided the most detail yet, alleging that Exxon 
knew it had serious crew problems but did nothing to rectify them and guarantee 
the safe shipment of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said that in 1985, Exxon became aware that Hazelwood had 
been routinely commanding tankers in a drunken state since 1982, and that four 
years before the spill Hazelwood was determined suffering from episodic alcohol 
abuse and dysthymia, a mental disorder characterized by depression, mood 
disturbances, poor concentration, difficulty in making decisions and impaired 
job functioning. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen months before the spill, according to court documents, the Exxon legal 
department became aware "of allegations that Hazelwood had regularly hosted 
drinking parties aboard ships; that Hazelwood threw empty Jack Daniels whiskey 
bottles overboard; that it was a bad joke in the fleet that it's Capt. 
Hazelwood and his chief mate Jack Daniels that run the ship; and that on one 
occasion, while leaving Valdez, he went below to his room for a drink and left 
the third mate to navigate the ship out." 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez crashed into Bligh Reef after Hazelwood, who admitted spending 
at least several hours in Valdez bars, sailed the loaded tanker out of Valdez 
on a detour around icebergs and turned command over to an unlicensed third mate 
and then retired to his cabin.

Palestinian refugees in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip stoned an Israeli 
soldier unconscious and set his car on fire, burning him to death, the army 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier had injured two Arab youths in a collision inside the camp 
Thursday, sparking a riot. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities immediately declared the Gaza Strip a closed military zone 
for two days. The army clamped a curfew on the camp and sent troops in to carry 
out house-to-house searches for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers ordered all camp residents onto the streets for identity checks. 
</P>
<P>
The reservist, who was not immediately identified, was killed about noon 
Thursday as Israel celebrated the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, one of 
Judaism's holiest days. 
</P>
<P>
Previous killings of Israelis have ignited fierce anti-Arab riots in Israeli 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The army said the reservist drove a civilian car with Israeli license plates 
into Bureij refugee camp by mistake. As he tried to leave the camp, he collided 
with a cart driven by two Arab youths, injuring them, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of camp residents gathered around the car and pelted the soldier with 
stones, knocking him unconscious. Masked Palestinians set the car on fire and 
burned the man to death, witnesses in the camp said. 
</P>
<P>
Army radio said the soldier was armed with an M-16 rifle but apparently did not 
use it. Troops who discovered the gutted car found large stones inside.

A judge today sentenced religious cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren to death for 
killing a five-member family belonging to his cult. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Charles Grieshammer pleaded Thursday for Common Pleas Judge 
Martin Parks to spare Lundgren's life, saying the Independence, Mo., native 
believed he was following God's will when he killed the Avery family, which 
included children ages 15, 13 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, 40, a one-time lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter Day Saints, was convicted Aug. 29 of aggravated murder for the 1989 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
Grieshammer said the Reorganized Church, which Lundgren broke away from to 
start his cult, is based on the belief that the second coming of Christ is 
near, and he said there is a belief there will be a prophet to lead the church. 
</P>
<P>
"You ended up with a man who felt he was the final prophet," Grieshammer said. 
"Jeffrey Lundgren and his followers went over the edge. Jeffrey Lundgren lost 
touch with reality. There is no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
Grieshammer said he was not trying to say Lundgren was innocent by reason of 
insanity.

"The penalty we are asking for is a horrible penalty," Grieshammer said. "To 
send Jeffrey Lundgren to prison for the rest of his life, to reside in an 
8-by-10-foot cell, that is a horrible punishment. It is the second most 
horrible punishment we have but it is what Jeffrey Lundgren deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Lake County Prosecutor Stephen LaTourette said Lundgren killed the Avery family 
because Dennis Avery, the father, was lazy and his children were unruly. 
</P>
<P>
"Believing you are a prophet of God or even being a prophet of God is no excuse 
for murder," LaTourette said. 
</P>
<P>
The cult disbanded in December. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence has shown that Jeffrey Lundgren didn't believe he was doing God's 
will but rather he was doing his own will," LaTourette said. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing a possible death penalty is Jeffrey Lundgren's 19-year-old son, 
Damon Lundgren.

5 S.C. LEGISLATORS, LOBBYIST CHARGED IN BRIBERY SCANDAL

Five more representatives and a lobbyist were charged today in South Carolina's 
growing bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Thomas Limehouse and Democrats Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding, B. J. 
Gordon and Donna A. Moss were named in a federal indictment growing from the 
FBI sting into the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Limehouse was charged in a three-count indictment of two violations of the 
Hobbs Act, the federal anti-bribery law, for allegedly accepting $2,000, 
conspiracy to accept cash and an additional obstruction of justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
Fant, Blanding and Gordon were charged together in one count of conspiracy to 
violate the Hobbs Act. Fant was also charged with accepting two bribes of 
$1,300; Blanding was charged with accepting two bribes of $1,300; and Gordon 
was charged with accepting one bribe for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Moss was charged with possession of cocaine during the 1989 Legislative 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged was lobbyist James Madison Brown V, on one count of possession of 
marijuana in September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments have come as the result of an FBI sting, nicknamed "Operation 
Lost Trust," which probed vote-buying in the General Assembly. Of five other 
legislators charged last month, three have pleaded guilty and another is 
expected to plead guilty next week. 
</P>
<P>
Several black legislators and activists have suggested the investigation is 
racially biased, if not racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five legislators charged today -- Fant, Blanding and Gordon -- are 
black, as is one of the five charged last month, Luther Taylor. In all, there 
are 19 blacks in South Carolina's House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Bart Daniel and other prosecutors have repeatedly insisted the 
investigation had no racial bias or motivation, and virtually all the state's 
white political leaders have said they do not see a racial bias.

California dairy farmers are joining the Consumers Union of U.S. Inc. in 
opposition to a 1990 Farm Bill provision that would raise the price of milk 
products produced in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The provision would allow dairy farmers in other states to increase the price 
of milk products from California, which are kept down by lower production costs 
in the state, according to the Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
California farmers would be paid more. But they fear that higher prices will 
reduce demand and make their milk products less competitive nationally, a 
Consumers Union news release said.

Mayor Jacques Chirac ordered emergency measures today to clear away huge piles 
of trash accumulating throughout Paris during a strike by 600 garbage truck 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The strike for higher wages was launched Monday by the Communist-affiliated 
General Confederation of Labor. In many neighborhoods, including some of the 
wealthiest in the city, sidewalks have been made impassable by mounds of 
odorous garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Chirac said private trucks would be hired to collect trash in many 
neighborhoods. Elsewhere, he said, large containers will be positioned where 
residents could deposit their trash.

Oil prices shot above $35 per barrel today for yet another all-time high on the 
futures market, as traders responded to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
statement that his citizens should be ready for war. 
</P>
<P>
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., 
said the Iraqi leader "made it clear he is not going to retreat, and I think 
that has got the market on edge again about the possibility of military 
escalation." 
</P>
<P>
In late morning trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet 
crude sold as high as $35.10 per barrel on November contracts. Crude contracts 
for November delivery opened at $34.05, up 63 cents from Thursday's close, and 
prices remained near that level as of midday. 
</P>
<P>
This morning's rise, amid heavy volume, became the latest in a series of 
records oil has been setting throughout the week. Oil had first risen above $33 
per barrel on Monday and surpassed $34 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Before this week's activity, the high futures price of $32.35 per barrel had 
stood since 1983.

CHIP BECK BEATS NICK FALDO IN GOLF SEMIFINALS

Chip Beck survived Nick Faldo's runaway start and beat the defending champion 
2-and-1 today to reach the semifinals of the World Match Play golf championship 
at Wentworth. 
</P>
<P>
Beck led by as many as five holes at one point after Faldo, the Masters and 
British Open champion from Britain, won the first two of 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open champion Hale Irwin lost to Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, 6-and-4, while 
Welshman Ian Woosnam defeated Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty, 5-and-4. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman of Australia beat countryman Wayne Grady with a birdie on the 
second playoff hole to gain a semifinal berth against McNulty. Beck plays 
Woosnam. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo landed a 1-iron within 8 feet of the flag on the first hole for a birdie, 
then chipped to 6 feet on No. 2 for a par after Beck bogeyed out of a bunker. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hole lead began to fall apart when Beck sank a 16-foot putt at the 
fifth. He then scored par as the usually steady Faldo had bogeys at the seventh 
and ninth holes. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo also had bogeys at the 10th, 12th and 13th holes, and he fell five behind 
when he hit into a bunker at the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
He made up ground at the start of the second 18 when Beck missed a 4-footer at 
the fourth and 3-putted the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
When Faldo birdied the 25th and Beck missed a 2-foot putt, the Englishman had 
cut the American's lead to one. And it was even at the 28th when Beck had a 
penalty drop from a ditch and posted a double-bogey 5. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Faldo appeared ready to recapture the lead, Beck rallied again. He 
holed from 16 feet at the 29th and birdied the next to go two ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo's 24-foot birdie putt at the 31st cut the lead to one, but Beck's 
birdie-4 at the next-to-last hole clinched a semifinal place. 
</P>
<P>
After the match, Faldo said he has withdrawn from England's team for the 
Dunhill Cup golf tournament at St Andrews, Scotland, Oct. 11-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Englishman said he wanted to give his injured left wrist a five-week rest. 
Faldo said he will not play again in Europe this season and his next appearance 
will be in Japan.

COWBOYS REPORTEDLY NEAR DEAL TO TRADE WALSH ;

<P>
A deal that would send Dallas Cowboys backup quarterback Steve Walsh to the New 
Orleans Saints in exchange for a package of draft choices may be close to 
completion, the Dallas Times Herald reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said a league source told them Thursday that New Orleans 
President Jim Finks this week has asked at least five teams about the 
availability of their backup quarterbacks, and that one of those teams is 
Dallas. Another is the Raiders, where former starter Steve Beuerlein is now the 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
Well-traveled John Fourcade is starting for the 0-2 Saints and former starter 
Bobby Hebert is a contract holdout. 
</P>
<P>
Another source said the Cowboys had been in contact with the Saints on 
Thursday, and that the Saints are willing to offer a package of draft picks for 
Walsh, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
A deal for Walsh possibly hinges on New Orleans' ability to trade the 
disgruntled Hebert to the Raiders for a first-round pick, a source said. After 
securing a draft pick for Hebert, the Saints then would package that draft 
choice and several of their own for Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saints want to move Hebert first," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
A back injury, its severity still undetermined, may keep the San Francisco 
49ers' John Taylor out of Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was injured in the closing minutes of Sunday's game against Washington, 
and Coach George Seifert said the receiver definitely won't start against the 
Falcons. UCLA product Mike Sherrard, who has not started a game since December 
1986, will open at Taylor's split-end position. 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants running back-return specialist Dave Meggett returned to 
practice Thursday, not saying much to clear up why he was a no-show Wednesday. 
"I was sick, man," he said. "You already know why I was out." 
</P>
<P>
Team sources insist Meggett staged a one-day strike to protest his 1990 base 
salary of $90,000. He wants to renegotiate the deal to better reflect his Pro 
Bowl season of 1989 and his value to the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
New England Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan may sit out Sunday's game in 
Cincinnati because of a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan did not practice Thursday for the second consecutive day, and Coach Rod 
Rust said his status remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait and see," Rust said. "We might not make a decision until Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
If the Patriots decided to hold Grogan out, former Raiders quarterback Marc 
Wilson would get the start.

<P>
San Antonio Spurs officials said today that guard David Wingate will not be 
back with the team after his indictment on rape charges in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Wingate remains free on a $10,000 bond; a trial is expected in about four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spurs will honor our obligations -- if any -- to David Wingate," team 
owner Red McCombs said in a statement, "but at this time there are no plans for 
David being a part of our team." 
</P>
<P>
McCombs said Wingate is likely to be spending his "primary energies" defending 
himself against the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate David's contributions to the Spurs last season and we have 
sympathy for him and all others connected to the various allegations," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Wingate has been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Forward John (Hot Rod) Williams said he will decide before the weekend is over 
whether he will be playing the 1990-91 season with the Seattle SuperSonics or 
Cleveland Cavaliers -- even if it means playing the 1991-92 season in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next 48 hours, I'll make my decision," Williams said late Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 28, would be the major component of a deal that would send Xavier 
McDaniel and Nate McMillan from the Sonics to the Cavs, while Cleveland would 
send Williams and an undisclosed sum of money to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cavaliers have already told me if I don't accept this deal they're going 
to trade me to Minnesota next year," Williams said. "But if that's what 
happens, that's OK. . . . Nobody is going to tell me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Nuggets point guard Michael Adams has agreed to terms of a 
multimillion-dollar, five-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
Adams had one year remaining on a contract that was to pay him $400,000 this 
season. He would have been an unrestricted free agent at its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are not going as smoothly with Chris Jackson, the Nuggets' top 
draft choice. Jackson is "tired of waiting" for the club to make a deal, his 
agent, Eddie Miller, said.

At the closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles Olympics they raised the South 
Korean flag and invited everyone to reunite in Seoul. To whet your appetite for 
Seoul they brought out a troupe of South Korean acrobats and dancers dressed in 
native costumes. In Seoul they raised the Spanish flag and honored Barcelona by 
introducing a battalion of guitarists and flamenco dancers. 
</P>
<P>
And in Barcelona, to herald the dawning of the Atlanta Games, they can offer 
the world this slice of Atlanta culture -- the first sound foreign tourists are 
likely to hear as they arrive at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, 
the world's largest Skinner box: a disembodied voice, calmly, but in the firm 
tone of a parent, instructing you: "Terminal A. You are now arriving at 
Terminal A. Please stay clear of the doors. Please proceed to the moving 
sidewalk. Please keep to the right so others may pass. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta. Much more than a city. 
</P>
<P>
A hub. 
</P>
<P>
Those of you who have flown into Atlanta know the T-shirt: "Go to Hell -- But 
Be Sure to Connect in Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter how much time you have to connect in the Atlanta airport; you 
can't do it. You can't get to your gate on time. Atlanta's airport is God's way 
of saying, "Take Amtrak." If I had a dollar for all the people who had to sleep 
in a heap on the Atlanta airport floor because they couldn't make their 
connections, I'd bid for the Games myself. Atlanta is probably the only airport 
in the world that sells pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee apparently believes the Athens airport is 
dangerous, and it is. Atlanta's airport has a different sort of terrorism. You 
don't get shot there; you simply grow pale and listless as you wait for your 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
Believe me, this isn't sour grapes because I was a supporter of Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia. It's just that Atlanta never struck me as the kind of exotic site 
the Olympics usually selects. 
</P>
<P>
Athens has the Acropolis and the Parthenon. Most of Atlanta's old buildings 
were burned down in the Civil War, although this week on "Designing Women" they 
were giving tours of the Sugarbaker home. Athens is Plato and Socrates. Atlanta 
is New Coke and Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta is known throughout the world thanks to CNN. In Gabon, for example, the 
star of "Body by Jake" is worshipped as a god. Atlanta looks great on CNN. It 
may come as a surprise to some foreign tourists that the combination of 
temperature and humidity during the Olympics will steam them like a hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
All kidding aside, Atlanta is a fine choice. You don't think being in the prime 
TV time zone of the country that bankrolls the whole Olympic shebang with its 
TV rights bid had any influence, do you? It has wonderful mass transit, and 
lots of good hotel rooms and restaurants, and the sports facilities will be top 
drawer. Jimmy Carter's already hard at work building the chairs for the Georgia 
Dome. (They ought to hold some of the outdoorsy, survivalist events, like 
canoeing, shooting and squealing like a pig, on north Georgia's Chattooga 
River, where they filmed "Deliverance.") 
</P>
<P>
Tourists should know, though, that Atlanta isn't exactly "Titletown USA." 
Loserville is more like it. Its professional teams are laughingstocks. None of 
Atlanta's professional teams, not the Braves, Falcons or Hawks, have ever 
played for the league championship. Through a combined 50 seasons of major 
league baseball and NFL football, the Braves and Falcons have only one playoff 
victory -- a Falcons wild-card fluke in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
You're familiar with the bumper sticker: "Go Falcons! Take the Braves With 
You." The Hawks routinely choke in the NBA playoffs. There used to be a hockey 
team there, the Flames, that never did much. Soon after moving to Calgary they 
won the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta columnist Dave Kindred reports that the Falcons are currently facing 
seven paternity suits, including two against former team President Rankin Smith 
Jr., son of the team owner; the Rankin Smiths are referred to inside the NFL as 
"the Jed Clampetts." Mindful of the team's 11-36 record over the last three 
seasons, a Falcon wife was quoted as saying of the team, "We may be bad, but at 
least we're fertile."

A'S MCGEE KEEPS EYE ON BATTING RACE

Willie McGee admits he peeks. 
</P>
<P>
McGee leads the National League in hitting, but finds himself left out of the 
batting race, on the other side of the statistical fence in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"I look," McGee said. "It's out there everywhere. You can't help but see it. 
I'm a fan too." 
</P>
<P>
McGee was plucked from the NL batting race on Aug. 29 when the St. Louis 
Cardinals traded him to Oakland for outfielder Felix Jose and two 
minor-leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
With enough NL plate appearances to qualify as batting champion, McGee left 
behind Philadelphia's Len Dykstra with an unwavering .335 mark to shoot for. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny is in a tough situation," McGee said. "But Lenny is a tough little 
player, and he's got a lot to look forward to with all he's got going for him. 
I wish him the best of luck. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to remember there's Eddie Murray (of the Dodgers) and a couple of 
other guys. You hate to see this kind of thing happen, but it was out of my 
control." 
</P>
<P>
McGee has watched Dykstra, the NL's leading hitter most of the season, slide to 
second with a .330 average. Meanwhile, McGee is batting .280 in 82 at-bats with 
the A's; his cumulative average is .328, and he leads the majors in hits with 
191. 
</P>
<P>
The switch-hitting outfielder won the NL's Most Valuable Player award and the 
league's batting title in 1985. Winning a second batting title in absentia does 
not sit well with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my choice," McGee said. "Even when I was over there I wasn't 
concerned about the batting race. I don't get caught up with that. I leave that 
to the fans."

FAIRPLEX EVENTS SET STAGE FOR FUTURE

<P>
Two races at Fairplex Park this weekend promise to play important roles in 
determining the shape of two six-figure races set for the following weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's $50,000-added Derby Trial will probably point out contenders for the 
$100,000 Pomona Derby seven days later. 
</P>
<P>
And the winner of Sunday's $50,000-added C. B. Afflerbaugh Stakes will receive 
an automatic invitation to the $150,000 Pomona Invitational on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the richest race of the meeting will be decided Saturday, when 
Fusion Illusion tops 10 2-year-old quarter horses set to meet in the estimated 
$200,000 Pacific Coast Quarter Horse Racing Assn. Breeders Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's crowd at Fairplex Park, and those at the 10 Southern California 
inter-track wagering sites taking the Fairplex races, can also wager on the 
$1-million Super Derby from Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Derby -- which matches Summer Squall, Unbridled and local heroes 
Stalwart Charger and Cee's Tizzy -- will be run between early races Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
TK's Skipper tops the field of seven Saturday night in the $35,000 third leg of 
the American Pacing Classic at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Also on tap Saturday night on the 12-event program is the $25,000 California 
Gold Series Final for pacing colts and geldings. Spicy Shawn Joseph, a narrow 
winner of the third leg of the series last Saturday, figures to be the 
favorite.

MILLIONAIRE TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OF RACEWAY

<P>
Multimillionaire developer Mark Raymond Vogel, who was arrested last week on a 
cocaine charge, plans to relinquish day-to-day fiscal control of Rosecroft 
Raceway, according to the track's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
James Murphy, who also is Rosecroft's president, said he will assume daily 
control of the track's finances. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke after a Thursday meeting between Maryland Racing Commission officials 
and Daniel Sandler, vice president and treasurer of Rosecroft. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel owns Rosecroft, in Oxon Hill, and Delmarva Downs in Ocean City, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, court records show Vogel owes the federal government more than 
$600,000 in income taxes, and that he is enmeshed in a tangle of financial 
difficulties that may threaten the future of his real estate and racing empire. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting came as legislators and racing officials expressed renewed 
concern Vogel might use funds from the race tracks to shore up faltering real 
estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they would like to isolate the race track from Mark's other ventures," 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Vogel has not been actively involved in Rosecroft's operations since he 
bought the track in December, 1987, Murphy said, the move will not disrupt the 
track's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
State records show that the two tracks lost $1.2 million for the year ending 
Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel, 42, a real estate speculator, was arrested in Fairfax County after an 
investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with possession of four grams of cocaine, which is worth about $400, 
Vogel was released on $10,000 bond and will plead not guilty to the felony 
charge, according to his attorney, Plato Cacheris.

Staff members at Sydney's Opera House say they have their very own phantom -- a 
well-dressed old man who haunts a box in one of the cheapest sections of the 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Theater Manager David Hensler said today there have been five sightings of the 
phantom in the past 15 years and many times when doors had been jammed shut and 
chairs mysteriously moved from their places. 
</P>
<P>
Hensler said the phantom of Sydney's Opera House could be the ghost of an old 
tramp known as Paddy, whose ashes were allegedly buried by friends in the 
foundations of the forecourt in the early 1970s.

Millionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley and real estate magnate Donald Trump are 
having a war of words through Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Playboy's March issue, Trump called Helmsley, convicted of 
tax fraud, "a disgrace to humanity" and a "vicious, horrible woman." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley had her say in an interview in the November issue, calling Trump "a 
sick, sick, sick, sick boy" and a liar. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Helmsley said Trump actually paid $78 million, not the $30 million 
he claimed, for the St. Moritz Hotel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The nerve of this S.O.B., the skunk," she said in excerpts of the interview 
released Thursday. "I wouldn't believe Donald Trump if his tongue was 
notarized." 
</P>
<P>
Sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million, Helmsley is free on 
$25 million bail pending her appeal.

RACIST THREAT, VANDALISM MAR SPIKE LEE SHOOT

A white florist who rented space to director Spike Lee for his new movie about 
the relationship between a black man and a white woman has been the target of 
vandalism and a racist threat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are giving special protection to florist James Longo's shop in the 
borough of Brooklyn, Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police spokeswoman, said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News reported in today's editions that vandals smashed the window of 
Longo's van, which was parked in front of the store, on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Sunday, the News said, the three windows of the shop were smashed, and 
the front window of the van, which had been repaired, was broken again. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, an anonymous caller using racial slurs told Longo that the 
vandalism occurred because he rented space to a black. Lee's best-known movie, 
the 1989 release "Do the Right Thing," depicted racial strife in a Brooklyn 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Mohrmann confirmed that Longo had reported "several incidents" of vandalism 
since Sept. 8, and that he reported the phone call on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Special attention is being given to the store and to the daily filming sites," 
she said, adding that the police bias unit is investigating the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Lee has been on location in Brooklyn and Manhattan for his new movie, "Jungle 
Fever." Filming at the Brooklyn store is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The filmmaker, who lives in Brooklyn, told the Daily News: "All I'm trying to 
do is make a movie in the beautiful borough of Brooklyn. I'm going to continue 
to shoot the film."

DAVE BRUBECK STILL HAS ALL THAT JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OWEN MCNALLY, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 19 months after triple-bypass heart surgery, and just a few months shy 
of his 70th birthday, jazz great Dave Brubeck is still thriving on the 
fast-paced tempo of life on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been jumping all over the world -- Turkey, Finland, Italy, Spain, 
Andorra, the Netherlands, England, France, California, Canada," the pianist and 
composer said in a telephone interview from his home in Wilton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can live through what I just lived through, you've got to be in pretty 
good health, surviving all those different time zones, having to sleep in a 
different bed every night and having to eat different food every day. The only 
easy thing about life on theroad is when you finally get to play the concert," 
Brubeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Life on the road has had some pleasant surprises for Brubeck as a father who 
takes great pride in his musical sons. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into my son Danny, a drummer who has his own fusion band called the 
Dolphins, at several festivals in Europe. Purely by accident, my band followed 
his on the same stage at Nice, France, so I actually got a chance to sit in 
with his group, which had an arrangement of 'Blue Rondo a la Turk,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Rondo a la Turk" was one of many big hits by the Brubeck Quartet, one of 
the hottest bands of the 1950s and early '60s, before rock monopolized the pop 
music marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, jazz was more like the acceptable music of America. It was our 
popular music and our classical music. Now it's more our classical music," 
Brubeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz education has played a key role in spreading the word about the music, he 
said. That role is being performed at the university level by two of his sons: 
Matthew, who lectures at Cal State San Jose, and Darius, who teaches at the 
University of Natal in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
This year is filled with many more concerts for Brubeck, including two special 
dates in London. Brubeck, who was born Dec. 6, 1920, in Concord, Calif., will 
celebrate his 70th birthday by performing with the London Symphony Orchestra 
Nov. 27 and 28. He'll be joined by his musical sons, Chris, Matthew, Darius and 
Danny and French violinist Stephane Grappelli. 
</P>
<P>
Both dates are sold out.

Andre Agassi took the sting out of a charged-up Horst Skoff, then toyed with 
him for two sets, giving the United States a 1-1 tie with Austria after the 
first day of their David Cup semifinal today. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Muster had used his power to overcome the finesse of Michael Chang in 
the opening match as Austria took an early lead in the best-of-five weekend 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi won the last three points of a tiebreaker in the first set and captured 
12 of the next 13 games as Skoff ran out of energy. The American needed less 
than two hours to complete his 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-ranked Agassi so dominated Skoff that the Austrian did not win a 
single point on his own serve in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of Skoff's tennis was on emotion that first set and I felt like 
it was just a question of getting through it," Agassi said. "If I had lost the 
first set I think he would have played like that for a little bit longer, but 
I'm not sure how long he would have kept that up." 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Australian took a 2-0 lead over Argentina in Sydney, 
Australia. The semifinal winners will play for the title beginning Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi and Skoff traded sharp passing shots and delicate drop shots in the 
tiebreaker until the eighth point, when Agassi recovered from a slip to take a 
5-3 lead. He won the next point on Skoff's serve, then slammed an ace to finish 
the set. 
</P>
<P>
"Andrew was playing great tennis. I've never played somebody who could put me 
under pressure like that, never ever. There was nothing I could do," Skoff 
said. "If you don't put pressure on Agassi he makes you run like a dog." 
</P>
<P>
With many of the 17,000 fans leaving the Prater soccer stadium in disgust, 
Skoff dropped the last 11 points of the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up my game after the first set and he sloed down a little," Agassi 
said. "I don't know if he got fatigued, but he tried so hard the first set and 
had nothing to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
In the opening match, Chang lost, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, in an intermittent rain. 
</P>
<P>
Muster improved his Davis Cup clay-court record to 23-0 by taking advantage of 
Chang's weak serve. 
</P>
<P>
Muster's victory sent red and white Austrian flags fluttering in the stands and 
brought fans, some with their faces painted red and white, to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a while until I got used to everything," Muster said. "The last 
three sets I was playing some of my best tennis." 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian left-hander, ranked seventh in the world, did not lose his serve 
in the second or third sets and recorded four of his eight service breaks 
against Chang in those two sets. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second and third sets he was able to dictate the points and I was 
having to play on the defensive," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain, which was not hard enough to stop play, did not seem to greatly 
affect either player. 
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, Wally Masur defeated Martin Jaite, 3-6, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-0, 6-2, in 
a three-hour struggle, giving Australia a 2-0 lead. Earlier, Pat Cash swept 
past Alberto Mancini, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 in the opening singles match on the grass 
center court at White City. 
</P>
<P>
Masur was given a pep talk from his teammates during the break after the third 
set. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys told Wally he had to get his feet moving," said Australian captain 
Neale Fraser. "He came out dancing. It was a fantastic effort." 
</P>
<P>
In a world group qualifying match for the 1991 Davis Cup, Henri Leconte and Guy 
Forget gave France a 2-0 lead over Britain at London. Leconte beat Nick Brown, 
6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, and Forget defeated Jeremy Bates 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-1.
