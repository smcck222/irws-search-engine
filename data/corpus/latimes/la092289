NEWSMAKERS: AS WORKING MOTHER, BHUTTO MISSES THE LITTLE THINGS

Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto lauds her double life as working woman 
and mother but admits it's tough when she misses special moments in her baby's 
life because of affairs of state. For instance, there'll be the missed birthday 
party this week for her 1-year-old son, Bilwal Zardari, born eight weeks before 
his mother's triumph last November in Pakistan's first openly contested 
elections in 11 years. "I'm missing my baby very much at the moment," Bhutto 
said. "I have asked one of my relatives to arrange a little birthday party for 
him in Karachi." The boy lives in Karachi with his father, businessman Asif 
Zardari, while Bhutto spends most of her time on the move or in Sind House, a 
sprawling mansion in Islamabad. She visits the two on weekends, making a 
two-hour flight. "I think children have this natural love for a mother, because 
I'm hardly ever with him, but when I see him his face lights up and he wants to 
come to me," Bhutto said. As the world's first Muslim woman elected leader, 
Bhutto sees her life as "a role model not only for Muslim women in Pakistan but 
for women in the entire Muslim world . . . to demonstrate that a woman can 
combine a home and a career."

 -- Former President Gerald R. Ford, whose wife, Betty, received treatment for 
alcohol and drug addiction, believes President Bush's crusade against drugs 
shouldn't ignore alcohol. "He (Bush) focused on cocaine but he did not broaden 
it to include other mind-altering drugs," Ford told about 2,500 people in a 
speech in Norfolk, Va. "Four times more deaths (in 1988) were related to 
alcohol accidents than to drug accidents. The problem is broader than hard 
drugs." He said rehabilitation centers are good, but they don't work miracles. 
"Treatment centers -- you can't just throw them up, establish and have them be 
successful overnight. I know something about that."

 -- Finders aren't necessarily keepers, says famed undersea explorer Jacques 
Yves Cousteau, in explaining why he doesn't regret never having found a 
gold-laden treasure ship like the one recently discovered off the coast of the 
Carolinas. At an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, the 
captain of the research vessel Calypso pointed out that France requires its 
citizens to report any such treasure to the government -- and can then force 
the finder to assist in the salvage effort. Any compensation is left to the 
government's discretion, he said. "So, knowing of those regulations, I would 
really hate to find a treasure ship," he said. Besides, Cousteau added: "I'd 
lose my crew, because they would all want a share." ANN CONNORS

ALBERT L. COLE; 'BUSINESS BRAINS' OF READER'S DIGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert L. Cole, the founding general manager of Reader's Digest and the 
acknowledged "business brains" behind the publishing empire founded by DeWitt 
and Lila Wallace in a Greenwich Village basement in 1911, has died at his home 
in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The executive credited with expanding the largest-selling magazine in the world 
into the fields of books, records and international circulation was 94. He died 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, a year after joining the Digest after a successful career with Popular 
Science Publication Co. and other publishing firms, Cole prevailed upon the 
Wallaces to start a Spanish edition. Ten years later, in 1950, he was credited 
with expanding the burgeoning Digest empire into condensed books, and in 1959 
into recordings. 
</P>
<P>
He was chairman of the Digest's executive committee from 1965 to 1969 and a 
member of the board until 1983.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DENIED SERVICE, POLIO VICTIM SAYS IN SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A polio victim who uses crutches to walk has filed suit against the owners of a 
Boyle Heights restaurant claiming that his civil rights were violated when he 
was allegedly refused a beer because he is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo Pena, 26, also claimed in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that 
security guards at the La Perla, El Gallo and El Terasco restaurant complex 
inside El Mercado de Los Angeles shopping center roughed him up and took away 
his crutches when he refused to pay his $16 bill. 
</P>
<P>
Pena told reporters this week that a waitress advised him Aug. 5 that "it 
wasn't their policy to serve crippled people because we might be on 
medication." He said he became enraged and refused to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro M. Rosado, the shopping center owner, denied that such a policy exists 
and was unaware of any incident involving Pena. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we refuse service is when someone is intoxicated. I am very 
strict about that," Rosado said. "We serve people all the time who are in 
wheelchairs. It's my business to sell beer and food. I want to serve as much as 
I can, and it doesn't matter whether someone is handicapped."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GOVERNOR URGED TO OK HOLOCAUST PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and representatives of Jewish 
organizations urged Gov. George Deukmejian on Thursday to sign a bill that 
would create a state commission to commemorate the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not simply to look back to the past but to educate for the future," 
Hayden said. "It's a negligible investment of money but a very important 
investment for the state government to be involved in this vital work." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, a spokesman for Deukmejian, said the Holocaust bill is "one of 
approximately 1,200 bills that the governor is required to act on by Oct. 2. so 
he has not had an opportunity to review that specific piece of legislation. I 
don't have any indication one way or the other which way he will go with that 
one."

SPEAKING UP FOR ZSA ZSA; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN TESTIFIES SHE THOUGHT SAME OFFICER 'WOULD KILL' HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense in the police officer-slapping trial of Zsa Zsa Gabor presented its 
star witness Thursday, a Virginia woman who tearfully testified that she was 
roughed up by the same Beverly Hills cop Gabor is accused of assaulting. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he would kill me," Melanie Yonkers of Alexandria, Va., said, 
referring to her October, 1988, encounter with Officer Paul Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
Yonkers said she was pulled over by the motorcycle officer after her 2 
1/2-year-old daughter, Lacy, had "slithered" out of her car seat and was 
sticking her head out a back window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Threw Me' 
</P>
<P>
The witness said that, after she refused to sign a citation for failing to 
strap her daughter in the car seat, Kramer "grabbed my arms and threw me 
against the back of the car and handcuffed me." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Yonkers said, her daughter became traumatized and began crying. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time my daughter sees a police officer or hears a siren, she says, 'Is 
that mean man going to take mommy away?' " said Yonkers, who flew to California 
at her own expense "to try to set the record straight about how abusive this 
man is." 
</P>
<P>
Yonkers, the sister-in-law of Hollywood executive Michael Medavoy of Orion 
Pictures, said she refused to sign the citation because she was in the process 
of moving to Virginia and Kramer told her she would be required to stay in 
California to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Yonkers, sobbing throughout her testimony in Beverly Hills Municipal Court, 
described the 6-foot-4 Kramer as "very abrasive, arrogant and smug." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's lawyer, William Graysen, had been heralding Yonkers as his star 
witness, and her testimony was intended to support Gabor's assertion that 
Kramer roughed her up after stopping her for a routine traffic violation June 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a doctor testified that he was thrown to the ground by 
Kramer after he was pulled over for speeding in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pattern Alleged 
</P>
<P>
Graysen has said he would present testimony from several other people who have 
had run-ins with Kramer to illustrate a pattern of "abuse" by the veteran 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who has admitted that she slapped Kramer but only in self-defense, 
completed her third day of testimony Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After advising Judge Charles Rubin that she had a "terrible headache," the 
Hungarian-born glamour queen spent only a few minutes on the witness stand, 
sipping water and taking deep breaths throughout. 
</P>
<P>
She again charged that Kramer called her an "(expletive) whore" during the 
altercation and acknowledged that she responded by using the same expletive, 
because "I learned it from your wonderful Police Department."

WISDOM FOR AUSCHWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intervention of the Vatican in reaffirming the 1987 agreement to withdraw 
the Carmelite Convent from the grounds of the Auschwitz death camp is welcome. 
So, too, is the acceptance of Rome's wishes by the Catholic Primate of Poland, 
Cardinal Jozef Glemp. 
</P>
<P>
Steps have been quickly taken to restore a dialogue between Roman Catholics and 
world Jewish leaders. Those contacts had been largely suspended last February 
when the deadline for moving the convent passed without action by the Polish 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue will not be helped by the anti-Semitic tone of some of Glemp's 
comments and the angry response of Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Cracow to a 
regrettable Jewish demonstration at the convent. But it was notable that 
Glemp's announcement came in a letter to Sir Sigmund Sternberg, chairman of the 
international Council for Christians and Jews, which was written during a 
meeting between Glemp and Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican statement reflects a determination to restore good relations. That 
commitment is reaffirmed both by earlier statements of Pope John Paul II and 
the work of Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, president of the Vatican Commission 
for Religious Relations with Judaism, a distinguished leader in programs 
designed to improve unity among Christians and cooperation among the religions 
of the world. Respectful cooperation is implicit in the plan to move the 
convent to an interfaith center.

L.A. RIVER FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Riverbed Freeway Proposal Receives Qualified Backing," Metro, 
Sept. 9: 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles River is neither an oasis of beauty nor an extended corridor 
connecting our diverse city, but it could be. We have plenty of freeways, but 
precious few rivers. 
</P>
<P>
An optimistic vision of our future includes reduced dependency on personal 
automobile transportation, not further freeway construction. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of our valuable imported water gives the river a year-round flow of 
relatively clean effluent as it cascades from Sierra snow to aqueduct, to lawn 
sprinklers, car washes and gutter runoff. Why let this evaporate in an 
elongated concrete flash pan? Portions of the riverbed should be broken up and 
planted in willows or other flood-tolerant plants. This would create a series 
of ponds which would foster wildlife, and recharge the subterranean water 
table. In addition, this would create a green corridor for people, bicycles and 
surface-routed metro trains.

KEEPING TABS ON AIDS MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislature has provided Gov. George Deukmejian with a rare opportunity to 
keep California in the vanguard of AIDS programs. It has sent him legislation 
that addresses some shortcomings in the system and establishes innovative ways 
of reducing future expenses as the pandemic's impact inevitably increases. 
</P>
<P>
Most important among the many bills is AB 1600 by Assembywoman Jackie Speier 
(D-San Francisco) to address the crucial issue of early intervention. The 
validity of more testing and earlier therapy for those infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, has now been demonstrated by new 
research. This makes the early interventions provided by AB 1600 all the more 
important in extending the lives of infected persons. Unfortunately, the 
Legislature has not provided appropriate funding for the program, but at least 
the framework is there. 
</P>
<P>
Funding is a problem among other bills as well. Bills to make permanent the 
continued subsidy of AZT for lower-income persons, and to extend coverage to 
the uninsured (ABs 887 and 2251), would raise state funding at least to $2.8 
million. But that is far short of what would be required in state matching 
funds to obtain California's share of more than $7 million to be provided in 
federal legislation now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Federal legislation overshadows another area of state bills -- protection 
against discrimination for those infected with HIV. Both AB 65 and AB 1535 have 
been amended to place AIDS in the broader context of protection for those with 
physical disabilities. This meets Deukmejian's earlier objections to 
anti-discrimination measures that singled out AIDS. And it is consistent with 
new federal disability legislation. The governor can now give a clear signal 
against discrimination with his signature on this legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term economies in the control of the pandemic and in the care of the 
HIV-infected population are implicit in a variety of bills to increase support 
for and access to home and community-based projects (ABs 960 and 1726); to 
support case management (AB 2056); to increase funding for congregate living 
facilities while making them eligible for Medi-Cal support (SB 276); to mandate 
AIDS education in grades 7 to 12 for all students except those for whom parents 
request exemption (AB 11), and to fund demonstration projects in four counties, 
including Los Angeles and San Diego, of services such as foster care for 
children exposed to HIV, drugs and alcohol (SB 1173). 
</P>
<P>
These bills now await the governor's signature. He has repeatedly called 
attention to the state's leadership in funding AIDS programs. These bills give 
him an opportunity to assure continued leadership while at the same time 
providing for more effective and less costly long-term responses to the 
disease.

L.A. RIVER FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have long believed that what keeps Los Angeles from universal recognition as 
a great city (like Paris, London, Vienna and Chicago, to name only a few) is 
our lack of a great river flowing through our urban center. Without such a 
river we don't seem fully alive. 
</P>
<P>
But now Assemblyman Katz proposes to turn even our pathetic concrete excuse for 
a river into a freeway. Well, why not? 
</P>
<P>
His additional ideas for flanking the new freeway with greenbelts, trees, 
bikeways and pocket parks sound wonderful. The next order of business, however, 
must be to dig up the Harbor Freeway and turn it into that great river we've 
always deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Let the city planners fill in all the transit lines and new roads to keep the 
traffic moving -- no doubt the river itself will move people and goods more 
rapidly than the freeway ever did. And the postcards of the downtown 
skyscrapers reflected in the river will pay for the project in new tourism.

Sherry Jeffe in her column ("Children Unborn," Opinion, Sept. 3) portrays the 
upcoming elections as a single-issue campaign dominated by abortion. True, 
women and men have responded to the heavy-handed attempts of the New Right to 
curtail freedoms with a backlash of their own. But the pro-choice debate 
reflects only one facet of that backlash. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot hold an anti-choice view without embodying a repressive attitude 
toward freedom generally and women's rights particularly. So a pro-choice vote 
chooses more than a pro-choice candidate and rejects more than back-alley 
abortions. It rejects the chest-pounding attitudes and self-congratulatory 
solutions of exclusion, curtailment, control, force, and domination responsible 
for seemingly unrelated decisions like funding cutbacks for health care and the 
arts and the erosion of civil rights. The issue of deteriorating freedoms 
provides much of the underlying strength of the pro-choice movement. 
Legislators who ignore that fact will misjudge its force -- and we'll be better 
off without them.

BLANK CHECK FOR THE HARD LINE IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH E. SHARPE, Kenneth E. Sharpe is a professor of political science at 
Swarthmore College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mid-September's ground-breaking meeting in Mexico between the Salvadoran 
government and guerrillas ended with an agreement to begin monthly negotiating 
sessions with international mediation. Will these talks go beyond 
public-relations posturing? Perhaps. There are new, strong pressures on the 
major players to pursue a political end to a civil war that has claimed 70,000 
lives since 1980. Progress, however, will be meager until the United States 
demands serious diplomacy for its billion-dollar investment. 
</P>
<P>
The critical fact that makes negotiations possible is that the 9-year-old war 
remains stalemated. The guerrillas, strong militarily, continue to take a heavy 
toll on the army and are crippling the government economically. But victory 
still eludes them, and the population, though largely sympathetic to the 
insurgents' reformist aims, is war-weary; almost 70% want a political, not a 
military solution to the war. 
</P>
<P>
For President Alfredo Cristiani, negotiations at this point are largely a 
public-relations ploy to show the United States that, despite his party's close 
association with wealthy elites, reactionary social policy and death squads, he 
is really a man of peace. But there are mounting pressures on Cristiani to take 
negotiations seriously. 
</P>
<P>
He came to office in June on promises of economic recovery and an end to the 
war. But the treasury is almost bankrupt, and deficits, trade imbalances and 
recession threaten to make the economic crisis worse. It is slowly becoming 
clear, even to some of his business-sector supporters, that no one will invest 
in economic recovery until the war winds down, and that a military solution is 
a distant hope at best. 
</P>
<P>
The growing logic of a political solution is still opposed by many hard-liners 
in the ruling Arena party and the military. "We have nothing to negotiate" with 
the guerrillas, Defense Minister Gen. Rafael Humberto Larios said recently. His 
response to the 11-day unilateral cease-fire that the guerrillas initiated 
before the talks in Mexico City was to mount major counterinsurgency operations 
in five provinces. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have pared down many of their longstanding demands, but remain 
firm on these: the prosecution of military personnel involved in the torture 
and murder of civilians, and a general reforming of the high command. This is 
anathema to senior officers. For decades their institution has been untouched 
by civilian control, their political crimes and corruption beyond the reach of 
the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a war that is personally profitable and paid for with the lives of 
junior officers and forcibly enlisted draftees is preferable to giving up their 
historic power and privilege -- as long, that is, as the United States foots 
the bills. Negotiations will have a chance only when cuts in aid persuade the 
military that Washington is serious about a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration does not seem to share Ronald Reagan's messianic 
impulse toward Central America, yet Secretary of State James A. Baker III is 
noticeably unwilling to rethink policy toward El Salvador. He may understand 
that U.S. policy is in trouble, but he wants to avoid a sustained, acrimonious 
congressional debate about supporting a reactionary regime and a hopeless war. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, pressures are slowly building. To many in Washington, the defeat of 
the Christian Democrats by the ultra-rightist Arena in last March's election 
signaled a policy failure. Despite the $3.6 billion given to El Salvador since 
1980, neither the war nor the poverty and repression that fueled it was close 
to a solution. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is already the third-largest U.S. aid recipient in the world. Now 
costs will rise, both for continuing the war and propping up an anti-democratic 
and virtually bankrupt, corrupt government. Supporters of continued aid are 
reduced to pointing out that at least Cristiani is not Roberto D'Aubuisson, the 
Arena leader who has been linked to political murders. No one is asking the 
really important question: Will the Arena government do better than the failed 
Christian Democrats in ending state terror and economic injustice? 
</P>
<P>
In July an attempt by a House panel to restrict and condition aid to El 
Salvador failed, but it did lead to the first floor debate on Salvador policy 
in five years. Last week, an important group of senators on the Appropriations 
Committee, led by Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Tom 
Harkin (D-Iowa) brought forward legislation that would have sent an important 
message to the military. But a majority in the Senate proved as reluctant as 
the House to initiate a reconsideration of policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill would have released $85 million in military aid, but only after 
the President certified certain improvements in El Salvador. What's more, the 
final one-third would have been released only if key congressional committees 
concurred that both the U.S. and Salvadoran governments were making a serious 
effort to "settle the conflict . . . through . . . negotiations," "protect . . 
. human rights," and preserve political freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and its Senate allies claimed that such conditions 
demonstrated a premature lack of faith in Cristiani. Hogwash. If Cristiani were 
serious about pursuing negotiations and ending rights abuses, he would not 
object to such a bill -- and a smart senator would see it as providing 
Cristiani with exactly the kind of leverage he needs to persuade the military 
to go along. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it's business as usual: The United States will write another blank 
check and the hard-liners in El Salvador will nod at rhetoric about democracy 
while pursuing their ill-fated war. If future peace talks are to have any 
meaning, the Bush Administration and Congress must reconsider their reluctance 
to get tough with the government in San Salvador.

ALLIANCE WITH KING TARNISHES THE PRINCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Reagan Administration's long and tortured crusade against leftist 
insurgencies in Latin and Central America has muddied the moral waters among 
friend and foe. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's initial involvement in these activities demonstrates that a small 
power is ill-equipped to play big-power games without suffering severe damage 
to its reputation and image. 
</P>
<P>
In its insistence on propping up the Contras in Nicaragua, undermining the 
Sandinistas and staving off Fidel Castro's forces, the Reagan Administration 
used any and all means at hand to the point where Americans and allies like 
Israel, soldiers and spies, free-lance mercenaries, arms salesmen, 
drug-peddling dictators and the drug overlords themselves became entangled in 
an unsavory mix. 
</P>
<P>
The results were, at best, mixed. President Bush, who once had dealings with 
the drug-dealing Gen. Manuel A. Noriega of Panama, now has declared a war on 
America's drug problem and sent military aid to Colombia. In the process, Bush 
has also quietly left the Contras to wither on the vine and die an ignoble 
political death. 
</P>
<P>
One of the casualties of these complicated Reagan-Bush policies -- which led, 
among other things, to the Iran-Contra scandal -- apparently is the reputation 
of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, news reports have surfaced portraying Israeli 
mercenaries at the center of drug dealing in Central and South America. The 
"evidence" was a highly doctored piece of videotape advertising the security 
firm Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead, headed by Yair Klein, a former lieutenant 
colonel in the Israeli Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to focus on Israelis, real or imagined, is a highly suspect approach. 
</P>
<P>
We have already noted Bush's relationship with right-wing Latin American 
dictators while he served as Reagan's vice president. The CIA dealt with drug 
traffickers to help finance the Contra war in Nicaragua. In a world where arms 
dealers, drug dealers and terrorists mix freely and are all employed in the 
cause of "freedom fighters" or as anti-communists, it seems strange to single 
out stray Israelis as sinister forces in those dealings and to suggest that 
they operated with the guidance of their government. 
</P>
<P>
This is remarkably similar to the tarnished paintbrush used on Israel for its 
part in the Iran-Contra affair. The truth is that Israel and the Reagan 
Administration had signed a document of strategic cooperation, which was 
perforce interpreted differently and unequally by the two partners. As is often 
the case, the weaker partner paid a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
Strategic cooperation meant that Israel, a small country with a highly skilled 
military, would provide the pincers of a bulldozer -- meaning that Israeli 
weapons would be used to buy influence in Iran with an eye toward bettering 
relations between Washington and Tehran and working toward the release of 
American hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of this policy are already well-known. But if Israel played a 
key role in the overtures and dealings with Iran, its role thereafter was 
minuscule as money gained from weapons sales found its way to the Contras. In 
Central America, the United States and its crew of military experts, National 
Securty Council officials and CIA operatives were the initiators and the 
actors, not the Israelis, although it is probable that some Israeli experts and 
free-lancers may have had a peripheral hand in matters there. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America as a whole is full of professional mercenaries, soldiers of 
fortune, "consultants" of all stripes who hire themselves out to regimes of 
whatever political stripe -- and yes, even to drug lords. The mercenaries come 
from all over, many of them from the United States, as well as Europe and the 
Third World. No doubt a small number of them are Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to accept the reality of military professionals and arms 
merchants for hire. It is quite another to suggest that Israelis -- and there 
are very few there -- should bear a special onus, and to suggest sinister 
Israeli governmental machinations at work. Yet, the emphasis on Israel is 
damaging precisely because it mars Israel's image, despoils the good deeds of 
an ally acting in good faith as part of a strategic cooperation agreement. It 
continues to be true that Israel bears a large moral burden, the kind not 
bothered with by such countries as Syria or such groups as the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the onus on Israel has become a blossoming industry in the media. It's 
a carryover from Israel's role in Lebanon and the one-sided visuals provided by 
the Palestinian uprising. It is also an example of a view held by the prophetic 
Machiavelli, who wrote five centuries ago that when a small prince allies 
himself to a mighty king, he will be cast adrift when he is no longer needed.

BODIES OF 2 MEN FOUND IN PLANE WRECKAGE NEAR OJAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two bodies found in the wreckage of a small plane Thursday are believed to be 
those of two missing Palos Verdes Peninsula pilots who disappeared Tuesday 
while flying home from Reno. 
</P>
<P>
A Civil Air Patrol pilot spotted the crash site at 12:45 p.m. about 15 miles 
north of Ojai near Reyes Peak, a 7,500-foot-high portion of Pine Mountain in 
northwestern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ground crews struggled through the rugged terrain of Los Padres National Forest 
for more than two hours to reach the wreckage, where they found the bodies, 
Ventura County Sheriff's Watch Commander Mike Gullon said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery ended an extensive two-day ground and air search for Milton 
Smith, 64, of Rancho Palos Verdes and William Manfrass, 68, of Palos Verdes 
Estates, both retired United Airlines flight captains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Reno for Races 
</P>
<P>
The men left Reno in a twin-engine Cessna 310 about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday, heading 
to Torrance Municipal Airport after enjoying a long weekend at the Reno Air 
Races, Civil Air Patrol Lt. Col. Bob Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who was piloting the plane, was last heard from shortly after noon 
Tuesday when he made a routine radio call to report that he was flying near the 
town of Avenal, in the San Joaquin Valley, at an altitude of about 10,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Other pilots who left Reno around the same time reported clear skies and smooth 
flying into Southern California, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends contacted federal officials late Tuesday when the men, whom they 
described as excellent pilots, failed to arrive in Torrance. Fowler said Civil 
Air Patrol volunteers started their search at 3:25 a.m. Wednesday, first 
checking at Torrance airport to make sure Smith's and Manfrass' cars were at 
the hangar where they kept their plane. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen volunteer air crews searched more than 500 square miles of Santa 
Barbara, Ventura and Kern counties before finding the wreckage, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency locater beacon that should have sent out a distress signal after 
the plane's impact was never heard by the search crews or by an orbiting 
satellite designed to listen for the tone. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, something goes down in a canyon and only emits when you hit it 
at the right angle," Fowler said, noting that searchers had not reported what 
kind of terrain the plane was found in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Rugged' 
</P>
<P>
Searchers at first believed the wreckage was in Santa Barbara County, so that 
department's helicopter helped verify the plane's location, Gullon said. When 
it became clear that the site was in Ventura County, responsibility shifted. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio communication in that part of the forest is very poor," Gullon said. 
"It's a very rugged part of the county. . . . We have to wait for the 
search-and-rescue team and the coroner's people to return some time tonight 
before we know many details." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends of Manfrass could not be reached Thursday night, but a 
friend of the Smith family read a brief biography that described Smith as a 
"great and loving father and well-remembered by all his friends." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 33-year United Airlines pilot who retired four years ago, began his 
flying career during World War II as an Army Air Corps navigator for B-17s 
flying out of England. 
</P>
<P>
He later became an Air National Guard and Air Force pilot before moving on to 
captain United Airlines DC-8s and DC-10s. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved to be with people," his wife, Priscilla, said during a brief 
interview. "He was a fine person and wonderful husband and extremely good 
father. You can't say that of too many people." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, Smith is survived by a daughter, Veve Cobbs of 
Belleville, Wis.; two sons, Jeffrey, a pilot for Northwest Airlines, and 
Matthew, assistant manager of Dive &amp; Surf in Redondo Beach; two 
grandchildren; four sisters and a brother.

MOBIL PARTY GETS SMALLER, BUT TORRANCE STILL DUBIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mobil Oil, which earlier had announced plans to have 10,000 to 12,000 people 
attend a daylong open house at its Torrance refinery Oct. 7, now estimates that 
only 6,000 to 8,000 people will come, with no more than 2,000 at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance Assistant City Manager Albert Ng, who had opposed holding the 
gathering at the refinery because of safety concerns, said Thursday that he 
continues to think a city park would be a better place for such a large group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still a Lot of People' 
</P>
<P>
"They could have the assembly in a park site and bus the people (to the 
refinery) for tours," he said. "Two thousand is still a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Fire Marshal Richard Nanney said the city's fire prevention office is 
reviewing Mobil applications for permits to hold a public assembly and to erect 
canopies. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the review is on the maximum size," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The refinery -- the focus of investigations prompted by a series of explosions, 
fires, gas releases and fatal accidents -- was planning to spend up to $200,000 
for jugglers, clowns, hot dogs, hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, bus 
tours of refinery process and control units and informational booths. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Barry Engelberg said the lower estimate of attendance is not an 
attempt to mollify the city by planning a smaller celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not planned to downsize our open house," he said. "You refine things 
as you go along. I just didn't want to give the impression that we were going 
to scale down the thing. The estimate of people changed." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials say the party is to polish the beleaguered refinery's image, 
part of a campaign that has also included advertisements in local newspapers 
and the publication of a newsletter sent to all Torrance residents. 
</P>
<P>
They say the campaign is not intended to influence a lawsuit filed against 
Mobil in April, in which the city of Torrance seeks to have the refinery 
declared a public nuisance, or to sway Torrance voters, who will face a ballot 
measure in March that would effectively eliminate the use of acutely hazardous 
hydrofluoric acid at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil reacted bitterly to the city's initial opposition to its open-house plans 
in mid-August, accusing the city of unconstitutionally violating its rights. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said then, however, that there are limited grounds on 
which the city can refuse permits, and Mobil continued to pursue its party 
plans.

DEVELOPER SCRATCHES PLANS FOR POOL HALL NEXT TO HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance developer has withdrawn plans to build the nation's largest pool 
hall next to Hawthorne High School, apparently ending a heated battle with 
parents and officials at the Centinela Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Jerry Jamgotchian president of Equity West Development Co., said 
in an interview Thursday that he has canceled plans for a 25,000-square-foot, 
56-table pool hall in a vacant building on the 5100 block of El Segundo 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, Treasure Hunt Inc. of Vernon will develop a bargain 
department store in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed pool hall had been vehemently opposed at school board and city 
Planning Commission meetings by parents, school officials and representatives 
of a local church. They said the pool hall would have attracted gangs, 
prostitution and drugs to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian had the necessary permits to develop the pool hall and had planned 
a grand opening for November. On Oct. 4 he was scheduled to go before the 
Planning Commission to request a liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
He said his decision Wednesday to withdraw his plans for a pool hall were based 
on business reasons, which he declined to specify. But he added that his 
decision was also "in the best interest of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Ann Birdsall, who said she was concerned that students might be 
served liquor at the pool hall, said she is elated that Jamgotchian has 
withdrawn his plan. She credited pressure by parents and school officials for 
persuading Jamgotchian to make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think the people had a lot to do with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. McKinley M. Nash, who has said the pool hall would have 
established an "undesirable educational climate," said in an interview Thursday 
that he is happy with Jamgotchian's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Hawthorne of all races have rallied around the support of a just 
cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash added, however, that he resents having had to take time away from his job 
to battle the developer and said he is going to recommend to State Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig that a state law be proposed to prohibit the sale 
of liquor near schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not have to engage in community activism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Earl Thornton of the Delaire Assembly of God Church in Hawthorne, who 
opposed the pool hall because he said it would attract the "less-than-best type 
of people" to the area, said he was pleased by the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how that was going to be a service to our area," Thornton said, 
adding that he would prefer that Jamgotchian build a youth center on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Stennis Floyd, a longtime resident whose son graduated from Hawthorne High 
School last year and who adamantly opposed the pool hall, remained skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said he does not think a bargain department store will be feasible in 
that building and that he questions Jamgotchian's sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't trust the guy at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition he aroused, Jamgotchian said he still plans to build a 
pool hall elsewhere in the area. He said he could not disclose the location 
until the purchase of the property is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you," he said, "I'm going to build a billiard center in the South Bay 
because the need is there."

BERNARDI TO TURN TABLES ON REPORTERS IN NEW SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The often opinionated and sometimes boisterous Ernani Bernardi will temporarily 
trade his councilman's seat for moderator's chair when he presents a televised 
current affairs program that will be a local version of "Washington Week in 
Review." 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Los Angeles News in Review," the first half-hour show airs at 8 p.m. 
today on Channel 45, United Cable Television, which serves more than 50,000 
east San Fernando Valley households. It will be taped an hour earlier, and 
Bernardi says he may distribute the tape to other cable stations in the Los 
Angeles area in hopes of wider airing. 
</P>
<P>
The show is scheduled to run every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's effort is not unique among Los Angeles City Council members, most of 
whom appear at least occasionally on cable television talk shows. But his show 
will be the first designed to feature newspaper reporters -- instead of 
politicians, city staff or community members -- talking about current events. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he got the idea after becoming disgusted with the fact that most 
people rely on television for their news. "What do you get from television? 
Nothing," he said. So he decided to bring the print medium to the tube. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradley Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Topics to be covered tonight include the investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley, 
recommendations of the City Council's Ethics Commission and the city's garbage 
disposal problems. Reporters scheduled to appear are Bill Boyarsky of the Los 
Angeles Times, Rick Orlov of the Los Angeles Daily News and John Schwada of the 
Los Angeles Herald Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
The set will resemble "Washington Week in Review's": an oval table, stark 
lighting, subdued background. Scott Merrifield, manager of studio operations at 
United Cable, said the only remaining question is whether to use the studio's 
only plant -- fondly named Oscar -- in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his reputation for feistiness and lengthy speeches before the council, 
Bernardi has promised to let the reporters do most of the on-camera talking 
unless "it seems as though it's falling down a little or slowing down. Then 
I'll pose a question." 
</P>
<P>
Topics under consideration for future shows reflect some of Bernardi's pet 
peeves and issues pertinent to his northeast San Fernando Valley district: 
immigration, crime, gangs, overdevelopment, crowded housing and unpaid police 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he will have no qualms about cutting guests off if they drone on 
beyond the nine minutes each is allotted for presenting and discussing an 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll butt in when the time is up," Bernardi said. "Don't worry." 
</P>
<P>
Because Channel 45 is a public access channel -- an electronic town square that 
allows all comers time to air whatever they please -- if the discussion goes 
overtime in the studio, it will run longer on television too. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no editorial power whatsoever," Merrifield said. "We're not editing 
what is said, just trying to make sure it looks good." 
</P>
<P>
Community college students will tape the show, smooth it out and broadcast it. 
</P>
<P>
With city funds, Bernardi hired Erwin Baker, a retired Times reporter, as the 
show's producer. Baker covered City Hall for 21 years and said he hopes to rely 
on relationships developed with reporters during his career to fill the 
program's guest lists for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great source of expert opinion represented by reporters in this 
town," Baker said. "All I can say is the three people I asked this time were 
not reluctant." 
</P>
<P>
Both men agree that the show's development was more coincidence than plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi has wanted to do something like the show for more than a year. But he 
said he had to put the idea on hold when he was forced into a runoff election 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Baker had been working part-time producing an employee newsletter for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. When funding for Baker's newsletter was cut in 
August, he sent letters to several council members offering to do public 
relations work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Plans Converge 
</P>
<P>
The two plans converged earlier this month. Public access television, required 
by the City Council in granting cable franchises, provided the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing hours of "Washington Week in Review" tapes, a format was 
chosen, guests were lined up and a time to air the show was negotiated with 
United Cable. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the show's title was chosen less than two weeks ago. Bernardi wanted a 
name that would remind viewers of "Washington Week in Review" and allow him to 
include issues outside City Hall. When he and Baker decided to do the show 
every two weeks, any titles that mentioned "week" were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
A list circulated among reporters and others at City Hall included "Inside 
L.A.," "Inside City Hall" and Baker's favorite, "Byline Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi didn't like it. 
</P>

"I didn't even know what that meant," Bernardi said of Baker's choice. "What

L.A. PROPOSES 3-STORY LIMIT ON VALLEY VILLAGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city planners Thursday offered a compromise limit of three stories 
on new apartment buildings in a predominantly single-family North Hollywood 
neighborhood, following an outpouring of objections from residents against a 
city proposal to allow five-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The offer of a lower height limit came as the Planning Commission met Thursday 
to consider a special land use plan for the Valley Village area that would 
restrict commercial and multifamily residential development. A final review of 
the plan before the commission is set for Nov. 9, after planners discuss the 
new recommendations with the area's citizens advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Village is a one-by-1 1/2 mile area bounded by the Hollywood Freeway on 
the east, the Tujunga Wash next to Coldwater Canyon Avenue on the west, the 
Ventura Freeway on the south and Burbank Boulevard on the north. Homeowners in 
Valley Village, in Van Nuys and elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley have 
become concerned that the growing number of apartment houses is destroying the 
character of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The new height recommendation would allow developers to build one story higher 
than the two-story limit recommended by the citizens advisory committee, which 
met for nearly two years. But it is lower than the five-story limit recommended 
by planners in a report released earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to fight to keep it to two stories," said Tom Paterson, president 
of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn., which represents about 500 households. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Sutton, the city planner in charge of neighborhood planning, called the 
three-story limit a compromise between the desperate need to provide housing 
and the need to protect single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"If we did everything residents wanted, we wouldn't have the housing we need to 
support the population," Sutton said. The height limit was dropped after he 
realized that the five-story limit was a mistake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Renee Weitzer, a spokeswoman for City Councilman John Ferraro, said "City 
Hall is like Peyton Place, and word just filtered down that the council members 
in the area weren't happy." Councilmen Joel Wachs and Zev Yaroslavsky also 
represent the area. 
</P>
<P>
Arline DeSanctis, a spokeswoman for Wachs, said residents have a right to be 
frustrated and angry that the recommendation of the citizens advisory committee 
for a two-story limit was not followed. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton told homeowners after the meeting that he had been wrong not to inform 
them of the changes in the plan before the meeting. But he said planners are 
responsible for drawing up plans that balance competing interests. 
</P>
<P>
If the Planning Commission approves the proposal, it will be sent to the 
Planning and Land Use Management Committee for a public hearing. The City 
Council has the final say over whether its adopted. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, building in the area is restricted by a temporary ordinance to 
two stories. The moratorium established by the ordinance, which was approved in 
November, 1986, expires later this year, but the City Council can extend it for 
one year.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD MAN GIVEN 12-YEAR TERM FOR DAY-LONG CRIME SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old North Hollywood man received the maximum sentence for a 24-hour 
crime spree during which he attacked the wife of a state Court of Appeal 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Mallotti was sentenced Thursday in San Fernando Superior Court to 12 
years and eight months in state prison for five felonies, including the 
residential robbery of Tanya Gates, wife of Appellate Judge Donald N. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Mallotti pleaded guilty last month to two counts of residential burglary, two 
counts of grand theft auto and one count of kidnaping, with the special 
allegation of great bodily injury to Tanya Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Mallotti said he was high on cocaine throughout the crime spree, which began 
June 29, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop. 
</P>
<P>
Mallotti broke into Gates' Northridge home and threatened to kill a maid if she 
tried to stop him from stealing the Gates' possessions, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
When Tanya Gates arrived home and confronted Mallotti, he punched her in the 
face, breaking her nose, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Mallotti fled in Gates' car, which he later abandoned. Early the next morning, 
he hijacked a car driven by Javier Ortega in San Fernando. Holding him at 
knifepoint, Mallotti forced Ortega to drive him around the area for several 
hours in search of drugs and money, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Mallotti also ordered Ortega to call Ortega's friends and ask them to bring 
money, according to court documents. Ortega contacted police, who arrested 
Mallotti.

DISAPPOINTED AT CSUN CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very disappointed to learn that Cal State Northridge is cutting back on 
the number of applicants accepted to their business program for the school year 
of 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
While this action may eventually ease the problem of over-enrollment, it does 
not help students acquire the impacted classes needed for graduation. CSUN 
should be offering more classes, especially those currently impacted. 
</P>
<P>
I hope CSUN finds a solution to solve their problem of impacted classes, for it 
is dearly needed, particularly by those students transferring from two-year 
colleges such as Moorpark College.

NOTHING SNEAKY ABOUT BOARD ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article regarding the Board of Supervisors' action on the Paramount Ranch 
zoning case ("County Alters Report, Reapproves Housing Project," Aug. 9) may 
have left the casual reader with an impression that the board was seeking to 
somehow secretly cover our tracks on this case. 
</P>
<P>
However the facts are quite different. As anyone expert in the field of EIRs 
and the California Environmental Quality Act would readily attest, public 
agencies often prepare addenda to their environmental documentation whenever 
minor changes are made to a project as a part of the final approval, and this 
case is no different. 
</P>
<P>
These addenda help satisfy the informational goals of CEQA by describing the 
approved project as clearly as possible. CEQA also encourages the use of 
addenda to allow for minor technical additions to provide for the most thorough 
impact report. Contrary to the impression left by the article, none of the 
information included in the addendum for this project was significant new 
material or information that the county was trying to withhold from scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
What the opposition to the case did not choose to disclose is that the board at 
my urging reduced the impacts of the project significantly -- thereby 
triggering the need for the addenda. On my motion, the board reduced the 
project from 159 homes to 150, and we required the developer to provide a large 
continuous permanent open-space buffer adjacent to the park property to the 
south. We required 80% of the oak trees to be saved and we imposed other 
requirements to reduce the impacts on surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Two final points. First it should be remembered that the general plan in place 
when I became supervisor in 1980 permitted 234 homes on the site. Today that 
amount is only 150, or two-thirds of the original amount. Second, one should 
not forget that there were significant numbers of nearby homeowners who 
supported the approval of the case.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN BEGINS 30-DAY JAIL TERM FOR FAILING TO CLEAN 
UP YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Thousand Oaks resident began serving a 30-day jail sentence Thursday after a 
judge found that he had repeatedly failed to clear his property of junk 
accumulated over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph Leben, regarded by his neighbors on Havenwood Drive as a kindly 
eccentric, turned himself in to the Ventura County Jail after Municipal Judge 
John R. Smiley denied his request for a modified sentence in a hearing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Leben, a planner in the aerospace industry, pleaded guilty in April to charges 
of creating a public nuisance and a fire hazard. He received several chances to 
clear his front, side and back yards before Smiley sentenced him to jail Aug. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The men's club of Leben's church even offered to help him and began clearing 
his yard. But Leben asked them not to come back because he was afraid that he 
"wouldn't have any control of what was going out," said Edward Krol, a member 
of St. Paschal Baylon Church in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Schreiner, the deputy city attorney who prosecuted the case, said a jail 
term was fair. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been dealing with him on this matter for years and years and years, and 
he's fully aware he needs to clean up his property," she said. "I feel he's 
been playing with and taking advantage of the system long enough. He's been 
given great latitude in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have said they long marveled at Leben's growing collection of junk 
and lodged quiet complaints over the years. But they said they never pushed the 
issue because Leben was quiet, pleasant and frequently offered to help them 
with chores. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing Wednesday, Leben claimed that he had cleared his yard and 
asked the judge to reconsider his sentence. But the city produced photographs 
and testimony from code enforcement officers that he had only moved debris from 
the front yard to the back, Schreiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Leben could not be reached for comment and does not have an attorney.

WESTLAKE FIGHTS VALIANTLY IN 34-28 LOSS TO VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all of its shortcomings, for its miserable defense, its spotty offense, its 
0-3 record, there is something about Westlake High's football team that tugs at 
one's sense of valor. There is no way to get down on this team. 
</P>
<P>
Take Thursday night at Thousand Oaks High, for instance. The Warriors lost 
another nonleague game, this time to Ventura, 34-28. 
</P>
<P>
After a week's worth of practices designed solely to stop the run, the Warriors 
gave up 273 yards rushing to one guy -- Danny Taylor -- who had 117 in his 
previous two games combined. In all, Ventura gained 318 yards on the ground, 
109 in the air. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all that, Westlake had two chances to win after trailing by 20 
points early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the defense because they stopped them on two critical drives and 
gave us the opportunity to win the game," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said. "We 
could have actually gone in and won the game." 
</P>
<P>
And take this Benkert guy. First-year coach, looks about 17, bleached-blond 
hair and promises of better things. Who you gonna believe, Dennis the Menace or 
those nasty little numbers that say Westlake is dead last in the Valley in 
defense? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be down," Benkert said. "I'm not down. The kids are playing. We're 
young and the kids are going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
"Stay with us." 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. Toss into Westlake's grand scheme a junior quarterback named Todd 
Preston. He's 6-foot-2, 170 pounds and has a rifle for a right arm. By the 
fourth quarter, it's an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
Preston threw for 243 yards -- 127 in the fourth quarter. He also threw 
touchdown passes of three and 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
His first pass of the fourth quarter was of three yards to Erik Holcomb to 
bring the Warriors to within 34-20. His two-point conversion run made it 34-22 
with 9:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
His second, less than five minutes later, traveled 12 yards to Dave Monheim and 
brought Westlake to within 34-28. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's a player," Benkert said of Preston. "He was the team leader we 
wanted him to be." 
</P>
<P>
Preston, however, had no say against Ventura's running game. Taylor ran for 
three touchdowns, including a 60-yard sweep around right end that gave the 
Cougars their 34-14 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (2-0-1) was aware of Westlake's difficulty in halting a running game, 
so the strategy was simple. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we had to clean up our act as far as the running game," Ventura 
Coach Harvey Kochel said. "And we felt they lent us that." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake was within seven, 14-7, at halftime, despite its inability to control 
the defensive line of scrimmage and, therefore, Ventura's rushing game. The 
Cougars gained 151 first-half yards via the rush. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that yardage were two long scoring runs by Taylor, both on dive 
plays out of the veer. Taylor dashed 37 yards on a fourth-and-three play to 
give the Cougars a 7-0 lead 5:49 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
With every Westlake defender stacked along the line of scrimmage expecting the 
dive, Ventura obliged and Taylor squirted through. Then, with 3:07 left in the 
half, Taylor scored from 59 yards for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Between the two runs, Ventura linebacker Jeff Green blocked Luke Crawford 
field-goal attempts of 27 and 47 yards. He also recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake retaliated with 42 seconds remaining in the half. On second and 10 
from the Cougar 36, a scrambling Preston connected with Erik Holcomb, who 
outran the defense to the end zone. The point-after made the score 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb accounted for three touchdowns, including an 86-yard kickoff return 
with 1:26 left in the third quarter that made the score, 28-14, Ventura. But 
Westlake's last two drives ended with Preston passes being intercepted.

HARBOR'S NEW COACH WILL FACE OLD FRIENDS WHEN SEAHAWKS OPEN SEASON AT SANTA 
MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbor (1-0) travels to Santa Monica (1-0) for Saturday's 7:30 p.m. Western 
State Conference opener, but Don Weems will feel at home on the Corsairs' 
field. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks' new football coach was an assistant at the school for 11 years 
and he looks forward to playing against old friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the three full-time coaches there," Weems said, "I worked with two and I 
was on the committee that hired them. It will be good to go back." 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy for the Seahawks to be competitive with No. 12 Santa Monica. 
The Corsairs trounced Chaffey 33-3 two weeks ago and they're bigger, faster and 
more experienced than Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, who defeated Victor Valley 27-6 in last week's opener, should 
find Santa Monica's tough offensive line difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively the Seahawks have the potential to do that. They were impressive 
against Victor Valley and should be much the same against Santa Monica. 
Freshman quarterback Glenn Baham will again run Harbor's short-pass oriented 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (1-0) is anxious to face Orange Coast (1-0) on Saturday at 7 p.m. in 
a Mission Conference opener at El Camino. The Warriors have been off for two 
weeks after defeating Antelope Valley 38-17 and they're hungry to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real excited about this game," said El Camino Coach John Featherstone. 
"We really haven't been tested yet and this will be it." Orange Coast opened 
its season with last week's 32-14 victory over Rio Hondo. Last year the Pirates 
finished at the bottom of the Mission Conference central division (4-6), but 
Coach Bill Workman expects 10 returning starters to improve that mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates start Greg Angelovic at quarterback. He completed 13 of 19 passes 
for 163 yards and one touchdown last week. Tailback Mike Vaez will also help 
move the ball. The freshman gained 102 yards on 22 carries against Rio Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' offense, led by quarterback Frank Dolce, finished with 379 total 
yards against Antelope Valley while their powerful defense limited the 
Marauders to 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Southwest (1-0) is looking for its second victory in Saturday's 1 p.m. WSC 
opener at West L.A. (0-1) and the Cougars should get it since their opponent is 
no powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers kept last year's streak alive with a 21-3 loss to Victor Valley two 
weeks ago. Last season they failed to win a game and ended at the bottom of the 
WSC with an 0-10 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest kicked off its season with a 17-16 win over Rio Hondo two weeks ago. 
The Cougars' defense, led by Pierce College transfer Chris Mims, played the 
biggest role in that victory. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Manigo will start again at quarterback for the Cougars. The Leuzinger 
High freshman passed for 164 yards and two touchdowns against Rio Hondo.

CCAA LOOKING FOR MORE PEOPLE TO SIT UP AND TAKE TAKE NOTICE OF THEIR TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Collegiate Athletic Assn. often skunks its Division II 
competition when it comes to winning NCAA titles. CCAA teams have dominated 
sports such as swimming, softball, cross-country and volleyball and have won 
titles in basketball, baseball, wrestling and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
But in the shadow of the Pacific 10 Conference -- as well as the Big West and 
the West Coast Conference -- the CCAA (and Division II in general) is often 
ignored. And the conference's most prestigious member, Cal State Northridge, is 
stepping up to Division I after this school year. What's a conference to do? 
</P>
<P>
In the CCAA's case, a long-range planning committee -- including various 
administrators from CCAA athletic programs -- is looking into the weighty 
matters of realigning the membership and increasing exposure. 
</P>
<P>
As Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, a member of the 
planning committee that met last week, says: "We say we're the conference of 
champions, but we're the only ones who know it." 
</P>
<P>
With Northridge leaving and at least one other CCAA team -- UC Riverside -- 
looking at moving up to Division I, the CCAA is wooing Cal State San 
Bernardino, an independent Division II school with a growing program, and has 
also been approached by UC San Diego, which now competes in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever comes and goes, the CCAA will have a new look in the 1990s, and will 
probably have more competitive races without Northridge, a school that dwarfs 
most of the eight-member CCAA with an enrollment of 31,000. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero said San Bernardino, the fastest-growing school in the Cal State 
system, has approached the CCAA and is openly being courted. It is hoped San 
Bernardino can join the CCAA next year, which would make the school a 
full-fledged member by the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego's approach was more of a surprise but is being considered 
optimistically, with membership probably a little farther down the road than 
San Bernardino. "The committee is in favor of seeing both of those schools 
involved," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
The other pressing point the committee discussed was expanded media attention. 
The CCAA would like to get a television deal for its post-season basketball 
tournament -- a similar attempt last year turned into a confused fiasco -- and 
is also working on a volleyball package. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an issue of image enhancement," Guerrero said. "We're pursuing TV 
exposure for the post-season (basketball) tournament, and we're thinking of 
adding some type of conference volleyball tournament since we're such a power 
nationally." A volleyball tourney, the panel hopes, would have some television 
appeal. "Every time you turn the (cable) TV on, you see volleyball," Guerrero 
said. "That would be a chance to showcase one of our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
The committee also is looking into expanding the responsibilities of the 
conference commissioner. Tom Morgan, a professor at Cal State Long Beach, is 
now the CCAA commissioner, which carries part-time status. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at increasing . . . the support base for the commissioner in 
order to be more visible," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the CCAA is to get more schools playing more sports. 
Women's soccer, for example, is a relatively low-budget sport but is not played 
at enough CCAA schools to set up a conference schedule. Hence, Dominguez Hills, 
with one of the strongest teams in the country, needs to play an exceptionally 
tough schedule and maintain a high national ranking to be considered for a 
post-season berth. From the CCAA's standpoint -- and certainly Dominguez Hills' 
-- it would be preferable to play a conference schedule with the winner getting 
an automatic NCAA playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about providing something in the by-laws where each school must 
have a certain number of sports," Guerrero said. "But that's preliminary. We 
need to know our composition for that." 
</P>
<P>
The one thing the committee knows for now is that in five years, the CCAA may 
look considerably different, and the power center will have shifted away from 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to volleyball, the West Coast Conference lives up to its name -- 
with a bit of a stretch. A scan of the eight conference rosters shows all but 
about a dozen of the players coming from California, Oregon, Washington or 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The curious stretch is that eight players come from Alaska, several of them 
conference stars. Junior outside hitter Angie Rais, an Anchorage native at the 
University of San Diego, led the WCC in hitting percentage last year, whereas 
Sitka product Christy Martin, a senior middle blocker at Portland, and Palmer 
native Erica Cordy, a junior setter at Gonzaga, earned all-WCC honors. Cordy is 
one of three Alaska natives on Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
Another Alaska product, freshman Karen Clapp, is red-shirting at Loyola. The 
Lions also boast the WCC's only Hawaii resident, freshman Dana Bragado. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine has the only East Coast native in the conference, all-WCC outside 
hitter Tami Seidenberg, who hails from the New York City neighborhood of 
Jamaica. Rare Midwest products include Pepperdine freshman Elaine Caraher from 
Orchard Park, Ill., and San Diego freshman Andrea Bruns from Apple Valley, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ellis, an assistant basketball coach to Paul Westhead at Loyola Marymount 
for the past four seasons, is stepping up to the pros this year. Ellis, 35, has 
been named a full-time assistant coach with the San Jose Jammers of the 
Continental Basketball Assn. Ellis, a volunteer assistant at Loyola since 
Westhead took over the program, was also a teacher in the Inglewood school 
system and an assistant coach of the Inglewood High basketball team from 1980 
to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Loyola Marymount Athletic Director Brian Quinn will appear as a 
guest panelist at 7:30 a.m. Sunday on KCBS-TV Channel 2's "At Issue." Quinn and 
USC sports attorney Denise Speaks will discuss NCAA legislation, including 
controversial Propositions 42 and 48, which deal with entrance requirements for 
student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast Conference begins volleyball play next week. A poll of coaches 
foresees Pepperdine repeating as champ, followed by (in order) Gonzaga, 
Portland, Santa Clara, Loyola Marymount, San Francisco, St. Mary's and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola volleyball player Janeice Stimpfig , who missed several matches with a 
knee injury, played briefly Tuesday night against Cal State Long Beach and 
hopes to be ready for the Lions' conference opener next week. 
</P>
<P>
Megan McAllister, the former Mira Costa High volleyball star, was voted most 
valuable player in the Volleyball Monthly Invitational held at Texas-Arlington. 
The USC hitter led the Trojans to the tournament title.

PALOS VERDES LOOKS LIKE WATER POLO KING; 
</P>
<P>
SEASON PREVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Chick McIlroy's first year as Miraleste High water polo coach, his team 
reached the CIF-Southern Section 2-A playoffs but was eliminated in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, 1987, the Marauders made it to the quarterfinals before losing 
to South Pasadena. Last year they lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I hope to go farther," McIlroy said. "I have more talent on this 
team than any I've ever coached, but it's also the most frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrating may the key word for Miraleste in 1989. All-Ocean League junior 
Zoltan Gyurko and two other players were suspended from at least one workout 
this week for undisclosed disciplinary reasons. McIlroy said Gyurko is working 
his way back onto the team but will not be in today's game against Muir. 
</P>
<P>
Gyurko may be out of the pool temporarily, but Palos Verdes transfer Todor 
Prlainovic won't play a minute for the Sea Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Prlainovic, a native of Yugoslavia who moved to the United States this summer, 
has been declared ineligible by the Southern Section because he is not part of 
an approved foreign exchange program, said Southern Section Commissioner Stan 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a world-class junior player, Prlainovic averaged six goals a game 
this summer for the Sea Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the talented transfer, however, Palos Verdes is expected to be one 
of the best teams in the South Bay, if not the best. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste will challenge Palos Verdes for king of the hill and the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At full strength, Miraleste is considered a contender for the 2-A title. The 
Marauders (4-3) are ranked seventh in the division. 
</P>
<P>
McIlroy, though, was cautiously optimistic about his team's chances before word 
of the suspensions came: "I believe we have the capability of being a Final 
Four team, but you'd never believe it, watching them play last week. It's like 
being on a roller coaster coaching these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste lost to Loyola and Gahr last Saturday. The previous weekend, they 
beat three teams en route to the championship game of the Irvine tournament, 
where they lost to the 3-A Division's top-ranked team, Capistrano Valley. The 
Marauders have also lost to Harvard, the fourth-ranked team in the 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes was the only South Bay team that went undefeated during summer 
league play, but that was with Prlainovic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're one of the best teams in the 3-A without (Prlainovic). With him, we're 
No. 1," said Palos Verdes Coach Jovan Vavic, whose team is ranked ninth in the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the king of South Bay water polo will be crowned at the El Segundo 
Tournament on Oct. 6 and 7, when virtually all of the area's teams will 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the top teams in the South Bay: 
</P>
<P>
Coach Vavic of Palos Verdes is lamenting the CIF ruling on Prlainovic, but 
don't expect other coaches to be sympathetic. "No one can touch them in the 
South Bay," Rolling Hills Coach Frank Akins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings return three seniors from last year's Bay League championship 
team that won a school-record 20 games. They are Jeff Kimball, the team's best 
driver and shooter, defensive specialist Chris Cormier and John Karambulas, the 
hole man and the No. 1 player on the team, according to Vavic. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Chris McAllister and Jason Chung are expected to contribute, as is 
junior goalie Mike Szilard, who has been "improving every day," Vavic said. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (6-3) could compete for the 3-A championship with or without 
Prlainovic. "I don't expect to lose any more games, at least until the 
playoffs," Vavic said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm beating my head against the wall, " McIlroy said of his young Miraleste 
team. "They're having a hard time learning that there is no 'I' in team. The 
word is commitment, you have to do what's necessary to win, thinking in terms 
of the team." 
</P>
<P>
One of only two seniors on the team, forward Duane Lauchengco is Miraleste's 
co-captain and team leader, McIlroy said. The other co-captain is junior 
forward Kyle Hildebrand, who played on the national champion Junior Olympic 
team this summer. Hildebrand will team with other junior Olympians Gyurko and 
Neal Searing. 
</P>
<P>
In goal for the Marauders is junior David Reed. 
</P>
<P>
McIlroy said a win against Muir today would put Miraleste "in the right 
direction, but the team's attitude won't change overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Poised to challenge Miraleste for the Ocean League title is El Segundo. The 
Eagles posted a 5-20 record last year, but are much improved. "We'll win at 
least as many as we'll lose," Coach Henry Stuart said. El Segundo was 7-7 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But the Eagles are still young and might be a year away from serious title 
contention. Top players include senior Mike Whitney and the team's fastest 
swimmer, junior Robert Ingersoll. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lubba, only a sophomore, is the Eagles' new goalie. "He has big legs; 
he's big and rangy and not afraid of the ball," Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got my problems," Mira Costa Coach Mike Nollan said. To be exact, Nollan 
has eight problems, replacing the seniors who graduated from last year's CIF 
2-A semifinalist team that went 23-9. 
</P>
<P>
"We're puting it together, but we have a way to go," Nollan said. Leading the 
way will be senior captain Mike Mullen. Senior left-hander Noah Willard, last 
year's top reserve, is this year's potential top scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Joe Boyle is in goal after a distinguished frosh-soph career. "Joe is 
our shining light, " Nollan said. "He's making us closer to where we want to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Roy Elliott, a CIF finalist in the 100-yard freestyle last spring, is 
the team's swiftest swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
At Chadwick, fourth-year Coach Brian Weaver has his Dolphins thinking they "can 
play with the big boys." The Dolphins could wrest the Prep League title from 
Webb for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, the kids were mortally terrified to play some of the big 
public schools," Weaver said. "Now we're beginning to beat some of these 
teams." Chadwick beat Redondo last week, 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
Players like senior captain Brad Cebeci are creating a winning atmosphere at 
Chadwick. Cebeci is a four-year varsity starter, a three-year all-league 
selection and the school's all-time leading goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Wallace, a 6-3 senior, is the Dolphins' fastest swimmer and an aggressive 
player. Look for junior left-hander Chris Willoughby, leading Chadwick in 
scoring, to take some of the load off Cebeci. 
</P>
<P>
In goal is basketball recruit Evan Calbi, playing water polo for the first time 
ever. "I recruited him when I saw him playing goalie in a street hockey 
tournament, " Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mark Rubke of Redondo has had to recruit as well. But he only had to look 
to the side of the pool to ask junior Chrissy Johnson if she wanted to give up 
her statistics duties and give the young team a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is one of the team's fastest swimmers, but senior Larry Rodriguez, an 
All-Ocean League choice last year, is the outstanding player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
After Rodriguez, there's a serious drop-off in talent, age, and experience. 
"We're so green you wouldn't believe it," Rubke said. Would you believe a 
freshman starting in goal? Travis Mayer gets the honors, three months after 
stepping out of an eighth-grade classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Mayer was blitzed for 23 goals, but Rubke gave him and the rest of 
his young team credit: "He's (Mayer) handling the situation as maturely as you 
could expect of a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills administered the 23-goal onslaught on Redondo, but frosh-soph 
Coach Frank Akins says the Titans are only an "average team this year." Akins, 
now in his 23rd year at Rolling Hills, gave up the varsity post to former 
Rolling Hills standout Pete Showler. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Chris Hurrell, the hole man, and Chris Huettemeyer, the goalie, should 
lead the team. Mark Eaton, Trevor Lattin, and Alan Bergin will also contribute 
for the Titans.

ERIC DAVIS SAYS SAN DIEGO TOPS HIS LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outfielder Eric Davis, unhappy and feeling unwanted in Cincinnati, says San 
Diego tops his list of prospective new teams if the Reds don't re-sign him 
after next season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Padres are my No. 1 team right now," said Davis, who hit his 33rd homer 
Thursday in the Reds' 11-7 loss to the visiting Padres. "Why? Because of the 
ballpark they have . . . the talent they have over there, the chance to be 
contenders for a long time (and) the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are things you look for when you're making a move." 
</P>
<P>
It's not certain that Davis will leave the Reds when he becomes a free agent 
after the 1990 season, but the power-hitting center fielder says he's ready for 
a change if that happens. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego would be a great place to play," Davis said. "Ask a lot of players. 
They'll tell you they would love to go to San Diego."

KINCHEN'S COMEBACK A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a four-year absence from the ring, Robert Kinchen wanted his comeback 
fight Thursday night at the El Cortea Convention Center to be nice and easy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was rough and awkward, but not rough enough to cause any serious 
problems for Kinchen, who is the younger brother of middleweight James (The 
Heat) Kinchen. He stopped Jose Moreno on a technical knockout after the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
But it surely was awkward enough to make Kinchen think twice about a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not what I expected," said Kinchen, 23, of left-hander Jose Moreno of 
Tecate, Mexico. "I almost turned to my trainer and said 'What's this?' " 
</P>
<P>
In the main event, San Diego junior middleweight Terry Norris (22-3), ranked 
fourth by the World Boxing Council, stopped Phoenix's Nathan Dryer (12-7) at 
1:45 of the fourth round on a technical knockout. Dryer's trainer threw in the 
towel when his fighter could no longer see out of his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
Kinchen (174 pounds) was aware that his scheduled opponent had pulled out of 
the fight earlier in the day, but he had no idea the replacement would be a 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell what he was going to do," said Kinchen, who attended Morse 
High. "Luckily, he switched to righty sometimes. He also had more heart than I 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
But that could not stop the right hand of Kinchen. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first round, Kinchen caught Moreno (4-2) square on the nose with a 
right-hand uppercut. In the second round, Moreno (181 pounds) was put down by a 
Kinchen right that landed on his collarbone. His nose also bled profusely and 
he had trouble breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno landed a couple of left hooks, but none seemed to faze Kinchen. 
</P>
<P>
The ring doctor stopped the fight between the second and third rounds because 
Moreno was having trouble breathing through his nose. 
</P>
<P>
James Kinchen, who helped train Robert for his return bout, said he was 
impressed, particularly considering the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he did well for being off that long, and for having to fight a lefty 
with no warning," James Kinchen said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert wasn't quite as pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing to hoop-and-holler about," he said. "I had some ring-rust. It's 
takes a while to get back in the groove, and an awkward guy like this doesn't 
make it any better." 
</P>
<P>
Kinchen left boxing after only three pro fights -- all knockout wins -- 
searching for something. What, he wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I just needed to grow up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All grown up and coming off two years of working in the Navy field support 
office, Kinchen said he was ready to start making some real money again. 
</P>
<P>
"Say what you want about boxing, but it's a great way of making money, but you 
have to be in the right place at the right time," Kinchen said. 
</P>
<P>
Which is where his brother James will be Oct. 24 when he fights Virgil Hill in 
Bismarck, N.D., for the International Boxing Federation Title. After years of 
waiting, it will be "The Heat's" first title shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire James a lot," Robert said. "He's my hero. He's paid his dues. I want 
to be like him." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Brad Powell (177) won his debut with a third-round knockout of 
Tijuana's Rafael Servin (175 3/4) in the opening bout. 
</P>
<P>
In the second bout, San Diego's Rogelio Perez (117 1/2) captured his first pro 
victory with a knockout at 1:37 of the third round over Los Angeles' Jose 
Daniel (117 3/4).

CHULA VISTA NEEDS TO FIND A WAY TO SCALE MIRA MESA

<P>
Size or deception? That is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista football Coach George Ohnesorgen thinks his team will have to do 
something to overcome Mira Mesa's size advantage when the teams play tonight at 
7:30 in a nonleague game at Mira Mesa High School. 
</P>
<P>
But Brad Griffith, Mira Mesa's coach, won't admit to having bigger players, 
which raises a question. Why does the program make Mira Mesa's linemen appear 
so monstrous? 
</P>
<P>
"I lied 10 to 15 pounds so the kids don't look too small," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Ohnesorgen isn't relying on the program. He had a scout checking out 
the action Friday, when Mira Mesa defeated Southwest, 7-3, so he knows what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
"Our scout was real impressed," he said. "They're a physical team. They just 
try to beat you up." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't any real rivalry. Sixth-ranked Mira Mesa (2-0) and fifth-ranked 
Chula Vista (2-0) have never played each other. Ohnesorgen said: "It's going to 
be tough to get pumped up for Mira Mesa since this is the first year we've 
played them." 
</P>
<P>
But this figures to be more than a run-of-the-mill nonleague game. Both teams 
are among the best in the county but have different styles. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa is diverse offensively. Running backs Don Elder and Wayne Pittman 
each rushed for more than 100 yards in Mira Mesa's 31-6 victory over Monte 
Vista. Tight end Marc Ziegler proved his ability to go deep against Southwest, 
catching a 51-yard touchdown pass that Griffith still enjoys watching on film. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most outstanding catches you'll ever see," Griffith said. "Over the 
shoulder, one-handed. If you see it on film, you wouldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista has relied heavily on a passing game directed by quarterback Derek 
Chapman, 11th in the county passing yardage (142 per game). He has two talented 
targets in receivers Brandon Gregg and Neviett Richardson, both juniors. 
Running back Trenel Hicks balances Chula Vista's attack.

AZTEC SPLIT END RAYE INJURES HIS FOOT; STATUS UNCERTAIN

<P>
San Diego State split end Jimmy Raye sprained his right foot in practice 
Wednesday, and his status for Saturday night's football game against Cal State 
Fullerton at San Diego Jack Murphy is uncertain, a school spokesman said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Raye's foot has been placed in a cast, and he will be examined further today. 
If he is unable to play, he will be replaced in the starting lineup by senior 
Robert Claiborne. Raye, despite the injury, will continue to hold on 
placements. 
</P>
<P>
Raye, a 5-foot-8, 160-pound junior, is second on the team with 11 catches for 
162 yards.

half, giving Point Loma Nazarene (2-2-3) a 1-0 lead at halftime. 
</P>

In the second half, Cal Lutheran's Larry Kidley tied the score with a penalty 
kick and Jeff Dietrich scored the game-winner off a cornerkick.

Simpson, the only remaining semifinalist from last year's tournament, defeated 
Don Matheson of Ft. Worth, Tex., 2 and 1, and Dean Cassell of Charlotte, N.C., 
4 and 3. Simpson will play Warren Jones of San Mateo today.

Apparently the dress code for cocktail parties is in no danger of getting 
stale. Not when Ali MacGraw can wear blue jeans to the same party where Valeria 
Golino wears gray satin. They weren't the only ones testing the fashion limits 
Wednesday when Matthew Rolston, just named photographer of the year, invited

Michael Dawkins, owner of the M Gallery on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, 
tells us singer Janet Jackson dropped by to look for jewelry the other day. Her 
outfit was notable: "ripped jeans, a cropped T-shirt, dark glasses and a 
cellular phone," Dawkins says. Jackson actually found time to select a 
Dawkins-designed silver bangle and earrings, despite spending about 30 minutes 
on her phone, which, according to Dawkins, "would not stop ringing."

Scouting Out the New Looks 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared for the Boy Scouts of America's new uniforms to hit the streets 
this fall. It's all part of a continued effort to make scouting appear more 
attractive to boys who might think it's a tad too "geeky" for their tastes. 
Styled-up outfits will supplement, but not replace, the standard dress uniforms 
the boys now wear, says Don Rogers, who works in the organization's council 
services division at its Irving, Tex., headquarters. The new look -- a 
short-sleeved tan cotton dress shirt and matching shorts -- is for casual 
occasions and active sports. There's now a short-sleeve red dress shirt as 
well. As for changing the nerdy image, Lee Sneath, national spokesperson for 
the Boy Scouts of America, said the organization is gearing up to change it. 
"There will always be a faction of people who think scouting isn't cool. We 
want to present the fun side." 
</P>

<P>
I Don't Wanna Grow Up 
</P>
<P>
We know at least one grown-up who still likes to shop with his mother. It's 
twentysomething talk-show host Byron Allen, who took mother and executive 
producer, Carolyn Folks, along when he selected cool threads for his new 
Saturday night show on ABC. Sherman Oaks retailer Rick Pallack tells us Folks' 
input was "more like a friend's," and viewers have already seen some of the 
clothes. For Allen's first show, which included guests Whoopi Goldberg and 
Patti LaBelle, the music-minded comedian wore an oversized teal linen shirt, 
black-white-and-teal glen plaid jacket and black pleated, baggy trousers. Stay 
tuned, because Pallack says Allen, unlike others in his line of work, is not 
going to stick with just one look.

Zandra Rhodes has changed her hair -- from Day-Glo pink to aubergine. The 
richer -- dare we say more passionate -- red color seems to complement her 
Queen of Hearts dresses, including one she created in pink silk chiffon, tulle 
and ribbons for the Duchess of York. The hearts on the fabric she used for the 
duchess were most discreet, Rhodes explained at Neiman Marcus, where she 
presented her new styles. "They have to be," she said. "If you do something 
with hearts, it has to make a woman feel wonderful and not as if she's in fancy 
dress for Valentine's Day."

The Height of Fashion 
</P>
<P>
When actor Chris Lemmon flies, he travels in style -- aviator style, that is. 
On a recent Alaska Airlines run from Burbank to Portland, the star of the new 
Fox-TV sitcom "Open House" sprawled out in first class, National Lampoon 
magazine in hand, wearing kick-back jeans and T-shirt. Then, during a stopover 
in Oakland, Lemmon pulled on his jacket: a '40s-look, distressed-leather 
bomber. Now that's dressing for the occasion.

Model Citizens 
</P>
<P>
Add Alexander Julian's name to the list of fashion designers and retailers 
using "real" people (not models) in their ads. His national menswear promotion 
this fall features five Boston businessmen whose jobs range from bond salesman 
to software honcho to magazine marketing specialist. The men did not have to 
wear makeup or assume outrageous poses, but they did get free haircuts. 
Professional model shots, Julian said, "paled in comparison."

A PILGRIM'S JOURNEY OF RECONCILIATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Italian Days by Barbara Grizzuti Harrison (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: $19.95; 
494 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Not the kind of travel book to pack, but one to read before you go, "Italian 
Days" is a perceptive writer's thoughtful, strong-minded exploration of her 
background. She calls it "a journey of reconciliation," finally discovering 
"everything I feared and everything I loved." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the hegira covers four years during which Harrison lived for weeks 
at a time in Milan, Venice, Florence, and Rome; then journeyed to the 
Mezzogiorno, where the harsh realities of life are a stark contrast to the lush 
sophistication of the northern cities; continued to Molise and the Abruzzi, 
from which her mother's family emigrated to the United States; not stopping 
until she had seen Puglia and Calabria, the home of her father's people. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a tourist's book but a pilgrim's; a sometimes joyous, often arduous 
diary of a search for an essential self, recounted by a mature and 
sophisticated essayist. Though the Italy presented here is uniquely Harrison's, 
she shows readers the way to find their own. 
</P>
<P>
Her first stop is Milan, where Harrison feels she could be anywhere in the 
modern world, and her disappointment is palpable. She stayed for a month, her 
mood matching the gray, wet weather, her reactions muffled by the pervasive 
mist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Warmth, Vitality 
</P>
<P>
Living alone in an apartment, she attempts to submerge herself in the life of a 
city that seems to have no discernible personality. Polluted, dreary, 
expensive, rude -- Milan is the diametrical opposite of the warmth and vitality 
she expected. Nevertheless, she perseveres, conscientiously balancing her 
personal impressions with quotations from writers who found Milan a better and 
brighter place. 
</P>
<P>
The food, at least, is magnificent, and Harrison is briefly consoled by salads 
with "as many shades of green as a Persian garden," by the lightness and 
freshness of a cuisine that delights her, even when no other prospect pleases. 
On the four days when the sun shines, she glimpses a different place, but the 
month drags, the people she meets are jaded, shallow, extravagant, and she 
leaves with relief for Venice, having done more than her duty by Milan. 
</P>
<P>
But Venice is not an unalloyed joy either. "After three days, the magic may 
wear off and a dull disenchantment set in. . . . Turner's paintings of the 
place -- a fusion of light and dancing water in which solid objects are hinted 
at and float -- seems more like the place than the place itself, the actual 
touristed Venice a collection of snapshot cliches." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Harrison wisely does not overstay, setting off for Florence before 
her ambivalence can entirely taint her observations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beginnings of Discovery 
</P>
<P>
The glorious Tuscan landscape, seen from her train window, restores her 
spirits, and the Florentine segment of the book glows with aesthetic insight 
and historical lore. Harrison meets stimulating people and begins to discover 
the sources of Italian character. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, the author reaches full stride. There, for the first time, she feels 
as if she has come home, reveling in every impression, agreeing for the first 
time with the earlier observers she cites. To her, as to Montaigne, "Rome is a 
pleasant place to live in . . . I never tasted air more temperate for me or 
more suited to my constitution." The noise, smog and contemporary intrusions 
that so distressed her in Milan only seem to add to Rome's vitality and charm. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison is happy, and her joy illuminates the prose. The Piazza Colonna, where 
musicians once played in the shadow of the Column of Marcus Aurelius, has been 
turned into a car park, but even that desecration cannot spoil Harrison's 
pleasure in watermelon gelato with seeds made of bitter chocolate. She's found 
the secret of the Italian character. 
</P>
<P>
"You are becoming so tolerant in Rome," a friend says. "It amounts almost to a 
vice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready for Anything 
</P>
<P>
By the time the author arrives in Naples, she's ready for everything the 
Mezzogiorno can show her; prepared for her long-deferred encounter with the 
Italian relatives she's never known, the family who lives not just in another 
country, but almost in another dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Though she continues to augment her own comments with excerpts from a variety 
of sources, this section of the book becomes increasingly emotional; the 
meetings with relations unsettling, astonishing and wonderfully rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
After this, Puglia, at the very tip of the Italian boot, seems "fairyland," and 
the mysterious stone structures called trulli become the lasting symbol of 
Harrison's extended journey. 
</P>
<P>
"In my dreams of trulli, the cones are made of crystal . . . ancient women 
dressed in black come out of the trulli; they wear Coptic crosses and Oriental 
turbans; they look like my grandmother."

'DRY SEASON' A POTENT LOOK AT SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Dry White Season" (at the AMC Century 14) moves so swiftly, catching you up 
into its hellish chain of events, that you're left reeling. That's exactly the 
effect it should have, for no other contemporary mainstream film takes us so 
deeply, so unflinchingly, into the tragically divided heart of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
It combines the artistry of "A World Apart" with the scope of "Cry Freedom" and 
also manages to generate the kind of suspense that brings back fond memories of 
that definitive political thriller, Costa-Gavras' "Z." It is in all ways a 
superior achievement, the very model of what a protest film ought to be, 
involving and entertaining, angry rather than preachy. 
</P>
<P>
In bringing Andre Brink's novel to the screen, producer Paula Weinstein and 
writer-director Euzhan Palcy pull absolutely no punches; they lay bare the 
limitless evil of apartheid for the whole world to see. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which was shot largely in Zimbabwe, opens with the Soweto uprising of 
1976. A bright adolescent, Jonathan (Bekhithemba Mpofu) insists on joining a 
student demonstration against second-rate education for blacks, despite the 
fears of his father Gordon (Winston Ntshona). Jonathan's brave decision 
triggers seemingly endless and ever-widening tragic consequences, and 
eventually involves his father's employer, Afrikaner schoolteacher and former 
rugby star Ben du Toit (Donald Sutherland), who lives in a Johannesburg suburb 
that could pass for one of the nicest areas of Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Right off, Palcy defines the vast difference between the white and black worlds 
by relentlessly cutting back and forth between the slaughter of black children 
in Soweto and a white children's happy rugby match, in which Du Toit's son 
Johan (Rowen Elmes) participates. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Cry Freedom," "A Dry White Season" centers on a white South African's 
gradual loss of naivete and growing commitment to the struggle against 
apartheid. But it does so with more economy, more dispatch, and illuminates the 
Afrikaner psyche as no other fiction film has. 
</P>
<P>
Unsparingly, but without lingering morbidity, Palcy shows us the atrocities 
with which whites afflict blacks on the flimsiest of pretexts. Then she allows 
us to understand how and why this occurs so endlessly. The Afrikaner society 
Palcy depicts with such conviction sustains itself on a lethal mixture of fear 
and indifference. 
</P>
<P>
We see that Jurgen Prochnow's steely Special Branch captain is not merely a 
sadist but is also consumed with fear, just as Du Toit's wife (Janet Suzman) 
is. These two really believe that South Africa is their country and that they 
are at war with the black majority, who they are certain would surely destroy 
them given the chance. It's this terrible fear that permits the most 
unspeakable torture and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the whites live in considerable comfort, pursuing a stable, 
settled way of life with a strong sense of community that insulates them from 
the horrible realities the blacks must endure from cradle to grave. "A Dry 
White Season's" key accomplishment is to make believable that a decent, 
intelligent and loving family man like Du Toit could have reached middle age 
and still be able to deceive himself as to the true condition of the blacks and 
the brutal treatment routinely accorded them. 
</P>
<P>
Palcy is able to convey all this and more because she and her co-writer, Colin 
Welland, have written from Brink's 1979 novel a remarkably succinct yet 
comprehensive and multilayered script, one of the year's best. To be sure, 
there are sharp exchanges over apartheid throughout the film, but the effect 
escapes preachiness because the film has such a fullness of life. 
</P>
<P>
Escalating slaughter culminates in an inquest, which brings Marlon Brando into 
the picture at just the right moment. He is there not merely to defend good 
against evil but to give us some respite. Magnificently bulky, he plays a 
brilliant, eccentric barrister of as much wit and humor as courage. In his 
first film in eight years, Brando fills the screen with his presence, providing 
a showy, pivotal distraction, allowing the film to shift gears from fiery 
expose to suspense thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 From this superbly constructed plot, we are able to see that one loving father 
and son -- Ben and Johan -- are gradually taking the places of another loving 
father and son, Gordon and Jonathan. This is what commitment to change really 
means: risking being subjected to all the dangers, injustice and suffering of 
those who have been so systematically victimized. It is in this melding of two 
worlds, so long deliberately separated, that "A Dry, White Season" becomes so 
stunning an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a false note in the performances Palcy has elicited from a large 
and varied cast, which includes Susan Sarandon as a tough-minded journalist; 
Zakes Mokae as a canny, sarcastic black taxi driver who serves as Du Toit's 
conscience; Thoko Ntshinga as Gordon's distraught but determined wife, and 
Susannah Harker as Du Toit's grown daughter who wishes that everything could 
get back to "normal." 
</P>
<P>
"A Dry White Season" represents the high point of Donald Sutherland's career. 
Never before has he had a part that demanded such range. Of his many splendid 
moments is one in which lets us know he is being betrayed by someone he loves. 
Refreshingly, the romance between Sutherland and Sarandon that would be 
obligatory in a lesser film is resisted here. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the Martinique-born Palcy made a terrific feature debut with 
"Sugar Cane Alley," an intimate West Indian film of much charm and grit about a 
grandmother determined that her bright grandson will escape the grueling 
existence of a sugar-cane worker. "A Dry White Season" (rated R for violence) 
is only her second feature, but working on an epic scale -- and in English -- 
she displays the assurance of a David Lean.

'BLACK RAIN' A BLAST OF FIERY RAZZLE-DAZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Black Rain" (citywide), director Ridley Scott and his team pump in so much 
pyrotechnic razzle-dazzle that the movie becomes a triumph of matter over mind. 
It's a blast of pure sensation, shallow but scintillating, like a great rock 
melody, superbly produced, where the music pumps you up even as the lyrics drag 
you down. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain" focuses on a macho cop from Manhattan who runs head-first into two sides 
of modern Japan: the rigid formalities on top, the crazy danger of the 
underworld below. It's more movie culture-clash, with Michael Douglas' rude and 
surly Nick Conklin, the ultimate fish out of water, trying to blast his way 
through an Asian sea of red tape to recover an extradited murderer, while the 
city around him becomes the movie's dominant character. 
</P>
<P>
This material has rich potential. It suggests current American paranoia about 
Japan's emerging economic supremacy, as well as the skewed modern visions of 
the new high-tech Orient in Juzo Itami films like "The Funeral" or "A Taxing 
Woman." But the story is standard '80s shtick: boy meets killer, boy loses 
killer, boy gets killer. The screenwriters, Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis, 
show little inspiration. They seem to have transplanted bodily Don Siegel's 
1968 "Coogan's Bluff" -- in which Clint Eastwood was a brusque Arizona lawman 
chasing a crazy extradited criminal all over New York -- and juiced it up with 
a lot of yakuza movie bits and a doomed cop buddy named Charlie (Andy Garcia). 
Charlie figures in the script's nadir of invention, a dopey scene where he 
plays torero with his jacket to a gang of maniacal motorcycle punks. 
</P>
<P>
The yakuza references are deliberate. Ken Takakura, the Eastwood of that genre, 
is cast here as the representative of old-style Japanese decency and honor: a 
cop assigned to help Conklin. He seems to be the only sane man in the entire 
movie, the foil for Conklin's belching rage and his what-the-hell approach to 
law enforcement. Takakura plays him with dignity and restraint -- even when he 
and Andy Garcia do their big male-bonding number, a duet to Ray Charles' 
"What'd I Say" in an Osaka nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott and his visual team -- including cinematographer Jan De Bont and 
production designer Norris Spencer -- give this unimaginative plot a dazzling, 
dangerous, overwhelming surface. The images seem to explode right in your face: 
a coruscating cabaret street that looks like pop Dante, towering angular 
skyscrapers poking like huge computer blocks into a misty black-night sky 
aflame with neon, a factory shooting off iridescent sparks, a weird modernistic 
golf range jutting over the edge of the city, huge plumes of Scott's trademark 
mist spilling out into the black, rain-slickened streets. 
</P>
<P>
Scott may have composed more knock-out frames per movie than any other modern 
director, and "Black Rain" knocks your eyes out all over again. It's 
hellaciously gorgeous. Much of this movie was actually shot in Osaka, but 
somehow Scott seems to have found part of the world he helped imagine in "Blade 
Runner": a huge, multimedia hybrid of a city that promiscuously smears together 
West and East. 
</P>
<P>
In "Blade Runner," Scott, Laurence Paull and Jordan Cronenweth seemed to have 
invented a new visual style: a kind of film noir refracted through the 
voluptuously mechanical imagery of movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey." It 
became film noir cubed: a world in which night, rain, rot and melancholy 
shadows mingled with blazing neon and super-electronic gadgetry, where those 
dark "Citizen Kane" camera angles had gone kaleidoscopic and hot. Here, Scott 
re-creates the same kind of imagery, minus the rot. You don't watch this movie, 
you get drenched in it. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who's played great, smooth, shifty slicksters in his last two movies 
-- the stock-manipulator Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street" and the adulterous 
lawyer of "Fatal Attraction" -- seems to be liberated here. He gets to snarl at 
everyone, wear leather and get gutty, honest, and low-down. It's a big, sexy, 
swaggeringly self-confident movie-star performance, and it plays nicely against 
the crisp, knife-like work of Garcia, Takakura, Yusaku Matsuda (the young 
killer) and the others. 
</P>
<P>
But Nick isn't really a character. He's another archetype, a stubble-faced 
superman who's usually right and whose battering-ram tactics are better suited 
to running down psychos than the slow-but-steady style of the local police. 
It's hard to take seriously the idea, which the movie suggests, that he's 
learned anything from this culture -- other than to be fond of Ken Takakura -- 
because the cops we see are tradition-bound fuddy-duddies and the yakuzas are 
weirdos or rich, conniving scum, and the only girl Nick flirts with is Kate 
Capshaw as a bar hostess from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Rain" is not an anti-Japanese film. (The title, which Shohei Imamura 
also used for his most recent film, refers to the rain that poured on 
Hiroshima.) But it suffers from the same problem as 90% of the big movie 
thrillers these days. It divides its characters between the superhuman, the 
inhuman and the irrelevant -- with an occasional Kate Capshaw. The movie's 
penultimate scene, its idea of a grand ethical resolution, works viscerally 
because of the force of the editing and the grandiose bravura of the last big 
action scene. But it's feeble on reflection: more market-researched morality 
from the Jaffe-Lansing producing team. 
</P>
<P>
Still, action movies are one genre where cliches can be transcended and 
execution can triumph over content. That's what happens here. "Black Rain" 
(MPAA-rated R for sex, violence and language) has a sheen and pace that puts it 
in the high class of glossy new urban thrillers like "RoboCop," "Die Hard" and 
"True Believer": mad, overheated, overviolent movies that keep driving up over 
the top and taking you with them. Ridley Scott makes you see the world in new 
ways. When he and his colleagues are cooking visually, they're in a class by 
themselves. Even with an albatross of an action script around their necks, they 
can make the world hot, fantastic, wild, make the ragged skies split open, make 
hell come raining down.

Cross Michael Jackson's greatest-hits album off your Christmas wish list. The 
release has been pushed back to next year. A source at Epic Records, Jackson's 
label, says the performer has written a lot of new songs and wants to finish 
recording them all before choosing several to include in the package. There is 
a possibility that more than two or three new songs will be included in the 
multi-record set, but there are no official plans for an entire new album at 
this time. ALEENE MacMINN

South Coast Repertory is one of seven theaters -- and one of only two outside 
of New York -- to snag a chunk of the $300,000 that will be provided for the 
production of six new plays as part of AT&amp;T's "New Plays for the '90s 
Project." The Costa Mesa theater will receive $50,000 for its staging of Howard 
Korder's "Search and Destroy," scheduled to open Jan. 12. The winning entries 
were selected from proposals submitted by 35 theaters. ALEENE MacMINN

"Knots Landing" star Kevin Dobson found himself on the run when he visited Skid 
Row this week, but for a different reason. On his way to donate secondhand 
clothes to the Midnight Mission, he was confronted by a knife-wielding 
transient. He broke free as two mission employees came to his aid, and police 
arrested the attacker. Dobson is a regular donor to the shelter. ALEENE MacMINN

LE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHINING LESS BRIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has success spoiled Le Cirque? Well, of course not, Jean-Claude. 
</P>
<P>
Spoiled isn't the word for this French Canadian company of upscale mountebanks 
who only last Sunday won, of all things, an Emmy (in a four-way tie for 
Outstanding Special Event). 
</P>
<P>
Why, the mere sight of Le Cirque du Soleil's encampment as you approach Santa 
Monica Pier is a boon for smog-sore eyes. There's still nothing under the 
soleil quite as enchanting as that sparkling blue and gold tent on the beach 
and the palpable excitement that surrounds this magickal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
But an enterprise is what it has become much more in the brief span of two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
And the changes are subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Le Cirque's founder, Guy Laliberte, for instance, is now listed as president 
and CEO of Les Productions du Cirque du Soleil Inc. (the italics are ours). An 
overlong preamble to the start of the show, included a welcoming address by 
Laliberte that belonged in the boardroom. Saperlipopette, owners of the Loews 
Hotels, a Cirque sponsor, were even introduced! The faintly acrid smell of all 
that billowing dry ice -- a Cirque staple -- has become laced with a soupcon of 
corporate je ne sais quoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Le Cirque's splendid redefinition of the very idea of circus (one 
ring, excellence and only human animals), marketing shrewdness and general 
acumen have distinguished this Quebecois company since it took local audiences 
by surprise as the spectacular opening act of the Los Angeles Festival in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And a lot has happened since, most of it very good for Le Cirque. But how good 
is good? The show Wednesday was heavy on clowning and short one of its key 
first-act attractions: the Shandong Acrobatic Troupe of the People's Republic 
of China. Red tape, not politics, has allegedly delayed the troupe in China, 
according to a Cirque spokesman. Amazingly -- and unforgivably -- no 
announcement was made about it to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of slapstick comedy was offered as a substitute, between ring master 
James Keylon (new) and Le Cirque's resident clown Benny Le Grand, master of the 
active garden hose (a return engagement of dubious hilarity). 
</P>
<P>
It didn't quite cut the moutarde, in spite of Le Grand's soaking and smearing 
of one patron and his ruining of another's necktie. 
</P>
<P>
(Are we having fun yet? . . .) 
</P>
<P>
Le Cirque's real strengths lie elsewhere: in the superiority of their specialty 
acts (the superb young jugglers, gymnasts, cyclists, trapeze artists, 
aerialists and contortionists) and Le Cirque's exceptional, extraterrestrial 
special effects; the resplendent, rainbow-hued costuming by Michel Crete and 
Dominique Lemieux; the fantasy lighting by Luc Lafortune, and Rene Dupere's 
striking original music, under the adroit musical direction of Benoit Jutras. 
</P>
<P>
While the second half of the evening was considerably livelier than the first, 
there were still not as many breathtaking acts as one remembered from past 
incarnations. True, the French trapezistes are terrific (despite a couple of 
well-recovered fumbles), but no better than the trapezistes of 1987. Bulgarian 
acrobatic dancers Maia Taskova and Mariela Spasova do nice things with 
streamers and hoops and balls, and Frederic Zipperlin's contortionist juggling 
(with spheres of all sizes) is admirable, but not nearly as amazing as the 
contortions of Angela Laurier in Le Cirque's 1988 visit. These new acts' 
overall level of competence appears down a notch from the company's formerly 
uncontested A+ level. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it is the older routines that continue to dazzle most: gymnasts 
Eric Varelas and Amelie Demay; the daredevil cyclists, the balancing chairs, 
the teeterboard act of the "businessmen penguins." 
</P>
<P>
The fruit of too much success? Perhaps. Or is it simply that when Gilles Ste. 
Croix replaced Guy Caron as artistic director the sensibilities changed? That's 
more likely. But it's all remediable, and the arrival of the Shandong Acrobats 
on Tuesday will probably do much to relieve this malaise. 
</P>
<P>
Le Cirque is still a remarkable entertainment. It's just that we all know by 
now how remarkable it can be and won't settle for less. So cut the comedy and 
get on with the acts, because this time you walk out humming the scenery, 
lights and, naturellement, the music. 
</P>
<P>
Good but not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the big top on the beach at the Santa Monica Pier, Tuesdays through 
Thursdays, 8 p.m.; Fridays, 9:30 p.m.; Saturdays, 4:30 and 8:30 p.m.; Sundays,

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: LIFE'S RHYTHMS ABOUND IN ART AND POEMS AT 
PALOMAR COLLEGE'S BOEHM GALLERY EXHIBIT

Complementary neighbors fill the two halves of Palomar College's Boehm Gallery 
this month. Ernest Silva's paintings and mixed-media constructions exude a 
seriousness laced with humor, while the poems oD. Snodgrass and accompanying 
etchings by DeLoss McGraw titter with whimsy and just an edge of darkness. Both 
shows embody a balance of tension and release that mimics life's own rhythms, 
and both toss out puns and punch lines when the mood turns excessively somber. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, who teaches at UC San Diego, uses symbols and surrogates to speak of the 
individual's perilous journey through time in his show, titled "The Rogue's 
Gallery." Natural disasters and other vague, extenuating circumstances always 
seem to mire this passage toward knowledge, enlightenment or artistic 
self-realization, but the journey persists. Silva evokes this image of the 
individual coursing through life in the form of a small, slat-framed canoe, 
subjected to tumult after tumult, but enduring with stoicism and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
In "Voyage Above the Volcano," a cone of wound, tied and tangled wooden rods 
spits up loops of blue. A small, red canoe bobs innocently in the eruption, 
askew but intact. "Errant Ship, Night Storm" sets the boat on its end within a 
cyclone of slim blue coils. A man's hat, smudged with black and blue paint, 
dangles from the lower end, toward the floor, residue of the lost soul tossed 
and dismissed by the sea's fury. 
</P>
<P>
"Lighthouse" extends the metaphor by juxtaposing the canoe, enmeshed in 
calligraphic coils, with a painting of a lighthouse. The boat balances on a low 
gold table, set between two handcrafted wooden chairs. Its tenuous journey 
takes place in the real space of life, while the lighthouse, seductive beacon 
of safety and security, remains elusive, an image on the wall far from physical 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Though subjected to stress and strain, the canoe never splinters, cracks or 
shatters from the pressure. Like the voyage and the voyager it represents, it 
simply endures. The solitude of the journey is echoed in Silva's painting "A 
Planet Alone, in a Sky Alone," a gloriously hued portrait of a man staring 
pensively before the sea. A coral moon hovers in the violet-stained sky, 
casting a luminous glow on the man's cheek and neck. Insistent strokes and 
cross-strokes of black and violet shadow the other side of his face. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's gestural, impassioned brush strokes come to mind here, as do 
Picasso's fractured female faces in another of Silva's works, "Heart of 
Darkness." Silva's self-consciousness as an artist working in a long and 
hallowed tradition surfaces frequently in this work, all from 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
His "Self-Portrait" invites symbolic interpretation of his identity. A canoe is 
central, of course, docked atop a yellow chest of drawers -- container of 
memories, histories, the artist's raw materials. A house-shaped cage perches 
atop the boat, a tie suspended from its front wall and a faux corn-cob pipe 
protruding from it as well. A painter's palette hangs within the cage, as if a 
compulsion to create, trapped within the artist's body. 
</P>
<P>
Like all of Silva's work here, the "Self-Portrait" is painted using mostly 
primary colors and black and white. Within this limited range, Silva conjures 
highly evocative sights and scenes. In his artist's statement, he cites the 
influence of Clyfford Still's "jagged nocturnal vision," as well as the 
symbolic narratives that materialize in his own dreams. Silva's work has the 
power to beget yet more dreams, a testament to the subtle power of his vision 
and the trance-like effect of his flickering black and blue seas. 
</P>
<P>
Across the gallery, the words of W. D. Snodgrass engage in a gentle volley with 
the images of DeLoss McGraw. The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet serves softly but 
with surprising bite, and the Southern California artist responds in kind, with 
a smile framed in the color of blood. Snodgrass and McGraw's collaboration 
began in 1981 with a letter from the artist to the author. It has thrived ever 
since, because of an obvious affinity of spirit and the freedom, as Snodgrass 
has put it, to misunderstand each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight Carnival" represents their most recent endeavor, a book of 10 poems 
and 10 etchings published last year by San Diego's Brighton Press. As in their 
earlier collaboration, "A Colored Poem," published in 1985 and also shown here, 
the works in "Midnight Carnival" act "in dialogue" with each other. The words, 
as much as the images, float, bounce, frolic and ponder their way through 10 
familiar facets of a carnival -- the hall of mirrors, the fire-breather, the 
high-wire act, the alluring carnival girl, the tattooed man. 
</P>
<P>
Snodgrass meanders through the melee -- the fears, fantasies and dampened 
dreams that descend upon a new town every week. McGraw's visual slices of the 
feast don't always match Snodgrass' in depth and poignancy, but, with only a 
few well-placed hues, they can push the tone from fantastic to phantasmic or 
from whimsical to wry. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw takes total liberty with his subjects, twisting their arms into loops 
and pinching their cheeks to bright crimson orbs. Like Snodgrass, however, his 
childlike frivolity and extravagance with form is tempered by the knowing -- or 
at least suspecting -- despair of adults. This dualism of frolicking and 
foreboding forms is discussed in an astute foreword to the book by Robert L. 
Pincus and is epitomized by the mix of dark mystery and radiant fun in the 
book's own title, "Midnight Carnival." 
</P>
<P>
A poetry reading by Snodgrass will be held in the gallery (1140 W. Mission 
Road, San Marcos) at 7 p.m. Oct. 6. The shows continue through Oct. 11.

WELLMAN'S 'ALBANIAN SOFTSHOE' TAPS INTO ANOTHER LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perplexity am what rules in Mac Wellman's "Albanian Softshoe" at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre; a play with its own grammar book, star chart and tide table. 
</P>
<P>
The setting turns out to be deep space, where matter and anti-matter can set up 
strange reflections of what's real. But Wellman sets his first act in an 
American-style living room where things are only slightly askew. The Danish 
flatware, for instance, has gone limp, a victim of "metal fatigue." That could 
happen, couldn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Then we're transported to the moons of Saturn, which seem inhabited largely by 
frowning, freezing Albanians. Our heroes (the wives in the suburban segment -- 
Darla Cash and Jan Leslie Harding) become involved in a quest for a 
900-year-old wizard named Pancake. They carry a talismanic cheese, which may 
not be the "real" cheese. But then Pancake (Damon Bryant) may not be the real 
pancake. 
</P>
<P>
What is going on here? More than just a lot of "flapdoodle," I think, although 
the word does come up in the text more than once, along with "hoohah." It's as 
if Wellman is trying to forestall the verdict of his more literal-minded 
listeners -- who do have a right to complain. There's a stretch in the middle 
of the show where the wordplay gets tedious, for all the fun that Douglas 
Jacobs and Michael Roth's players are having with it. They don't seem 
self-indulgent, but their lines do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I liked "Albanian Softshoe" more than I didn't like it. To begin with, it 
is not the same old thing. Wellman shows us what he thinks of the same old 
thing in the suburban sequence -- the play's foyer, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
What's being played with here isn't just the code of soap opera ("More 
coffee?") but the American faith in the pursuit of happiness. Cash, Harding and 
Tony Simotes have a brilliant triple spiel where they bemoan the fulfillment 
that they have been cheated out of and are determined to get -- three mynah 
birds saying "me, me, me." 
</P>
<P>
On the moons of Saturn, another mind-set prevails. This is the world of the 
tribe, where I do what "custom" tells me to do, a world of vendettas and blood 
guilt, where every legend has a "terrible" ending. 
</P>
<P>
The nonsense here is ritual nonsense, and Wellman can't have as much fun with 
it as in the American section, because what it represents has so much weight. 
When his tribe sits down to tell stories, they do so with real gravity, 
pointless as some of their stories are. 
</P>
<P>
"Sky full of things in X/Sky full of other things in Y." We register the 
difference, and that alone would make the play more than flapdoodle. 
</P>
<P>
But there's also Wellman's delight in language. "Albanian Softshoe" feels as if 
it were written on the command of the author's unconscious, with his censor 
bound and gagged in the next room. As in Shakespeare, the words have a contour 
that doesn't depend on their meaning, which arrives an instant after they do, 
like spray from a crashing wave. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Wellman goes in for ringing pentameters. He would rather wrench the 
language apart, to explore how curiously an English sentence can go and still 
make a kind of sense. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce McKenzie is particularly felicitous here, as a spiky-haired 
message-bearer named Wingfoot. (The play is full of messages, riddles, charms 
and spells.) At first glance it's astonishing that McKenzie and the rest of the 
company have no trouble with this wayward, complicated text. But at second 
glance it's perfectly clear why they don't: It's a kick to stand the language 
on its ear. 
</P>
<P>
"Albanian Softshoe" also profits from a smashing physical production -- Michael 
Roth's wide-screen set, Brenda Berry's intergalactic lighting and a mountain of 
costumes from Clare Henkel, sometimes witty (the price tag hanging from the 
lounge suit in the suburban section), but often as harsh as the winter cold. 
Although off the wall, "Albanian Softshoe" is never totally a softshoe, and 
that's its salvation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Intelligence, droll humor and considerable theatrical adroitness are the major 
charms of Alice B. Theatre, a Seattle-based gay and lesbian performance group 
that opened Wednesday night at Highways in Santa Monica for a five-day run. 
</P>
<P>
Associate artistic director Susan Finque is easily the group's most compelling 
actor. In one of the tart black-out sketches that make up "Portrait of Iowa," 
she is a matron in a dowdy dress who talks wistfully about the things she looks 
forward to: birthday parties, summer camp, Fridays . . . and love with another 
woman. With her arms plastered demurely to her sides, Finque creates a rounded 
character with the pucker in her mouth, the lift of her chin and the honest 
appeal in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In excerpts from her own "T.S./Crossing" -- a restless, deliberately 
self-conscious undermining of conventional notions of sexual identity -- Finque 
begins with a display of rippling musculature and tensile poses as she sits 
topless with her back to the audience. Eventually, she dons a man's suit, and 
delivers the monologue of an up-tight family man with uncannily convincing body 
language. 
</P>
<P>
The teaser is a selection of walks -- woman as man, man as woman, woman as man 
as woman -- offered up to the audience as so many actor's tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Rick Rankin's "Attack of the Zombie Back-Up Singers" features 
him as a fast-talking guy in a white coat telling the campily baroque title 
story with the aid of a flip chart. Larry Lefler is a vamping zombie in white 
formal gloves and a sequined dress. The piece is a hoot until the end, when a 
hokey set of metaphors lumbers in. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth company member, appearing in "Portrait," is Timothy Jones. His 
delivery is often forced, as if he has heard his lines before and doesn't quite 
believe them. CATHY CURTIS

<P>
We've known Marc Pally as the creator of lush, teeming universes of 
deliberately disjunctive organic forms. Now it appears he also can be a 
devil-may-care provocateur. If this new approach lacks the romantic near-chaos 
of Pally's previous work, it still has a raffish appeal. In "Group Show," for 
example, a wall of 58 small oval and rectangular paintings recycle '80s sayings 
("slow growth"), allude to subjects in the news ("junk bonds") and quote 
adspeak ("early-bird special"). 
</P>
<P>
Day-Glo and eccentric colors, busy patterns, goopy textures and various styles 
of lettering keep everything puttering along. But the joke is the way the 
visual-aural static nearly overwhelms allusions to a famous art critic and a 
couple of artists. 
</P>
<P>
In still other works, like "Weak Link," Pally adds painted words -- vile data, 
cash flow, zero gain -- to his language of images. The words give the paintings 
a new stridency and pointed social relevance, threatening to destroy the 
delicate ecological balance of the imagery. But Pally has taught us how to 
intuit seeming disarray and imbalance as a map of the mind's wanderings. Given 
the context, the angular metallic designs in "Weak Link" read as ornaments 
produced by an ancient civilization; white dots on black leaf forms suggest 
that mold may be setting in now. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a disappointing experiment -- silver paintings textured 
with bumpy vegetative forms and celestial bursts -- the remainder of the 
exhibit shows Pally in firm control, a painterly Prospero commanding the 
spirits of his rich and strange visual territory. (Rosamund Felsen, 669 N. La 
Cienega Blvd., to Oct. 7.) CATHY CURTIS

After a good rain, colors, contrasts and contours seem to snap with clarity. 
This is the vision that Astrid Preston brings to her paintings of tree-lined 
roads, cityscapes, verdant woods and valleys. Whatever the subject or quality 
of light, Preston gives her landscapes the almost too-sharp look of a 
hallucination. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of architects, Preston began by making funny little houses from 
clear geometric shapes in aluminum. The work was about shape, line and form as 
well as symbolic meanings of shelter. Later she began painting familiar Santa 
Monica streets that we could not imagine anyone strolling on, followed by 
strangely beautiful houses painted at night that we could not imagine anyone 
living in. 
</P>
<P>
Current works continue to push the landscape genre a few more notches away from 
strict realism. Large canvases are organized into broad sweeping roads that 
recede quickly toward the background, pulling us toward an unknown destination. 
Preston brings incandescent blue skies down to meet roads lined with dark 
bushes and trees. Palms mix illogically with pines, night light mingles with 
seering sun all in the same canvas. Many scenes are dotted with pockets of 
unexplained light, as if some person hiding in the scene were shining a lamp 
out toward the intruding viewer. 
</P>
<P>
There are no overt references to geometry and architecture in these 
increasingly mature works, but you still sense structure in tight composition 
and graceful execution, and you still sense a Hopperesque comment on alienation 
in the lush lime-green knolls that invite us in only to hold us at arm's 
length. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to Sept 30.) MARLENA DONOHUE

A romantic cocoon surrounds Ciel Bergman's newest paintings of huge irises. 
They stand amid pink watery landscapes daubed with touches of color and swirls 
of spinning line. Long horizontal canvases sliced by color into tall vertical 
segments, they frequently make clever plays with space but lean dangerously 
close to decorative sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
What slows the drift into cloying affability is the artist's casual, assured 
drawing and assertive elements like the dark and light circles in "Still and 
Still Moving." On this canvas two pairs of orbs, white and black, red and 
green, hover like strange mirrored moons above an alien yellow horizon. Solid 
shapes and bold color are welcome anchors for form and meaning in the pastel 
never-never land that haunts so many of these paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Leon's plywood constructions are less dreamy, earthier landscapes. His 
impressive "Rockface" sculptures are towering pseudo-mountain ranges or rounded 
hunks of cliff face held together with screws and glue. Part stage-set 
illusion, part straightforward materials, they improbably convey a sense of 
dense mass as well as something of a painterly, tactile antiquity. Moving 
around the two free-standing wood mountain forms is like walking through the 
stacked space of a Chinese brush and ink landscape to touch the distant 
mountains. (Dorothy Goldeen Gallery, 1547 9th St., to Oct. 9.). SUVAN GEER

When Jeff Price turns a human torso into a bronze sack strung up like a desert 
water gourd, he stretches the form into new, sometimes disturbing realms of 
sculptural and psychological investigation. Akin to Peter Shelton's formalized, 
objectified human forms, Price's transmogrified body parts are more sexual and 
visceral. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat haphazardly this exhibit traces Price's evolution of organic forms 
through various stages of development. From piece to piece dangling 
scrotum-like forms become stretched, weighted bags that wind up suggesting 
female lower torsos. The impact of this transformation is felt most keenly in 
the rough, massive bronze sculpture "Census," a wall-pinned phallus that hangs 
from a steel peg like a gigantic, heat-warped bottle opener with buns. Next to 
this kind of overwhelming physicality Price's paintings retreat into soft 
peddled intellectualizations. The drawings feel more immediate but substitute 
elegant mutation for primal force. (Newspace, 5241 Melrose Ave., to Oct. 7.)

'SOUND + VISION' = BOWIE RETROSPECTIVE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We're going to do what we can with the material that we now do," an anxious 
British singer says on a home demo tape that he made in 1969 to showcase his 
new songs for record executives. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it has been considered 'single' material, but we'll leave that up to 
you to sort out. . . . Anyway, the first one is called 'Space Oddity.' " 
</P>
<P>
The artist was David Bowie and the song -- the melancholy tale of an astronaut 
marooned in space -- went on to launch one of the most provocative and 
influential careers of the modern pop-rock era. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Bowie's spectacular new "Sound + Vision" retrospective box set 
begins with this home tape rather than the polished studio version of "Space 
Oddity" underscores the boldness and ambition of this Rykodisc package. 
</P>
<P>
The set, which is due in stores Monday, is the first installment in Rykodisc's 
campaign to introduce in CD all 18 of Bowie's RCA albums -- the most 
anticipated CD campaign since Capitol began its Beatles CD series in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
RCA released CDs of most of Bowie's albums in 1984, but the label dropped them 
from its catalogue the following year when the CD rights reverted to Bowie and 
his former management company. The new Rykodisc albums -- expected to be 
released at the rate of one or two a month starting early next year -- have 
been remastered for CD and will feature previously unreleased material in most 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Sound + Vision" is both a teasing introduction to what is ahead and a 
carefully designed summary of an artist who is a cinch to be named to the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible for induction in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The package contains three 60-minute discs plus a bonus disc containing three 
previously unreleased live numbers from Bowie's 1972 "Ziggy Stardust" tour and 
his 1980 video of "Ashes to Ashes." The latter can be seen, of course, only on 
machines that have CDV or laser capability. The "Ashes to Ashes" audio alone 
can be heard on any CD player. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Rykodisc said the company expects to ship about 100,000 
copies of "Sound + Vision" in the CD format (suggested retail price: $59.98), 
about 40,000 in cassette form ($44.98) and 15,000 in vinyl ($69.98). The bonus 
disc will only be in the CD packages. The vinyl set costs more than the CD -- a 
rarity indeed -- because of the cost of manufacturing six high-grade vinyl 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Loder, a former Rolling Stone writer and now MTV's news anchorman, may be 
overstating it when he suggests in a 72-page booklet that comes with the 
Rykodisc set that without Bowie, the '70s "might have been a fairly pathetic 
decade." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bowie brought an urgency and ambition to rock in the early '70s that 
established him as the first great rock star of the decade. He re-asserted the 
importance of ideas and personality in rock at a time when performers were 
becoming increasingly anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the more than four dozen selections on the CDs have appeared on record, 
but there is some unreleased material. The latter includes a version of Bruce 
Springsteen's "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" recorded during the 1975 
"Station to Station" sessions. 
</P>
<P>
As these selections show, Bowie was -- and continues to be -- a frustratingly 
inconsistent record maker, yet "Sound + Vision" captures marvelously the 
constant tension of someone struggling to explore his own emotions and 
distinguish himself as an artist.

SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS OFFER GOOD REASON TO SLEEP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past few years, Saturday morning cartoons have undergone a minor 
renaissance. The appearance of "The Gummi Bears," "My Pet Monster," "A Pup 
Named Scooby-Doo" and "The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" seemed to promise a 
happier era of higher standards in children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
But the new shows for the 1989-90 season, which debuted on the past two 
Saturdays, break that promise: Parents will need a post-hole digger to find the 
standards used in making them. These series suggest a return to the bad old 
days of the '70s, when storytelling in cartoons vanished like the vitamins 
Uncle Ben supposedly sealed into rice, and "animation" meant images that were 
drawn, rather than images that moved. 
</P>
<P>
This decline can be attributed to a number of factors: the falling value of the 
dollar and the concomitant rise in overseas production costs; breakneck 
production schedules; reduced network license fees on Saturday morning; the 
limits that anti-violence pressure groups have placed on slapstick comedy and 
dramatic conflict. But assigning blame doesn't alter the result: American 
children are getting inferior entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an overview of the new Saturday morning lineup -- and it seems 
appropriate that the same word would be used to describe this array of shows 
and suspected criminals. 
</P>
<P>
NBC Programs 
</P>
<P>
"Camp Candy." A formula cartoon sitcom with a caricature of John Candy ineptly 
riding herd on a standard assortment of smart-mouth kids. There's a snooty 
Valley Girl, a "cool" boy ("Dude!"), a nerdy little boy with glasses, a tomboy 
obviously modeled after Peppermint Patty. Although billed as a "live 
action/animated comedy," there was no live action in the first episode -- and 
precious little comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain N: The Game Master." A formula cartoon adventure about Kevin, a 
teen-aged boy who somehow gets sucked into an animated world of computer games. 
Naturally he's a whiz at Nintendo games, and uses his skills to aid beautiful 
Princess Lana in her battle against the evil Mother Brain, a disembodied 
monster whose voice sounds like a Little Richard album played at about 30 
r.p.m. This premise has been used before ("TRON," "The Last Starfighter"), but 
all these characters seem to do is plug the various games. 
</P>
<P>
"The Karate Kid." This cheapo adventure based on the popular films ranks as the 
worst new show of the season. The first episode had Daniel, Mr. Miyagi and a 
girl named Taki rafting down the Amazon in pursuit of a magical "shrine." How 
they got to South America, where Taki came from and the source of the shrine's 
powers, were never explained. A more significant puzzle is why Miyagi talks in 
the sort of fortune-cookie dialogue that went out with Charlie Chan movies 
("Honorable gentleman is what Daniel-san call 'real jerk' "). Isn't NBC's 
standards and practices department supposed to prevent racial stereotyping on 
children's shows? And why did Pat Morita -- who supplies the character's voice 
-- lend his talents to this turkey? 
</P>
<P>
"ALF Tales" puts the cartoon version of Alf into various classic fairy tales. 
The writers seem to be trying to redo Jay Ward's irreverent "Fractured Fairy 
Tales," but the results are utterly flat. It's also not clear that children 
will understand the references in some of the punch lines: "I'll have to check 
the warranty on my liposuction." No worse than a trip to the dentist without 
anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Programs 
</P>
<P>
"Dink, the Little Dinosaur," owes a lot to Don Bluth's "The Land Before Time." 
Both focus on cute-as-a-button baby dinosaurs of different species who learn to 
play together. (Their behavior is supposed to offer a subtle lesson in 
tolerance.) The enormous size of the dinosaurs is one of the principal reasons 
for their enduring popularity with children, but "Dink" robs them of that epic 
scale and reduces them to so many saccharine squeeze toys. 
</P>
<P>
"The California Raisins." Will Vinton's commercials of animated clay raisins 
dancing to old rock songs launched a marketing phenomenon. The Raisins are so 
popular on toys and T-shirts, it was probably inevitable that someone would get 
the semi-bright idea of using them in a children's show. The drawn animation in 
the series, however, fails to re-create the slick, funky motions of the clay 
characters. Rather than make the animators draw a lot of wrinkles, the Raisins 
have been redesigned with smoother bodies, which makes them look like the 
California Eggplants. The net result, an inane comedy about a show-biz group 
with a hapless manager, resembles a lame retread of the old "Alvin Show." 
</P>
<P>
Kidvid attempts to go hip in "Rude Dog and the Dweebs": The title character and 
his garish canine followers are drawn in an angular, new wave style. 
Unfortunately, these with-it designs only look good from one or two angles and 
tend to fall apart when the artists try to move them. Underneath a lot of 
pseudo-cool gnarlyspeak ("Yo, Dudes, get rude!") is an ordinary cartoon sitcom 
about a pack of talking animals living in an otherwise normal city, in the 
dubious tradition of "Top Cat" and "Foofur." Yo, Dudes, get the "off" button! 
</P>
<P>
The one new ABC series, the regrettable "Beetlejuice," already has been 
reviewed. Despite the inclusion of "Beetlejuice" and "Slimer and the Real 
Ghostbusters" in its schedule, ABC offers the best Saturday morning fare: "A 
Pup Named Scooby-Doo," "The Gummi Bears/Winnie the Pooh Hour" and "The Bugs 
Bunny and Tweety Show." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, anyone who doubts the negative impact of the former Reagan 
Administration's decision to loosen the restrictions on the number of 
commercials shown on Saturday morning should try watching an hour of kidvid. 
Young viewers are deluged with ads for toys, chewing gum, sugar cereal and 
other over-sweetened treats. The cereals may be presented as "a part of this 
balanced breakfast," but this plethora of commercials hardly constitutes 
balanced viewing.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CBS' 'SNOOPS' OUTSHINES OTHER SERIES MAKING DEBUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three series premiere head to head at 8 tonight. CBS' "Snoops" is the most 
likable newcomer in a season that's not very likable. NBC's "Baywatch" is the 
soggiest. ABC's "Family Matters" is one of the most forgettable. It's about . . 
. uh . . . uh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not about a housekeeper who is a witch. That's the subject of "Free 
Spirit," another ABC comedy getting a special premiere later tonight in advance 
of its regular Sunday debut. On a 10-point scale, it rates one broomstick. 
</P>
<P>
This is becoming one of those seasons in which a new show that's merely 
pleasing stands out as extraordinary. That's the case with "Snoops" (8 p.m. on 
Channels 2 and 8), which introduces the husband-and-wife investigating team of 
Chance and Micki Dennis (husband and wife Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid). 
</P>
<P>
He's a criminology professor, she's assistant to the State Department's deputy 
chief of protocol. He likes the plain life, she prefers glamour. 
</P>
<P>
As urbane amateur sleuths, Chance and Micki are rooted in Dashiell Hammett's 
Nick and Nora Charles of "The Thin Man" and Jerry and Pamela North of "Mr. 
&amp; Mrs. North." Like the Norths, Chance does much of the investigating, 
Micki much of the solving. And like the Charleses, Chance and Micki investigate 
crimes because sleuthing is in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
They take their cue tonight from one of Chance's students, whose re-examination 
of an old murder convinces him that the police blew the case. The identity of 
the killer is not really the point, however, for it's style, not plot, that's 
emphasized in this breezy, diverting hour that Chance spends wrapped around 
Micki's finger. 
</P>
<P>
They're a charming pair, and the Reids are smooth and adroit. Yet "Snoops" is 
one of those shows that's nice the way it is but could be much better. The 
edges are a little too soft, the wit and dialogue not quite sharp enough. 
</P>
<P>
As Chance says when Micki wants them to go dancing, "This fox ain't trottin." 
Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "Baywatch" (8 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39), isn't even 
treading water. The scene is Malibu, where tonight two reckless power skiers 
cause the drowning of a young woman, spurring head lifeguard Mitch Bucannon 
(David Hasselhoff) and fellow lifeguard Craig Pomeroy (Parker Stevenson) into 
action. What Bucannon doesn't know is that the two power skiers are older 
friends of his 12-year-old son, Hobie, who has been cutting school to hang out 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of "Baywatch" is apparently to celebrate Los Angeles County 
lifeguards and the Pacific. Although the sights are beautiful, the premiere is 
less a story than a seascape, lacking the dramatic intensity and credible 
characters necessary to sustain an hour. Bucannon is not very plausible, but 
he's rock-solid compared with Pomeroy, who is described as a successful lawyer 
who only moonlights as a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
You suspect that the creators of "Baywatch" are lifeguards moonlighting as 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy "Family Matters" premieres at 8:30 p.m. (on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42), about the time the Dennises are just starting to do their best bickering 
and Mitch Bucannon is telling little Hobie to cool it with playing hookie. 
</P>
<P>
The family crisis is far more severe, however, in the household of Carl and 
Harriette Winslow (Reginald VelJohnson and JoMarie Payton-France), where Carl's 
pushy mother (Rosetta LeNoire) has moved in at the request of Harriette. 
</P>
<P>
And now mother Winslow is driving them crrrrrrazy, something that you might 
have expected Harriette to foresee before she invited her in. Is this 
major-dilemma time or what? 
</P>
<P>
Carl (pouting): "Harriette, Mama's sittin' in my chair!" 
</P>
<P>
Harriette (pouting): "I don't know what you're complaining about. She insulted 
my meat loaf before I even took it out of the oven!" 
</P>
<P>
And those are the big laughs. 
</P>
<P>
If only someone could make mother Winslow disappear. Someone can -- but 
unfortunately she's in another ABC comedy, one even dumber than "Family 
Matters." 
</P>
<P>
That would be "Free Spirit," arriving at 9:30 p.m. before assuming its regular 
8 p.m. Sunday time slot. Combining the worst of "I Dream of Jeannie" and 
"Bewitched," "Free Spirit" takes place in the home of divorced attorney Thomas 
Harper (Franc Luz) and his three kids, including 10-year-old Gene, who feels 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
So who should appear in his room -- poof! -- but Winnie the witch (Corinne 
Bohrer), who not only giggles a lot but also becomes the family housekeeper. 
But only the kids know she's a witch. 
</P>
<P>
Her first day on the job she lectures the businesslike father on parenting. She 
tells him: "This family's one kid short." Pause for dramatic effect. "The kid 
in you." Lump in throat. Emotional moment. In the next scene, the father is 
taking his kids bowling. Oh please! 
</P>
<P>
Winnie doesn't do windows. Unfortunately, she doesn't do comedy either.

THE ACCENT IS MULTINATIONAL, INTERCONTINENTAL ON LE CAFE'S MENUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually a restaurant whose menu travels all over the map -- France, China, 
Mexico, Italy -- doesn't do anything especially well. Not so at Le Cafe, where 
dinners (lunch is another matter) are composed of well-made dishes from several 
continents, fully realized dishes with a good amount of national character 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a flavorsome and well-textured chicken liver pate (Chef's pate, they 
call it here). It was a generous portion thoughtfully served at room 
temperature (excessive cold deadens flavor). A thick slice of appealingly 
coarse duck pate was likable but looked more interesting than it tasted. A 
"handmade" beef tamale, enlivened with cilantro, however, had a welcome 
tastier-than-it-looks freshness. 
</P>
<P>
Skip the appetizer sampler whose pleasures -- oysters on the half shell and the 
Chef's pate -- were outgunned by uninteresting boiled shrimp and a tired pasta 
primavera. My favorite dish was a large bowl of tender mussels in a shallot, 
garlic and wine sauce rich with butter and mussel broth. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner entrees are also multinational. A first-rate New York steak had been 
Cajun-blackened and topped with a deceptively normal-looking pat of herbed 
butter. Deceptive because the butter had been spiked with chile and thus served 
as a savory dose-it-yourself condiment. 
</P>
<P>
Among the specials one evening was a generous portion of exquisite poached 
salmon with a mustard-scallion topping that was too strong in massive amounts 
but which left a distinctive, yet delicate swath of flavor when removed to the 
side of the plate. Scallops and shrimp "Japon," in a dark ginger and black 
mushroom and soy sauce, seemed more Chinese than Japanese. It certainly didn't 
lack flavor but it was cruder than it could have been. 
</P>
<P>
The vegetables and starches were unfortunately unreliable. One night they were 
perfect: Lush, correctly cooked asparagus, napped with a well-balanced garlic 
butter accompanied by crispy, rich scalloped potatoes. After that combination, 
just OK carrots and green beans and rice were terribly tame. 
</P>
<P>
La Cafe is such a well-run restaurant that on more than one occasion the 
server, sensing that something didn't please me, asked whether I'd like a 
replacement. This is an uncommon sensitivity to the diner, which is remarkably 
welcome. Unfortunately, the same offer wasn't made at lunch. It's immediately 
obvious that a different chef cooks during the day, because nothing really came 
to life. 
</P>
<P>
Crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms were dull, veal with scallions and shiitake 
mushrooms failed to taste of the promised ginger, and warm honey chicken salad 
was a bust. A uniform mound of frisee lettuce (with a fine, light dressing) had 
been topped with pieces of overcooked white meat chicken drizzled with a 
slightly sweet, tasteless syrup. The exception was linguine with a fresh 
tomato, white onion and scallion sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget desserts. A large, mostly berry shortcake, for instance. It 
wasn't a cake in the usual sense, but a thin layer of superb shortcake that had 
been copiously topped with fresh strawberries and raspberries and whipped 
cream. It was perky and inviting. A tarte tatin was as apple-y and caramelized 
as it should have been. A peach cobbler, however, though obviously made of 
fresh peaches, was too runny. Only a chocolate eclair didn't have a homemade 
feeling to it. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of some unevenness in the kitchen, Le Cafe is a fine quality 
restaurant. Not only is the menu varied and most often pleasing, but the 
atmosphere is welcoming. I got the feeling that the management really cares 
about the diner. (For instance, you are told the prices of the specials so 
there are no unpleasant surprises when you get the bill.) And that attitude is 
reflected in the decor, which is a surprisingly harmonious combination of 
high-tech -- both colorful and metallic -- including a wonderfully whimsically 
erector set-like bar and the warmth of a plank floor. 
</P>
<P>
There is a modestly priced wine list with a respectable range of California 
bottlings, some under $20. And, typically, there are a few half bottles, 
including a clean 1986 Joseph Phelps Sauvignon Blanc at $9. 
</P>
<P>
If I lived near Le Cafe, it could easily become my neighborhood restaurant -- 
for dinner or a late supper: From 10 p.m. until closing, Le Cafe, which many 
know as a well-respected jazz club, serves burgers and other items, including 
appetizers, salads and sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: chef's pate, $5; mussels, $8.50; blackened New York steak, 
$15.50; poached salmon (price varies); tarte tatin, $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Cafe, 14633 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 986-2662. Open 9 a.m. to 1 
a.m. daily. Full bar. Valet parking. Dinner for two, food only, $40-$60.

STIRLING WON'T DELAY MOVE TO COURT TO SAVE ELECTION COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If he would postpone his resignation until November, state Sen. Larry Stirling 
(R-San Diego) could save county taxpayers as much as $600,000. That action 
would allow a race to choose his successor to be scheduled with next June's 
primary instead of requiring a special election. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stirling, who long has billed himself as a fiscal conservative -- and 
has a voting record to prove it -- said Thursday that, in keeping with a pledge 
he made to Gov. George Deukmejian, he intends to resign from the Legislature to 
join the San Diego Municipal Court next week. As a result, the vacancy in his 
39th District will be filled in a costly special election, probably in 
December, with a possible runoff in February. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the election also will have political ramifications. Special 
elections usually draw small voter turnouts, a pattern that would probably give 
an edge to Republicans, who historically turn out in larger numbers than 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Free Shot' at Seat 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a special election would give two of the major potential contenders 
for Stirling's seat -- Assemblywomen Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) and Lucy Killea 
(D-San Diego) -- a "free shot" in the Senate race without jeopardizing their 
Assembly posts. If the Senate race were consolidated with next June's primary, 
the two would have to give up their Assembly seats to run for Stirling's Senate 
slot. 
</P>
<P>
But Stirling said in an interview Thursday that any conjecture about election 
costs and the timing of his move from the state Senate to the judgeship is 
moot, because he has no intention of agreeing to a two-month delay in his plan 
to step down from the Senate next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling repeated that message Thursday to county Supervisor Susan Golding. 
Golding, as chairman of the Board of Supervisors, the body that will have to 
fund the election, asked Stirling to consider delaying his resignation so that 
the election could be consolidated with next June's primary. The county faces 
severe budget constraints, and a special election will reduce the board's 
already lean contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about possibly saving hundreds of thousands of dollars . . . but 
he said he wasn't going to do it," said Golding, who herself has been mentioned 
as a contender for Stirling's seat. "He said this is what the governor wanted 
him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Though sympathetic with the county's plight, Stirling said there is the need 
for him to join the Municipal Court bench as quickly as possible to help 
relieve the logjam of cases in local courts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fiscal consideration for the county -- I understand that," said 
Stirling, whose annual salary will more than double, from $40,800 to $82,000, 
when he becomes a judge. "But there's also a big backlog at the courthouse, and 
the governor has been criticized by the county for not filling those vacancies 
quickly enough. So I'm eager to get over there to help reduce that workload." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, Deukmejian's deputy press secretary, offered a similar 
explanation, saying that the governor's motive in asking Stirling to make the 
move quickly is "the dire need for additional judgeships" in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling's resignation will set in motion a complex formula under which 
Deukmejian will schedule a special election to select his replacement. Under 
the most likely timetable, the primary -- in which all candidates of all 
parties will appear on a single ballot -- would be held in mid-December, county 
Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack said. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a runoff between the top 
Republican and Democratic vote-getters, as well as those of any minor parties 
in the primary, would occur in mid-February, McCormack said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a special primary and runoff would cost about $300,000 each, there 
would be no added expense if the race were put on the ballot in next June's 
countywide primary, the registrar said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law Covering Vacancies 
</P>
<P>
Normally, special elections to fill legislative vacancies are, by law, held 
from 112 to 119 days after the openings occur. However, the law also specifies 
that, if a regularly scheduled election falls within 180 days of the vacancy, 
the race to fill the opening can be consolidated with that election. If 
Stirling were to delay his resignation until at least Nov. 27, local election 
officials said, the election could be held in June. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates weighing the possibility of seeking Stirling's seat include 
former San Diego City Councilmen Bill Cleator and Mike Gotch, El Cajon Mayor 
John Reber, El Cajon Councilwoman Beverly Miller, Santee Councilman Jim 
Bartell, El Cajon lawyer Sam Hornreich and Dianne Jacob, a member of the 
Jamul-Dulzura Union school board.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NUDISTS IN BALBOA PARK? GLAD YOU ASKED THAT . . . 
</P>

<P>
As a research librarian at the downtown San Diego library, Evelyn Kooperman 
answers a lot of trivia questions about names, dates, quotations and other 
oddball information. 
</P>
<P>
She also reads a lot of books about San Diego County: 350 at last count. 
</P>
<P>
Now she has married her two professional passions into a nifty, 406-page 
paperback titled "San Diego Trivia" ($12.95, Silver Gate Publications). 
</P>
<P>
It's got everything you never knew about local history, geography, 
architecture, sports, music, art, theater, literature, place names, movies, 
television, plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Like: 
</P>
<P>
* Who turned San Diego from a Democratic city to a Republican one? 
</P>
<P>
 Land baron Alonzo Horton, who arrived in 1867 and announced that he would hire 
only Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 * What county supervisor had to either resign or live in his barn? 
</P>
<P>
 J.P.M. Rainbow in 1893. When the county line was redrawn, his house was in 
Riverside, his barn in San Diego. He resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 * How many of the 138 prostitutes arrested in the Nov. 10, 1912, raid on the 
downtown red-light district promised to reform? 
</P>
<P>
 Two. The others bought train tickets to Los Angeles. Most of the tickets 
proved to be round-trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * What San Diego mayor took office by climbing a ladder and crawling in a 
window? 
</P>
<P>
 John L. Sehon in 1905. His enemies said he was ineligible because he was a 
retired Army captain, so he launched a preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Was there ever a nudist colony in Balboa Park? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, during the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition. But the 
cops required the women to wear brassieres and G-strings; the men, loincloths. 
</P>
<P>
 * What local city was named for a woman's first husband and then renamed for 
her second husband? 
</P>
<P>
 Santee. Raisin grower George Cowles settled the area in 1877 and called it 
Cowlestown. His widow later married realtor Milton Santee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooperman, 43, a native San Diegan and graduate of San Diego State University, 
says she got the idea for a trivia book after KFMB radio asked her two years 
ago to submit some questions for a contest. 
</P>
<P>
After that came nights and weekends of combing through books and old 
newspapers. She's already dreaming of a second edition, after finishing 10 new 
books on San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of trivia, she notes, is not a trivial matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Perfect Fit 
</P>
<P>
North County identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Palomar Pomerado Hospital District in Escondido has changed to the Palomar 
Pomerado Health System. Presumably patients will be now systematized rather 
than hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
In Encinitas, the city government has a contest to find a mascot or logo to 
symbolize life on the suburban coast. 
</P>
<P>
A suggestion: How about an adjustable-rate mortgage payment superimposed on a 
BMW repair bill? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knowing the Score 
</P>
<P>
Political fallout: 
</P>
<P>
* There was a reason you didn't see any pictures of Gov. George Deukmejian 
standing beside Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Police Chief Bob Burgreen and 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl before, during or after their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Before reluctantly agreeing to the meeting, the Duke put down an ironclad 
condition: no news photos. 
</P>
<P>
* Before we get giddy on the gassy rhetoric of populism, consider that John 
Hartley won a City Council seat with fewer votes than any candidate in several 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
His 7,900 votes represent 1.3% of the city's registered voters. Explain to me 
again how district elections ensure that the "voice of the people" will be 
heard at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
* The "new politics" has some old political faces. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shepard, former Hedgecock strategist and criminal co-defendant, was an 
adviser to both Hartley and Linda Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
* There's no truth to the rumor that Hartley's first legislative proposal will 
be to decriminalize the selling of lobsters from the back of flatbed trucks. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, McColl branded Hartley as an outlaw because of his three 
citations in the early 1980s for peddling edible crustaceans without a license. 
Now, he's keeping them at arm's-length.

D.A. DISMISSES CLAIMS OF ELECTION VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, saying his office will not become embroiled in 
political battles, Thursday dismissed accusations that three members of the 
Escondido City Council violated their city's election financing laws -- charges 
that opponents believed would have removed them from office. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-page letter to the Escondido Common Sense Committee, Miller wrote 
that, although "technically, there may have been misreporting as alleged," 
there was "insufficient evidence to prove willful intent to violate the law. 
Likewise, the alleged misreporting is not so egregious to justify criminal 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
After explaining his office's investigation into the charges, Miller closed: 
</P>
<P>
"Although regrettable, inadvertent errors are to be expected and will not give 
rise to criminal prosecution by this office. Under no circumstances will we 
permit (minor errors) made in good faith attempts to comply with highly 
technical reporting requirements to be transformed from the field of a purely 
political battle to the foundation of a serious criminal inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which serves as a City Hall watchdog group, had charged, among 
other things, that veteran Councilman Jerry Harmon last year loaned two fellow 
council members amounts of more than the $250 allowed under city statutes, and 
that council members Kris Murphy and Carla DeDominicis, who received the loans 
in advance of their election, failed to pay back the money to Harmon within the 
60-day period specified in city election statutes. Violation of that code 
section called for removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
Committee secretary Patricia (P.K.) Walker, herself an unsuccessful council 
candidate last year, said Thursday she faulted Miller's findings and feared 
that his attitude toward the charges gives notice to candidates for public 
office that they don't have to follow the letter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a city code that says they can't do the things they did. But he 
(Miller) is saying, OK, anything goes because people are incapable of 
understanding the codes," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will not pursue the matter further, Walker said, "although I hope 
someone else will pursue it. Why do we have election codes if they're not going 
to be enforced?" 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Harmon said he was not only satisfied by Miller's findings but 
thought it was "great that the message (by Miller) is more strongly worded than 
I had hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
At issue was the manner in which Harmon bought a newspaper advertisement on 
behalf of himself and council candidates DeDominicis and Murphy in advance of 
last year's municipal election when they won office. DeDominicis and Murphy 
later repaid Harmon $1,424 and $1,739, respectively, and those transactions 
were shown on their finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
But Walker's group contends that Harmon essentially loaned the two candidates 
the money, in a sum greater than allowed by city code, and that he was repaid 
after the deadline had passed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insufficient Evidence 
</P>
<P>
Miller found that, although there may have been a technical violation, "since 
the amounts, sources and recipients of the monies were in fact reported on the 
candidates' disclosure statements, there is insufficient evidence to prove 
willful intent to violate the law." 
</P>
<P>
Miller noted that the state's Fair Political Practices Commission is 
investigating the same charges. The FPPC has yet to conclude its review, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also dismissed accusations that Murphy and Harmon improperly reported 
in-kind donations in the form of campaign office space, as well as other, 
unspecified charges. "Generally, these allegations are broad in scope and 
supported only by rumor and speculation," Miller wrote Walker. "Moreover, such 
allegations that may be supported in fact are (minor) in character and do not 
justify criminal action." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Miller said he found no evidence to support the charge that the City 
Council violated the state's open meeting law, the Brown Act.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Assn. of Governments committee Thursday agreed to study a "multiple 
airport" solution to the region's need for a long-term alternative to 
increasingly crowded Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed Sept. 12 by San Diego City Councilmen Ron Roberts and Bob 
Filner, would add a fourth option to the list of alternatives being studied by 
the Sandag panel. The committee now is exploring the feasibility of shifting 
the regional airport to Miramar Naval Air Station, a site east of Miramar and a 
binational airport on the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by Roberts and Filner, city-owned Brown Field on Otay Mesa, now a 
general aviation airport, would be expanded into a major facility operating in 
conjunction with Lindbergh. Montgomery Field and Palomar Airport in Carlsbad 
might also be used for commuter air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of air traffic at Brown and Lindbergh fields would be determined in the 
future, depending on Sandag study of noise, ground access, environmental 
constraints and the technical feasibility of landing airliners at Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag's Board of Directors will vote on the proposed study today.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON

<P>
An anti-abortion activist was sentenced Thursday in El Cajon Municipal Court to 
450 days in jail on charges stemming from the blockade of a medical clinic in 
La Mesa, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Municipal Judge Elizabeth Riggs sentenced William R. Lehman, 29, of 
Vista, one of seven protesters convicted by a jury Monday in connection with 
the July 3 protest, to 180 days in County Jail for criminal trespass and 270 
days for resisting arrest. Riggs ordered that the sentences run consecutively, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs set Lehman's bond at $10,000 while he appeals, prosecutors said. It could 
not be determined late Thursday whether Lehman had posted bond, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs sentenced the six other protesters, convicted either of trespass alone or 
of both trespass and resisting arrest, to a variety of sentences, ranging from 
a $300 fine to 61 days in jail, prosecutors said. It could not be determined 
late Thursday whether the activists who received jail sentences had posted 
appeal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The activists were arrested at the July 3 blockade of the Family Planning 
Associates Medical Group on Fletcher Parkway.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego National Sports Training Foundation received the first of three 
cash installments Thursday, leading up to a $3-million gift toward funding a 
U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The EastLake Development Co., which is building a 3,200-acre "master-planned" 
community in the Lower Otay Reservoir area, where the center will be located, 
presented a check for $536,000 to the foundation. EastLake officials said the 
balance of the gift will be paid out over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Daniels, a spokesman for EastLake, said the camp will be a 
year-round, warm-weather facility -- the first of its kind in the United 
States. Plans call for construction of residence, dining and recreation 
buildings, a sports medicine clinic, visitor center, track, pool, gymnasium, 
tennis courts, playing fields, offices and equipment storage areas. 
</P>
<P>
Other Olympic training sites are in Colorado and Florida, but neither of those 
is designed for year-round use. Construction of the Chula Vista center is 
scheduled to begin early next year. The next Olympic Games are scheduled for 
Barcelona, Spain, in the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Teams expected to use the facility include archery, kayaking, canoeing, 
cycling, rowing, synchronized swimming, team handball, track and field, 
volleyball and water polo.

SAUDIS EXECUTE 16 SHIITES

Sixteen Shiite Muslims from Kuwait were beheaded in Saudi Arabia for exploding 
two bombs in Mecca last July at the height of the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy 
city, the Saudi Interior Ministry said. A statement carried by the official 
Saudi Press Agency said 10 of those beheaded were of Iranian origin and two 
were of Saudi descent. The statement implicitly blamed Iran for the attacks, 
which killed a man and wounded 16 others. The explosions occurred despite tight 
security during the annual hajj, or pilgrimage, attended by about 1.5 million 
Muslim pilgrims from around the world.

BUTTE COUNTY GETS REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the help of the state, Butte County received a reprieve from bankruptcy, 
but supervisors still prepared for insolvency by setting aside $200,000 to hire 
lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy cases. An immediate financial crisis was 
averted when the state agreed to defer billing the county for its $2.8-million 
contract with the Department of Forestry for fire protection services until 
July. The agreement helped erase a $3.5-million deficit and permitted 
supervisors to adopt a $128-million 1989-90 budget by virtually eliminating 
library services for 167,000 county residents and drastically cutting the 
county's emergency reserve fund. If Butte County eventually declares

DAY CARE CENTERS HELD SAFER THAN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Day care centers appear to be safer places for children than their own homes, 
government researchers reported. The new study involving Atlanta day care 
centers found children are about half as likely to be injured at a day care 
center than at home. "Children in organized, licensed day care may have a lower 
rate of injury than those cared for at home," researchers from the federal 
Centers for Disease Control reported in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn. The study, involving 5,300 children attending 71 day care centers in 
Atlanta from June 1, 1987, through May 31, 1988, is the most comprehensive of 
its kind, said Dr. Jeffrey Sacks, who led the research. Researchers found 143 
injuries requiring medical attention occurred during the study period, which 
works out to 14.3 injuries for every 100 children attending the centers. That 
figure is about half the 35 per 100 found previously by other studies on 
children outside day care centers.

Rod Graham, the indicted sheriff of Yolo County, agreed to retire Oct. 1 at 
half pay, plus $40,000 in cash. The deal with Graham was approved by a 3-2 vote 
of the Board of Supervisors and announced by County Counsel Charles Mack, who 
described the settlement as a matter of economics. Graham, 48, was named in a 
federal indictment, charging him with extortion, bribery and conspiracy. He was 
accused in January of taking $3,600 in contributions to his 1986 reelection 
campaign from a developer with plans for a major commercial and residential 
project in West Sacramento. The indictment was an outgrowth of a three-year FBI 
sting aimed at state legislators.

SENATE VOTES TO LIMIT CONTEMPT JAILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate voted to limit civil contempt of court jailings in the District of 
Columbia, a measure designed to free a mother jailed more than two years in a 
child custody dispute. The bill, drawn to deal with the case of Dr. Elizabeth 
Morgan, was passed by the House on Wednesday and now goes to President Bush. 
Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.), who introduced the latest version of the measure, 
said: "I haven't spoken directly with the President, but we're told he is 
sympathetic and that the White House staff will encourage him to sign it." The 
case that inspired the bill involves a mother who was sent to jail in August, 
1987, after refusing a judge's order to produce her daughter, Hilary, for 
court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her ex-husband and the girl's 
father. Morgan has alleged that Foretich sexually abused the girl. Foretich has 
denied those charges.

The Senate voted to ease slightly restrictions for federally financed 
abortions, brushing aside outnumbered conservatives and flouting a White House 
threat to veto any attempt to liberalize regulations. Lawmakers on a voice vote 
agreed to legislation prohibiting federal assistance for abortions except for 
pregnancies that threaten the mother's life or those caused by rape or incest 
"promptly reported" to authorities. Under current law, the only exception is 
for cases in which the woman's life is endangered. Conservatives conceded they 
didn't have the votes to block the provision, but said they will try to 
eliminate the language when House-Senate negotiators work to shape a compromise 
bill. The House version retains the current restriction.

The Senate, heeding pleas to give El Salvador's new president, Alfredo 
Cristiani, "a chance to succeed," voted to boost aid to that country to $90 
million for the coming year and remove restrictions on the money. Initially, on 
a 67-33 vote, the lawmakers stripped from a $14.4-billion foreign aid bill a 
Democratic-sponsored provision that would have cut the aid into three slices to 
be sent at four-month intervals and would have given Congress what amounted to 
veto power over the final installment. The Senate then approved, by an 82-12 
vote, a substitute measure to increase the military aid from $85 million to $90 
million. The Senate still has to complete work on the overall aid measure and 
work out differences with the House before sending the bill on to President 
Bush.

Former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer, 
said farewell from his deathbed to his successor, President Alfredo Cristiani, 
according to his personal physician. Dr. Jose Luis Saca also said that Duarte 
had asked for other friends and colleagues to be sent to his room for brief 
goodbys. "He is completely aware that he is dying," said Saca, who added that 
the 63-year-old former president is now refusing medication that could prolong 
his life. "He asked that I not give him more medicine, so that he may die in 
peace." Duarte's cancer was diagnosed in June, 1988. His condition has 
deteriorated rapidly the past two days.

Palestinians stoned a bus carrying West German tourists through Bethlehem and 
injured two of them, the Israeli army said. The attack on the tourists was the 
second in two days by activists in the uprising in the occupied areas. Several 
West Germans were slightly hurt Wednesday night when their bus was stoned in 
Bethlehem. Tourists have become a target since Israeli troops disguised as 
tourists shot and killed an activist in Bethlehem last month.

WOMAN TELLS OF BRUTAL YEAR AS MAN'S PRISONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Police on Thursday were investigating the bizarre abduction of a woman who told 
authorities she was held prisoner for more than a year inside a truck camper 
and repeatedly raped, beaten, electrically shocked and forced to cook and clean 
for the man who kidnaped her, two other women and five children. 
</P>
<P>
The victim -- identified by Los Angeles police only as a 27-year-old Guatemalan 
immigrant who lived in South-Central Los Angeles -- told officers that she was 
locked in chains inside the camper at night. 
</P>
<P>
She escaped Sept. 2 after she stole a set of keys as the others slept, freed 
herself and called police from a nearby liquor store, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The camper, which had been parked since January in a dirt alley behind the 4200 
block of South Broadway, has not been seen since, police said. The vehicle was 
described as a 1960 to 1962 white and beige Ford with a green stripe. 
</P>
<P>
Police released a composite drawing of the male suspect, believed to be between 
40 and 44 years old. Officers said he uses at least four aliases -- Manuel 
Moreno, Tomas Garcia, Fernando Ruiz and Dusty -- and owns a collection of 
shotguns, rifles and handguns. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not know if the two other women are accomplices or victims. They are 
being sought for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
The children, three boys and two girls, are believed to be between 2 and 10 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first read the report I said, 'Aw, come on, these things don't happen,' 
" Newton Division Detective Dick Heidesch said. "But several of us talked to 
the victim independently, a counselor talked to her, and everyone is convinced 
she is telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the victim's aunt had filed a missing person report, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Delia Perez said the victim claimed the man beat her and shocked her 
with wires attached to a battery when he did not like the food she cooked or 
the way she cleaned. She was not allowed to speak to outsiders and left the 
camper only to wash clothes and sell produce to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried to escape once before, but she was beaten," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police photos of the woman taken the night she escaped show two dime-sized 
scars on each corner of her mouth, where she said the man shocked her when she 
disobeyed him. The calf of one of her legs bore an open, infected wound where 
she said she had been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
The victim told police that she was abducted July 15, 1988, while she was 
waiting for a bus in South-Central Los Angeles. A woman approached her and said 
she knew a man who could give her a job, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
When the victim later met the woman at the camper, parked outside a South Los 
Angeles store, she was told to enter the vehicle to fill out a job application. 
She was immediately handcuffed and gagged, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Since January the camper had been parked most of the time behind a row of 
run-down store-fronts on South Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Villarana, 53, who works in an upholstery shop in the area, said the man 
asked permission to park behind his store, promising to guard the alley at 
night. Villarana said the man he knew as Manuel told him he had just brought 
his family to Los Angeles from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought they were poor. I felt bad for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eulalia Renteria, who lives in a nearby apartment building, said she brought 
the family food until May, when the man told her to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"He appeared superior to the women," Renteria said. "He called them dummies, 
dull and idiots. That I didn't think was normal." 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors said they never thought to call police because they did not hear 
arguing and the children appeared clean and happy. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the suspect was hired as a handyman at the University Seventh-day 
Adventist Church on Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"He was clean and seemed nice," said Deacon William Baker Sr., who hired him 
for $6 an hour. "He told me he was trying to feed his kids." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's son, William Jr., 28, said he visited the man at the camper several 
times, but the memory of one visit stayed with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't let me go inside . . . but he wanted to show off his gun 
collection," the younger Baker said. "I saw this woman inside and she pulled 
back the curtains and handed the guns out a window." 
</P>
<P>
During the visit, while the man told war stories about serving in Vietnam, 
Baker said he could hear dishes rattling inside the camper and smelled food 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed like a real nice guy," Baker added. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISSING PLANE, 2 BODIES FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civil Air Patrol searchers found two bodies in the wreckage of a small plane in 
Ventura County on Thursday, ending an extensive search for the missing plane 
that was supposed to have landed at Torrance Airport on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was spotted by a Civil Air Patrol crew at 12:45 p.m., and ground 
rescue workers reached the area about two hours later. They found two bodies, 
believed to be two retired United Airlines pilots from the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Smith, 64, of Rancho Palos Verdes and William Manfrass, 68, of Palos 
Verdes Estates left Reno Tuesday morning. Smith, who was piloting the plane, 
was last heard from shortly after noon Tuesday when he made a routine radio 
call reporting that he was flying near the town of Avenal at an altitude of 
about 10,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Friends contacted federal officials Tuesday night when the men failed to arrive 
in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Bob Fowler of the Civil Air Patrol said 15 volunteer search crews 
covered more than 500 square miles of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties before 
spotting the wreckage near Reyes Peak on Pine Mountain, about 15 miles north of 
Ojai.

TOO OLD TO RILE IF NOT PROVOKED, ZSA ZSA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, complaining of a terrible headache, took the witness stand for a 
second day of cross-examination Thursday and immediately confessed -- to being 
old. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Fox, I am an old lady," the 60-something actress told Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Elden Fox, who is prosecuting her for slapping a Beverly Hills cop. "Would I 
hit a 6-foot-6 cop with a gun if he isn't insulting me to death?" 
</P>
<P>
Then Gabor, saying she was so fatigued she had not returned a Wednesday 
telephone call from former President Ronald Reagan, stepped aside for other 
defense witnesses, who supported her claim that she acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Peric, a Hancock Park art dealer, became the star defense witness thus far 
in the two-week trial, testifying that she was driving past the scene June 14 
when Gabor emerged from her white Rolls-Royce and slapped Officer Paul Kramer. 
With what she called a "perfect view" from high in her Jeep, Peric disputed 
police officer testimony that Gabor stepped out of the Rolls on her own before 
hitting Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Peric testified, Kramer pulled Gabor out by the wrist and then slammed 
the car door. Peric called the treatment of Gabor "very rough, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Another defense witness, Melanie Jonkers flew west from Virginia to testify 
that Kramer treated her arrogantly and abrasively after pulling her over for a 
violation involving a child's car seat in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jonkers, one of several witnesses called by Gabor to try to prove "a pattern" 
of misconduct by Kramer, told jurors she ultimately was handcuffed and seated 
on the curb while her 2-year-old daughter was kept in her car with the windows 
up in 100-degree heat. Then she was jailed briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Jonkers said she decided to testify for Gabor "to set the record straight . . . 
about how abusive this man (Kramer) is." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, however, Jonkers conceded that her daughter's head was 
partially out the window of her Mercedes when she was pulled over by Kramer. 
She also admitted that she refused to sign a traffic citation, explaining to 
jurors that it was her first ticket, that she was not from Los Angeles and that 
Kramer told her she would have to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Jonkers said she became so upset at the time that she doubted Kramer was really 
a police officer and ran into the street, attempting to stop a public transit 
bus and a car as she cried for help.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REWARD OFFERED IN SHOOTING OF MAILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service officials are offering a $10,000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the gunman who shot and wounded a mail 
carrier in Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Manzano, a six-year Postal Service employee, was making his daily rounds 
in the 700 block of 103rd Street, shortly after noon last Friday when a gunman 
demanded mail containing cash and checks, said postal official Donald Obritsch. 
</P>
<P>
A struggle ensued. As Manzano fled and tried to get back into his postal truck, 
he was shot in the face. He remains hospitalized in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, who fled in a waiting car, did not make off with any mail. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, postal officials made a plea for help and gave a 
description of the car: a gold four-door 1971 Chrysler Plymouth New Yorker with 
a torn vinyl top.

<P>
A bipartisan group of politicians, academics, journalists and public servants 
gathered at a conference in Claremont this week to wrestle with some big 
problems facing America's leaders, offering a list that included everything 
from grinding drug problems to potentially devastating global warming. 
</P>
<P>
It is a new, more threatening world out there, wrapped in "interlocking 
slow-motion crises," summed up Lamont C. Hempel, a director at the Claremont 
Graduate School's new Center for Politics and Policy that sponsored the two-day 
Agenda for the 1990s conference. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing that the diverse group of conferees agreed upon was the 
certainty of continued change -- change brought about by, in the words of one 
conference member, challenges that are "intermestic," a blend of international 
and domestic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
By that, it was meant that certain global issues, trends and technology 
transcend the normal boundaries between nations, forcing world leaders to share 
solutions on environmental, energy and social problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be talking to your grandchildren about this critical juncture in 
history," said former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who began the 
conference with a call for a stronger America despite Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's amiable attitude toward the West. 
</P>
<P>
A raspy-voiced Haig, still good-naturedly batting down a recent report that he 
was the secret source of revelations that brought down the Nixon Administration 
during the Watergate crisis ("I'm not Deep Throat, but I'm getting to be Sore 
Throat"), worried openly about Gorbachev's future course. 
</P>
<P>
"Andrei Gromyko (the late Soviet foreign minister) described Mikhail Gorbachev 
as a leader with a nice smile and teeth of iron," said Haig, who contends that 
the failures of economic restructuring will force the Soviet leader to give in 
to hard-liners. "We've seen an awful lot of the nice smile. We're about to see 
the teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Haig, a Republican presidential candidate last year, had some heads shaking 
when he chided liberal Americans for being "almost exclusively preoccupied with 
the struggle for social justice in America." 
</P>
<P>
For others at the conference, the struggle for social justice was as compelling 
as ever. Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a liberal Democrat still smarting 
from his failed 1988 presidential campaign ("I characterize my present status 
as 'politics in remission' "), spoke of his hopes for a new period of social 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a kind of duality in the national makeup," he said. "When times are 
good, we're enormously complacent. We just pick up the oars, lean back and 
drift." 
</P>
<P>
But like others, Babbitt said he sees signs that the complacency is ending. "I 
believe we're coming very close to one of those cycles of American history when 
there will be a period of renewal and innovation, when public service will 
again become an honorable pursuit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt, in the conference's concluding address, saw hope for capitalism in the 
increasing involvement of workers in the American marketplace, citing the 
recent purchase of 75% of United Airlines by the Airline Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But he expressed worries about, among other things, the "graying of America," 
with prospects for one out of five Americans being over 65 by 2030. "Think of 
the implications for children . . . with 50% of the voting power held by 
retirees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited "spirit of renewal" of which Babbitt spoke cannot come a 
moment too soon, suggested Jessica Tuchman Mathews, vice president of the 
Washington-based World Resources Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Already there are worrisome signs of global warming which could eventually 
spell disaster for the world, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, measurements of average global temperatures have shown that 1981, 
1983, 1985, 1987 and 1988 were among the highest ever registered in 135 years 
of record-keeping. Droughts in recent years in the American Southeast and 
Midwest have been of a severity that comes only "once every 300 years," Mathews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a period of unprecedented stress on the environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, Mathews proposed a "silver bullet" solution to the 
national propensity to put fossil fuels into the atmosphere: a phased 
$1-per-gallon tax on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Such a measure would not only raise revenue but also encourage American auto 
makers to make more efficient cars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with most of the rest of the industrialized world, with gasoline taxes 
as high as $4 per gallon, "we are an anachronism," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But environmental problems, as well as many political ones, defy national 
solutions, said Mathews and others. 
</P>
<P>
"When a fire burns in the Amazon, it changes the air we breathe everywhere on 
the planet," Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some signs of optimism because voters are more receptive to paying for 
social services, social problems are more challenging than ever, said Wendy 
Lazarus, of the Los Angeles-based advocacy group Children Now. The drug problem 
in particular has been devastating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the Center for Politics and Policy, said John David Maguire, 
president of the Claremont Graduate School, is to serve as a "perpetual forum 
for critical thinking" about political issues. The center will bring together 
"scholars and practitioners" to attack problems, he said.

L.A. SCHOOLS EMBARK ON NEW EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
DISTRICTWIDE COMMITTEE GEARS UP FOR BOLD TRY TO RESTRUCTURE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Planning for changes that educators, parents and community leaders hope will 
dramatically improve education in the Los Angeles Unified School District began 
in earnest Thursday at the first meeting of a powerful new districtwide 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting at the 32nd Street Performing and Visual Arts Magnet School near USC, 
the 24-member Shared Decision-Making and School-Based Management Central 
Council discussed goals and organizational needs as it geared up for what many 
observers say is the district's boldest effort ever to restructure schools. 
</P>
<P>
The council's co-chairs, Deputy Supt. Sidney Thompson and United Teachers-Los 
Angeles Vice President Helen Bernstein, sat side-by-side in a display of 
cooperation that both said could never have transpired four months ago, when 
teachers went on a nine-day strike for higher pay and more authority to run 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Settlement Element 
</P>
<P>
The Central Council, a key element of the teachers' contract settlement in 
June, will oversee the district's move toward placing more authority and 
responsibility for improving education at the local school level, with 
administrators, parents and, in particular, with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also provides for new local councils at each of the district's 800 
regular and adult schools that eventually will have the power to make sweeping 
changes affecting curriculum, hiring and other aspects of school life. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is following the example of the Dade County, Fla., and Rochester, 
N.Y., school systems, which pioneered similar decentralization efforts a few 
years ago. Supporters of the approach hope it will produce happier teachers, 
more involved parents and better schools -- critical goals in Los Angeles with 
its 39% dropout rate and chronically low test scores. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we're doing now is not working," Bernstein said. "The future of the 
district depends on what this (Central Council) does." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accountability Issue 
</P>
<P>
Said Central Council member Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of 
the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People: "The biggest question 
is whether we can bring accountability into the (school) system." 
</P>
<P>
As set out in the contract, teachers make up 50% of the Central Council and the 
individual school councils, while parents, community leaders and administrators 
make up the remaining half. Principals will not have veto power over local 
council actions. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said the main task of the Central Council will be to train the local 
school councils and draft guidelines for them to follow. The local councils 
this year will begin to make decisions regarding student discipline policies, 
spending of certain funds, scheduling, even access to the school copying 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Council will meet twice a month, with the next meeting set for Oct. 
12.

ANOTHER REPORT ALSO FAULTS KING HOSPITAL FOR ITS DEFICIENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new, confidential report prepared by the state Department of Health Services 
details health-care deficiencies at Martin Luther King Jr./ Drew Medical 
Center, echoing last week's scathing state report on the institution, which 
cited serious lapses in patient care, administration and quality assurance. 
</P>
<P>
The new report -- inadvertently made available to The Times -- concludes that 
the hospital has flunked five major areas of inspection, threatening a shut-off 
of Medicare and Medi-Cal funding, the main source of revenue to the 430-bed, 
county-operated hospital in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100-Page Report 
</P>
<P>
The 100-page report was forwarded to the federal Health Care Financing 
Administration last week for action, but it has not been publicly released. And 
the federal agency has not yet informed the hospital whether it will move to 
shut off the hospital's funds or merely put the facility on probationary 
status, subject to continuous federal monitoring and review. 
</P>
<P>
The report describes fundamental, systemic deficiencies at the hospital in more 
explicit and broader terms than the state report on the hospital issued last 
week, which detailed serious violations of the state's health code. Those 
violations jeopardize the hospital's state operating license. 
</P>
<P>
The new report states flatly, for example, that the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, which oversees the administration of King, "is not effectively 
monitoring and conducting the affairs of the hospital," nor is there any 
evidence to show that the supervisors hold doctors "accountable for the quality 
of care provided to patients." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quality Assurance' Failed 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found so many problems that they failed the hospital's "quality 
assurance" program, which is supposed to ensure review of most hospital deaths 
and questionable occurrences. And they also said the hospital's nursing 
services, dietary care and infection control practices did not meet federal 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
They cited numerous instances in which patient care at the hospital had been 
"compromised" as a result of a critical breakdown in five fundamental areas. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to pass inspection in one area alone can jeopardize a hospital's 
federal and state funding available through the Medicare and Medi-Cal programs, 
federal officials said. King received about $59 million from these programs 
during the last fiscal year, according to county health official Carl Williams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Progress Made 
</P>
<P>
Officials at King had no comment on the new report, but Williams said that many 
of the deficiencies cited have "been taken care of already." He declined to 
give details. 
</P>
<P>
Both federal and county health officials refused to make the new report 
available to The Times. But along with a cover letter declining to release the 
report this week, Williams sent The Times a copy of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how that happened," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is heading a county Department of Health Services investigation of all 
recent allegations of substandard patient care and deficient hospital practices 
at King. The investigation was ordered by the Board of Supervisors after a 
series of articles in The Times, which, according to the supervisors, pointed 
out problems of "poor administration, a lack of highly skilled medical staff 
and a severe shortage of space, staff and funding to adequately deal with the 
hospital's increasing patient load." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infection Control 
</P>
<P>
The new report, based on an inspection in June, again faults infection control 
at King. "Infection control at King was not being enforced for the prevention 
and control of infection and communicable diseases within the hospital," the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that the nutritional needs of patients were neglected for 
days at a time. In one sample of 13 cases, deficiencies were found in all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
As for the nursing problems at King, the report said many deficiencies stemmed 
from a consistently inadequate level of staffing.

LATELY, IT HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY RYDER FOR THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SUTTON COLDFIELD, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the final hole of the 1969 Ryder Cup at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club in 
Southport, England, Jack Nicklaus conceded a two-foot par putt to Tony Jacklin. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Ryder Cup ended in a tie for the only time since it began as a 
biennial series matching the best golfers from the United States and Great 
Britain in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 20 years since Nicklaus' gracious gesture, the 28th Ryder Cup begins at 
the Belfry, a few miles north of Birmingham, with the 12 U.S. players willing 
to concede nothing, neither a decisive putt nor the overwhelming sentiment here 
that they have relinquished their position as the sport's best to the 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some of the obligatory media hype on both sides of the Atlantic, a 
competition that was begun to foster friendship between golfers from the United 
States and Great Britain, and was eventually extended to include all of Western 
Europe, has not become unfriendly. 
</P>
<P>
There is little question, however, that the players approach it with 
considerably more resolve than they did in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the United States had won 14 of the previous 17 Ryder Cups, including 12 
of the last 13. It could afford a tie every 40 years or so. But in case some 
U.S. egos were damaged, they no doubt were soothed by seven straight victories 
that gave the Americans a 21-3-1 edge before the 1985 competition here at the 
Belfry. 
</P>
<P>
The United States lost that year but rationalized it as just one of those 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a feeling of, 'Oh well, it had to happen. It's good for golf. They 
were lucky,' " said Ray Floyd, one of the players on that team. "You know, all 
the excuses." 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, on Nicklaus' Muirfield Village course at Dublin, Ohio, a U.S. team 
captained by the Golden Bear himself lost again. Not only was it the first time 
that the Americans had lost two straight, it was the first time they had lost 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, it wasn't luck, there weren't any more excuses, and we felt 
that we were slipping down in the rankings of world golf," Floyd said. "That's 
what we've come to put right." 
</P>
<P>
As the non-playing captain of the U.S. team, Floyd has been wearing a red, 
white and blue visor this year that reads: "Bring Back the Ryder Cup." But in a 
recent article, "The Battle of the Belfry," Golf Digest put a World War II 
helmet on a drawing of Floyd and presented him as Gen. George S. Patton. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, Golf magazine, in an article headlined "Bound for Glory," 
gave the Patton treatment to one of the U.S. players, Mark Calcavecchia. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is just golf, none of the players particularly embrace the war 
metaphors. But the Americans admit their goal is essentially the same as 
Patton's: Victory in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
There was team competition between the United States and Great Britain as early 
as 1921, but the first official Ryder Cup matches were played in 1927 at 
Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The competition was named for Sam Ryder, an Englishman who earned his fortune 
by selling penny packets of seeds to gardeners. A golf enthusiast, he donated 
the small gold cup, which was worth about $375 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The sides split the first four competitions, but British golf was devastated by 
World War II. In 1973, the Irish joined the cause against the Americans. But 
there was no serious challenge until 1979, when reinforcements came from all of 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
That was Nicklaus' idea. Whose side is he on, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CAPTAINS 
</P>
<P>
Even with the addition of players such as Seve Ballesteros of Spain and 
Bernhard Langer of West Germany, the Europeans did not threaten until 1983 at 
the PGA National Golf Club at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
There, on the final hole, Lanny Wadkins pitched from 70 yards to within 15 
inches and then birdied, giving the United States a one-point victory. The U.S. 
captain, Nicklaus, kissed the ground from where Wadkins had pitched. 
</P>
<P>
That was a case of the United States winning, not Europe losing. Credit for 
restoring the Europeans' confidence went to their non-playing captain, Jacklin. 
</P>
<P>
The man who returned respectability worldwide to English golf in 1970 with a 
U.S. Open championship treated the Europeans as what they were, professionals. 
They flew to the United States on the Concorde, stayed in a five-star hotel and 
had only the best in equipment and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
They lost that one but won the next two. Believing that was a good time to go 
out, Jacklin, 45, intended to quit after 1987. But, on the Concorde flight 
home, the European players insisted he remain for their attempt to win a third 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
The last two years have been turbulent ones for him. He lost his wife of 22 
years, Vivien, in an automobile accident and became fodder for the London 
tabloids when his association with a 16-year-old waitress was revealed. She 
later cashed in by revealing herself in a magazine centerfold. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking stability, he married Astrid Waagen, the former wife of the Bee Gees' 
drummer, but she had a miscarriage last December. 
</P>
<P>
Planning to retire to a calmer life in Spain after this Ryder Cup, Jacklin has 
not lost his trademark brashness, saying, "I am 100% confident we will retain 
the trophy. It's not going anywhere this week." 
</P>
<P>
One who disagrees is Floyd, 47, who is making his first appearance as the U.S. 
captain. He said that he has been researching the players who might be 
available for the Ryder Cup, their strengths and weaknesses in match play, for 
a year, but it is apparent that he also has taken some history lessons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967 at the Champions Golf Club at Houston, the British captain, Dai Rees, 
introduced his players by reciting their hardly imposing resumes. The U.S. 
captain, Ben Hogan, countered with: "Ladies and gentlemen, I present the 
American team, the 10 greatest golfers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
At a banquet here Wednesday night, Jacklin introduced his players and their 
impressive credentials. When it was Floyd's turn, he pointed to "the best 12 
players in the world" and sat down. 
</P>
<P>
Jacklin, for once, was speechless. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Thursday if he'd had a chance to reply, Jacklin said: "I had a chance to 
chuckle, which is better than a chance to reply. I guess one of our guys, Seve, 
is 13th." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
United States: Paul Azinger, Chip Beck, Calcavecchia, Fred Couples, Ken Green, 
Tom Kite, Mark McCumber, Mark O'Meara, Payne Stewart, Curtis Strange, Wadkins, 
Tom Watson, 
</P>
<P>
Europe: England's Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam, Howard Clark and Mark James, Spain's 
Ballesteros, Jose-Maria Olazabal and Jose-Maria Canizares, Scotland's Sam 
Torrance and Gordon Brand Jr., West Germany's Langer, Ireland's Christy 
O'Connor Jr. and Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players were automatic selections because of points earned on their 
respective tours, but Jacklin had three wild cards and Floyd had two. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd has been second-guessed because he used his for Watson and Wadkins. 
Neither has played particularly well this year, although Watson had top-10 
finishes in the British Open and the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
One second-guesser is Gary Player, who handicapped the competition in 
Thursday's London Daily Mail. The headline read: "Floyd Has Opened the Way for 
a European Hat Trick by Recalling Watson, the Man Who's Lost His Touch." 
</P>
<P>
But Watson, 39, is at least talking a good game. When he was selected in 
August, he said, "We're going to go over there and kick some butt." 
</P>
<P>
Even more succinct in his comments has been Calcavecchia, who said the 
Europeans tried to humiliate the Americans during the victory ceremony in 1987. 
He already has taken some revenge by winning the British Open this year, but he 
said previously tha the would trade a championship in a major tournament for a 
Ryder Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
The London Daily Mirror Thursday called Calcavecchia a "Sicilian Yank" who has 
a "Mafia-style lust to draw more European blood." 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans do not know quite what to make of all this jingoism. The 
Americans stopped at the White House for breakfast with George Bush before 
flying over, but Jacklin said that the British Prime Minister, Margaret 
Thatcher, did not send his team an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not been threatened with that yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FORMAT 
</P>
<P>
Four foursomes will tee off this morning and play 18 holes. There are two men 
from each team in the foursomes. Teammates will hit alternate shots. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, four foursomes, including some players who competed in the 
morning, will tee off for another 18 holes. All the golfers will play their own 
shots, the best scores on each hole counting. 
</P>
<P>
That also is the format for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, each player will be matched against a player from the other team in 
18 holes of straight match play. 
</P>
<P>
Teams score one point for each round won. 
</P>
<P>
Both captains have chosen to go with experience in the opening foursomes this 
morning, Strange and Kite against Faldo and Woosnam. Another interesting match 
should be Watson and Beck against Ballesteros and Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
The captains are not required to use all of their players until the final day. 
But, in the interest of team spirit, Floyd said that all 12 Americans will play 
on the first two days as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Good," said Jacklin, who made no such commitment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COURSE 
</P>
<P>
The Belfry was a potato field until work began in 1975 to construct a course in 
England that would prepare British players for the U.S. tour. In other words, 
there is a lot of water and sand. Jacklin believed the Europeans would have 
more of an advantage on a traditional British seaside course, where the gales 
and showers might distract the Americans. But since this course worked out so 
well for the Europeans in 1985, he was happy to return. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting hole is the 275-yard, par-four 10th, where the green is 
guarded by water. In 1985, the U.S. captain, Lee Trevino, advised his players 
to lay up and pitch to the green. The Europeans went for the green and probably 
won the Cup because of their daring. 
</P>
<P>
This week, it appears as if everyone is going for it. In a gusting wind that 
Jacklin calls "nonsensical," the 10th should claim more than its share of 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FANS 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to polite applause for one and all on the PGA Tour, the U.S. players 
were not ready for the rowdy reception they received four years ago from the 
English fans. 
</P>
<P>
Couples was not part of the U.S. team in 1985, but he said that he heard the 
fans would step on a player's ball in the rough to make him wish that one of 
his clubs were a machete. 
</P>
<P>
That probably is exaggerated, but the fans undoubtedly were partisan. When the 
Americans complained, their captain, Trevino, called them crybabies. 
</P>

Floyd warned them this week that they should keep their minds on their games, 
no matter what confronts them of an extracurricular nature.

"I think that's a good idea," Jacklin said. "I want the galleries to cheer and 
cheer loud. I want them to cheer louder for the home team. That's part of the 
advantage of playing at home."

FRED STRICKLAND, A MAN OF MANY POSITIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From the football laboratories of Anaheim, where the Rams once cooked up the 
Eagle defense, now emerges the prototype football player of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are calling him Fred Strickland. Other teams around the league will 
use different names. 
</P>
<P>
This modern-day gladiator can rush the passer as a defensive tackle on one play 
and drop into pass coverage the next. 
</P>
<P>
Has the game evolved? Imagine Merlin Olsen covering Gale Sayers out of the 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drew up their unique five-linebacker Eagle scheme before the 1988 
season, in part as reaction to National Football League offenses that seemed 
intent on turning football into a game of finesse and foot races. 
</P>
<P>
"All these offenses with all these open formations are causing you to have to 
defend the whole field," Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur explained. 
"The more guys you can put on the field who can run, the better off you are." 
</P>
<P>
Bigger and faster players on offense demanded bigger and faster players on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
In the context of the new defense, he threw the compiled data into a computer 
and it spat out Fred Strickland's name. What exactly is a Strickland? Certainly 
not an Edsel. He was the Rams' second-round choice from Purdue in 1988. He 
played middle linebacker in college and is cat-quick and strong at 6-feet-2 and 
250 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
With the Eagle, the Rams had already invented a new position called the 
nose-backer, a player who roams the defensive line as a linebacker or lines up 
directly over the opponent's center. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jerue was the original nose-backer, but after his knees gave out late last 
season, the Rams moved rookie Strickland into the position. And he has taken 
the job to another level. 
</P>
<P>
Before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery Aug. 8, Strickland was playing a 
different position in every defensive formation. He'll resume that role once 
his knee gets a bit stronger. Strickland returned to the lineup last week 
against Indianapolis in a limited role. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly does he do? 
</P>
<P>
In the Rams' regular 3-4 defense, he's a starting inside linebacker. In the 
Eagle, he moves to nose-backer. In the team's "nickel" or pass defense, 
Strickland plays down in the trenches as a defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear every day how the players are getting bigger and stronger and 
faster," Strickland said. "And I think with this defense, you can actually see 
that. It's no longer just because a person weighs this much and is this high or 
this fast he's just going to play that position. Chicago came up with it first, 
when they had Refrigerator (William Perry) playing at fullback. He ran pass 
patterns, and caught a touchdown pass. That started a new era, with them 
saying, not just big guys are made for the line, and not just small guys are 
made to just play linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
The game, of course, has been evolving all along. For years, Lawrence Taylor of 
the New York Giants has been darting and blitzing like a defensive end from his 
outside linebacker position, prompting other teams to follow suit. The Rams 
used the mold to form Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
But playing an active linebacker such as Strickland at defensive tackle was a 
new wrinkle that raised a few eyebrows around the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a surprise to people that you could play Strickland in the line 
and have him do well," Coach John Robinson said. "When we were talking about it 
in the spring, people were laughing at us. They said, 'You can't do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes they could. And Strickland hopes to become a roving menace that 
opponents can't ignore. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looked at a lot more," Strickland said. " 'Is he going to stay here? Is 
he going to drop? Is he going to blitz?' Staying in one spot, that gets boring 
after a while. You're standing there, and it's 'OK, I line up right here, I 
read this guy, and that's it.' With this, I can stand up over the center, I 
don't have to get in a three-point stance. I like it. It makes them aware." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland said he actually lobbied to play defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I wanted to rush, I didn't care where," Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
There were adjustments, of course. "At first I thought it would be easy," 
Strickland said. "I thought my speed was going to help me, that I was just 
going to get by them. But when I started playing over a guard, it was a lot 
harder, because speed didn't help there. I had nowhere to run. I was getting 
bounced back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
The answer for Strickland was putting on weight. He has added about 15 pounds 
and now weighs about 255. "And I'm still running well, and dropping into 
coverages fine," he said. "And my pass rush has not slowed down at all." 
</P>
<P>
So the next time you see Strickland following Roger Craig out of the backfield 
on a pass pattern, think of Olsen chasing Sayers. And take another good, long 
look at the Fred Strickland model. Soon, everybody in the league is going to 
have one. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The team considered putting linebacker Larry Kelm on injured reserve Thursday 
but decided against it. Kelm, expected to start the season at inside 
linebacker, will miss his fifth consecutive game this week because of the foot 
injury suffered in the Phoenix exhibition game on Aug. 21.Tight end Vernon 
Kirk, who was on the non-football injury list, was released. Kirk tested 
positive for steroid use on Aug. 29, but was never expected to make the final 
roster. . . . Cornerback LeRoy Irvin, suspended Aug. 29 for violating the 
league's substance-abuse policy, will return to practice Monday. . . . The Rams 
fell 14,835 tickets shy of selling out Sunday's game and lifting the local 
blackout.

RETIRED RACE CAR DRIVER GINTHER IS DEAD AT AGE 59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richie Ginther, a retired race car driver, died Wednesday in France, apparently 
of a heart attack. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
Ginther was stricken while on vacation in Touzac, a village near Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning his career in Southern California sports car racing in 1951, 
Ginther eventually moved to the international Formula One circuit, where he 
drove for Ferrari, BRM and Honda. 
</P>
<P>
A mechanic for a Southern California Ferrari importer, Ginther got into Formula 
One racing almost by accident. While visiting the Ferrari plant, he was asked 
to test-drive a car because the driver who usually did it was ill. He was so 
impressive that he later was asked to join the Ferrari team. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on the Ferrari team at the same time I was and he did a tremendous job 
of helping to develop the new Formula One cars," said Phil Hill, who became the 
first American Formula One champion in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Ginther won his first and only Grand Prix race in 1965 at Mexico City. Driving 
a Honda, he edged Dan Gurney. His highest finish in the season standings was 
second in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
A pint-sized man with a trademark grin, Ginther was seriously injured in 1966, 
when he broke his collarbone, several ribs and cracked his pelvis when he 
slammed into a tree in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Expected to be 
sidelined for at least six weeks, Ginther was racing three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
He moved into Indy car racing in 1967 but retired later that year after failing 
to qualify for the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
Ginther was also recognized as one of the top developmental mechanics in 
racing. He helped develop the aerodynamic tail spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
While testing a Ferrari, Ginther noticed that handling problems were caused by 
aerodynamic lift. He solved the problem by adding a tail to spoil the air flow 
across the rear of the car, reducing lift. 
</P>
<P>
He formed Richie Ginther Racing after retiring, then, after selling the 
business, toured the country in a motor home before building a house in 
Rosarita Beach, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Ginther told friends that the time he spent in the motor home was the most 
freedom he'd ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hollywood on Aug. 5, 1930, Ginther lived in Granada Hills before moving 
to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Ginther is survived by his wife, Cleo, and a son, Greg, from a previous 
marriage. No funeral services are planned. A family spokesman asked that 
donations be made to the World Wildlife Foundation.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: WALSH, TRYING NEW AIR ATTACK, HAS HIT SOME ROUGH 
SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Walsh, who will work the Raiders' game at Denver Sunday, will be on a 
telecast coming into Los Angeles for the first time since he was hired as NBC's 
top football commentator. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd rather be going into Fargo, N.D.," he said on the phone from San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, of course, was kidding, but entering Week 3 of the National Football 
League season, he really isn't too sure about this broadcasting business. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how things are going, Walsh said: "I can't give you a lot of bravado, at 
least not yet. Maybe at the end of this first season I can look back and say, 
'Yeah, everything is great.' But I can't say that now." 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds as though Walsh, who coached the San Francisco 49ers to three 
Super Bowl victories during the 1980s, has been humbled a bit by a career 
change, that does seems to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh worked six practice telecasts, five with partner Dick Enberg, during the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the first week of the regular season, he worked Chicago-Cincinnati. He 
offered some strong opinions, but at times he talked over Enberg and once, 
early in the game, gave the wrong score. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I realized what I did, I was panicked about how I would get out of this," 
Walsh said. "I could feel the beads of sweat on my forehead." 
</P>
<P>
Enberg got him out, and Walsh made light of the mistake. "By the way, Dick, I 
just figured out the score," he said on the air. "I didn't know where the 
scoreboard was." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Walsh and Enberg worked the Rams' game against Indianapolis, 
which, because of the NFL's blackout policy, wasn't shown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"My mechanics were better but my substance not as good as the first week," 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
He made his biggest faux pas when Jim Everett set a Ram record by completing 14 
straight passes. 
</P>
<P>
Enberg: "The NFL record for most consecutive passes completed is 22. Do you 
know who the quarterback was?" 
</P>
<P>
Walsh: "It has to be Ken Anderson." 
</P>
<P>
Enberg: "No. How about Joe Montana?" 
</P>
<P>
Walsh: "Oh, that's right. It shows you I'm slipping." 
</P>
<P>
Enberg: "That happens once you get into the broadcast booth." 
</P>
<P>
Although Walsh is confident about his knowledge of the game and his ability to 
communicate the technical aspects of it, he concedes that he has weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"What I need to work on is the banter with Dick," Walsh said. "I need to come 
back with more snappy comments. 
</P>
<P>
"In this area, I may never reach the level of a John Madden or a Dan Dierdorf, 
but I can improve as I get more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Since Walsh left the 49ers, some of the players have criticized him for his 
austere and autocratic ways. 
</P>
<P>
Of the switch to George Seifert as coach, Montana said: "It's like driving down 
the freeway and you open the window and get a breath of fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
Said Walsh: "At first, I was hurt by some of the comments, but I think it was a 
case of players closing ranks and showing unity toward their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Closing ranks and showing unity is a philosophy I preached, and ironically, I 
was a victim of my own philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have talked to most of the players involved. . . . Joe and I talk 
frequently." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL, which has a strict blackout policy because it believes telecasts hurt 
attendance, should take a look at the college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Even though ABC will televise Saturday's USC-UCLA "doubleheader" locally, a 
crowd of 70,000 is expected at the Coliseum for USC-Ohio State and another 
75,000 is expected at the Rose Bowl for UCLA-Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC announcers will be Gary Bender and Dick Vermeil on the 12:30 p.m. 
USC-Ohio State game, with Cheryl Miller handling sideline duties, and Keith 
Jackson and Bob Griese on the 5 p.m. UCLA-Michigan game, with Mike Adamle on 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Being a sideline reporter is sort of a thankless, non-glory job. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest part is dodging players as they run out of bounds," Miller 
cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Adamle said: "The key is to enhance the telecast without intruding. If I get on 
the air three or four times, then I've had a great day." 
</P>
<P>
Some others who have worked as sideline reporters have fancied themselves as 
comedians, but it has never worked. 
</P>
<P>
Adamle said: "I'm not out there to audition for David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
Said Miller: "You have to keep everything short and sweet, 10 to 15 seconds. 
And if it's a real good game, you won't see me at all." 
</P>
<P>
ABC first used sideline reporters in 1974, hiring two college students. One was 
Don Tollefson of Stanford, the other Jim Lampley, a North Carolina graduate 
student. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, ABC last season scrapped those terrible halftime interviews with 
the coaches, the ones in which the reporter would grab a coach, yell a 
question, and the coach would yell something back and run off. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting rid of those was a good idea," Adamle said. "They were meaningless. 
The coaches never had anything to say." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, former USC and Olympic basketball star, is well known in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
But some people might not recall that Adamle was a pretty good football player. 
</P>
<P>
A running back at Northwestern, Adamle, 39, was the Big Ten's most valuable 
player in 1970. He played six years in the NFL, two each with the Kansas City 
Chiefs, the New York Jets and the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, he started four games in the backfield with a rookie named Walter 
Payton. "That's something I can tell the grandkids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamle was a sports anchorman for the ABC affiliate in Chicago until last 
December and now works full-time for the network. He is also the co-host of the 
syndicated show, "American Gladiators." 
</P>
<P>
When Adamle was at the Coliseum last year for the USC-Oklahoma game, he spotted 
a girl he dated five years earlier in Chicago, Michelle Stringini, who moved to 
Los Angeles to get into the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
The romance was rekindled, and the two were married last month. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
The CBS pro football game Sunday at 10 a.m. is San Francisco at Philadelphia, 
with Verne Lundquist and Terry Bradshaw reporting. . . . A good way to start an 
NFL Sunday is with ESPN's "NFL GameDay," at 8:30 a.m. It's a one-hour pregame 
show that is more thorough than the half-hour shows on NBC and CBS. . . . A 
good way to finish an NFL Sunday is with ESPN's "NFL PrimeTime" at 4:15 p.m., 
followed at 5:15 by "NFL Dream Season." Sunday's featured "Dream Season" game 
has the 1976 Raiders facing the 1969 Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5 will carry the Angels' 10:30 a.m. games at Cleveland Saturday and 
Sunday. With Bob Starr busy with UCLA and Ram radio broadcasts, Joe Torre will 
do the play-by-play. Reggie Jackson will again be the fill-in commentator 
Saturday, with Johnny Bench taking over that job Sunday. A Channel 5 spokesman 
said the station has been getting a lot of favorable reaction to Jackson's 
work. . . . With the Angels idle Monday, KMPC will carry the Oakland broadcast 
of the Athletics' home game with Texas that night. . . . The USA network is 
offering live coverage of the Ryder Cup matches at Sutton Coldfield, England, 
this weekend, beginning at 8 a.m. today and Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday. The 
announcers are Joel Meyers, Gary McCord, Ben Wright, Don Wade and Jim Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Good news for cable subscribers who get WGN. The Chicago station that carries 
the Cubs will also show 25 Bull games this season and 45 White Sox games next 
year. . . . The new face on ESPN's late-night "Sports-Center" is Carolyn Burns, 
who joined the cable network from San Francisco's KRON-TV. . . . Norm Wiles, 
the Pasadena fireman who won the privilege of announcing an inning of a Dodger 
telecast on SportsChannel as part of the Think Blue Week promotion in June, is 
announcing high school football for a San Dimas cable company. . . . Brian 
Quinn, Loyola Marymount's athletic director, will be a guest panelist on 
Channel 2's "At Issue" Sunday at 7:30 a.m. to discuss Propositions 42 and 48.

THIS TIME, GIANTS RALLY FOR 4-3 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS AGAIN CAN'T HOLD LEAD; CLARK IS INJURED 
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Eddie Murray's 20th home run dropped into the right-field seats Thursday 
night, giving the Dodgers a 2-1 lead over San Francisco in the sixth inning, 
one question remained: How would the Giants come back this time? 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, with most of a quiet crowd of 24,896 at Candlestick Park 
wondering what was taking so long, the answer appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Oberkfell bounced a pinch RBI single, and Brett Butler followed by lining a 
two-run double as the Giants rebounded for the third straight night to complete 
a three-game series sweep with a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a five-game lead over San Diego with nine games remaining, about the 
all the National League West leaders lack are new adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
Said Oberkfell: "Amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Butler: "I'm smelling the gloves, I'm smelling the grass, I'm smelling the 
roses . . . I'm having such a good time." 
</P>
<P>
These Giants are becoming so giddy, they were walking around their clubhouse 
late Thursday night as if a certain All-Star first baseman wasn't sitting in 
front of his locker with a bandage on his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark left the game in the third inning with a bruised knee after Dodger 
catcher Mike Scioscia fell on him following a first-inning home plate 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
The National League's co-batting leader with a .337 average should be back 
within a couple of days, which sounds better than he looked as he limped off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Will, you scared the heck out of us," Giant owner Bob Lurie told him in the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't mean to," Clark said with a smile. "I could be back as soon as 
(today)." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' seventh-inning work provided a fitting ending to three nights on 
which they overcame three Dodger leads in the fifth inning or later. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, not only did we feel we could come back, our opponents also felt 
it," Butler said. "I know, because I felt it when the Dodgers did it to us last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger starter Ramon Martinez began the seventh with that 2-1 lead and 
confidence. After allowing an RBI double to Kevin Mitchell in the first -- it 
was Clark who scored and then was smothered by Scioscia -- Martinez stopped the 
Giants on three hits over the next five innings. 
</P>
<P>
And in the bottom of the sixth, after Murray followed a Lenny Harris single 
with his homer off Kelly Downs, Martinez had worked out of a none-out, 
runners-on-first-and-third jam. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out Mike Laga, got Kevin Mitchell to pop out and made Earnest Riles 
foul out. 
</P>
<P>
But Matt Williams led off the seventh with a single up the middle. Terry 
Kennedy followed with a sacrifice bunt that Murray fielded and threw late to 
second, making both runners safe. 
</P>
<P>
After Donell Nixon pinch-ran for Kennedy, pinch-hitter Chris Speier's bunt 
forced Williams at third base. 
</P>
<P>
But then pinch-hitter Oberkfell singled to right, his 14th pinch hit of the 
season, tying him for the league lead and scoring Nixon from second with the 
tying run. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot, we were just down one run with three innings to go," said Oberkfell 
with a smile. "We knew we were still in this game." 
</P>
<P>
After Scott Garrelts ran for Oberkfell, reliever Ray Searage replaced Martinez. 
Two pitches later, the Giants took the lead as Butler doubled into the 
left-field to score both runners. 
</P>
<P>
Moaned Searage: "The little pest." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Butler, who is hitting .284 and considered the top leadoff batter in 
the league: "I'll take that compliment. When I first joined this team, Mike 
Krukow told me he used to hate to pitch to me because I would foul off 15 
pitches and then get a hit to left field. That's fine. I relish that role." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said he and the rest of the Giants also relish the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something all of us dream of," he said, "to get up there with a chance to 
get the big hit. Everyone in our clubhouse wants to be in that situation now." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia's ninth homer, in the ninth inning off reliever Steve Bedrosian, made 
things closer. But all of the comebacks in the house had already been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Wednesday's stunning 8-7 loss, Jay Howell, who allowed four 
of the five runs in the Giants' ninth-inning rally, said he's not going to 
touch a baseball for several days. Afer compiling an 0.75 earned-run average in 
his first 49 appearances, he has a 14.40 ERA in his last three apperances, 
including blowing two wins for Fernando Valenzuela and another for John 
Wetteland. "I'm a little bit tired right now, and I have to be smart enough to 
step away from it," said Howell, who hasn't appeared in this many games (53) 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser, hit in the right foot with a line drive Tuesday night, has been 
limping. He said he still plans to start against San Diego at Dodger Stadium 
Sunday, keeping alive one of baseball's more remarkable streaks. In his 
six-year career he has never missed a start -- Sunday will be No. 190. . . . 
The Giants set a new season club attendance record of 1,934,717. . . . The 
Dodgers have drawn less than that figure only five times in their 28 years in 
Dodger Stadium.

LPGA TOURNAMENT AT BUENA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
TURNER CATCHES WALTERS TO SHARE FIRST-ROUND LEAD WITH 67 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WALTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Walters, who has missed more cuts than she has made this season, had it 
all going her way Thursday, taking the early lead with a five-under-par 67 in 
the LPGA's $300,000 MBS golf tournament at Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
That was the good news. The not-so-good news was that the player who caught up 
with her later in the afternoon with birdies on the final two holes is Sherri 
Turner. Turner and Walters share a two-stroke lead over five players at Los 
Coyotes Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, Amy Alcott, Jody Rosenthal, Patty Rizzo -- who missed a one-foot 
putt on No. 18 -- and Jill Briles, a third-year pro who earned $27,157 last 
year, all shot 69s. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, the leading-money winner during 1988, missed the cut last week in 
Seattle and showed up here ready to do some work. 
</P>
<P>
"She is working hard this week," said Turner's caddy, Jean Darden, Thursday at 
the practice range, where Turner was still hitting in the 90-degree heat after 
her round had been completed. "She came in here Monday and started beating 
balls. She practiced and practiced." 
</P>
<P>
Turner is determined enough to play well this week that she also bowed out of 
the pro-am Wednesday so that she could practice. 
</P>
<P>
Turner has won once this year, in the third week of the season in Hawaii. She 
is eighth on the earnings list with $187,742 but has fallen off the level of 
consistency she displayed in 1988, when she had 17 top-10 finishes. She has had 
seven this season, and this is her farewell tour stop. She was close to going 
home after missing the cut in Seattle, having made plane reservations, but 
changed her mind at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last (official) tournament she is playing this year, and she said, 
'Let's have some fun, ' " Darden said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner had an eagle on the 12th hole, a 455-yard par-five, to go with five 
birdies against two bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been so frustrated (this season)," Turner said. "I've been putting a 
lot of pressure on myself to play well and I just haven't. But (today), I felt 
things were going real well." 
</P>
<P>
Walters, in her fifth year on the tour, grew up in British Columbia but 
attended Florida State, where she was an All-American in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Walters' best career finish was a tie for third in 1987, and she has never led 
a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 22 outings this season, she has missed the cut 13 times, finished in the 
money nine times, and withdrew once -- when the state of her game was in such 
disrepair that she walked off the course at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Seattle, however, she played her best golf of the year and 
finished tied for 15th. 
</P>
<P>
"I started putting really well last week," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Having landed at the top of the leader board for the first time in her LPGA 
career, Walters discovered that she is very comfortable there. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players say they are more comfortable a few shots off the lead, that it's 
easier to strike from behind and things like that," she said. "I feel very good 
where I am. I wouldn't trade with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Walters was hard-pressed to oblige the substantial concern about poor greens at 
the Los Coyote Country Club course. She sank putts of 30, 15, and 10 feet along 
with a couple of four-footers and a two-footer for birdies in her morning 
round. She made only one bogey -- at the par-three seventh hole, when she hit 
an eight-iron 15 feet over the green on the 149-yard hole. She left herself a 
slippery downhill chip that ran by the cup by seven feet and made the putt 
coming back. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens weren't a problem at all," Walters said. "They were faster then 
they had been during my practice round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a good putter isn't bothered by the type of greens. Good putters can 
putt on anything." 
</P>
<P>
The greens became more beat up and bumpier as the afternoon rounds were played. 
</P>
<P>
Players had been concerned coming into the tournament that the greens, which 
had been damaged by a fungus earlier in the summer, would be difficult to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us as a whole have putted them (the greens) well considering the stress 
conditions mother nature has put them under," said Pat Bradley, who shot a 69 
and was in the five-player cluster in second place.

ARLINGTON RACECOURSE, DESTROYED BY FIRE IN 1985, IS NOW BETTER THAN EVER 
</P>

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
Any race track that has a Sunday Silence sundae on its dining-room menu can't 
be all bad. 
</P>
<P>
But that $2.95 concoction, named after the Kentucky Derby winner and a 
combination of homemade ice cream smothered with a jillion calories, is only a 
small reason for liking Arlington International Racecourse, the rebuilt grande 
dame of Midwest racing in this northwest Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
There are bigger, and better, reasons for liking the new Arlington, which is 
the result of 19 months of construction and an estimated $175 million of owner 
Dick Duchossois' money. The track opened 2 1/2 months ago, about four years 
after the original plant was destroyed by fire. The inaugural meeting will 
continue through Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to find a fan or a horseman who will knock the place. Charlie 
Rose, an assistant to New York trainer John Veitch, has brought a couple of 
horses here. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard so many raves about the place that when I came here in July, I 
didn't expect it to live up to all those notices," Rose said. "But it did. It 
is just as good as everybody says it is." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Price, who owned and trained Carry Back when he won the Kentucky Derby in 
1961, lives in Florida and is visiting a Chicago race track for the first time 
in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is like the Louvre," Price said as he looked around. "Check that. 
It's nicer than the Louvre." 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for the new Arlington lies solely with Duchossois (dush-a-SWAH), 
a 68-year-old workaholic businessman whose company employs 8,500 people, makes 
railroad cars and automatic garage-door openers and has seven radio stations 
and a television station. Duchossois also owns Quad City Downs, a harness 
track, and races horses and operates Hill 'n Dale Farm, a 400-acre estate where 
he stands Zev, Illinois' most important stallion. 
</P>
<P>
A newcomer to racing, Duchossois wasn't interested in horses until one of his 
four children started riding saddlebreds in state competitions. In 1983, 
Duchossois and three partners paid $19 million to buy a deteriorating Arlington 
Park from Gulf &amp; Western. Although Duchossois put up most of the money, he 
remained in the background while the others ran the track. 
</P>
<P>
One of the partners, Joe Joyce, had worked for Gulf &amp; Western and was 
largely responsible for starting the Arlington Million, thoroughbred racing's 
first million-dollar race, in 1981. The Million was designed to give the ailing 
track a transfusion by importing top grass runners around the world to Chicago 
to run against America's turf stars. 
</P>
<P>
The Million was a moderate success for four years, failing to attract Europe's 
best horses but turning into a personal showcase for John Henry, the 
charismatic gelding who won two of the races and finished second another time. 
</P>
<P>
On July 30, 1985, 25 days before the fifth Million, Duchossois, a widower, 
attended a birthday party with Phyllis Diller, his good friend. When Duchossois 
returned home, he got a phone call from Joyce with news that there was a fire 
at the track. The fire continued the next day, wiping out the grandstand and 
most of the track offices. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, Arlington was still able to run the Million, by removing the 
grandstand rubble and replacing it with tents and portable bleachers that gave 
the track a county fair atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies offered a settlement reported to be $60 million, and 
Duchossois used some of the money to buy out Joyce and the other partners, who 
say that financially they did better that way. 
</P>
<P>
Duchossois went from a silent partner to a 100% owner who got involved in 
everything. The track operated on the same makeshift basis for two years, then 
closed last year while construction continued on the renamed Arlington 
International. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that when something bad happens, something good can come of 
it," Duchossois said. "The most fitting thing of all was that the year we ran 
what we called the Miracle Million (1985), Teleprompter, an English horse owned 
by Lord Derby himself, won the race. Because of that, the whole world knew what 
Arlington accomplished on the heels of the fire. We took a tragedy and turned 
it into an international display of good will." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Duchossois has turned a setting out of Currier &amp; Ives into a sleek, 
cosmopolitan racing facility that operators of Garden State Park and the 
Birmingham Turf Club wished they had settled for when their tracks were built 
in recent years. Both Garden State, near Philadelphia, and Birmingham, in 
Alabama, were extravagant examples of construction overkill, facilities that 
were too big, too opulent -- and too expensive -- for their market areas. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington International may have cost a lot of money -- and only Duchossois 
himself knows exactly what it cost -- but in the mind of its builder, it is a 
realistically sized plant. When the Arlington Million was run for the ninth 
time on the Sunday before Labor Day, management actually worked at keeping the 
crowd down -- to around 30,000 -- so that everybody would be comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't California," says Duchossois, who races horses with trainer Charlie 
Whittingham on the West Coast. "A big crowd for us on a Saturday is 20,000. 
We've got room to expand, but we don't use our infield for spectators and what 
we've tried to do is build a facility where everybody can enjoy a day at the 
races." 
</P>
<P>
Duchossois is also attempting to lure new, younger fans to Arlington, which is 
the goal of tracks everywhere. There is a high-tech video area in the six-story 
plant where fans can punch up interviews with racing personalities explaining 
the intricacies of the sport. The same monitors also provide history lessons, 
flashing highlights from the careers of some of racing's most famous horses. 
There are several picnic areas and the yellow and white tents, familiar 
holdovers from the post-fire years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relative smallness of the plant, it is easy to see how the cost 
escalated, because Duchossois spent lavishly in many areas. Just outside the 
video center, one level down and overlooking the amphitheater paddock, is a 
life-size bronze depicting the finish of the first Million, in which John Henry 
and Bill Shoemaker nipped The Bart and Eddie Delahoussaye at the wire. The 
statue is called "Against All Odds," which Duchossois says describes the 
resurgence of Arlington as well as the fairy-tale career of John Henry, a 
mean-spirited horse who passed from owner to owner before he started winning 
major races. 
</P>
<P>
Among the things that impress Whittingham about Arlington are the sight lines. 
At many race tracks, one of the basics -- seeing the horses run -- can't be 
taken for granted, but here there are 12,000 seats with unobstructed views. The 
cantilevered roofs at both ends of the grandstand have no vertical structural 
supports and actually resemble giant Concorde bookends. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington may also lead the country's tracks in television monitors per square 
foot. There are 800 monitors, with a TV set at most tables in the main dining 
room, as well as at many of the box seats. The running of each race is also 
accompanied by the best sound system in racing. A fan anywhere in the plant can 
hear every word of ebullient Phil Georgeff's race call, and the volume is 
intentionally turned up when the horses hit the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Have there been any complants? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes. Someone said that the hamburgers at the concession stands are 
overpriced. Still, they are less expensive than those sold at Saratoga. And 
some of the old guard would feel more comfortable being able to flick their 
cigar butts, but when the floors are marbled, carpeted or both, that's not 
acceptable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"The place is so rich that I feel like taking my shoes off, so I won't leave 
any footprints," one bettor said. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the high rollers and corporate groups, Arlington has built 19 
sky boxes, unfurnished suites that accommodate a minimum of 20 people and rent 
for $60,000 a year with a three-year lease. One source said that the track has 
not been overwhelmed with applicants, but Duchossois said that he got enough 
response to almost rent each box twice. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've decided to do is rent most of them on a daily basis, for parties," 
Duchossois said. "It costs $1,000 a day for a group to use them." 
</P>
<P>
The early problems for Arlington International have been behind the scenes. The 
track is suing a large Chicago architectural firm for $20 million, charging 
that plans were submitted late, forcing the track to hire a general contractor 
without competitive bidding and causing cost overruns. In response, the 
architects say that Arlington is eight months late in paying the last $1 
million of the $6.3-million fee. 
</P>
<P>
The architects, who specialize in office buildings and museums, had no 
experience designing a race track. They were specifically selected because they 
would be open-minded with their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Duchossois, a decorated Army major during World War II, will not be an easy 
opponent in this legal battle, giving ground no more readily than he has in 
skirmishes with the racing commission, the state legislature and other Chicago 
tracks over racing dates, off-track betting territories and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
People who work for Duchossois are used to the same 14-hour days he subjects 
himself to. Duchossois says he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington's employees must follow rules that are highly unusual for race track 
personnel. Betting during working hours is verboten, and mutuel clerks won't 
punch out a ticket if they recognize a fellow employee across the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"After this weekend, a lot of my people are going to get a week off," 
Duchossois said before the Million. "They've been working under a lot of 
pressure, first in the rush to get ready for the opening, and then getting set 
for the Million." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Arlington didn't mention a respite for himself. In fact, he 
scheduled a vacation for November, then canceled it.

19 DIE AS SCHOOL BUS, HIT BY TRUCK, SINKS IN WATERY PIT

<P>
At least 19 students died and dozens more were injured when their fully loaded 
school bus plunged into a water-filled gravel pit Thursday morning after it was 
was hit by a truck carrying soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, on its way to nearby Mission junior and senior high schools, had just 
picked up two more students when it was hit by the truck. Many of the students 
were standing in the aisles. Initial reports were that the blow by the truck 
was glancing, perhaps because bus driver Gilbert Pena was swerving to avoid the 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, possibly carrying as many as 80 students, went flying into the 
unbarricaded gravel pit just beside the road, plunged 40 feet to the water, 
flipped upside down and came to rest on its side. It then sank and was 
completely under water. 
</P>
<P>
Screaming children trapped in the bus struggled to get out through open windows 
and the bus door. Many of those who did get out stood on the bus and waited for 
help to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The collision was the worst accident involving a school bus in Texas history 
and the third-worst school bus accident ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"I just freaked out," said Alex DeLeon, 18, as he described the bus falling 
headlong as he held tight to the seat in front of him. He said he grabbed his 
sister, Regina, pushed her out the window and then pulled himself free. "I was 
on the outside in a second." 
</P>
<P>
Many others did not make it, including Raul Flores, who had not planned to go 
to school, but his mother had insisted. In the aftermath of the crash, the 
boy's mother wept and said it was her fault that her son was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Another mother had to be taken by ambulance from the crash site after she saw 
the bodies of her two teen-age daughters pulled from the bus. 
</P>
<P>
A young man walked up to DeLeon as he stood in front of the Mission Hospital 
Thursday afternoon. The two shook hands and then DeLeon shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Your brother didn't make it, man," DeLeon said. 
</P>
<P>
The young man, sobbing, with shoulders drooping, walked slowly back to his car. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, David Valadez complained bitterly about what he thought was inaction by 
police officers and firemen at the scene, saying that he saw only one policeman 
swim to the bus while others only urged the students to grab ropes that had 
been tossed over the steep rocky cliff. He said also that medical care was not 
administered quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of kids who could have survived if they had been given 
(cardiopulmonary resuscitation)," said Valadez, who rushed to the scene because 
he feared his children were on the bus. They weren't, because his wife had 
taken them to school. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America, and this shouldn't happen. You had a lot of people in shock 
and the police were not doing anything to treat it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several others echoed Valadez's complaints, saying that Lt. Rudolfo Reyes of 
the Alton Police Department was the only policeman who initially went in the 
water to pull the children out. Reyes said he did go down a ladder that was 
already in place when he arrived but was reluctant to say anything more about 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much I can say about that," he said. "The citizens and children of 
Alton are our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 7:40 a.m. at a spot where two arrow-straight roads 
intersect in this rural area dotted with orange groves. The truck, driven by a 
man identified as Ruben Perez of Mission, was on one road and the bus was on 
the other. Texas Highway Patrol Sgt. Dave Baker said that the accident was 
still under investigation and no charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said also that a team from the National Transportation Safety Board was 
en route to conduct its own investigation. He said he had heard reports that 
Perez said his brakes had failed when he tried to stop at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
DeLeon and other survivors said the truck driver ran a stop sign. The truck 
remained alongside the road after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Roads were dry and the weather was clear at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to look at everything from front to back," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
When police officers and ambulances arrived, the students, ranging in age from 
12 to 18, were taken to several area hospitals, and a command post was set up 
at the Mission Community Center. One officer estimated that at least 125 
emergency vehicles were used during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Lists of the students were compiled, one of the living and one of the dead. As 
relatives poured into the center, they were told to go either to a hospital or 
to a temporary morgue to help identify the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Women wailed in abject grief when told to go to the morgue. And, at the 
hospitals, more relatives crowded into the lobbies, waiting for news of their 
kin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a nightmare," hospital worker Maria Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a bad year for the people of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and the 
string of towns adjacent to the Mexican border. Last summer, a department store 
collapsed in Brownsville, killing 14 people and injuring 47. Then Hurricane 
Gilbert, one of the worst in memory, hit the valley last fall, followed by the 
discovery this spring of a string of ritualistic murders in nearby Matamoros, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As the day went on, counselors and ministers visited the families of the dead, 
while the curious tried to talk their way past police barricades to the crash 
site. The last of the bodies was brought up by divers about two hours after the 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's worst school bus accident occurred in 1976, when a bus plunged off 
a freeway ramp, killing 28 Yuba City, Calif., high school students and a 
teacher. In 1959, 27 people were killed when a bus went into a creek in 
Prestonsburg, Ky.

TINY ASH WHITEFLY LAYING SIEGE TO TREES AND TEMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Mueller, a gardening enthusiast, has abandoned her hobby because a 
swirling white cloud of pinhead-sized flies has invaded every corner of her 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
When the Van Nuys woman must go outside, she wears two bandannas to protect her 
hair and ears. She waves her hands to keep tiny flies off her body and 
frequently coughs and puffs air out her nose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's driving me crazy. They are all over. You wonder if you are breathing them 
in," she said, exasperated. "It's horrifying. When I touch my plants, a cloud 
rises up in my face." 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of summer, the wrath of the ash whitefly, a pest without 
enemies, reached an explosive crescendo throughout Southern California, 
attacking millions of trees and prompting an unprecedented outcry from 
fly-tormented homeowners, especially in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
From Van Nuys to Glendora in Los Angeles County and throughout most of Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, thousands upon thousands of residents 
who have long found cool comfort beneath their shade trees are under siege by 
what is perhaps the most menacing insect to have swept into residential 
neighborhoods, agricultural officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecues have been canceled or ruined. Patio furniture has stayed in the 
garage. Housework has doubled. Many residents have purchased car covers and 
others keep a bucket of cleaning solution on hand to wipe flies and their 
sticky droppings off windshields. 
</P>
<P>
Windows stay closed. The insects stick to hair like dandruff. Simply chatting 
outside with a neighbor is an arm-flailing exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had anything that comes close to matching the citizen-based outcry 
over this," said Bob Atkins, Los Angeles County deputy agricultural 
commissioner for pest prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"They are everywhere. Everywhere!" said Lynn Olson of Glendora, whose front and 
back yard trees are teeming with flies. "Some days I feel like taking an ax to 
every tree on the block. It's so frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, Atkins said his office has received up to 200 calls 
a day from fly-tormented homeowners, forcing officials to install a tape 
recording. Throughout the county, local city officials say they too are 
receiving scores of calls. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no good news for callers. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually nothing can stop the flies, entomologists said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immune to Sprays 
</P>
<P>
They multiply with lightning speed and have wax-coated wings that are almost 
immune to pesticide sprays. Residents who do spray find only a few hours 
respite from the swarms and inadvertently kill insects that can be beneficial 
to gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Others have turned to drilling holes in their trees and inserting intravenous 
capsules that leach pesticides in the hope that lethal doses will eventually 
flow far enough to kill the leaf-sucking flies. Agriculture officials 
discourage the practice because it is only a temporary fly killer and repeated 
boring kills trees. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, some residents are screwing high-pressure nozzles on their 
garden hoses and shooting water on their infested trees in an attempt to blast 
away the pests. 
</P>
<P>
The flies come right back. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is tell people to deep water and fertilize their trees to keep 
them as healthy as possible," Atkins said. "Unfortunately, that's not what 
people want to hear. We are used to quick kills with pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
The flies attack a wide variety of trees, attaching themselves like white 
crusts and laying eggs on the undersides of leaves. The flies are slowly 
sucking the life out of two of the region's most popular shade trees -- ash and 
ornamental pear. 
</P>
<P>
But they also have an appetite for others, including loquat, pomegranate, 
Christmas berry, peach and plum. They will also latch onto citrus, but it is 
not a primary "host tree," agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Infested trees will "live under stress" for several years before dying. 
</P>
<P>
The flies, which were first detected in July, 1988, by a Van Nuys 
vegetable-stand owner, have no natural predators in Southern California, the 
first North American region to host the fly. The insect is a native of Europe 
and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ash whitefly was identified by state entomologists, it had 
spread throughout Los Angeles County, free from European species of wasps and 
ladybugs that control the flies in their native lands. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say the main hope for ash whitefly control is to import 
the enemy insects. This week, a state entomologist who is in Italy sent back 
two boxes of the stingerless wasps and ladybugs to UC Riverside, where the 
insects will be studied. 
</P>
<P>
If the predators can survive and breed in Southern California, feed off the 
whitefly and not become destructive pests themselves, they could be turned on 
the ash whitefly as early as next spring, said Thomas Bellows, UC Riverside 
associate professor of entomology and the whitefly expert supervising the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Then, it would take anywhere from two to eight years before residents will 
detect any kind of population reduction, agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Early predictions of devasting effects on the state's $831-million-a-year 
nursery industry have not come to pass, state agricultural officials and 
several large growers said. The infestation has not struck the mammoth 
$634-million citrus industry either. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the flies have been mainly attracted to big, healthy trees growing 
along residential streets and shading the back yards of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Infested trees rain droplets of a molasses-like substance -- the ultimate 
insult, fly excrement. When the flies swarm, the excretion floats through the 
air and settles like sticky dew. Dead, sticky leaves turn moldy and drop onto 
the sticky ground. The sweet substance attracts ants. 
</P>
<P>
"The floor, the furniture, the mini-blinds, everything is coated with sticky 
stuff," said June Amacher, 67, of Glendora. "Leaves stick to the cat, my feet 
stick to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Two houses down from Amacher's, the Huntington family keeps a bucket of soapy 
water and a squeegee on the porch to wash their car windows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pain. Every time I drive, I have to clean the windows or else I can't 
see," said Troy Huntington, 17. "And if I walk outside barefoot, it doesn't 
feel so good." 
</P>
<P>
In Whittier, Sylvia Ochoa, 34, said a recent back yard gathering was ruined 
when flies began swirling around her guests. First, her friends thought the 
nearby hills were on fire because so much ash was floating in the air. 
</P>
<P>
No, Ochoa told them, it was the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
"Then for some reason the flies were attracted to the ladies with hair spray," 
Ochoa said. "It was kind of funny, they all left with white flies stuck to 
their hair." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 miles south, Lorean Wirt of Cerritos was dumbfounded several weeks ago 
when she found that her gold car parked beneath the ornamental pear tree was 
covered with a white veil. When she brushed the vehicle, flies swooshed up 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disgusting," the 30-year-old woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she dreads seeing neighbors on her way out to her fly-swathed car. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even want to open my mouth and say hello. I just nod my head, wave and 
get in the car as fast as I can. It's the safest thing to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Van Nuys, the flies were so thick on Enfield Avenue that resident Tom 
Spicklemire is reluctant to fire up the barbecue and grill himself a steak. 
</P>
<P>
"The second you take the meat off the grill, flies start landing on it," he 
said. "It's miserable." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Mueller across the street echoed the wishes of many who have found 
themselves under ash whitefly siege. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for a cold, wet winter," she said. "Maybe that will take care of 
the little devils."

SHEVARDNADZE GIVES BUSH NEW ARMS PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze presented significant new 
proposals to President Bush on Thursday in an effort to break the logjam in 
strategic arms reduction talks, U.S. and Soviet officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that a "general time frame" for the next U.S.-Soviet 
summit should be found during discussions in Wyoming this weekend between 
Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, after nearly two hours of talks between Bush and Shevardnadze, said the 
Soviet foreign minister presented a "long, detailed and technical" letter to 
Bush from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev containing "some new twists" on 
previous Soviet arms positions. 
</P>
<P>
Among those twists were "some concessions," Baker said, although they included 
"some ambiguities." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Among Key Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
A senior Soviet official later said the Gorbachev letter included two major 
position changes involving anti-missile defenses and sea-launched cruise 
missiles, both of which are among key obstacles to concluding a broad new 
agreement in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, known as START. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable U.S. officials characterized the change in the Soviet position on 
missile defenses as "important" and "of some significance." 
</P>
<P>
They attached less importance to the cruise missile position. One U.S. official 
said it was "nothing new -- well-plowed ground." 
</P>
<P>
"The words need to be sorted out," said one official. "There is a lot of 
elliptical language that needs to be nailed down. It's a very important letter, 
but not a breakthrough on every issue." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Bush, Shevardnadze and Baker flew to Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
to begin an intensive weekend of discussions on the proposals contained in the 
letter as well as a broad range of U.S.-Soviet relations, including a date for 
the next summit. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Wyoming, Baker and Shevardnadze huddled in their shirtsleeves in 
the forward cabin of Baker's U.S. Air Force DC-9 for more than three hours, 
holding what a senior U.S. official called "a very intense and unusual kind of 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Gesticulating frequently, sometimes almost nose-to-nose, they debated two 
issues that have bedeviled Gorbachev's reform program: the upsurge of 
separatist movements among the Soviet Union's nationalities, and the Kremlin's 
inability to get serious economic reforms under way. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who participated in the discussion, said Shevardnadze 
admitted that the Kremlin had "made mistakes in the past" in dealing with 
minorities and said that "autonomy was going to become, much more, the hallmark 
of the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence analysts have said that the challenge to Moscow's power from 
several nationalities, especially in the Baltic states, is Gorbachev's most 
serious political problem and could lead to repressive measures. But 
Shevardnadze appeared to say that the Soviet leader has decided on a 
conciliatory tack instead. 
</P>
<P>
Before they left Washington, Baker had hinted that a Bush-Gorbachev meeting, 
the first since Bush's election as President, might occur "next year." But he 
then suggested that "next year" was a theoretical time frame. 
</P>
<P>
Baker provided no reason why a new summit would be scheduled at this time, 
given Bush's remarks earlier this week that he was in "no rush" for such a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that they (Bush and Gorbachev) get together from time to time 
and talk about the full range of the problems between these two countries," 
Baker said. "The President feels that he could productively spend time talking 
about these issues, face to face, with the leader of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Shevardnadze also touched upon other issues in their discussions at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush complained about continued weapons shipments to Nicaragua by Soviet Bloc 
nations, including Cuba, despite a Gorbachev statement that Soviet supplies had 
ceased. Shevardnadze replied that Moscow was "not totally in control of what 
happens with Cuba," Baker said, adding, "We have some difficulty in believing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Bush complimented Moscow on its approach to Eastern European nations that are 
striving for greater democracy and economic independence. 
</P>
<P>
Baker quoted the President as saying that "the Soviet Union had proceeded very 
responsibly and in a very measured way, with respect to changes that are taking 
place -- not just in the Soviet Union, but in Eastern Europe as well." Bush 
also "expressed our desire to see that type of an approach continue," Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On arms control, the Gorbachev letter accepted in principle a U.S.-backed "open 
skies" proposal under which one nation's aircraft would make surveillance 
flights over the other's territory, according to U.S. and Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also endorsed the concept of testing verification procedures for a 
START agreement, even before a treaty on strategic arms is signed and ratified, 
to ensure that they work. 
</P>
<P>
Primary attention was focused, however, on the key issues of strategic defenses 
and sea-launched cruise missiles, since these are among the final roadblocks to 
a START treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The basic difference between the superpowers on missile defenses is that the 
Soviets want the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty reaffirmed based on its 
narrow interpretation -- that it bans tests of anti-missile weapons in space. 
The United States, however, contends that the treaty permits such tests. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has argued that if the United States intends to develop missile 
defenses, it cannot sign a START agreement that cuts offensive nuclear weapons 
in half because extra offensive weapons would be needed to overcome such 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Some easing of the Soviet position has been reported recently, such as allowing 
certain kinds of tests in certain regions of space. Whether Moscow has formally 
accepted this idea, which was broached by some U.S. negotiators but rejected by 
the Reagan Administration, is not known. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration inherited the anti-missile Strategic Defense 
Initiative, or "Star Wars" program, from the Reagan Administration but has been 
less committed to it. Coincidentally, the retirement of Ambassador Henry 
Cooper, who has led the U.S. delegation to the Geneva talks on this issue, is 
seen as a possible signal of U.S. willingness to compromise on "Star Wars," 
since his successor reportedly is less adamant about championing the 
controversial program. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Soviet differences over sea-launched cruise missiles, or SLCMs, also run 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
The United States intends to deploy, without negotiated limits, both 
nuclear-tipped and conventionally armed cruise missiles that can be launched 
from surface ships and submarines. The Soviets want to limit the number and 
range of nuclear SLCMs to prevent the winged weapons from being used to 
circumvent the cuts in ballistic missiles envisaged in START. Distinguishing 
between nuclear and conventional SLCMs is impossible without intolerable 
on-ship inspections, the United States claims. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the Soviets have hinted that they might accept SLCMs of 
longer range than previously, but this is unlikely to break the impasse on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, senior Administration officials believe that missile defenses and 
SLCMs will be "end-game" issues at the U.S.-Soviet talks and that one may be 
traded for the other, such as Soviet permission for anti-missile testing in 
exchange for a U.S. ban on nuclear SLCMs.

COPPER WIRE THEFTS LEAVE DESERT TOWNS HIGH AND DRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
International jewel thieves they are not. But a pesky band of burglars has 
caused a heap of trouble for a string of remote desert towns this summer, 
stealing miles of the copper telephone wires that link the outposts with the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by the high price of copper, thieves have stolen about 55 miles of the 
multistrand bare wire in San Bernardino County and another 80 miles of wire in 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The wire -- either snagged from the ground and tugged down with ropes or 
clipped by thieves who shinny up telephone poles -- is sold to salvage yards, 
which pay up to $1.04 a pound for copper. In San Bernardino County, the thieves 
made off with more than $100,000 worth of wire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual burglaries there have left homes and businesses in the towns of 
Ludlow, Amboy, Cadiz and Danby without phone service periodically since early 
August, with some residents cut off for as long as a month. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, a copper line stretching between Whitewater and Desert 
Center was stolen. Few telephones were affected, but the theft cut service to a 
Cactus City rest stop telephone on Interstate 10 that is the only one within a 
40-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had wire thefts before, but not on this scale," said Riverside County 
Sheriff's Detective Mark Barfnecht. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Burris, 79, elder statesman and sole owner of the privately held 
community of Amboy, said townsfolk for weeks were forced to drive to Twentynine 
Palms, 50 miles away, to make telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The phones are our lifeline, and it's just been terrible, what with all the 
wrecks we get on the highway out here," said Burris, who runs a cafe, motel and 
gas station in Amboy, population 24. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one truck turn over on Amboy Road and the driver lay there for an extra 
hour and a half with a broken back while somebody drove to Twentynine Palms to 
call for help. These crooks left us high and dry. We're about ready to get out 
the shotguns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses -- reliant on telephones to receive orders and call for supplies -- 
also have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real pain for us because we need to talk to our sales office every 
day to get orders," said Lyndon Jones, plant superintendent at the Leslie Salt 
Co.'s salt mine at Bristol Dry Lake. "I finally set up a two-way radio and had 
them phone orders to my wife in Twentynine Palms, who would then radio them to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Pacific Bell officials were hindered in their efforts to restring 
the wire both by a lack of available supplies -- not much copper wire is made 
any more -- and a recent strike, which coincided with the peak of the thefts. 
On some occasions, workers replaced the wire and restored service only to have 
thieves strike again the very next day. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have a phone when you went to bed and you'd wake up and it would be out 
again," said Felicitas Ortiz, 56, who works at the general store in tiny Cadiz. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the troubles, Pacific Bell decided to link the area's telephones to 
a more modern microwave communication system, eliminating the need for the 
uninsulated wiring that, for the most part, is used by the company only in 
rural areas. Terry Kressel, Pacific Bell supervisor for the desert area, said 
the affected towns will be on an emergency radio system until the microwave 
connections are completed in November. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, have been tracking the thieves with mixed 
success. Because the areas vandalized are so remote, alarms that Pacific Bell 
attaches to the wire do little good; by the time authorities arrive, the 
thieves are gone or hiding in the desert.

<P>
So, in San Bernardino County, reserve Sheriff's Deputy Richard Bunn decided a 
stakeout was in order, and parked one recent night in an area having fresh 
truck tracks. Sure enough, the burglars appeared. There was a high-speed chase 
across the desert, which ended when the thieves' truck got stuck in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Five men from Riverside County communities were ultimately arrested in that 
episode. One has pleaded guilty and the other four will stand trial in Barstow 
on Nov. 6 on charges of grand theft and possessing stolen property -- both 
felonies -- and misdemeanor interruption of a telecommunication line. They face 
up to four years in custody if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they believe the thieves in the two counties were part of 
the same loosely organized group, hitting first in Riverside County and later 
in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these successes, authorities worry that the value of scrap metals makes 
other desert areas served by bare copper telephone wire vulnerable to attack. 
And in Riverside County, other burglars have begun stealing everything from 
aluminum guard rails on freeways to metal bleachers at Little League fields 
near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is making sure salvage yards obtain proof of ownership when they take 
this kind of material in," said San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty. Ben 
Sasnett, who has handled one of the wire theft cases. "Otherwise these guys can 
keep making money off it."

(Southland Edition) STOLEN WIRE 
</P>
<P>
1. San Bernardino County 
</P>
<P>
Thieves stole a 55-mile length of bare copper wire stretched between telephone 
poles from Ludlow to Danby, along a route that basically parallels the National 
Trails Highway. Homes and businesses in the small towns of Ludlow, Amboy, 
Bristol Dry Lake, Cadiz and Danby were left without phone service, some for up 
to a month. Problems were experienced as far as several miles from both sides 
of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
2. Riverside County 
</P>
<P>
An 80-mile stretch of copper wire from Whitewater to Desert Center was stolen. 
The route of the suspended wires basically parallels Interstate 10. Because 
most customers in this area had been switched to more modern wireless systems, 
only a few telephones were affected by this theft. But one was a key phone at 
the Cactus City Roadside Rest off Interstate 10 -- the only phone in a 40-mile 
radius.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, rejecting Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak's call to trade occupied land for peace, said Thursday that Arabs are 
not willing to give Israel peace. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir dismissed as a joke Mubarak's appeal to the Israeli people to change 
their government's mind. Part of Mubarak's interview with Israeli journalists 
in Cairo was broadcast Wednesday in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Egyptian leader was interfering in Israel's internal affairs, 
he said: "I don't think he meant it seriously. He was only joking." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir told high school students in Herzliya: "Land for peace -- that 
well-known phrase sounds so innocent. Israel will give up land and they will 
give us peace. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There is no element in the Arab world willing to give us peace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Syria as Example 
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example Syria, which wants Israel to return the annexed Golan 
Heights, captured in the 1967 Middle East War, but he said he does not believe 
Syria is willing to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Israel is banging its head against a wall by trying to deal only 
with Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip while ignoring 
Palestinians outside. 
</P>
<P>
Angry Shamir aides said Mubarak should "stop preaching" and trying to lure 
Israel into talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which it regards 
as a terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel Radio that Mubarak's 
call for Israeli-Palestinian talks and his 10 proposals for conducting 
elections in the occupied territories "would torpedo our initiative and not put 
it forward." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's demand that Israel be willing to hand back territory means in practice 
allowing a PLO state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticizes Mubarak Tactics 
</P>
<P>
Shamir criticized Mubarak's attempt to appeal to Israelis over their leaders' 
heads, contrasting Israeli and Egyptian forms of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he expects an answer from the Israeli people but from their 
government," he said. "We are a democratic country. If people didn't rely on 
the government, it would not be able to stand the way it does in Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli political commentators also questioned the wisdom of Mubarak's appeal 
to the Israeli public against Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "The Wrong Address," the newspaper Yediot Aharonot 
said Mubarak's first mistake was to appeal to the people and his second error 
was that he addressed only Israel, not the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Trust is not created by direct appeals to Israelis to bypass their government 
or by provoking an argument between one and the other, and it is definitely not 
created unilaterally," the newspaper said.

CONGRESS ASKED TO AID NICARAGUAN VOTE

The Bush Administration, declaring "we are at a watershed in Nicaragua," asked 
Congress on Thursday to provide $9 million to help guarantee that the 
presidential election scheduled there next February is conducted fairly. 
</P>
<P>
The request came as President Bush met with former President Jimmy Carter, who, 
in contrast to the Administration's skepticism, said he is confident the 
balloting will be free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's funding request was made by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III, who called the election "a rare chance for us to support 
democratization in a totalitarian society." 
</P>
<P>
The White House has built its hopes around the presidential candidacy of 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the leading opponent of President Daniel Ortega. 
Baker said she has a chance of victory against the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illusions Shunned 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "We shouldn't be under any illusions about the battle they face." 
</P>
<P>
With Nicaragua's one-month voter registration season approaching in October, 
the Administration is hoping for quick action by Congress to make the money 
available for immediate use. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Administration's proposal, $5 million would be given to the National 
Endowment for Democracy to pay for such activities as election monitoring, 
voter registration and party-building. The endowment is a private foundation 
created by Congress in 1982 to support democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration said that an additional $4 million could help pay the 
expenses of monitoring the election by outside groups and for registration of 
Nicaraguan expatriates. Carter, chairman of an international group planning to 
monitor the election, said the money is needed to make sure that the opposition 
parties have adequate funds to even out the odds and to monitor the election 
between the opposition and the governing Sandinista regime. 
</P>
<P>
"They have 4,394 voting places, and each voting place will have 11 observers -- 
one from every party -- to make sure that every vote is counted right and that 
the process is carried out properly," he said. "That is going to cost some 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, asked whether he thought the election would be fair, said, "I do 
believe that, because all sides in Nicaragua now have agreed to participate in 
the election, under the present constitution and laws." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later about the former President's comments, White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said that "we're still wary." He cited the refusal of the 
Nicaraguan government to admit all groups of observers who have expressed an 
interest in monitoring the election. 
</P>
<P>
Carter also said he supported continued economic assistance for the Contras, 
the U.S.-supported rebel force that has sought to overthrow the Sandinista 
government. The Sandinistas took power in 1979, during Carter's White House 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said that all of the Contras who want to return to 
Nicaragua should be allowed to do so, and that he considered his responsibility 
as an election observer to guarantee that they are not "harassed, but are given 
a full opportunity to be part of the political process."

ARAFAT, ISRAEL REPORTERS DEBATE PLAN FOR TALKS ON PALESTINIAN ISSUES

<P>
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, in an unusual direct 
appeal to the Israeli public, said Thursday that he endorses "open talks" with 
Israel, and he urged citizens to help him resist the most recent crackdown on 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you accept that, as Israelis?" Arafat declared, waving one of the 
controversial new identity cards required of residents in the occupied 
territories to help quell the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising. "You have to 
help me reject it, because I'm a human being, like you." 
</P>
<P>
In a sometimes heated exchange with Israeli journalists after a meeting with 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat refused to commit himself on Mubarak's 
10-point peace initiative, but he did endorse the Egyptian leader's proposal 
for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians -- as long as the ground 
rules are left open. 
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed to the preliminary conference that Mr. Mubarak has proposed," 
Arafat said, "but open talks, without conditions. Not your conditions, not my 
conditions. No preconditions. Fair?" 
</P>
<P>
While Egyptian and some moderate Israeli leaders have proposed the talks as a 
prelude to elections in the occupied territories, which would select a 
delegation to decide final peace issues, Arafat insisted that the talks lead 
the way to an international conference on peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our right to demand what we want," Arafat said, "and it's their right to 
demand what they want. That's fair enough. Or aren't you democratic? Have you 
been a little bit affected by the armed (Jewish) settlers (in the occupied 
territories)?" 
</P>
<P>
Many of the PLO leader's remarks were aimed directly at the Israeli 
journalists, whose request to interview Arafat prompted the press conference, 
which included other reporters as well. Israeli citizens by law are barred from 
contacts with the PLO except through "international" press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals to Israeli Public 
</P>
<P>
At times, the repartee became heated, as the Israeli journalists demanded to 
know whether the PLO would promise permanent peace if it were granted a 
Palestinian state in the West Bank, whether Israel should be negotiating with a 
group it considers a terrorist organization and why the PLO doesn't call a 
cease-fire in the uprising, or intifada, as a prelude to any peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in turn, used the occasion to appeal directly to the Israeli public, 
often framing his comments as if he were face to face with them over a 
bargaining table, while the Israeli reporters, just as often, argued back. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think we lack humanity?" he asked at one point, and then referred to a 
common Yiddish term for non-Jews. "Am I goy, and you're a person, or what? I am 
a human being like you. I am not goy!" 
</P>
<P>
Later, arguing with reporters over terrorism allegations, Arafat broke into a 
smile and declared: "Why should we go into these details? You are our cousins. 
We know each other. We want peace." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we want," shot back one of the Israeli journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"But what kind of peace?" Arafat went on. "We don't want the peace of 
destruction and occupation and death." 
</P>
<P>
The PLO chairman said he is "always open to discussions which will bring us to 
a complete and just peace," but he said it is up to Israel to respond formally 
to Mubarak's 10 points before the PLO accepts or rejects them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Divided 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has put off a final response in the wake of deep 
divisions within the Cabinet, whose most hard-line members, including Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, are strongly opposed to the Mubarak plan's provisions 
for Israel to exchange land for peace, halt all Jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories and allow Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem to vote 
in any elections. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis have also refused to negotiate with the PLO, a stand that has raised 
questions about who would make up the Palestinian panel in any direct talks. 
Would it be confined strictly to West Bank and Gaza residents, as the Israelis 
would prefer, or would representatives of the vast Palestinian refugee 
populations outside the territories be represented as well? 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has proposed including two Palestinians deported from the territories 
as one way of compromising, but Arafat said outsiders should not be allowed to 
dictate the makeup of the Palestinian panel. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't I a representative of the Palestinians?" he said. "Am I the son of my 
people, or the son of a crook? I'm not able to say I accept such-and-such a 
person from your (Israeli) side. No. You're free to choose who you want. And we 
have to be free in the same way. Or are you free, and we're slaves?"

771 WHITES VOW TO REFUSE ARMY DUTY IN SOUTH AFRICA

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of 771 young white men pledged Thursday to defy the government and 
refuse duty in the South African Defense Force. It was the largest public 
challenge ever to the country's system of military conscription. 
</P>
<P>
At simultaneous news conferences in six cities, draft resisters produced a 
"national register" of 771 conscientious objectors. Among them were university 
students, doctors, social workers, geologists, pastors, artists and mechanical 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The military's defense of apartheid was cited by many as the reason for their 
decision, but others based their decision on religious considerations or 
antipathy toward violence in general. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided, in good conscience and of our own accord, that we cannot 
serve," Chris de Villiers, a 33-year-old law clerk, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Will Go to Jail 
</P>
<P>
De Villiers, leader of the End Conscription Campaign, which was restricted from 
political activity by the government last year, added: "Some of us will go to 
jail. Others will opt for religious objector status. Many of us will choose 
between a life in exile or constant evasion of call-ups." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 771 men on the list, some have already done the first two years of their 
required military service and intend to refuse mandatory reserve duty. A few 
said they are refusing draft notices; others have not yet been drafted. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Force warned Thursday that it would take legal action against those 
who fail to report for service. In the past two years, four men have been sent 
to prison for refusing to serve. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, however, the Defense Force noted that the 771 men had only 
stated their intention to break the law, not actually done so. It said that 
after 142 South Africans announced several months ago that they would refuse 
military service, an army investigation indicated that only nine had actually 
failed to show up for national service or reserve duty. 
</P>
<P>
Methodist Bishop Peter Storey told reporters, "It is absurd that a society that 
hangs people for killing people should jail people for refusing to kill." 
</P>
<P>
Military service is mandatory for all able-bodied white men in South Africa, 
although many get deferments and a handful qualify as religious objectors. It 
is illegal even to discourage anyone from compulsory military service. 
</P>
<P>
Religious objectors may request permission to perform community service, 
usually six years in a government job. 
</P>
<P>
Many young men have fled the country to avoid conscription. Draft resisters 
face jail terms of six years, the length of mandatory service plus reserve 
duty, and two men have received the maximum sentence in the last two years. 
About 68,000 conscripts are on active duty in South Africa at any given time, 
in addition to about 325,000 reservists. 
</P>
<P>
The stand taken by the draft resisters coincided with a seven-week-old defiance 
campaign against apartheid organized by the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose 
affiliation of most major anti-apartheid groups in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The government, after a week of allowing peaceful marches in major cities, 
moved Thursday to stop peaceful protests in Durban and Johannesburg. Police 
arrested 38 high school students and teachers while breaking up a march in 
Durban protesting the acquittal of a black civic leader who has been charged 
with murdering a student.

Newberry's honeymoon was to have been in the Virgin Islands, which were

JET'S COCKPIT RECORDER GIVES INVESTIGATORS NO ANSWERS TO ABORTED NEW YORK 
TAKEOFF

National Transportation Safety Board officials said Thursday that a preliminary 
examination of the cockpit voice recorder of USAir flight 5050 gave no 
indication why the pilots suddenly aborted the flight from La Guardia Airport 
Wednesday night, sending the plane skidding into the East River. 
</P>
<P>
Two women passengers were killed when the Boeing 737-400, on a late flight to 
Charlotte, N.C., broke up at the end of the runway. Fifty-five other passengers 
and a crew of six survived, although 19 passengers were hospitalized with a 
variety of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB sources said Thursday that the pilot and co-pilot, who have not been 
identified, have declined to talk to investigators until they talked to 
attorneys and representatives of the Airline Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Interview Soon 
</P>
<P>
However, acting NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad said Thursday night that the 
NTSB talked with the pilots' association and expected to interview the cockpit 
crew soon. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said the cockpit voice recorder had "a good tape," but that "we heard 
no voices that indicate any engine problems or (other) reasons why the takeoff 
was aborted." 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB, which briefed reporters on the status of the investigation into the 
crash, said it knew only the last name of the chief pilot, Martin. The agency 
said it had not determined the experience of the flight crew, or which pilot 
was at the controls during takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers told investigators that they heard a USAir pilot say he 
was aborting takeoff moments before the plane slid off the rain-slicked runway. 
"There was no indication of why he was aborting," said Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman Fred Farrar. "Until we know why the guy aborted the 
takeoff, we have no way of knowing the cause of the accident." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Work to Do 
</P>
<P>
"We're a long way from making any kind of concrete conclusion," Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are anxious to pinpoint not only why the pilots decided to abort 
the flight, but when. The plane may have skidded into the river if the decision 
was made too late in the takeoff, or if the pilots made the decision in time 
but other factors, such as a brake failure, prevented the plane from stopping. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad said the controllers could not tell whether the plane was going "too 
slow for takeoff or too fast to stop." 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot seemed to be accelerating but didn't have enough power to get the 
plane up," said passenger Larry Martin. "He put on the brakes. The plane took a 
dip and the next thing I knew all hell broke loose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plane in 3 Parts 
</P>
<P>
The plane broke into three parts about 50 to 100 feet into Bowery Bay, its 
front sections resting above the water on a trestle that held runway lights, 
its back sections submerged. The two women who died were seated in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
The flight data box recording, which was also recovered from the plane, 
indicated that the plane swerved slightly instead of moving straight down the 
runway and showed some "deviations" in rudder movement, Kolstad said, but 
investigators did not immediately understand what effect that might have had on 
the takeoff. Pilots may use the rudder to counter wind gusts on takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was 9 months old and it had no history of mechanical problems, said 
airline spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan. A three-member Boeing crash team planned to 
examine the aircraft.

PANEL WOULD END DEATH ROW INMATES' MULTIPLE APPEALS 
</P>

<P>
Seeking to speed up the handling of death penalty cases, a panel led by former 
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. proposed Thursday that Death Row 
inmates who have exhausted state appeals be given only one chance within six 
months to file challenges in the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Death penalty foes quickly denounced Powell's proposal as "a rush to the 
gallows." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, which dates to 1867, a prisoner may file new and 
repeated appeals in the federal courts for years after a conviction and 
sentence have been finally approved in the state courts. 
</P>
<P>
In the typical death penalty case, this two-track system results in years of 
drawn-out litigation, followed by a slew of frenzied "11th-hour appeals" as the 
execution date draws near. 
</P>
<P>
The long delay -- more than eight years on average from conviction to an 
execution -- plus the high cost of litigation have raised doubts about capital 
punishment, even among its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard fact is that the (death penalty) laws of 37 states are not being 
enforced by the courts," the 82-year-old Powell said Thursday. "My feeling is 
that if we can't make it work, we ought to abolish capital punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of this report is to kill more people faster," charged Mary 
Broderick, director of the National Legal Aid Assn., which defends inmates 
facing execution. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 2,200 prisoners are facing a death sentence. Yet, since 1976, 
when the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment, only 118 people have been 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Sentence Rare 
</P>
<P>
Annually, more than 20,000 murders are committed in the United States, only a 
small percentage of which result in a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Although controversial, Powell's proposal is expected to find a ready audience 
in Congress, which must make any changes in the 1867 law. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in the midst of debate on the massive anti-drug bill, Senate 
conservatives were prepared to put new time limits on federal court appeals in 
death cases. They were put off only by a pledge from Judiciary Committee 
liberals to send Powell's recommendations to the floor for a vote 60 days after 
they are officially transmitted to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Powell's report was discussed behind closed doors by the Judicial 
Conference of the United States, which represents senior judges from each 
region of the nation, and which must decide whether to transmit the report to 
Congress. The judicial group, which is chaired by Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist, delayed a vote on whether to approve the report until its next 
meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
"This controversy . . . boils down to a simple question: Should there be a time 
clock on justice in this country?" said Leslie Harris of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, one of several groups which said they would fight the Powell 
plan in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Harris noted that some Death Row inmates are found to be not guilty after 
spending years in prison. In a recent, celebrated example, Randall Adams was 
freed from a Texas prison earlier this year, more than a decade after being 
mistakenly convicted and sentenced to death for killing a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick also said that it was unfair and incorrect to say that appeals in 
death cases are merely intended to cause delay. In more than 40% of these 
cases, she said, the appeals result in the death sentence being overturned, 
usually because of a flaw in the trial or sentencing procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The two critics accused Rehnquist of having "set up" a pro-death penalty panel, 
chaired by the highly esteemed Powell, with the express goal of cutting off 
prisoners' appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist has not hidden his dissatisfaction with the death penalty system. In 
a speech to the American Bar Assn. in February, the chief justice said the case 
of serial killer Theodore Bundy showed how convicted murderers can make a 
travesty of the courts. Although Bundy had been on Death Row for nine years, 
his lawyers filed appeals in four different courts, including three in the 
Supreme Court, the day before his execution. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely it would be a bold person to say that this system could not be 
improved," Rehnquist told the lawyers group. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rehnquist asked Powell and four other senior federal judges to study 
the workings of the 1867 Habeas Corpus Act in death cases. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, the Powell proposal is more generous to defendants than the 
initial changes proposed by the Senate conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
If states choose to participate in the new streamlined system, they would be 
required to furnish Death Row inmates with a competent lawyer to review the 
case and file challenges in federal courts. Some states, including California 
and Florida, routinely provide lawyers, without charge, to file post-conviction 
appeals for convicted murderers, but others such as Georgia, Louisiana and 
Mississippi do not, according to Albert Pearson, a University of Georgia law 
professor who worked with Powell on the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital cases should be subject to one fair and complete . . . review through 
the state and federal systems," Powell said. "This review should be free from 
the time pressure of an impending execution and with the assistance of 
competent counsel for the prisoner. When this review has concluded, the 
litigation should end," he said.

SENATE PANEL PREFERS LAW TO PROTECT FLAG 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday in favor of a proposed new law to 
prohibit desecration of the American flag and recommended that the full Senate 
reject a rival effort backed by the White House to protect the flag by amending 
the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic-controlled committee voted 9 to 5 in favor of a statutory change 
proposed by its chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). The measure would 
make flag burning a federal crime, punishable by maximum penalties of one year 
in prison and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also voted 8 to 6 to send the proposed constitutional amendment 
sought by President Bush to the full Senate with a negative recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot Political Issue 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are sharply divided over the two approaches to prohibiting flag 
desecration, which became a hot political issue in the wake of a Supreme Court 
decision last summer overturning a Texas law that banned flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
By prior agreement, the Senate committee was obliged to submit both 
flag-burning measures to the Senate floor, where they will be debated next 
month. The House already has passed a flag-burning bill, and Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley has promised to schedule a vote on a constitutional amendment later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a constitutional change argued that the Judiciary Committee's 
negative recommendation would not seriously affect its support on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not surprised by the unfavorable vote because the chairman (Biden) was 
against it," said an aide to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). "It will be on the 
Senate floor, where the proponents of a constitutional amendment will come out 
in force." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
The flag debate has split Congress three ways. One faction favors simple 
legislation to protect the flag, another backs the President's call for a 
constitutional amendment, and a third contends that democracy is better served 
by taking no action at all. 
</P>
<P>
The debate in the Judiciary Committee reflected those divergent views. Most 
Democrats argued against any attempt to tinker with the Constitution, while 
Republicans countered that the Supreme Court's decision on the 
constitutionality of flag burning probably could not be overturned by a mere 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
"A constitutional amendment is absolutely necessary to ensure with certainty 
the validity of any statute banning flag desecration," said Hatch, adding that 
the Biden bill would be "unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) argued the minority view. No matter how 
objectionable flag burning may be to most people, Kennedy said, restricting any 
form of political dissent by statute or amendment would be a violation of the 
free speech principles enshrined in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to try to prevent desecration of the flag by desecrating the 
Constitution," Kennedy said. "If freedom of expression means anything, it means 
tolerance not just for views we approve, but for views that we hate as well." 
</P>
<P>
While flag-protection legislation has strong bipartisan support in Congress, 
proponents of an amendment concede they probably do not have enough support to 
change the Constitution -- a process that requires a two-thirds majority vote 
in the House and the Senate as well as ratification by three-fourths of the 
states. A statute, in contrast, would require only a simple majority in the 
House and Senate to pass.

Republican senators, following six hours of negotiations with Democrats, agreed 
late Thursday to take a new plan for financing the war on drugs to the White 
House for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the plan contained some of the selected cuts in spending the Bush 
Administration had wanted as a way to offset increases in the drug program as 
well as an across-the-board reduction in federal programs to raise the bulk of 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they would not consider the plan a tentative agreement without 
White House approval and they indicated that there was no rush on the part of 
the Administration to provide that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been on the phone to (White House chief of staff John H.) Sununu all 
night," Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said as he emerged from the negotiations 
along with other tired senators. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they would take the plan to the White House today and then 
reconvene their negotiations with the Democrats. Senators declined to comment 
on specifics of the plan.

VIRGIN ISLANDS GET $500,000 IN AID

The Interior Department released $500,000 in emergency funds Thursday for the 
Virgin Islands. An Interior spokesman suggested the money could be used for 
food and clothing for disaster victims -- and for chain saws and other tools to 
dig out of the debris and restore essential services. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush declared Puerto Rico a disaster area. He did the same 
Wednesday for the Virgin Islands. The declarations make federal aid available, 
much of it low-interest loans through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
which established a task force to coordinate its aid efforts with those of 
other federal departments. 
</P>
<P>
The aid is badly needed, said economist Jose Salazar-Carillo, a professor at 
Florida International University. He said Hurricane Hugo had set back the 
economies of the Caribbean areas it hit by at least two years. These areas need 
"not only loans but outright grants," he said, "to get their infrastructures 
back together."

WOMAN SHOT TO DEATH AT MEDICAL CLINIC AFTER REPEATED THREATS FROM HUSBAND 
</P>

<P>
A woman who told a friend that her estranged husband was going to kill her was 
shot to death in a Santa Fe Springs medical clinic Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Although several witnesses identified the gunman as the husband, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's investigators said only that they were seeking a "male family 
member" in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old victim, who was shot several times in the torso, died shortly 
after arrival at a nearby hospital, deputies said. They released no other 
details of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Semidey, an employee of the clinic and a longtime friend of the victim, 
said the gunman walked into the facility shortly before noon and demanded from 
the woman that he be allowed to see their 6-month-old son. After a short 
argument, he pulled out a handgun, shot the victim once and paused until she 
fell to the ground, then shot her again several times, Semidey said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too fast there was not much I could do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Semidey, office manager of the clinic in the 10000 block of Orr &amp; Day Road, 
said her friend had been estranged from her husband since discovering two 
months ago that he had another wife. The victim, who had custody of the 
6-month-old son, had been living with different friends until about two weeks 
ago, Semidey said, and had been asked to leave by various hosts because of the 
possible danger posed by the husband. 
</P>
<P>
The woman and her child spent a night on the streets before turning to Semidey, 
who said she consoled the victim through several periods of marital turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
Semidey said she took the woman in and gave her $300 to hire a lawyer. The 
victim was planning to obtain a restraining order on grounds of emotional and 
physical abuse, Semidey said, but the petition had not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Semidey said the husband tracked the woman and continued to harass her during 
the two months of estrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the husband found the woman at Semidey's home and for the 
two days preceding the shooting, the couple discussed how they could "work 
things out," Semidey said. 
</P>
<P>
Semidey said the wife was trying to divide the couple's belongings and get the 
husband to leave her alone. The woman wanted to take the child and separate 
from the husband "without violence," Semidey said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Semidey left for work on Thursday, the woman spoke anxiously about her 
husband's most recent threat to kill her, Semidey said.

FEINSTEIN PROPOSES 'DRUG CZAR' TO COORDINATE STATE'S EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her two political opponents already proposing solutions to California's 
drug problem, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein unveiled her 
own plan Thursday, calling for a "drug czar" to coordinate enforcement, 
education and treatment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"(California) state and local agencies will spend some $9 billion this year on 
programs to combat illicit drug use, but there is no state strategy to 
effectively coordinate those resources," Feinstein said in remarks prepared for 
delivery in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Much as what is being done at the federal level, Feinstein said that if elected 
in 1990 she would name one person to "draft a comprehensive plan to combat drug 
use on the supply side and the demand side." 
</P>
<P>
"At present," Feinstein said, "there is no statewide drug plan, no strategy to 
fight narcotics. And President Bush's drug plan fails to give California the 
resources it needs or the priority it deserves to wage an effective battle." 
</P>
<P>
To finance her plan, Feinstein said she would seek bond measures if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
She also called for mandatory jail sentences for the sale of narcotics on the 
first offense and for same-day treatment programs for pregnant women who are on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor, 
has introduced legislation in the Senate that would earmark the money now spent 
on congressional newsletters for fighting the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
A special focus of Wilson's efforts is the increasing number of women who give 
birth to drug-addicted babies in California. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County alone, that number has jumped from 500 cases in 1985 to 
more than 2,500 today, according to Dr. Margaret Yonekura, chief of Obstetrics, 
Maternal and Fetal Medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Yonekura recently got a promise from Wilson to find more money for a program 
she runs for crack-addicted mothers and newborns. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, Feinstein's opponent for the Democratic

LONG BULL MARKET STOMPING SHORT SELLERS' PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
RALLY, TAKEOVER SPECULATION KEEPS LIFTING STOCK OF BOTH SOUND AND MEDIOCRE 
FIRMS 
</P>

Short sellers are having a tough time in the stock market this year, and 
Kathryn Staley, an investment adviser in Atlanta, has a pithy if surreal 
explanation why: 
</P>
<P>
"Trash is levitating," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The market's strong rally this year -- up 25% so far, as measured by Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500 index -- is lifting stocks of both sound companies as well as 
mediocre ones whose prices might otherwise be tumbling into oblivion. That's 
making it hard for short sellers -- investors who bet that stocks will fall in 
price -- to make money, even if they've shorted companies that are lousy 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most "shorts" are having a mediocre year at best and are struggling to 
just stay even for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Most short sellers are anywhere from break-even to down 10% to 15%" in terms 
of their return on invested capital, said Staley, who advises clients on 
selling short. By contrast, short sellers were posting average returns of 20% 
or more at this point last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know any short sellers that are making money," agreed Neil Dolinsky, a 
partner of Dunnavan Dolinsky &amp; Weeden Leuthold, a Minneapolis partnership 
that sells short for institutional clients. 
</P>
<P>
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich is the kind of stock giving Dolinsky and other shorts 
fits this year. The Orlando, Fla.-based publishing, insurance and theme-park 
concern took on more than $2 billion in debt to fight off a takeover bid by 
British publisher Robert Maxwell two years ago and now is trying to sell assets 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Dolinsky, confident Harcourt's stock would tumble, shorted the stock twice in 
recent months. Instead, Harcourt this year has climbed to about $16 a share 
from $9, saddling Dolinsky with losses. 
</P>
<P>
But he isn't giving up. Dolinsky shorted Harcourt again this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still convinced we're going to be right about it," he said. "Staying 
power is the name of the game." Maybe, but his $20-million short-selling fund 
for institutional clients is down 9% since the fund was established in 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Short sellers have been burned by several other stocks that did not plunge as 
they expected. They wrongly predicted that L.A. Gear, a trendy footwear maker, 
would not live up to strong sales projections and that disappointed investors 
would dump the stock. Instead, L.A. Gear has kept growing and its stock has 
tripled this year, closing at $74.75 a share Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air has been another sore point with the shorts. Frank Lorenzo's 
debt-plagued company put its Eastern Airlines unit into bankruptcy protection 
and Texas Air is trying to sell some assets to pay off its debt, yet its stock 
closed Thursday at $18 a share, up from about $12 at the start of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very tough year," said Robert Holmes, president of Gilford 
Securities in Chicago, which manages a short-selling fund of about $10 million. 
But he, too, is not giving up on his favorite picks. He continues shorting 
Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional investors who go "long" and buy a stock hoping it will climb 
in price, short sellers first borrow shares from a broker and then promptly 
sell the stock. Then they wait for the stock to drop in price, when they can 
repurchase the shares, return them to the broker and pocket the difference in 
price (less trading commissions). 
</P>
<P>
But selling short is risky business. Whereas a stock bought long can only drop 
100%, a shorted stock can double or triple in price, making the short seller's 
risk unlimited. Also, it might be months or years before the price of the 
shorted stock finally drops. It's not uncommon for short sellers to wait two 
years or more before "covering" a position, that is, buying back the stock. In 
the meantime, if the stock price goes against them, they would face "margin 
calls" -- demands for more cash -- from the broker who loaned them the stock. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there have been stocks that even the bulls have finally sold off, 
putting the short sellers in the money. Two examples: Integrated Resources, a 
once high-flying tax shelter syndicator that defaulted on its bank debt this 
summer, and Jiffy Lube International, a fast-growing chain of auto-service 
stores that faced a cash crunch earlier this year. Holmes said he made a nice 
profit shorting that pair of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began in '82 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, short sellers said they're having to wait longer than normal 
to profitably cover their positions because of the current bull market. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these stocks just won't die, they seem to have multiple numbers of 
lives," said Joe Feshbach, who with his brothers Kurt and Matt and partner Tom 
Barton are considered the leading short sellers in the nation. Their Palo Alto 
firm, Feshbach Bros., which manages a $400-million portfolio, is down 3% so far 
this year, compared to a 22% gain in 1988, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Feshbachs became prominent after proving that short selling, if done 
correctly, could earn big profits in nearly any market. They began shorting 
with $200,000 in 1982, just as the historic bull market was getting under way, 
yet they managed to double or triple their money in some years. They also 
specialized in finding short candidates where corporate fraud was involved. 
</P>
<P>
One of their biggest scores was shorting ZZZZ Best, Barry Minkow's Reseda-based 
carpet cleaning company that collapsed due to insider fraud in 1987. The 
company had a stock market value as high as $200 million, but virtually all of 
ZZZZ Best's reported sales turned out to be phony. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced the company was lying about its remarkable sales growth, the 
Feshbachs shorted the stock at $10 a share, then watched as the shares became 
worthless -- except to them and other short sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Because short sellers thrive on corporate disasters and financial failures, 
many executives and traditional investors find the shorts repugnant. Short 
sellers also have been accused of spreading rumors to send stocks lower. The 
shorts counter by saying executives need only to bolster their companies' 
performances to keep them at bay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Particularly Hamstrung 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who have been the most critical and the most hostile toward short 
sellers have almost without exception had the most to hide," Joe Feshbach said. 
</P>
<P>
A bull market naturally makes the shorts want to hide. But this year many short 
sellers claim to be particularly hamstrung because lots of companies they 
consider to be losers have been bid up nonetheless, largely because takeover 
speculation has become so widespread that even struggling companies are 
attracting interest, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most frustrating market for me since I've been on the short side" 
starting in 1985, said Jim Chanos, owner of Kynikos (Greek for "cynical") 
Associates, a New York money management firm. "There's so many deal makers, so 
much capital, that the criteria (for buyouts) has just gone down." 
</P>
<P>
But despite striking out on many stocks this year, the shorts are still anxious 
to come to bat. Short interest in August -- that is, stock that had been sold 
short but not yet repurchased -- totaled 554.5 million shares on the New York 
Stock Exchange, just shy of the record 556.3 million reached in April. 
</P>
<P>
Even at those levels, short selling comprises just a fraction of total trading 
volume. But the short-interest level signals that selling short is not falling 
out of favor despite the stock market's surge. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, in fact, could be setting the stage for the short sellers' comeback. 
The market's rise is making an increasing number of stocks overpriced relative 
to their business prospects -- and thus ripe for a collapse that would cheer 
the shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Feshbach: "It's a difficult market. But there's a lot of merchandise 
available."

J. P. MORGAN HIKES RESERVES BY $2 BILLION TO COVER LOANS TO LESS DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. on Thursday said it will pump $2 billion into its 
loan-loss reserves, becoming the third major New York banking company this week 
to set aside a staggering amount of money to cover increasingly doubtful loans 
made to developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
The move by J. P. Morgan, parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., will result in a 
third-quarter loss of $1.8 billion, and an unspecified loss for the year. That 
is the second-largest quarterly loss ever for a bank, eclipsed only by a 
$2.6-billion quarterly shortfall posted by New York-based Citicorp in 1987, 
which also stemmed from problem loans to developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chase Manhattan Corp. increased its reserves by $1.15 billion, 
producing a $1.1-million loss for its third quarter. On Monday, Manufacturers 
Hanover Corp. added $950 million to its reserves, and it is expected to post a 
$750-million loss for the three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
In setting aside reserves, a bank designates money to cover potential future 
losses on loans that have gone sour. Banks have been under increasing pressure 
the past few years to put aside reserves for loans made to developing nations, 
principally in Latin America, in the late 1970s and early 1980s amid growing 
signs that the debts never will be fully paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's move is the most dramatic yet by a big American bank to deal with 
those loans because it now has set aside money to cover all of its $3-billion 
portfolio of long- and medium-term loans to developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Implies Loans Worth Zero' 
</P>
<P>
The move surprised industry executives and analysts because most banks have 
been expected to increase reserves only to close to 50% of their outstanding 
loans and because Latin American debt still trades in the secondary market, 
meaning that investors believe that it at least has some value. 
</P>
<P>
"It implies that the loans are worth zero, but they clearly are worth more than 
zero," said Jerry L. Jordan, senior vice president and chief economist at First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The move likely reflects J. P. Morgan's strong balance sheet, which allows the 
bank to make such a big addition to its reserves, and the company's desire to 
put its problems with loans to developing countries behind it. Unlike both 
Chase and Manufacturers Hanover, J. P. Morgan said it has no plans to issue 
common stock to replenish its capital. J.P. Morgan has about $100 billion in 
assets, making it the nation's third largest banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only regional banks in the United States, such as Bank of Boston, have 
set aside reserves covering all of their loans to less developed countries. 
Most large banks have reserves totaling about 30% of their exposure, meaning 
they have 30 cents in reserves for every dollar they provided. 
</P>
<P>
The move by Morgan, however, is likely to put pressure on other big banking 
organizations, including Chemical Bank, Citicorp, Bankers Trust and 
BankAmerica, to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pessimism Deepening 
</P>
<P>
"It turns up the heat on all of them," said James J. McDermott Jr., research 
director at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a New York investment firm that 
specializes in bank stocks. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America, has reserves covering 37% of its $7.4 
billon in long-term and medium-term loans to developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Morgan's announcement reflects some of the deepest pessimism yet about 
whether the banks will recover much for their loans to developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic and political problems have intensified in several countries where we 
have significant exposure," said J. P. Morgan Chairman Lewis T. Preston in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Preston also said the bank is concerned about the "rising expectations" of less 
developed countries in the wake of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's 
debt-reduction plan intended to provide relief to debtor nations. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Morgan's developing nations loans are primarily to Mexico, Brazil, 
Argentina and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Third World nations are about $1 trillion in debt. Brazil this week 
missed a $1.6-billion interest payment on its commercial bank debt and 
Venezuela is more than $800 million past due on interest payments. Argentina is 
in arrears to its bank creditors by $4.4 billion and has said it cannot afford 
to service its $60 billion in debt.

UNOCAL STILL PUMPS OIL THE OLD WAY IN VENTURA COUNTY. BUT A PROPOSED 
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT COULD FORCE A SHUTDOWN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Bible-quoting Presbyterian from Pennsylvania, 200 Chinese immigrant laborers 
and an equal number of hard-drinking wildcatters converged in the arid hills of 
Ventura County a century ago with a single goal: Oil. 
</P>
<P>
Their work created the wells that powered the company that was to become Unocal 
Corp., the Los Angeles-based energy company that observes its centennial next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Partly as a remembrance, Unocal still maintains and operates some of the era's 
ancient equipment there, and the wells continue to produce oil -- the 
old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
But as the company observes its 100th year, it faces the prospect of having to 
shut down the Ventura County operations that have otherwise withstood the 
effects of time and weather. There's a stronger force at work: Development. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal won't discuss details. But C. R. (Dick) Marshall, Unocal's production 
foreman for the Ventura area, said a group of investors is considering an 
upscale residential development on about 1,200 acres near Unocal's oil fields 
above Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
The company is talking with developers about possible conflicts between the 
project and the old oil wells -- and if push comes to shove, Unocal could just 
shut the whole thing down as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would just cost too much to upgrade them and maintain them," Marshall said. 
Unocal also wants to preserve its rights to future oil production near the 
site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The operations consist of a handful of wells sunk as long ago as 1884, still 
operated by 19th-Century-style "jack line" pumps. 
</P>
<P>
The operations also include an unusual group of tunnels dug by Chinese 
immigrant laborers in 1890 to tap nearly vertical deposits of oil. About 28 of 
60 tunnels remain productive, dribbling out water and about five barrels of oil 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
The operations are all that remain of the bustling oil field that gave birth to 
Unocal in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvanian was Lyman Stewart, co-founder of the company, who came to 
California to prospect for oil. He found it in the hills above Santa Paula, 
where the native Chumash Indians used sticky black goo from natural seeps to 
waterproof their baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyman was a geologist, and he rode horseback through here, and he just . . . 
mapped all these seeps," said Marshall, a 16-year Unocal veteran and unofficial 
company historian. "Then he would go to the property owner and say, 'Listen, 
I'd like to get the mineral rights to your property' " -- rights he'd buy for 
$2 to $5 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
With rights to about 38,000 acres in hand, Stewart then set about drilling for 
oil, primarily in the Adams Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart and his hearty mustachioed banker partner Wallace L. Hardison formed 
the Hardison &amp; Stewart Oil Co. It and two other oil companies merged in 
October, 1890, to create Union Oil Co. of California, now called Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Stream Down Canyon 
</P>
<P>
The area was the site of Unocal's -- and California's -- first gushers. In 
January, 1888, Adams Canyon Well No. 16 hit big and got credit for saving the 
fledgling company from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
According to old company logs, "the oil shot up to a height of nearly 100 feet 
and flowed at the rate of 800 to 900 barrels a day. Before it could be 
controlled, it sent a stream down the canyon for a distance of seven miles." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Adams No. 28 surpassed the first well. In February, 1892, it 
came in, blowing oil over the derrick, flowing down the canyon into the Santa 
Clara River and out to sea, according to a Unocal history. At its peak, the 
well produced 1,500 barrels of oil per day. 
</P>
<P>
On Sulphur Mountain, which formed one of the canyon's walls, the terrain was 
too steep to build derricks. Following the example of an earlier prospector, 
Stewart decided to tunnel for oil. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Chinese immigrants -- known for mining skill -- were shipped into 
nearby Port Hueneme and installed in boarding houses near the oil field. 
</P>
<P>
Working in crews of about a dozen, the laborers set about digging an ingenious 
network of tunnels to tap the oil deposits. The tunnels angled uphill from the 
entrance to allow oil to run out in redwood sluices. Fresh air blew in through 
a water-powered ventilator. At the tunnel's entrance, a man with a mirror 
reflected sunlight back into the tunnel's darkness to help diggers see and stay 
aligned. 
</P>
<P>
The work was long and arduous. Crews with picks and shovels took four or five 
months to dig an average 300- to 400-foot tunnel. And some tunnels ran more 
than 1,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explosion Killed 4 Men 
</P>
<P>
The work was also dangerous. Cave-ins were common, and crews took canaries with 
them -- much as coal miners do -- to detect natural gas buildups. In 1890, an 
explosion rocked Adams Canyon Tunnel No. 4, called the Boarding House tunnel 
because of its proximity to the diggers' camp. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison's brother, Harvey, and three other men entered the tunnel to 
investigate -- and a second explosion killed all four. 
</P>
<P>
Even outside the tunnels, life was rough. The white drilling crews lived in 
separate camps from the Chinese mining crews, but fights nevertheless erupted 
between the two, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Paula, hard-drinking roughnecks routinely shot up the local saloon, 
despite the best efforts of the devout Stewart to keep them in check. 
</P>
<P>
Now, little is left of the tunnels except the pipes that continue to collect 
oil. Many of the tunnels collapsed during the torrential rains of 1969, 
Marshall recalled, and only a handful are still open to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The vertical wells are in better shape: three of the old units that powered the 
drilling pumps remain. Components of the wooden pumps themselves have been 
replaced over the years with steel; only Slocum Well No. 15 is preserved as it 
was, made entirely of redwood. 
</P>
<P>
The operations produce enough oil to pay for their upkeep and make a few 
dollars for Unocal, maybe 25 to 30 barrels a day. That's minuscule compared to 
the average 400 to 500 barrels a day from a modern well on nearby Sulphur 
Crest, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not an economical project," Marshall said. "They just keep them 
going for the history and because it was part of the early company."

GUILTY PLEA IN BUSINESS WEEK INSIDER CASE;

EX-SALESMAN AT PRINTER GAVE COPIES TO HIS BROKER

A former salesman for the company that prints Business Week magazine formally 
entered a guilty plea Thursday to conspiring to trade on advance information 
about stocks mentioned in the magazine's influential "Inside Wall Street" 
column. 
</P>
<P>
As reported, Shayne Walters, 32, of Laguna Hills, agreed in August to plead 
guilty to charges in the Business Week case. He also pleaded guilty to perjury 
for lying under oath to an investigator of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation has now resulted in guilty pleas on both the East and 
West coasts in the government's probe of illegal trading using purloined copies 
of the business weekly between 1986 and 1988. The magazine was not charged with 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Walters was a sales representative for R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, a 
Chicago-based printer of Business Week, from January, 1983, until April. A 
Donnelly plant in Torrance printed copies of the magazine for distribution in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In entering the plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Walters agreed to 
cooperate in the federal probe. Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl H. Loewenson Jr. said 
his office would recommend a lenient sentence for Walters based on the 
information he gives the government. 
</P>
<P>
Walters faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the two 
charges. He is to be sentenced April 24 by U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Morning Trek 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy charge alleged that between September, 1986, and July, 1988, 
Walters obtained advance copies of Business Week from the Donnelley plant in 
Torrance and then supplied them to his stockbroker, who traded on companies 
reported favorably in the "Inside Wall Street" column. 
</P>
<P>
Walters told the judge that he would leave his house at 3:45 a.m. on Thursdays, 
the day the magazine was distributed, and drive 45 miles to the plant to get a 
copy of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He then would drive 45 miles back to his hometown and give the magazine to his 
stockbroker, Walters said. He also said the stockbroker, who was not 
identified, paid him for some of the advance copies. 
</P>
<P>
Walters was the latest person to plead guilty to schemes involving trading on 
pre-publication copies of "Inside Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. broker, and S. G. (Rudy) 
Ruderman, the former broadcast editor for Business Week, had previously pleaded 
guilty to similar charges, and both were sentenced to six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least seven other Donnelley employees have either resigned or 
been fired in wake of the Business Week scandal. The SEC also has sued Dillon 
and five others in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a settlement reached with the SEC in August, Walters agreed to pay $62,000 
in restitution and civil penalties -- an amount double his illegal profits. 
</P>
<P>
Papers filed by the SEC said Walters purchased and sold stock from 13 companies 
based on information in the magazine and that the stockbroker traded on more 
than 40 companies.

ACTION BY AMERICAN CONTINENTAL INVESTORS; 
</P>
<P>
CORPORATIONS DEPT. NOW NAMED IN SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Corporations was named a defendant Thursday in a 
lawsuit originally filed this spring on behalf of about 22,000 investors who 
stand to lose nearly $200 million from the collapse of American Continental 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In an amended complaint, the agency was accused of acting "in reckless 
disregard of its own internal findings" in approving the public offering of 
American Continental bonds, which were sold mostly through its Irvine 
subsidiary, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The filing marks the first time that a government agency has been named a 
defendant in the various lawsuits pending against American Continental, which 
has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection, and Lincoln, which was 
seized by regulators and in August was declared insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
And it follows the civil racketeering suit filed last week by the Resolution 
Trust Corp., the government agency dealing with the national S&amp;L crisis, 
against American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. and most of the 
company's officers and directors, claiming they conspired to siphon $1.1 
billion in federally insured funds from Lincoln for their personal use. 
</P>
<P>
The investors' complaint that was amended Thursday now alleges that the 
Department of Corporations gave American Continental approval to sell its bonds 
even though the agency had sufficient evidence that the Phoenix-based company 
could not repay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Corporations staff made its own analysis that the offering 
didn't make any sense," said Ronald Rus of Orange, one of the plaintiffs' 
lawyers. "Notwithstanding that, the agency found that a Big 8 accounting firm 
said it's OK and then approved it. So who's fault is it?" he said. "I say they 
both are at fault." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also claims that Lincoln's former operators, its outside accountants 
and its lawyers engaged in "a massive fraud" to pump up Lincoln's earnings and 
net worth artificially and improve the company's stock price for their own 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Bender, commissioner of the department, said the agency "acted 
appropriately" in approving the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what was required under the law and, in fact, more than what was 
required by law," she said. "When a court looks at this, I'm convinced it will 
find that we did nothing wrong.' Agency officials previously said they 
contacted numerous state and federal agencies investigating American 
Continental and Lincoln Savings but could get no concrete evidence to warrant 
denying American Continental's application to sell the bonds. Bender said her 
agency had authority to bar the offering only if it found the public sale to be 
"unfair, unjust or inequitable."

Money Supply Rises: The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose 
in the week ended Sept. 11, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The Fed said 
the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,153.9 billion from 
$3,142.0 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a 
seasonally adjusted $4,017.8 billion from $4,007.3 billion. The narrowest 
measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $782.1 billion 
from $774.7 billion.

R. J. REYNOLDS TO CUT BACK ON SHIPMENTS OF CIGARETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. will slash domestic cigarette shipments for the 
rest of 1989 and revamp incentive programs for distributors, Reynolds officials 
said Thursday, in a move to increase the company's share of the shrinking U.S. 
cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
Because tobacco companies usually report their volume based on manufacturers' 
shipments rather than sales to smokers, cigarette makers sometimes push their 
wholesalers at the end of the year or the end of the quarter to buy more 
cigarettes than they can sell. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds gave volume discounts and extended credit terms to encourage such 
wholesaler buying, which is also called "loading." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduce Earnings 
</P>
<P>
"What we have decided is, as far as our company is concerned, that is a 
counterproductive practice," said David Fishel, a Reynolds spokesman. "It 
creates a returned-goods problem. You get so much product in the pipeline that 
it can't get to the shelves in a reasonable amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Although the curbed shipments will reduce operating earnings by approximately 
$170 million in the third and fourth quarters of 1989, Fishel said the company 
hopes its action will steady its manufacturing pace throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
But Emanuel Goldman, beverage and tobacco analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in San 
Francisco, took a less sanguine view of Thursday's announcement, saying 
Reynold's action amounts to "inventory surgery." 
</P>
<P>
"They mismanaged their field inventory," Goldman said. "They shouldn't have 
shipped so much. We estimate that this inventory depletion will amount to 
around 15 billion cigarettes. Last year, RJR shipped around 177 billion, so 15 
billion is like one month's sales. Rather than try to drop at a gradual rate, 
they've decided to bite the inventory bullet." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the company is losing money. In fact, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco 
Co. -- a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco -- has shown improvement in sales and 
revenues in the first half of 1989, compared to the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings and Price Hikes 
</P>
<P>
Although the company has sold fewer cigarettes, RJR Nabisco's domestic and 
international tobacco sales totaled $3.5 billion in the first six months of 
1989, up from $3.3 billion in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestic sales are going down by about 4% in unit volume," said Karl von der 
Haydn, executive vice president and chief financial officer for RJR Nabisco. 
"Profits are not necessarily going down because of cost savings and price 
increases."

PEOPLE: ORANGE COUNTY BUILDER NAMED TO FEDERAL MORTGAGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush has appointed Christine Diemer Reed, executive director of the 
Orange County Building Industry Assn., to the board of the Federal National 
Mortgage Assn., more popularly known as Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 37, of Corona del Mar, was named to a seat traditionally filled by a 
representative of the home-building industry. It is one of five seats filled by 
presidential appointment on the 18-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said she was "pleasantly surprised" by the appointment and said she would 
work to represent the building industry on the board of the private 
corporation, which buys mortgages on the secondary mortgage market, infusing 
new funds into the market. 
</P>
<P>
Reed had been director of the California Department of Housing and Community 
Development -- appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1987 -- before taking 
over the powerful local builders' trade association in July. The builders' 
group numbers 1,100 members. MICHAEL FLAGG

RADIO GROUP MAY REVIVE PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES

The National Assn. of Broadcasters, responding to a federal regulator's 
suggestion to curb "shock radio," said Thursday that it is considering reviving 
radio and TV program codes that were dropped under government pressure in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes, in an address to a 
radio broadcasters' convention in New Orleans last week, urged radio executives 
to tune out "shock radio" programs that use sexually and racially oriented 
humor to attract audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Sikes said broadcasters should revive the codes that were abandoned in the 
mid-1970s after the Justice Department initiated an antitrust lawsuit against 
provisions of the codes involving advertising. New codes should be drawn up by 
the industry, without government pressure, Sikes said. 
</P>
<P>
NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel said the NAB's executive committee, "in response to 
comments made by Chairman Sikes at Radio 89 (convention), . . . instructed the 
staff to conduct an assessment of the feasibility, effectiveness, legal and 
legislative elements of -- and member support for -- devising a statement of 
standards or guidelines concerning programming in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Sikes, a former radio station owner who came to the FCC six weeks ago, told the 
broadcasters' convention they were not "simply recorders, transmitters and 
antennas. We are what we broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that on Aug. 24, the FCC announced it was considering action against 
three radio stations in Chicago, San Jose and Indianapolis for possibly 
broadcasting indecent programming during daytime hours when children may have 
been listening. 
</P>
<P>
That action was widely viewed as a shot across the bow of broadcasters from a 
new, no-nonsense FCC. Sikes, along with new Commissioners Andrew Barrett and 
Sherrie Marshall, faced tough questioning during their Senate confirmation 
hearings in July on what they proposed to do about indecency on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Wurfel said the NAB was a little gun-shy regarding new broadcasting codes in 
light of the Justice Department attack on the old codes. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't desire to get into any further antitrust action," Wurfel said, adding 
that NAB also has to weigh First Amendment concerns and community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Wurfel said it was too early to tell if programmers or other broadcast or cable 
television groups would get involved in NAB's feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
The House earlier this year passed a bill that would give the television 
industry a three-year antitrust exemption so it can try to adopt voluntary 
guidelines on violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed a similar measure that added antitrust exemption for 
guidelines on portrayals drug use and sex, and differences in the two bills are 
now being worked out in a House-Senate conference committee.

DOW JONES MAKES AN OFFER FOR REMAINDER OF TELERATE 
</P>

<P>
Dow Jones &amp; Co., moving to consolidate its role in the lucrative field of 
electronic publishing, said Thursday that it offered to buy the rest of 
Telerate Inc., the financial data service, for about $576 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, which owns about 
two-thirds of Telerate, proposed paying $18 a share for the 32 million shares 
it does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
The bid values all of Telerate at about $1.72 billion. It represents a 
substantial premium over Telerate's $15.125 market price at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared to Meet 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street traders placed bets that the publishing giant would eventually 
have to pay even more for the rest of Telerate, and lifted its stock $5.25 to 
close at $20.375. It was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones said it is prepared to meet with Telerate to discuss the proposal, 
which traders took as a signal that the company may be willing to raise its 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Telerate, founded two decades ago, pioneered the booming business of providing 
real-time financial information to banks, brokers and corporations, using a 
global network of video terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones, also a major player in electronic news with its computer-based Dow 
Jones News Retrieval, began building a stake in Telerate a few years ago. It 
has long been expected to buy all of Telerate's stock at some point. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones currently owns 63.6 million Telerate common shares, or about 66.2% of 
the total. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of Telerate concluded a regularly scheduled meeting Thursday after 
Dow Jones announced its bid. 
</P>
<P>
A Telerate spokesman said Neil Hirsch, Telerate president and chief executive, 
had no comment on the offer. Late in the day, the company said it selected two 
independent directors to examine the Dow Jones bid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value May Be Higher 
</P>
<P>
While Dow Jones has a controlling interest in Telerate, traders figured that 
the target may need to compel a higher bid from its majority owner. 
</P>
<P>
"The directors have to demand what they consider a fair price for the minority 
shareholders," said one stock speculator who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the value of the company has been put by some analysts as high as 
$25 per share, or $2.39 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But some noted that a recent scarcity of takeover announcements had speculators 
eager to pour cash into the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones said that early next week it will start a tender offer for all 
Telerate shares it does not own at $18 each, in a proposal that will expire 
Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones said that after the tender, if it were to own more than 90% of 
Telerate or reach an acquisition agreement with the company, it will acquire 
remaining Telerate shares for the tender price. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones shares closed off 37.5 cents at $37.125.

PROPOSED LAW WOULD RAISE FUNDING AND SALARIES AT SEC

A Senate panel has passed legislation that would increase Securities and 
Exchange Commission funding by $70 million over the next two years and lift 
salary caps for SEC staffers. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee approved a package of 
SEC-related legislation without amendments and little discussion on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing the SEC's budget for 1990 and 1991, the proposed 
package would let the SEC lift caps on employee salary, especially crucial 
entry-level staff attorney posts. 
</P>
<P>
Most other federal financial regulators were given that authority by the 
savings and loan bailout bill passed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
At his confirmation hearing before the same committee last week, Richard C. 
Breeden, the Bush Administration's nominee for the SEC chairmanship, said 
raising staff pay was one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a thrift crisis in the securities markets," said Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the subcommittee that drew up the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the high turnover rate caused by salaries that are not competitive with 
the private sector, Dodd added, "We simply must have an agency that has the 
funds and expert staff to keep our markets clean and keep them sound." 
</P>
<P>
The legislative package must still clear the Senate Appropriations Committee 
and the full Senate and House.

LATE COMPUTER TRADING PUSHES DOW DOWN 3.61

<P>
The stock market posted a small loss for the second straight session Thursday, 
yielding to some late selling by professional traders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials closed with a 3.61 loss at 2,680.28. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 677 up, 750 down and 536 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Before trading began, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross 
national product grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, after adjustment for 
inflation, in the second quarter of the year. That came as a mild surprise to 
analysts, who had generally expected no change from the 2.7% estimate reported 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting suggestion of a slower-than-expected pace of business activity 
helped stocks gain ground in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
But after the advance faltered near the 2,700 level in the Dow industrial 
index, prices began to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said much of the late pressure on the market came from traders engaged 
in computer-program strategies involving stock index options and futures, and 
the prominent stocks that make up the indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan climbed 1/2 to 40 in active trading. Wall Streeters generally 
upgraded their appraisals of the company's earnings outlook after its 
announcement late Wednesday of large writeoffs on its loans to less developed 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Morgan, which late Thursday announced a move similar to Chase's, rose 1/8 
to 39 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Kollmorgen fell 5 1/4 to 18 3/8 after Vernitron Corp. said it no longer wanted 
to proceed with a $25-a-share takeover of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 146.93 million shares, up from 136.64 million 
Wednesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter 
market, totaled 173.11 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock index of 225 selected issues gained 274.44, or 
0.80%, closing at 34,745.02. The index began rising soon after the market 
opened as investors were reassured by the yen's overnight jump against the 
dollar, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices rallied in thin trading. The Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, closed at 
2,380.9, up 11.1, or 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell slightly in light trading, extending losses earlier in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/4 point or $2.50 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield rose to 8.18% from 8.16% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some credit strategists said there was no particular reason for the weakness, 
which has depressed the long bond's value by more than 1 point since Monday and 
pushed up short-term interest rates back over 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Others attributed the weakness to declining investor expectations that the 
Federal Reserve will ease credit policy to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell about 7/32 point and long-term 
issues fell about 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 1.34 to 1,175.34. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds fell 3/32 point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.48% from 7.47% 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.08% as the discount rose 1 basis 
point to 7.82%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.16% as the discount rose 1 
basis point to 7.74%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.23% as the discount 
rose 4 basis points to 7.68%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.9375%, down from 9.75% late Wednesday. The 9.75% figure was 
considered a technical aberration caused by the end of a two-week reserve 
measurement period. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained ground against the major currencies in quiet dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were unchanged to slightly higher. On the New York Commodity 
Exchange, an ounce finished at $365.50, up 60 cents from Wednesday. Republic 
National Bank later quoted a bid of $363.85, up 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Recent statements by Japanese and West German officials indicated some concern 
about the dollar's strength. But a regularly scheduled meeting of Bundesbank 
officials Thursday failed to result in an expected hike in West German interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders are anticipating higher West German and Japanese interest rates in 
tandem with softer rates in the United States, a scenario that would depress 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the dollar failed to respond to the Commerce Department's downward 
revision in the second-quarter gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 1.25 yen to a closing 145.00 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a 
higher rate of 145.10 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 145.65 yen, up 
from 145.10 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.5805 to buy 
one pound, cheaper than $1.5820 late Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost 
$1.5790, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.5835. 
</P>
<P>
Gold held steady in London at a late bid of $363.25, unchanged. In Zurich, gold 
also was unchanged at $363.50 bid. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to 
close at $364.11 bid. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver closed at $5.181 an ounce, up 
from $5.119 on Wednesday. Earlier in London, the metal was trading at a late 
bid price of $5.14 an ounce, compared to Wednesday's $5.13. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of grain and soybean futures rallied strongly on the Chicago Board of 
Trade as the markets braced for the first hard freeze of the season in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, silver futures were sharply higher for the second consecutive 
session, energy futures were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 2 to 3 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
December at $3.94 3/4 a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher, 
with December at $2.31 1/2 a bushel; oats were 1 1/2 to 2 cents higher, with 
December at $1.41 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7 1/4 cents 
higher with November at $5.82 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was rooted in forecasts for freezing temperatures this weekend and 
early next week, possibly reaching as far south as northern Arkansas and 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"This is record-breaking or near-record-breaking type cold coming in," said 
Charles Notis of Freese-Notis Weather Inc., a private forecasting firm in Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Most corn and soybean crops west of the Mississippi River and in Illinois have 
matured beyond the danger stage. But the crops in other Midwestern states east 
of the Mississippi -- especially soybeans -- are susceptible to freeze damage. 
</P>
<P>
In the western Corn Belt, where the crops are more mature, "I don't think 
you're talking about yield losses, I think you're talking about quality 
problems," said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures scooted up sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange as the 
dollar weakened. Gold futures made only slight gains, held back by the oil 
market's lackluster showing. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled 10 to 60 cents higher, with October at $366.30 an ounce; silver 
was 6 to 6.4 cents higher, with September at $5.181. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle were 0.25 cent lower to 0.55 cent higher, with October at 71.70 
cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with 
September at 83.10 cents a pound; hogs were 0.43 cent lower to 0.13 cent 
higher, with October at 41.90 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.10 
cents lower to 0.60 cent higher, with February at 48.75 cents a pound.

U.S. MEMO PROBES USE OF RICO IN TAX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Remember the controversy over whether prosecutors in the recent 
Princeton/Newport Partners trial were railroading the defendants by charging 
them with racketeering for allegedly engaging in a securities-related tax fraud 
scheme? 
</P>
<P>
Despite claims that they were being overcharged because of their connection 
with Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., five officials of the New 
Jersey securities firm and a former Drexel trader were convicted last month of 
violating the tough Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or 
RICO. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, some apparent support for the defendants' position that RICO 
should not have been used has surfaced from an unlikely source: an internal 
U.S. Department of Justice memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mail Fraud Alleged 
</P>
<P>
In a so-called blue sheet recently added to the policy manual for U.S. 
attorneys, tax division chief Shirley D. Peterson noted: "It is the position of 
the tax division that Congress intended that tax crimes be charged as tax 
crimes and that the specific criminal law provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code should form the focus of prosecutions when essentially tax law violation 
motives are involved, even though other crimes may technically have been 
committed." 
</P>
<P>
In the Princeton/Newport case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged that a 
series of phony securities trades with Drexel, used improperly to realize tax 
losses, constituted mail fraud -- and that the mail fraud was a RICO violation. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's memo, however, noted: "A similar policy will be followed with 
respect to the filing of RICO charges predicated on mail fraud charges, which 
in turn involve essentially only a tax fraud scheme. Tax offenses are not 
predicates for RICO offenses -- a deliberate congressional decision -- and 
charging a tax offense as a mail fraud charge could be viewed as circumventing 
congressional intent unless unique circumstances justifying the use of a mail 
fraud charge are present." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Bring Up' 
</P>
<P>
The memo, which does not mention the Princeton/Newport case, was added to the 
manual on July 3 -- just two weeks after the Princeton/Newport trial began -- 
said a spokesman for the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys in Washington. 
Peterson was unavailable for comment. Neal Cartusciello, a prosecutor in the 
case, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys said the memo could help efforts to get U.S. District 
Judge Robert Carter to overturn the RICO verdict. While three defendants were 
charged with stock manipulation and the tax scheme, three others were charged 
only with the tax scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to bring this up in our (appeal) papers," said defense lawyer 
Robert Schwartz. "Judge Carter has approved an indictment that the Justice 
Department now says it will never approve again."

GM UNLIKELY TO BATTLE RIVAL FORD OVER JAGUAR -- ANALYSTS

General Motors Corp. is unlikely to enter into an expensive bidding war for 
Jaguar PLC, which would pit the No. 1 U.S. auto maker against its archrival 
Ford Motor Co., analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe GM has the need for Jaguar to the extent Ford does," 
Charles Brady, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said. 
</P>
<P>
GM had no comment on rumors of its potential interest in Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
Ford announced Tuesday that it wanted to buy up to 15% of the British luxury 
car maker, which was seen as a precursor to a bid for the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
Under Jaguar's articles of incorporation, a maximum of only 15% of Jaguar may 
be sold to outside interests until the end of 1990. That restriction, which was 
imposed when the British government privatized the auto maker in 1984, can be 
relaxed with the approval of Jaguar and its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
But Jaguar, whose board meets today to discuss the move, has reacted negatively 
to the Ford move. "It's unwelcome and an unwelcome surprise," said a Jaguar 
spokesman in London. "We are genuinely surprised they have done this without 
consultation."

IBM, BAXTER FORM VENTURE TO TAP HEALTH-CARE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The world's dominant computer firm and the nation's largest hospital supply 
concern said Thursday that they would join forces to develop computer products 
and services for the rapidly growing health-care information management market. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp. and Baxter International Inc. said they 
will form a joint venture information management company that will serve all 
segments of the health-care industry. The new company, a 50-50 partnership 
between IBM and Baxter, will employ 800 when it becomes operational. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will sell products and services to hospitals of all sizes as 
well as to individual doctors and group practices, said Scott Roeth, director 
of health industries at Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM. "We will have services for 
financial applications and clinical applications of health care," he added. 
These software products would, for example, manage hospital billing and 
patient-care records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$11-Billion Market 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is expected to be in place by the end of the year to compete 
in the $11-billion worldwide market for health-care-related computer products 
and services. The companies declined to disclose financial terms of the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Both IBM and Baxter currently provide a range of computer products and services 
to the health-care industry. Baxter, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it will 
spin off its Systems and Annson Systems divisions into the new partnership. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said certain of its health-care software products and development projects 
will also be transferred to the Long Island, N.Y.-based joint venture, as well 
as a small number of IBM employees. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will take over the software applications portion of an 
ongoing IBM project to develop an integrated bedside workstation for nurses, 
Roeth said. "We have a great interest in the nursing area," he said. The goal 
of the project is to provide nurses immediate access to patient records, 
allowing them to update those computer records at the bedside. "We want to 
automate as much as we can for the nurse at bedside," he added.

FISHING NOTES / DAN STANTON; 
</P>
<P>
FRUSTRATED ANGLER GOES DEEP TO HOOK HIS SURFACE FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a typical three-day tuna fishing trip for Charlie Floven of Long 
Beach, aboard the El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day out, steady catches of small albacore were being taken on jig 
stops. Floven failed to land one while trolling. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day, the El Dorado started kelp-hopping stops for yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
At every stop the crew kept busy gaffing albacore catches. Floven kept getting 
hits but was not able to bring a longfin aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to give up, he changed his tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Floven put an 80-pound test line on his rod and tied a treble hook with an 
eight-ounce sinker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try something that is not conventional for surface fishing. I am 
not about to get skunked on this trip," Floven told the crew. 
</P>
<P>
Down toward the bottom, he let his line out with a small whitefish for bait, 
and within minutes was hooked up with a yellowtail. He was following his fish 
and reeling at the same time when suddenly his reel handle failed to turn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one that could be the jackpot and he's not going to get away," said 
Floven. As the rod bent, he started to hand line the heavy fish to the surface 
and the waiting gaff. 
</P>
<P>
It was indeed a jackpot contender, but Floven lost out by one pound to a 
26-pound yellowtail caught by Paul Bentacy of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley Wall of Carson returned Monday from a five-day albacore trip to San 
Benitos Island off Mexico and said it was the most fabulous trip he had ever 
been on. 
</P>
<P>
Wall caught 15 yellowfin tuna and 15 yellowtail and won the jackpot with a 
33-pound yellowtail. He caught three albacore but released the small one. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual Dave Freeman Fire Department Burn Foundation derby saw 56 
anglers fishing for cash awards. 
</P>
<P>
First place with a six-pound bonito went to Mark Young, who got a cash award of 
$361. Second spot, worth $217, went to Don Sutton and third, for $73, to Bob 
Olsen. All three winners were from Wilmington Fire House 49. 
</P>
<P>
The big winner of the derby was the burn fund, which received most of the 
proceeds from the derby. 
</P>
<P>
Another International Game Fish Assn. record is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach angler Nick Curcione, fishing with a small fly rod and 
eight-pound test line, caught a 10-pound, 5-ounce skipjack while fishing for 
albacore aboard the Searcher. It has been officially weighed and registered 
with the IGFA. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Friedman of Redondo Beach was also aboard the Searcher and won the 
trip's top lady angler award when she decked nine albacore and seven skipjack. 
</P>
<P>
The Catalina Island Gold Cup Marlin Tournament will take place Monday and 
Tuesday with 110 boats signed up to compete. First place is worth $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects are good as 204 marlin have been weighed in at Avalon so far this 
year.

WHO WAS STEVEN?; 
</P>
<P>
THE LITTLE BOY WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPED NEVER FOUND HIMSELF

<P>
He knew his first name was Steven. 
</P>
<P>
But emotionally he never really came home and privately he couldn't become 
whole because publicly he was always Steven Stayner, an abduction victim, 
someone in a miniseries, one missing kid among tens of thousands on flyers and 
milk cartons who, miraculously, a decade ago, did return alive and apparently 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came back he was a jolly kid, a jokester, happy-go-lucky," said Sandy 
Hawkins, a friend with the seniority of any natural aunt. "But that was the 
exterior. What was going on inside . . . apparently an awful lot of turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, suggested Anna Jones, his true aunt, Steven Stayner may well have 
remained an identity jumbled with Dennis Parnell, the name he carried during 
seven years of abduction and sexual abuse as the "son" of kidnaper Kenneth 
Parnell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Inside the Man 
</P>
<P>
"I think probably he was Dennis," she said. "A child sitting inside a man who 
didn't know how to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Steve's wife, Jody Stayner, also saw her husband's conflicts: "Steve hurt a 
lot. But he always seemed to get through it no matter what. He was a survivor. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Now it doesn't really matter. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Steve Stayner, 24, died when his motorcycle collided with a car 
pulling from a migrant-worker's center here onto rain-puddled Santa Fe Drive. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sad, reckless, ironic end -- with Stayner riding a powerful cycle he 
was not licensed to operate. Nor was he wearing a helmet. His had been stolen, 
said a friend, two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He had bought the blue-and-white, 1989 Kawasaki EX-500 with a piece of the 
$30,000 he received for rights to the story of his 1972 kidnaping and 
astounding return. It was shown in May as a television miniseries: "I Know My 
First Name is Steven." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if there could be any softening of his tragedy, noted a relative, it would 
be in knowing that Stayner died while following adult responsibilities -- 
returning home from a small but steady job to continue his reconciliation with 
Jody after the latest of several short estrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there were still some demons haunting him," said Diane Booth. She is 
a reporter for the Merced Sun Star whose interviews with Stayner became a small 
friendship. "But he was trying to overcome them (demons). I believe that in 
time he would." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there wasn't time. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Stayner was buried alongside his grandparents at Merced District 
Cemetery where 450 people formed around his powder blue steel casket and there 
were enough news crews to be kept behind ropes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a funeral service at the Merced Stake Center of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-Day Saints, where Stayner had been converted in 1985, his 
church counselor, Steve Tucker, tried to explain the clashes that tore at a 
young man's peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Before he was kidnaped he was just Steven Stayner, a kid growing up in 
Merced," said Tucker in eulogy. "But seven years later, he became Steven 
Stayner, a national figure. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came home, his family could not have him for themselves. He had to be 
shared." With all this international attention, he said, Steven had "a hard 
time getting his feet on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
But, spoke a sister, Jody C. Stayner, he wouldn't quit and continued to shove 
until the past did indeed begin to retreat. So even in his death, she told 
mourners who spilled from chapel pews to folding chairs in the center's 
gymnasium, there is a satisfaction from seeing the fading of a past, dark life 
and an assumed identity. "I'm so glad that he went as Steven Gregory Stayner, 
our brother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For seven grim years, however, the only traces of Steven Gregory Stayner were 
snapshots and a family's memories. Of a quiet boy who tended a fallen owl and 
liked to ride dad's tractor on their almond ranch near Snelling. Of the third 
of five children who wrote his name on an inside garage wall when nobody could 
know the scribble would one day become the most tender of family souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
On a December day in 1972, two drifters approached Stayner on a Merced street 
corner. Ervin Murphy said he was a minister and wanted to drive Stayner home to 
collect a church donation from his mother. Kenneth Parnell, a pedophile with 
previous convictions for child molestation, opened the car door for the 
freckled second-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Stayner was sodomized by Parnell that first night. Up to the age of 14, he was 
shuttled from remote towns to isolated cabins in Northern California and 
registered for brief periods at several schools as Dennis Parnell. By the sixth 
grade he had been beaten, smoked marijuana, got drunk on cheap whiskey and been 
thoroughly manipulated into believing his parents didn't want him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Victim 
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day 1980, a fresh Parnell captive, 5-year-old Timmy White, was 
brought home. Timmy was crying. Steven was reminded of his own early tears, 
pain and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't see Timmy suffer," Stayner explained later. "I just didn't think it 
was right for him to have to go through the same thing that I did. He really 
didn't have to. There was someone there who could stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Hand-in-hand, Steven and Timmy hitchhiked 40 miles to Ukiah. They found a 
police station and were free. Timmy, unharmed, after 16 days. Steven, by then 
unsure of even his real name, after seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Ervin Murphy served two years of a five-year sentence for kidnaping. He was 
released in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Parnell served five years of an eight-year sentence. He was released in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Stayner served 10 years of a lifetime sentence of restlessness, doubts 
and rebellion against basic authority. He was released Saturday, say members of 
his family, when his motorcycle rammed the left-side front door of a 1976 
Plymouth Volare squeezing onto Santa Fe Drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Belief in Healing 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Stayner was lucky to survive his teens and the times he talked, 
claimed one close relative, of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
For there were only a few counseling sessions for Stayner following his return 
and no psychotherapy. Stayner said he didn't need it. His parents, noted 
relatives, believed there would be full healing from the abduction and its 
sexual abuse in the closeness and love of a family reunited. 
</P>
<P>
"I never reached out to talk about it with my parents," Stayner once said, "and 
they never pushed to find out." Nor was the subject discussed with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he used to reason, why pay a psychologist $100 an hour to sit and talk 
out a problem when "I've been talking to reporters for nine years. It's a good 
substitute." 
</P>
<P>
But reporters, said those close to Stayner, also were part of the problem. They 
came from New York and Germany, all the television networks and magazines, 
every wire service and most newspapers when Stayner came home to 1655 Bette 
St., the home his parents refused to sell because it could be the one place 
their missing son might search for. A book was promised. Of course there would 
be a television movie. 
</P>
<P>
The story was regurgitated incessantly. On Stayner's first fishing trip with 
his father to McClure Lake. On the family's first picnic and Christmas. On all 
the anniversaries. When Parnell was tried and sentenced. When Parnell was 
released. When Stayner married. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toll of Telling 
</P>
<P>
Stayner -- in the expressed belief that repeating his story would sustain 
awareness of child abductions -- never refused an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Yet telling took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to think, said Anna Jones, that one day the reporters "would get 
everything they wanted, finally, and go home and leave him alone. But that 
didn't happen. They just kept hounding him." 
</P>
<P>
Or as a sister, Cindy Stayner, noted: "At first he ate up all the attention and 
was impressed by it. Then it got old and he tried to get out of the light." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, said reporter Booth, Stayner likely was hobbled by another 
chunk of his past. With Parnell he had led an undisciplined life style "with a 
single man, smoking and drinking . . . a life where he was running it." 
</P>
<P>
To return to a family circle, to its rules, curfews and responsibilities, she 
said, was bound to bring difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everything Has Changed' 
</P>
<P>
Stayner described those difficulties in a 1984 interview with Newsweek 
magazine: "I returned almost a grown man and yet my parents saw me at first as 
their seven-year-old. After they stopped trying to teach me the fundamentals 
all over again, it got better. But why doesn't my dad hug me anymore? I guess 
seven years changed him, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has changed. Sometimes I blame myself. I don't know sometimes if I 
should have come home. Would I have been better off if I didn't?" 
</P>
<P>
There were grade and discipline problems in high school. Stayner dropped out. 
There were quarrels at home. Twice he was ordered out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
By the age of 19, he had piled up $1,100 in unpaid traffic tickets. He paid 
them off by raking leaves and splitting logs for the county parks service but 
couldn't break the ways of a traffic scofflaw. In the end, his driver's license 
was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
He studied welding at Merced College but nothing came of that. He expressed an 
interest in law enforcement but did not apply for work with any police 
department. He sold fried chicken, delivered pizzas, worked as a security 
guard, labored in a meat-packing factory and worked for the city parks 
department -- but never at any job paying higher than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slowed the Wandering 
</P>
<P>
Then Stayner seemed to slow his wandering. Some believe the pivot was pretty 
obvious. Jody Edmondson. They dated for a year, then married in 1985. He was 
20. She was 17. 
</P>
<P>
There were arguments, of course, and walkouts. Over bills. Over how pickles 
should be sliced for a hamburger. It happens when you live first with in-laws 
and then with cousins in their mobile home. It's unavoidable when two people 
still young enough to be college juniors are holding down three adult jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly, remember friends, Stayner's life in recent months was starting to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
For now there were two children -- 3-year-old Ashley and 2-year-old Steven Jr. 
-- to protect and with an unusual dedication rooted in his own past. Or as 
Stayner said in a May interview promoting the movie of his life: "They don't go 
out unless I go with them or there's someone outside watching. If they're just 
out on the porch, the door is always open. As long as I can see them and hear 
their voices, I'm OK." 
</P>
<P>
He had one job helping the janitorial service of his father-in-law, an 
apartment house manager. There was a second job as a trainee manager at a Pizza 
Hut and it was going well. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting a feeling of accomplishment," said Lee Marano, owner of five 
Pizza Hut franchises in the Merced-Atwater area. "He was evolving, developing a 
more outgoing personality, giving direction to others." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role of Crusader 
</P>
<P>
Stayner also was becoming a full crusader for the one thing in which he 
certainly was expert -- child abduction. 
</P>
<P>
He delivered warning lectures to youngsters at local schools. There were 
appearances for the Kevin Collins Foundation of San Francisco and other groups 
searching for missing children. Stayner, accompanied by Kay Stayner, his 
mother, testified before the Ways and Means Committee of the State Assembly on 
one bill that would increase penalties for kidnaping children, and another 
requiring parents to have their children fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
"Steven became a representative of the fact that, hey, missing children can 
come home," noted Hawkins. "He was something tangible, something for them 
(parents) to hang onto in this situation where thousands go missing and only 
two or three come home." 
</P>
<P>
The burdens of his earlier life, said his friends, seemed to become lighter as 
each door closed on the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closing the Door 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest, they believe, was the making of the miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
"In one of my last interviews with him, right before the miniseries, he said 
that he was glad that was over," Booth related. "He had known for years there 
would be a TV movie. So to him, it was one more of those doors closing." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, just before 5 p.m., Stayner was finished with his shift at Pizza 
Hut at 16th and G streets. It had been raining heavily. His manager, Todd 
Smith, suggested he drive the franchise's pickup home and stay dry. 
</P>
<P>
Stayner -- after reminding the manager that his license had been suspended and 
that an accident in the truck might not be good for Pizza Hut business -- 
declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
He rode off down Santa Fe Drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rammed a Car 
</P>
<P>
At 4:55 p.m., three miles later, and at less than the posted 55-m.p.h. limit, 
he rammed the car that, said California Highway Patrol investigators, pulled 
into the street ahead of his cycle. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:35 p.m., at Merced Community Medical Center, Stayner was declared dead of 
a fracture at the back of the skull. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car -- identified by officers as Antonio Loera, an employee 
of a tomato-packing company -- fled the scene. He later surrendered in Tijuana, 
was returned here and has been arraigned on felony hit-and-run and manslaughter 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Last Reunion 
</P>
<P>
The life and death of Steven Stayner has written touching footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
A small family group attended his funeral service. They sat in rear seats and 
were able to avoid the media. It was James and Angie White and their son, 
Timmy, now 14, the boy that Stayner had walked to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
There was one lonely statement by Cindy Stayner. She said she was waiting for 
the telephone to ring. "Someone will say it's OK, Steve is here and he's 
alive," she said. "Because that's what happened before." 
</P>
<P>
Jody Stayner, a widow at 20, tried to draw some calm from it all. She 
remembered her husband's past, his pain and his strange sense of not quite 
belonging. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's not hurting any more," she said. "Nobody can hurt him now." He's 
free, she said. That's why she chose a very special inscription for the lid of 
her husband's casket. "It says: 'Going Home.' "

BRAVO, THE PACESETTER OF HIGH-PROFILE SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, Goodwin is a regular contributor to the Times fashion pages.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rose Marie Bravo isn't a designer label. But from her Union Square office in 
San Francisco, 38-year-old Bravo wields enormous influence over what the women 
of Los Angeles will wear to lunch at the Bistro Garden or a performance at the 
Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed chairman and chief executive of I. Magnin and Bullocks Wilshire last 
spring by her mentor, Edward S. Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive of 
the department stores' parent company, R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Bravo is a retail 
star -- one of the youngest and highest-ranking women in the retail business 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Her salary was estimated in excess of $1,000 per day in an article that ran in 
the San Francisco Examiner last fall. 
</P>
<P>
She is not only making her mark on Macy's two toniest divisions, but also on 
polite society, an important constituency of both Bullocks Wilshire and I. 
Magnin (preferred by Nancy Reagan) -- or at least on how the social people 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
Paloma Picasso black leather tote bag in hand, Chanel purse on her shoulder, 
Bravo hits the road with the frequency of a rock star as she dashes from 
European collections to store inspections to society-splashed San Francisco 
dinners to honor her name-brand designers. All along the way, she makes mental 
notes of what high-profile types such as San Francisco socialite Ann Getty 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
She was on the road again recently for one of her frequent visits to Los 
Angeles, this time to concentrate on I. Magnin. (She oversees all 23 I. Magnin 
stores, including eight in Southern California, along with the seven Southern 
California Bullocks Wilshire stores.) 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, a car picks her up at home in the wee hours of the 
morning and delivers her to the airport in time to make it to I. Magnin, 
Beverly Hills, by 10 a.m. Italian designers Rosita and Tai Missoni are making a 
personal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The Missonis are flattered -- if a little shocked -- to see the chic, 
high-energy executive standing in the store to greet them. She wears a beige, 
chevron-patterned suit from their fall collection. (Suit size: large. "I 
thought, did I gain that much weight?" Bravo giggles.) 
</P>
<P>
"We were always very nicely received at I. Magnin, I must say," Rosita says, 
"but we didn't expect to see the chairman." 
</P>
<P>
After spending the morning attending to the Missonis, making sure among other 
things that they have enough to eat, Bravo holes up inside an office for a 
conference with Betty Leonard, store manager and operating vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of talking sales figures, she fires off a multitude of questions about 
certain key social events. Especially the recent gala for the Los Angeles Music 
Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Does everybody go to this thing?" she grills Leonard. "What were they wearing? 
Who were the important designers? Any trends in the dresses? Did you see lots 
of chiffon? 
</P>
<P>
"Was there any Armani? What about St. Laurent with the brocade?" she inquires 
of two designers with their own boutiques at I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
She even wants to know trends in evening bags. Were they beaded, satin or 
quilted? 
</P>
<P>
These aren't idle inquiries. The Beverly Hills store is a barometer for all the 
others. (Half of I. Magnin's business is done in Southern California and 
Phoenix.) 
</P>
<P>
"If something is upscale and unique and expensive and it doesn't sell in 
Beverly Hills, well, chances are it's not going to sell anywhere we have a 
store," Bravo explains. 
</P>
<P>
"The ladies in L.A. want whatever's new, whatever's hot. They want it first. 
They want it now." 
</P>
<P>
Bravo, a Macy's New York careerist, rose from associate buyer of cosmetics and 
fragrances in 1974 to senior vice president for merchandising (cosmetics, 
coats, accessories, fine jewelry) before Finkelstein sent her packing to San 
Francisco last April. It was just after he acquired Federated Department 
Stores' California divisions, including the Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire 
stores as well as I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Finkelstein basically said to me, 'I want you to run these stores, now 
figure out how to do it,' " Bravo recalls. 
</P>
<P>
She put Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin under one management, consolidated 
buying offices and made merchandise changes, while being sensitive to the 
stores' differences. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to imitate the success of the menswear business for Bullocks Wilshire, 
for instance, a men's suit and clothing department opened in I. Magnin, Beverly 
Hills, three months ago. In exchange, Bullocks Wilshire has recently seen an 
influx of women's ready-to-wear designer labels. 
</P>
<P>
Next, like a woman redecorating two houses at once, Bravo started a massive, 
$5-million-plus (sources say) renovation and redecoration of the Beverly Hills 
I. Magnin store, and began planning changes for Bullocks Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the designer salon at Magnin's has a working fireplace and a pouf covered 
in a Bill Blass leopard print. Soon, Bullocks Wilshire's first floor will get 
some spit and polish. 
</P>
<P>
Between parties and renovations, Bravo jets off to Europe to cover 
ready-to-wear and couture collections and touches down in Manhattan 10 times a 
year. But socializing in California, in the name of her stores, is an important 
part of her job. 
</P>
<P>
She says she got intensive training in that particular skill while working in 
cosmetics for Macy's in New York. She refers to it as "vendor relations," or 
the care and feeding of fashion and beauty images, egos and personalities. When 
she began launching designer perfumes from Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass, 
Galanos and others, she says, "I sort of got the gist of the importance of 
designers." 
</P>
<P>
The same week she played host to the Missonis, Bravo put on a breakfast for Bob 
Mackie, who was appearing in I. Magnin in San Francisco, and oversaw a charity 
luncheon at I. Magnin in Seattle for Georgette Mosbacher, president of La 
Prairie cosmetics and the wife of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
That weekend, Oscar de la Renta arrived in San Francisco to receive the Mary 
Ann Magnin Award, and Bravo, appropriately dressed in De la Renta, was hosting 
another dinner. (Ann Getty tossed yet another party.) 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, she manages to do it all and seldom step on anybody's toes. Quite the 
opposite. Robert A. Nielsen, chairman and president of Revlon fashion and 
designer group, maintains: "Rose Marie has proved you can be effective in 
business and be a nice person. When she heard my wife was ill recently, she 
called her at home and at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gould, president of Giorgio, Beverly Hills, and Parfums Stern, throws 
up his hands. "I've got nothing bad to say about her." 
</P>
<P>
The most critical remark comes from Carol Phillips, chairman of Clinique, who 
recalls Bravo's cosmetics-buying days in New York: "At that time she wasn't 
married and struck me as one of those 24-hour-a-day businesswomen." 
</P>
<P>
Her workaholic ways do put a crimp on her private life. Last May, her husband 
of six years, Bill Jackey, a furniture manufacturer's representative with whom 
she has had a long-distance relationship since she moved West last April, 
closed their New York apartment and relocated in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
For their summer vacation, the couple spent the weekend in Santa Barbara. But 
of course, Bravo sneaked off to see the local I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
The job, she admits, is "all consuming. It leaves little time for anything." 
She bemoans the fact that she only sees her family in Florida once or twice a 
year, and even though her best friend of 20 years now lives an hour away from 
her in Palo Alto, the two women have only been able to get together three times 
since Bravo moved there. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, Bravo decided, to her mother's dismay, that having children was out 
of the question. (Jackey has two grown children from a previous marriage.) "It 
would be unfair to have a child in this kind of situation," Bravo says about 
her demanding schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Evans, former president of Monet jewelry and currently president of the 
InterPacific retail group, says Jackey's ego doesn't appear to be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Many high-ranking women have husbands who don't have high-powered positions, 
like my own husband, but they are willing to accept our high profiles because 
their egos are strong. I think he's very proud of her," Evans says. 
</P>
<P>
The couple intends to spend non-working weekends floating on the San Francisco 
Bay in their 27-foot fishing boat, which arrived from Long Island two weeks 
ago. Bravo doesn't catch many fish, but she does let down her fashion 
standards, braving the seas in long underwear, wool hat and Jackey's old army 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
An admitted failure in the homemaking department, she's appreciative of her 
husband's cooking; if he's away, she orders takeout salad from Macy's Cellar, a 
restaurant in the specialty store. A former English major at Fordham University 
in New York, Bravo always has a stack of books at her bedside. Most recently, 
Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray." 
</P>
<P>
Ask her about the future, and she'll tell you about the future of shopping. 
Bravo believes it will be a throwback to the past. "I almost think, in a way, 
we might go back to what once existed when customers had their own saleslady, 
and she helped them from head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
"All this talk about computers and mail-order shopping, I don't really buy. 
When it comes down to it, you need a human being. It's a very human business."

GOVERNMENT AND THE ARTS;

<P>
AMERICANS BACK U.S. FUNDING BUT SPLIT OVER CURBS, POLL SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans approve, by nearly 2-to-1, of government funding of the arts, but 
they are evenly split in their reactions to Sen. Jesse Helms' (R-N.C.) effort 
to ban public money for "obscene" or "indecent" art, according to The Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 49% believe artists receiving government funding have no right to be 
daring or sometimes offensive in their work, while 40% said they did, whereas 
11% didn't know or wouldn't say. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted Sept. 14-19, comes as a U.S. Senate subcommittee prepares 
to hold a confirmation hearing today on President Bush's nominee to be the 
National Endowment for the Arts new chairman, Oregon lawyer John E. Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results were tempered by the finding that three-quarters of Americans 
haven't heard about the controversy that has enveloped the endowment. Large 
proportions said they didn't know enough about other issues in the controversy 
to respond. 
</P>
<P>
A House-Senate conference committee is expected to begin deliberations next 
week on a compromise version of the endowment's 1990 appropriations bill, which 
was amended in the Senate to include the Helms restrictions, as well as 
provisions blacklisting two private arts groups for five years for organizing 
controversial exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Helms did not respond to calls from The Times seeking his reaction to the poll 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Poll findings on artistic-freedom issues found Americans generally unaware of 
details of the endowment controversy and related issues. Some arts observers 
said, however, that the lack of awareness of key issues in the controversy 
wasn't as high as they feared. But they said it reflects a reality the arts 
community has been reluctant to face -- that the security of artistic freedom 
and the future health of the federal arts program are not issues that have 
excited widespread public concern. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Murphy, executive director of the Washington-based American Arts Alliance, 
said she found the results overall to be "a rather encouraging set of 
statistics." She said the division over the right of government-funded art to 
be daring or offensive may be the most significant finding of all. "Obviously, 
the majority of people are not even aware of what Mr. Helms is doing," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The poll seems to have captured the level of awareness the American public has 
about the endowment and issues that are surrounding the controversy," said 
Richard Koshalek, director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. "I 
don't think the vast majority of the public is aware or concerned at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's not as bad as it could have been," said Robert H. Reid, director 
of the California Arts Council. "The censorship part is not as bad as I would 
have expected, except for the bizarre response on the Bill of Rights. Whenever 
you get religion, sex, the flag and politics all rolled into one issue, you're 
bound to get a tremendously emotional response." 
</P>
<P>
Although there was a nearly equal division over the Helms amendment -- with 25% 
of respondents approving of it and 23% disapproving -- the largest proportion 
of all, 52%, said they didn't know enough about the issue to have an opinion or 
hadn't heard of the controversy at all. 
</P>
<P>
A similar division appeared in public opinion over whether government money 
should be spent to promote the arts. While 40% said they favored such 
expenditures and 21% said they opposed, 39% had no opinion or were not aware of 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But while an overwhelming majority of Americans -- 66% -- agree with First 
Amendment guarantees against government-imposed restrictions on freedom of 
speech or the press, 16% disagree that such protections should exist and 18% 
say they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Those observations are among findings of a new Los Angeles Times Poll based on 
telephone interviews with 2,217 Americans 18 and older. The national sampling 
included respondents in all 50 states and is subject to a sampling error of 
plus or minus three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Among the poll's other observations were these: 
</P>
<P>
While an overwhelming majority -- 61% versus 27%, with 12% saying they didn't 
know -- opposed government censorship of the arts, 49% of Americans said they 
think artists who get government money have no right to be daring or offensive 
in their work. Another 40% supported such work and 11% didn't now or refused to 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
More people -- 39% versus 31% -- thought government support should be withdrawn 
when a controversy develops over a publicly funded artwork -- specifically work 
alleged to be distasteful or profane; 15% said the response depended on the 
situation and 15% weren't sure or wouldn't say. 
</P>
<P>
Fully 76% of the respondents had heard either nothing or very little about the 
controversy enveloping the national endowment. Only 6% said they had heard "a 
lot" about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of people believe arts support should be at either the state or 
federal level, with about a quarter favoring each level of government.

<P>
At a pace more appropriate to a forced march than a gallery tour, John E. 
Frohnmayer was showing a small group of visitors the 20th-Century art 
collection that adorns the two floors of his downtown law firm. 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected of the man who is to appear in Washington today for the 
opening of his confirmation hearings as President Bush's nominee to head the 
National Endowment for the Arts, Frohnmayer was a member of the law firm's art 
selection committee when the works were bought. 
</P>
<P>
In almost perfunctory fashion, he recited the names and backgrounds of the 
mainly Oregonian artists. On reaching "Yuba 4," a tall copper-clad redwood work 
by sculptor Mel Schuler in the 17th-floor reception area, he suddenly laughed 
heartily -- an unabashed, genuine laugh from deep down in the gut. 
</P>
<P>
Given the nature of his nomination and the ugly political crisis in which the 
national endowment finds itself over its indirect support of artworks that some 
call obscene or sacrilegious, he had realized that he might be well advised to 
issue a disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a very phallic piece down there," Frohnmayer said finally to his 
guests. And then he laughed again. 
</P>
<P>
He is like that. He is a genuinely informal yet deeply introspective attorney 
-- who happens to also hold a degree in theology. He is a veteran of the 
Vietnam War, rows competitively on the local Willamette River, has studied 
voice extensively and once had the option, which he declined, of pursuing an 
operatic career. He seems a man of consummately lowbrow exterior but highbrow 
insides. 
</P>
<P>
He is a moderate Republican -- though he insists he detests political labels -- 
whose personal tastes in music span an entire range of classical to Broadway 
and 1960s folk, and in art favor the abstract over the representational. 
Politically, he is close to Oregon's Republican senators, Bob Packwood and Mark 
Hatfield, and to liberal Democratic Rep. Les AuCoin too. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his 18th-floor office with a view straight out at the west hills of 
Portland, where he lives with his wife, Leah, and two teen-age sons -- one of 
whom is in college and the other a high school senior -- Frohnmayer paused for 
a second to focus on this most crucial current question for not only the 
endowment's chairman but the organization as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"My response to people who argue that the federal government has no legitimate 
role in supporting the arts is that we're not here just to be protected," he 
said finally. "The government doesn't exist just to put an impregnable ring of 
missiles around the United States, because there has to be something in the 
middle there -- something we're protecting. 
</P>
<P>
"And that is the ability of Americans to exercise artistic freedom. To learn 
through the arts that there are a number of different ways to look at things, 
which is the fundamental basis of a cooperative society." 
</P>
<P>
He has met with Bush only once -- briefly -- before being nominated for the 
post in July. But he expects Bush to support the arts endowment 
enthusiastically -- if only because, at a funding level of about $171 million 
next year, it represents a cheap way to make a highly visible political 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
He is unashamedly an Oregonian. He makes no apologies for being a stranger to 
the Beltway -- the highway system that more or less surrounds Washington. He 
emphasizes his respect for the essential role of major East Coast cultural 
institutions but sees the arts as much less elitist than bluebloods of what 
could be called the nation's Ahhts Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I'm not from any of those places (in the Northeast corridor 
including Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston) and the fact that I am 
from Portland, Ore., I think will do something toward changing the perception" 
of the arts endowment as an elitist preserve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm certainly not unmindful of the major, high-budget institutions in the 
country. They are absolutely critical in terms of our long-term artistic 
health." 
</P>
<P>
With his brother Dave, who is Oregon's attorney general, Frohnmayer started a 
singing group called Frohn's Tunes that performs popular songs with lyrics 
rewritten as political spoofs each year at a forum for Oregon Republicans 
called the Dorchester Conference. 
</P>
<P>
A recent example was a devastating satire on the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, whom 
Dave Frohnmayer had played a large role in running out of the state. Sung to 
the tune "Ghost Riders in the Sky," the chorus went: 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a Rolls 
</P>
<P>
 Give me a Royce 
</P>
<P>
 The life of a guru is choice." 
</P>
<P>
But behind this studied informality, there is a side of John Frohnmayer that 
believes passionately in the federal government's role as a catalyst for the 
arts. It is what first led him to seek the job eight years ago from 
then-President Ronald Reagan, who chose a career bureaucrat, Frank Hodsoll, 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
If a swing through Washington last week, in which Frohnmayer met with 20 key 
members of Congress, is any indication, the Portland trial lawyer and First 
Amendment expert can expect an easy time in his confirmation. He even had a 
cordial half-hour meeting with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), author of an 
amendment to the national endowment's 1990 appropriation bill that would ban 
federal support for any art that is "offensive, indecent or sacrilegious." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview here this week, Frohnmayer declined to describe the encounter 
with Helms, but the senator is said to understand that his amendment may not 
survive a House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer has likewise been circumspect in discussing details of the overall 
political unpleasantness surrounding the endowment. He has adhered to a 
strategy that relies on him keeping his thoughts about such things private 
until senators who vote on his confirmation have an opportunity to ask such 
questions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
However, Helms also is said to have made it clear that he believes he has 
increased his own political capital by pressing his campaign against the 
endowment. Helms, who did not respond to calls seeking his comment, is said to 
believe that, while there will be a viable national endowment for Frohnmayer to 
run when he takes over next month, the period of confrontation with 
conservatives over what is -- and is not -- appropriate subject matter for 
government-supported art may have only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the endowment need to mend our fences," Frohnmayer said. "By that I mean 
with the Congress. And we need to let them know that we are an agency that is 
responsive and responsible and is really going to do something for our society 
which is exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think one necessarily has to agree with every criticism that's 
leveled, but I do think that one has to take (the criticism) seriously and 
responsibly. Where we really need work is in emphasizing the positive of the 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer, 47, was born in Medford, Ore., one of three sons and a daughter of 
a lawyer father and music teacher/arts patron mother. Dave and John Frohnmayer 
became lawyers -- though John flirted with a religious calling, attending Union 
Theological Seminary in New York as a Rockefeller Fellow. He holds a master's 
degree in Christian ethics from the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer's two other siblings, Mira and Philip, are musicians and music 
teachers. But music has been a common vehicle for the whole family. John 
Frohnmayer mastered the guitar as a teen-ager and has kept up his voice 
instruction throughout his legal career. Dave Frohnmayer, who describes himself 
as the least accomplished musician in the family, still managed to win a 
celebrity "battle of the batons" benefit for the Eugene Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Although John Frohnmayer's theological background has drawn little attention, 
it may turn out to be directly relevant to the endowment crisis. One of the 
works that got the endowment into trouble was an image of a photograph, "Piss 
Christ," of a crucifix immersed in urine, by New York photographer Andres 
Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer has consistently refused to discuss his personal feelings about this 
image or the homoerotic and sadomasochistic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, 
which make up the other immediate cause of the controversy. But it is known 
that, regarding "Piss Christ," his personal theological reading of the image is 
that it is not sacrilegious but could be seen as a legitimate commentary on the 
brutal persecution of early Christians that the cross first symbolized. 
</P>
<P>
He is said to find the body of Mapplethorpe's work -- most of which was 
well-received art photography -- a significant contribution to the medium but 
to question the choice of subject matter of the photographer who died of AIDS 
this year at 43. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer served in the Navy aboard the light cruiser Oklahoma City off the 
coast of Vietnam in the late 1960s. A lawyer in Eugene and then in Portland 
beginning in 1972, he has specialized in civil litigation. Frohnmayer has a 
special interest in First Amendment law and has represented Oregon newspapers 
and television stations. 
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the Oregon Arts Commission for seven years and president for 
four. He is on the board of Chamber Music Northwest; has sung in New York, 
Chicago and Palo Alto; directed a sculpture competition in Eugene in 1974, and 
was on a committee to select sculpture for a new Capitol in Salem in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Capitol sculpture that may have been Frohnmayer's first brush with 
the rough and tumble of politics, Dave Frohnmayer recalls. At the time, Dave 
was a state representative who had opposed financing of the sculpture John had 
helped to choose. This development was not well received in Salem, but John 
defused the controversy by inviting an articulate sculptor to testify about 
acquisition of the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"A strength of his is his real steadiness," Dave Frohnmayer said of his 
brother. "He's very cool under fire. He has a very engaging sense of 
self-effacing humor. He's not full of himself and he's not going to be one to 
lose his cool at the first setback." 
</P>
<P>
These are attributes that likely will be important in John Frohnmayer's tenure 
at the national endowment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll have a real good sense of where he wants to end up," said Dave 
Frohnmayer. "He has a good sense of vision and goal-setting. That's very 
important instead of just blowing in the political wind." 
</P>
<P>
John Frohnmayer will need all of those skills in his new job; he is all but 
certain to be confirmed by the Senate. He will take over a demoralized 
endowment wracked by political crisis and decimated by a series of resignations 
and imminent resignations of key staff members. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Frohnmayer is expected to arrive next month, the national endowment 
will be without its deputy chairman, director of policy and planning, general 
counsel, director of administration and the heads of four of its programs, 
including the crucially important theater and music divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer is expected to move quickly to shape his own new management team -- 
which, because of the extent of the vacancies, is expected to reshape the 
direction of the national endowment virtually overnight. He talks about a new 
era of openness and responsiveness at the arts endowment -- apparently, 
endowment insiders say, after Frohnmayer received a torrent of complaints in 
his visits to Capitol Hill last week that the agency is stuffy, aloof, arrogant 
and just plain snotty. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the endowment would be a very open place," he said. "I think 
accessibility is often a problem if you're a federal agency. I'd even like us 
to have an 800 (toll-free telephone) number and to see if there are ways we can 
be more visible around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer is also expected to move almost immediately to start exploring 
financing methods the endowment has not previously attempted. He noted that the 
endowment has never attempted to function as a true endowment would. He said 
his own analysis of the endowment's enabling legislation has led him to believe 
it could accept private donations, make loans and perhaps even hold investments 
-- all operating tools common to endowments. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Frohnmayer believes he can overcome the political and management 
problems and get on with his vision of the arts endowment's role in American 
society. It's an inclusionary, grass-roots, even populist arts philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"One dream scenario," he said, "would be that, in every community in the 
country, there are imagination celebrations and art teachers in the schools who 
really turn kids on to creativity and music teachers who can work with the kids 
as alternatives to gang life. 
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to see the U.S. as a nation where people are really 
practicing the arts. It's not corny to sing. It's not wimpy to paint. You 
shouldn't get derision if you do ballet. There needs to be a sense that 
creativity and the arts are normal things to do. That's the ultimate of a 
creative society."

CBS PRODUCER GETS USAIR STORY HARD WAY: HE IS CRASH SURVIVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
While other news organizations were still scrambling to cover the crash of a 
USAir jetliner that plunged into the bay near La Guardia Airport Wednesday 
night, CBS was able to provide viewers with an eyewitness account from the 
scene. One of its producers had been on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Producer David Hawthorne had been on his way to North Carolina to coordinate 
coverage of Hurricane Hugo when the jetliner suddenly skidded in the rain and 
plunged into the bay near La Guardia Airport at 11:27 p.m., EDT. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply ran out of runway," Hawthorne, a 29-year-old producer for CBS 
Newsnet, the network's service for sharing news footage with local affiliates, 
recalled Thursday. "I didn't know that we had hit water until I climbed out 
onto the wing. The plane had split into three pieces. When someone shone a 
flashlight into the plane, I saw two people strapped into their seats, with 
blood around them." 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers were killed, and 51 of the other 61 people on board were injured 
in the crash. Hawthorne was holding a passenger's baby when he realized that he 
was over water. "I thought, 'Whoa, I can't swim well enough to carry a baby.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to high tech, what Hawthorne could do was report the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Once everyone was safe, I thought, 'I've got to call CBS News.' " Hawthorne 
returned to his mangled seat, retrieved the cellular phone he was carrying with 
him on his assignment, and called in to the CBS News desk. The desk put him on 
the air live on WCBS-TV in New York at 11:59 p.m. At 12:33 a.m. EDT, the 
network broke into its entertainment programming and Hawthorne -- whose 
previous report for WCBS had been his first on-air experience -- reported from 
the scene, live on the phone to Dan Rather, who had come into the studio to 
help with the live coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"He had cool-headed intelligence, and it was hard to believe he'd never been on 
the air before," Rather said Thursday. "I think he'll get the equivalent of a 
battlefield promotion." 
</P>
<P>
Rescued to the La Guardia runway on a raft along with other passengers, 
Hawthorne continued to provide off-camera coverage for CBS News producers until 
nearly 3 a.m. At 7:10 a.m., he was a guest on "CBS News This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
On his way to the doctor Thursday afternoon to check out soreness and a slight 
pain in his neck and shoulders, the producer said he had no thoughts of turning 
his experience into an on-camera career. 
</P>
<P>
"When I called in, I never expected to be on the air," he said. "I thought 
they'd send out one of those guys who look good and can tell the story on the 
air."

SALES DOWN, PROBLEMS UP FOR ADULT HOME-VIDEO INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Time Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-pornography groups haven't squashed the X-rated home-video business but 
they have certainly inflicted damage. The industry, which prefers to be called 
adult rather than X-rated, is suffering from dwindling profits, decreasing 
visibility and a steady shrinkage of outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-pornography groups such as Citizens for Decency Through Law and the 
American Family Assn., working mostly on a state and local level, usually 
attack video retailers, encouraging the passage and enforcement of laws that 
forbid the sale or rental of "obscene" materials. 
</P>
<P>
"When retailers are prosecuted, they have to hire lawyers, which is costly," 
said David Kasten, president of the Adult Video Assn. "Some retailers unite to 
fight the legal battles, but it's still a financial drain. Some retailers find 
it easier to just stop stocking adult titles. In some states -- such as Utah, 
Florida, the Carolinas, Virginia -- you can't really market adult films." 
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the shrinking number of outlets, Mara Epstein, vice president of 
sales and promotion for the adult company Arrow Films and Video Inc, said: 
"Most of the big national chains don't stock adult titles any more -- too many 
complaints and hassles." 
</P>
<P>
And those that do tend not to make it obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the Tower chain still carries adult titles, product manager John 
Thrasher said: "Adult movies are about 5% of our business. We just try to 
provide as wide a range of titles as possible for our customers. Retailers just 
have to be smart about it. They put them in a special section or under the 
counter or in some out-of-the-way place. They have to be very discreet about 
displaying them." 
</P>
<P>
But out of sight doesn't mean out of mind. 
</P>
<P>
There's still a big audience for these movies. The sale and rental of adult 
movies represents 12% of the home-video business, according to Adult Video 
News, the industry's most respected publication. Based on calculations from 
Paul Kagan Associates that the entire home-video industry last year generated 
$6.4 billion worth of rentals and $1.5 billion in sales, that would work out to 
a whopping $948 million in the sale and rentals of adult movies. 
</P>
<P>
And the adult business is actually even larger than these figures indicate. The 
numbers don't include business done by mail order or through adult-only stores. 
According to Adult Video News, there are about 1,300 adult stores in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to measure the volume of business done through these outlets," 
said Paul Fishbein, editor and publisher of Adult Video News. "These people 
don't reveal financial figures, but a lot of money is generated both by the 
adult stores and mail order." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, profits in the adult home-video industry are down. Part of the 
problem is that prices have dropped drastically since the gravy days of the 
early '80s, when retail prices were often in the $80-$90 range. Though major 
new releases still retail for $40-$60, many titles sell for $14-$20. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments are down too. "With fewer outlets, you can't ship as many copies as 
you could years ago," said Arrow Video's Epstein. "Now you ship about 2,000 
copies of a title -- 5,000 is great. In the old days you could ship 25,000 
copies of a good title." 
</P>
<P>
The industry has made some changes in an effort to adapt. Some companies, 
including Arrow Video, are exploring other outlets -- such as liquor stores -- 
and different marketing techniques, such as using low-key, inoffensive pictures 
on the packages so that store-owners will be more inclined to stock the titles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 98% of the adult movies are now shot on videotape rather than film 
because it's cheaper. The average movie on videotape now costs between $10,000 
and $50,000 to make, Fishbein said, compared to about $100,000 to shoot on 
film. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that shooting on film was necessary because most of the movies 
would first be shown in adult theaters. But the home-video boom doomed the 
theater business. According to Fishbein, there were about 1,500 adult theaters 
in the country at the beginning of the decade. Now there are fewer than 300. 
</P>
<P>
Along with shrinking profits, another problem plaguing the adult home-video 
industry is what various officials describe as a drop-off in the quality of the 
product. "Only about 15% of what's coming out is quality," Fishbein said. 
"There are too many garbage movies on the market -- poorly shot, poorly made." 
</P>
<P>
Much of this inferior product is released by small, low-overhead companies that 
are the scourge of the industry. Such outfits sell old movies as if they were 
new, use low-quality tape, duplicate on slow speed (often resulting in a fuzzy 
picture) and frequently package the same movie under a different title. Major 
adult companies such as Arrow, Caballero and VCA are furious at these renegade 
firms for flooding the market with low-cost product, which drives all prices 
down. 
</P>
<P>
These low-quality tapes, Fishbein insisted, undermine the adult industry by 
turning consumers off. "They feel ripped off, so they stay away from adult 
movies," he said. "The way things have been going, this industry can't afford 
to alienate customers."

A Soviet military helicopter on a police raid to destroy opium poppy fields in 
Central Asia crashed and exploded in flames, killing four of the 15 people 
aboard, the Tass news agency reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The MI-8 copter was about to land in mountains near the fabled city of 
Samarkand in Uzbekistan when a gust of wind threw if off course and onto rocks, 
N. Sattarov, a senior Interior Ministry official in Samarkand, was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers escaped through the middle and tail sections of the 
chopper but could do nothing to help those trapped inside as fire broke out and 
the craft exploded, killing four people, Tass said.

LAGUNA GROUP HITS THE BEACH IN PROTEST OVER SEWAGE SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of Laguna Beach residents and surfers, angry over repeated sewage 
spills that have fouled the beaches throughout the summer, picketed at Main 
Beach on Thursday afternoon to demand that city officials take immediate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a 9,000-gallon raw sewage spill that closed a 2,000-foot stretch 
of Laguna Beach shoreline on Tuesday morning, about a dozen activists and 
beach-goers called on the city to stop the spills permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to make a statement to everybody who wants clean beaches," 
said Marielle Leeds, a city recreation commissioner. "The fact that the beach 
is closed is itself a big statement." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach city officials admit that they are stymied by the rash of sewage 
spills but deny that they are guilty of inaction.

<P>
Mayor Robert F. Gentry noted that the council on Tuesday night ordered City 
Manager Kenneth C. Frank to hire an electrical contractor to design and install 
an early warning system that will cost the city about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to install the system was spurred by the Tuesday morning spill of 
9,000 gallons of raw sewage from the city's Anita Street pumping station, the 
seventh such spill this year. 
</P>
<P>
The protest group urged that the city also buy backup generators for each of 
the 23 city-owned pump stations along the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Nelson, a surfer and engineer, said he had contacted officials of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington because of his frustration 
with the repeated spills. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out swimming a little while ago, and there was actual fecal matter 
floating near me," he said, as members of the group held signs and waved to 
honking motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the water has really degenerated," Nelson said. "It's never 
been so bad. It's just phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
But Gentry pointed out that nine of the last 10 spills from pump stations over 
the last three years were the result of power failures, and therefore not the 
city's fault. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any picketing to be done, it should be in front of the Southern 
California Edison Co.," Gentry said in a telephone interview before the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
However, Southern California Edison spokesman Steve Sullivan said that power 
interruption is normal and that the city should be responsible for ensuring 
continuous power by installing backup generators. 
</P>
<P>
The city has rejected that idea because the generators are expensive and 
installing them would require significant modifications to many of the pump 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said that city officials have done everything possible to stem the 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless I'm missing something, I can't see what more we can do," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said that the early warning system, which could be operating within a 
month, will consist of a sophisticated network of sensors and lights hooked 
into the Laguna Beach Police Department and will be monitored by the 24-hour 
switchboard operator. The system will alert city workers when a pumping station 
is malfunctioning. 
</P>
<P>
A bid from an as-yet-unnamed electrical contractor to build the system should 
be ready to present to the council by Oct. 3, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The pump stations are located along the beach and are used to pump raw sewage 
uphill from the beachfront homes to the main sewer line under South Coast 
Highway, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
When a pump loses electrical power, the well that collects the sewage fills up 
and overflows into the surf. 
</P>
<P>
The latest spill closed off 1,000 feet of shoreline both north and south of the 
Anita Street pump station, Frank said. He expects the beach to reopen either 
late today or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had looked into purchasing emergency generators for the pump 
stations earlier this year. Only two stations have emergency generators that 
automatically supply electricity during a power outage. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank said that city engineers rejected that proposal because it would cost 
almost $1 million, and because it would be difficult to install the bulky 
emergency generators in the small, concrete sheds that house the pumps and 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Frank said, he would prefer to add emergency generators to each pump 
station if the city had the money. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't," he said. The city is already spending $1 million renovating the 
aging sewer system in South Laguna, where the underground pipes are almost full 
to capacity and leaking. 
</P>
<P>
"That is where the priority is right now," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank defended the decision to only recommend that the city purchase the early 
warning system, which, he admitted, would not stop all spills. 
</P>
<P>
"You obviously can't ever have a 100% fail-safe system," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has recently purchased a portable generator that could be transported 
to pump stations that are experiencing power losses. Use of the portable 
together with the proposed early warning system, Frank said, should enable city 
officials to catch most pump station problems before before they result in 
sewage spills. 
</P>
<P>
The city beaches have been plagued by an unusually high number of sewage spills 
in recent years. A citywide power outage in July caused pump failures in eight 
locations, resulting in the spill of more than 12,000 gallons of sewage.

LANDOWNERS SAY CITY TRYING TO CHEAT THEM 
</P>

<P>
The owners of a 200-acre tract of prime real estate along Laguna Canyon Road -- 
the latest battleground in the effort to save the canyon from development -- on 
Thursday accused Laguna Beach officials of trying to seize the property and 
give them only a fraction of what it is worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any strong desire to do anything other than take my 
property at a price I am unwilling to sell it for," said John DeWitt, a San 
Gabriel Valley oil retailer who, along with Alice Platz of Arizona, owns the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt's comments followed the Laguna Beach City Council's decision this week 
to condemn and commence eminent domain proceedings to acquire the property, 
which is south of the junction of Laguna Canyon and El Toro roads. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, eager to preserve as much of the canyon as possible, have been 
embroiled in a long-running feud with DeWitt and Platz over how best to save 
the area for preservation while providing them with adequate compensation for 
their 200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is the latest skirmish in efforts by Laguna Beach officials and a 
loosely based coalition of environmental groups and activists to save the 
canyon from development. There is a similar dispute over the Irvine Co.'s plans 
to build an upscale housing project at the mouth of Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists have urged the Irvine Co. to turn the 2,150 acres into a 
"Central Park of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
City officials had offered DeWitt and Platz $1 million for their property but 
turned to condemnation after the offer was rejected. Officials said the land, 
which is on the east side of Laguna Canyon Road less than a mile south of El 
Toro Road, would be purchased with Proposition 70 funds and preserved as 
permanent public open space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding for Natural Land 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 70 was the California Wildlife, Coastal and Park Land Conservation 
Act, which provides grant funding for the acquisition of natural land. The 
amount that DeWitt and Platz eventually receive for the property will be 
determined either through negotiations or by a court during the condemnation 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt said Thursday that the city's action did not mean the battle was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a voter; I'm just a property owner," he said. "The soap opera 'As 
Laguna Turns' will continue." 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt said Laguna officials did not negotiate in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, no attempt to negotiate has been made," he said. "There 
have been a couple of phone calls and half-hour meetings. I've called, and 
they've refused to talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt noted that he had resubmitted a previous offer to donate more than 180 
of the 200 acres to Laguna Beach in return for the city's allowing "acceptable 
development" of the lower acres fronting Laguna Canyon Road. DeWitt said this 
plan would save the city money and litigation costs to acquire the property and 
enable him and Platz to secure some return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in reaching a satisfactory agreement," he said. He said half 
the property is worth more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Firm Plans 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt said he had no firm plans for the property but previously had considered 
residential and light industrial use. The land is now zoned for agriculture. He 
said the previous $1-million offer is one-third less than his investment. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Lucas, president of Laguna Canyon Property Owners Assn., speaking on 
behalf of DeWitt, said his offer was fair. 
</P>
<P>
"We much prefer Proposition 70 money to be used for other acquisitions," she 
said. "We have no problem with minimal development." She said it was "appalling 
that they voted to condemn without more negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Clark, deputy city manager, said that he could not reveal details of the 
negotiations but denied that the city did not try to reach an equitable 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made every attempt to negotiate with both parties," he said. "The 
negotiation really just enters another phase now. It will continue, but if 
we're unable to resolve it, it will ultimately be resolved in a court action." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Martha Collison, the only person on the City Council to vote 
against the condemnation proceedings, said that while she agrees with the need 
for open space, more negotiation with DeWitt is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not negotiated enough with this man as much as we should," she said. 
"We're offering half the money he thinks it's worth. He has rights too." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Pro Tem Lida Lenney said that even though condemnation and getting 
the property by eminent domain sounds bad, it's a "fair process."

CIGAR OR MARIJUANA? BAILIFF'S REPORT SPARKS JUDGE-LAWYER TIFF 
</P>

Brent Ayscough likes his cigars -- three or four a day, usually after meals. So 
it was only natural one day after lunch this week that the Torrance attorney 
lit up a Repeter Churchill from Honduras and took a few deep drags before 
heading into a Westminster courtroom for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Those few drags led to a minor brouhaha when, according to Ayscough, he gave a 
friendly greeting to the court bailiff Wednesday afternoon and then was quickly 
summoned with his opposing counsel in an ongoing civil fraud trial to the 
chambers of Orange County Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: it seemed that the bailiff believed that he had detected marijuana 
on the attorney's breath and promptly reported his suspicions to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas "said that this was the third time I'd come into his court with 
marijuana on my breath," Ayscough said in an interview. According to the 
lawyer, the judge then repeated the accusation later in open court and even 
brought an undercover narcotics agent into court to assess the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just outrageous," said Ayscough, who lives in Palos Verdes. "He was 
questioning my ability to adequately represent my client. He couldn't even tell 
tobacco from marijuana." The attorney said he has never used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
After the confrontations in chambers and in open court, Ayscough said he "flew 
off the handle" and demanded a full investigation of the drug allegation to 
clear his name, even inviting Cardenas to check his car for cigar butts and 
perform a urine test for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The judge declined. But even before the smoke had cleared Thursday, Cardenas 
was hit with another dilemma -- whether to allow the media to stay in his 
courtroom for coverage of the Ayscough affair and of Ayscough's motion for a 
mistrial as a result of it. 
</P>
<P>
The judge balked. Appearing riled as he emerged from his chambers after talking 
Thursday morning with lawyers in the case, he ordered two reporters and two 
photographers out of the courtroom, declaring it a "private court." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by a reporter about his authority for such an extraordinary move, 
the judge responded: "You can either leave or I'll have you dragged out." 
</P>
<P>
Three members of the county marshal's office, including the bailiff who had 
apparently reported the suspected marijuana use, ushered the members of the 
media out of the room. The hearing on the mistrial motion was finished by the 
time media lawyers had arrived to contest the move as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Court observers said they could think of few precedents for clearing the 
courtroom under such circumstances. But Patrick Hearn, assistant executive 
officer for the Superior Court, maintained that "the individual judge does in 
fact have a lot of discretion" over such decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the judge nor the cigar-smoking attorney was talking about the affair 
later. That was because Cardenas, a 1976 appointee to the bench by then-Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr., had slapped a gag order on all involved, an order he later 
refused to explain to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The judge confirmed that he had denied Ayscough's motion for a mistrial because 
of the allegation, but he would not comment on any other aspect of the episode. 
</P>
<P>
But during the closed hearing on the mistrial motion, Cardenas could be heard 
through the court doors saying that he had not accused the attorney outright of 
smoking marijuana and suggesting that Ayscough had blown the issue out of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas told the lawyer in a caustic tone: "I didn't just accept (the 
marijuana allegation) off the cuff. . . . I thought I should inquire, and I did 
it. That would have been the end of it, but you've made this into a Mt. 
Vesuvius. 
</P>
<P>
"I accepted your representation (that Ayscough had not smoked marijuana). 
That's the end of it, but you want to keep going," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ayscough said later that he was unsure whether he would press the 
matter. He simply offered a reporter a cigar as he left the courthouse.

An autopsy Thursday confirmed that Orange County Superior Court Judge James R. 
Franks II committed suicide by firing a single gunshot into his chest, a 
Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard J. Olson said a preliminary autopsy showed that Franks died of one 
shot from a 9-millimeter handgun. Toxicological tests were performed, but the 
results will not be available for six to eight weeks, Olson said.

TAX CONSULTANT HIRED TO FIND MORE INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Newport Beach has hired a tax consulting firm to make sure the city 
is receiving all the sales tax it is entitled to, officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Westlake Village-based firm, Municipal Resource Consultants, plans to 
generate additional income for the city by identifying point-of-sale taxpayer 
errors that often go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Sales tax produces $12 million annually for Newport Beach, roughly a quarter of 
the city's general fund. City officials did not know how much more income to 
expect due to the service. 
</P>
<P>
City Finance Director George Pappas() said MRC has conducted similar surveys 
for other Orange County cities including Irvine, Fullerton and Santa Ana. The 
firm's services will be self-funding; MRC will keep 25% of the income it finds 
for the city.

HOW DO YOU SCRUB THE CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL? VERY, VERY CAREFULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When the windows need washing at the Crystal Cathedral, church employee David 
Shiffer makes it a point not to discuss it with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, David and two other daring church workers will climb into a 
specially made basket and be lifted up alongside the 12-story structure for the 
annual cleansing of about 11,000 windows at the world famous church in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"She hates to think of me so high up," Shiffer, 39, said of his mother. "She 
thinks for some reason that something will go wrong even though I've been doing 
this for the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Crystal Cathedral opened its glass doors in 1980 and became an 
instant Orange County landmark, drawing both tourists and regular worshipers to 
weekly services and spectacular Christmas and Easter pageants, the tedious job 
of window washing has attracted much public attention. Shiffer says he feels 
like a celebrity for the five days he hovers above ground with window cleaner 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"People just stand around a lot of the time, watching us do what we do," 
Shiffer said. "I guess it is pretty interesting to see a group of men all 
washing windows." 
</P>
<P>
This year's washing begins three weeks behind schedule because of some adjacent 
construction work that was kicking up dust, according to officials. The window 
washing is usually completed two weeks before the fall premiere of the Rev. 
Robert Schuller's Sunday morning telecast, "The Hour of Power," which reaches 4 
million viewers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Sept. 17 television taping had to proceed without spotless windows, 
although many of the lower panels were cleaned. But Schuller said he didn't 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not that superficial about what's on the outside," Schuller after a 
recent Sunday morning sermon. "Of course, it would have been nice to have the 
windows cleaned before the filming but that wasn't possible. It's what's on the 
inside that counts." 
</P>
<P>
The window cleaning is not only for appearance's sake but also for the general 
upkeep of the glass, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We do wash the windows once a year to prevent the deterioration of the glass 
due to air pollution and chemical buildup," said Ruth Johnson, director of 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
The church spends an estimated $30,000 -- taken from a special endowment fund 
earmarked for the maintenance -- each year to rent a 110-ton crane to lift the 
window washers in a basket attached to a 180-foot boom. 
</P>
<P>
Each year the church hires an Orange-based business, Mr. Crane, to hoist 
several maintenance workers in the basket, specially designed to conform to the 
demands of the cathedral's distinctive architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-pound basket has special brushes for reaching side windows, water 
pumps, a dozen hoses and 20 tanks holding a solution of iodized water and 
ammonia. Respirators are also aboard if workers want to avoid the powerful 
smell of ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
The workers begin by washing the roof peaks, which is considered the most 
difficult and dangerous part of the cleaning chore. 
</P>
<P>
"The roof can be tricky because the surface is slanted and landing the basket 
so just the right amount of weight is on the glass is imperative. One wrong 
move and the basket keeps sliding down." 
</P>
<P>
And while no workers have ever been injured on the job, there is always a 
threat of swift winds. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't working the detail at the time," Shiffer explained, "but there is a 
story that says a few windows were broken when the basket took a wrong turn, so 
we have to be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
Workers spend about two days cleaning the roof, and they usually have to 
replace four or five windows that break or become cracked by wind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CLEANSING THE CATHEDRAL 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's most famous glass church -- seen weekly by a national 
television audience -- was built in 1980. As they do every year, church 
maintenance workers will spend five days -- starting Monday -- scouring the 
sleek exterior of the 12-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
Glass: 11,000 panes, 40 different configurations. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Crew: Three maintenance workers, two crane operators. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment: A 110-ton crane with a 180-foot boom lifts workers in a 2,000-pound 
basket, with special brushes for reaching side windows, water pumps, a dozen 
hoses and 20 tanks holding a solution of iodized water and ammonia. Respirators 
are aboard to protect workers against ammonia fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Tips: "The roof can be tricky," said church employee David Shiffer, "because 
the surface is slanted and landing the basket so just the right amount of 
weight is on the glass is imperative. One wrong move and the basket keeps 
sliding down."

LOS AMIGOS HIGH EVACUATED AFTER EXPLOSION IN VAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Amigos High School in Fountain Valley was evacuated Thursday morning after 
an explosion in an electrical vault caused a power outage at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion at the rear of the school near the gymnasium caused minor burns 
to two adults working on the campus and prompted school officials to dismiss 
about 1,500 students and school personnel for the day at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Fire Department Battalion Chief Paul Summers said students were 
sent out to the athletic field immediately after the 8:05 a.m. explosion in the 
vault, which houses the electrical wires for the school. The explosion sparked 
a small fire, which was put out "within minutes," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
An air-conditioning contractor and a building superintendent who were working 
nearby suffered minor burns that were treated at the scene, Summers said. Alan 
Trudell, spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District, which includes 
Los Amigos High School, said the vault was to be repaired overnight and 
students were to return to class as usual this morning.

INSPIRED MADDUX DEFEATS PHILLIES; 
</P>
<P>
RIGHT-HANDER SAYS ZIMMER'S LECTURE HELPED HIM GET 18TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Maddux was much more impressed with the lecture Chicago Manager Don 
Zimmer's had delivered after the loss of the night before than Zimmer was. 
</P>
<P>
After pitching a six-hitter in Chicago Thursday afternoon to give the Cubs a 
9-1 victory over the Phillies to chalk up his 18th victory of the season, and 
to protect the Cubs' lead in the National League East, Maddux credited Zimmer's 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
"He made us more aware of what we should be doing to get the batters out, that 
really was what the meeting was about," Maddux said. "It worked, what he said. 
We won!" 
</P>
<P>
But Zimmer shrugged it off, saying: "I've been saying the same thing all year." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs were helped, too, by Andre Dawson, who broke out of an 11-for-58 slump 
with a three-game homer. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's magic number for clinching the East was seven. Second-place St. Louis 
scheduled to play at home against New York Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux is 18-12 and has equaled his victory total of last season. The 
right-hander, pounded for seven runs and 12 hits in 4 1/3 innings against the 
Phillies on Sept. 6, struck out six and walked two in his seventh complete 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, which won 9-8 Wednesday, has allowed 35 hits in two games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago went ahead in the second inning on Rick Wrona's RBI single off Terry 
Mulholland. The Cubs made it 6-0 in the fourth on RBI singles by Ryne Sandberg 
and Mark Grace followed by Dawson's 19th homer. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dascenzo, Sandberg and Grace hit consecutive RBI singles in the fifth off 
Randy O'Neal. Ricky Jordan hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth inning for the 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to continue to root for spoilers to beat the Cards and we have to 
continue to win," said Grace, who had two hits and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Phillies Manager Nick Leyva, commenting on the pitchers he used against the 
Cubs, Terry Mulholland, Randy O'Neal and Reggie McElroy: "They stunk." 
</P>
<P>
Leyva thought the game was decided in the fourth inning, when third baseman 
Charlie Hayes hesitated on his throw to first after Dascenzo's two-out 
grounder. Dascenzo beat the throw, setting up the five-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mental error," Leyva said. "It knocked the wind out of the ballclub. 
If he makes the play, it's a one-run ball game. His concentation is not there."

WALTERS, TURNER TIED FOR LEAD AT 67; 
</P>
<P>
FIVE OTHERS TWO STROKES BACK AFTER FIRST ROUND AT LOS COYOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WALTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Walters, who has missed more cuts than she has made this season, had it 
all going her way Thursday morning, taking the lead with a five-under-par 67 at 
the LPGA's Nippon Travel -- MBS golf tournament in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
That was the good news. The not-so-good news is that the player who caught her 
later in the afternoon is Sherri Turner, the leading money winner in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and Walters share a two-stroke lead over five players at Los Coyotes 
Country Club. Pat Bradley, Amy Alcott, Jody Rosenthal, Patty Rizzo -- who 
missed a one-foot putt on 18 -- -- and Jill Briles all shot 69. The par 72 
course is 6,350 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Turner missed the cut last week in Seattle and showed up here ready to do some 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"She came in here Monday and started beating balls," said Jean Darden, Turner's 
caddy. "She practiced and practiced." 
</P>
<P>
Turner was on the practice range after her round Thursday, still hitting in the 
90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
She is so determined to play well this week that she also bowed out of the 
pro-am Wednesday so she could practice. 
</P>
<P>
Turner has won once this year, in the third week of the season at Hawaii. She 
is eighth on the earnings list with $187,742, but has fallen off the level of 
consistency she displayed in 1988, when she had 17 top-10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
She has had seven top-10 finishes this season. This is her final tour stop. She 
almost went home to Greenville, S.C., after missing the cut in Seattle, and had 
even made plane reservations, but changed her mind at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last (official) tournament she is playing this year, and she said 
'Let's have some fun,' " Darden said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner had an eagle on the 12th hole, a 455-yard par five. She also had five 
birdies and two bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been so frustrated (this season)," Turner said. "I've been putting a 
lot of pressure on myself to play well, and I just haven't. But (today) I felt 
things were going real well." 
</P>
<P>
Walters, in her fifth year on the tour, grew up in British Columbia but 
attended Florida State, where she was an All-American in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Her best career finish was a tie for third in 1987. She has never led a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 22 starts this season, she has missed the cut 13 times, finished in the 
money nine times, and withdrew once -- when her game was in such disrepair that 
she walked off the course at the Boston tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Seattle, however, she played her best golf of the year and 
finished tied for 15th. 
</P>
<P>
"I started putting really well last week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Having landed at the top of the leader board for the first time in her LPGA 
career, Walters discovered she is very comfortable there. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players say they are more comfortable a few shots off the lead, that it's 
easier to strike from behind and things like that," she said. "I feel very good 
where I am. I wouldn't trade with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Walters' performance lent no support to others' concerns about the condition of 
the greens at the Los Coyotes Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
She ran down putts of 30, 15, and 10 feet along with a couple of four-footers 
and a two-footer for birdies during her round, which was played during the 
morning. She made only one bogey -- at the 149-yard seventh hole, when she hit 
her tee shot 15 feet over the green. Her chip left her with a slippery downhill 
chip that ran seven feet past the cup. She made the putt coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Players had been concerned coming into the tournament that the greens, which 
had been damaged by a fungus this summer, would be difficult to handle. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens weren't a problem at all," Walters said. "They were faster then 
they had been during my practice round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a good putter isn't bothered by the type of greens," she said. "Good 
putters can putt on anything." 
</P>
<P>
The greens became bumpier as the afternoon rounds were played. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us as a whole have putted well, considering the stress conditions 
Mother Nature has put (the greens) under," said Bradley, one of five players at 
69. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, also in the group at three-under, gave her game and the course good 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing more solid, more consistent and the course played well today," 
Rosenthal said. "I thought the greens were putting pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also played early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzo, who won at San Diego this year, was stuck in the second-place group 
after missing a one-foot putt at 18 that would have put her alone in third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"I changed putters for this tournament because the greens are slower and I 
forgot to make an adjustment for it when I lined up to putt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens are real different from what we have been playing, but they're not 
all that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Alcott, who last played this course 19 years ago in a 10-and-under division 
tournament, birdied two of the last three holes to gain her share of third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the scores will be all that low, but seven-under could win," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Rarick, who finished second last week, shot two-under 70. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good," she said. "If I shoot 70 every day, I have a good chance to be 
there Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Rarick, a good wind player, likes the fact that the wind comes up in the 
afternoon here. She has an afternoon tee time today. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Lopez opened with a 73. Beth Daniel shot a two-over 74.

SANTA ANA MARCHES TO VICTORY, 29-14; 
</P>
<P>
SAINTS DOMINATE, CAPITALIZE ON MATER DEI'S MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It wasn't over until it was over but Santa Ana's 29-14 victory over Mater Dei 
at Santa Ana Stadium never seemed that close. Probably because the Monarchs 
(0-3) were busy fumbling away opportunities to pull ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (3-0) dominated defensively and offensively, sacking Monarch 
quarterback Danny O'Neil five times for minus-41 yards and limiting the 
Monarchs to only 58 yards rushing and 209 total yards. Bobby Vidana had two of 
those sacks and a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Saint tailback Garner Hicks, alone, rushed for 203 yards and a touchdown in 30 
carries and caught a pass for nine yards. Santa Ana had 343 yards offensively 
moving the ball at will with 14 first downs in the game, nine in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we got momentum going something happened to break us down," Monarch 
Coach Bruce Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half with Mater Dei trailing, 13-7, it was an interception by 
Albert Perez with 1:20 to play that ended the Monarch's drive to take the lead. 
The turnover eventually led to a Saint touchdown on a 1-yard quarterback sneak 
by Jesse Rosas with four seconds in the half to put Santa Ana ahead 19-7. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei trailed the whole game, managing only three first downs in the first 
half. Oscar Wilson stripped O'Neil of the ball to end another Monarch drive and 
set up Gus Plasencia's 21-yard field goal in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 14-22, with less than two minutes to play, the Monarch's Mike Silvey 
blocked Plasencia's punt and recovered it on the Saint 20. But Mater Dei could 
not penetrate the Saint defense. Vidana sacked O'Neil for an 8-yard loss before 
O'Neil fumbled the ball trying to scramble away from the pressure Vidana, 
Wilson and the rest of the defensive line put on him all night. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunity came knocking at the Monarch's door again and again nobody was 
home. Santa Ana fumbled on Mater Dei's 36. The ball was kicked and tumbled 
forward until Ryan Motherway fell on it in his end zone for a touchback. David 
Gonzalez (five carries, 34 yards) ran for two before O'Neil threw two 
incompletions and a pass for -6 yards on fourth and 8 and Mater Dei turned the 
ball over on downs on its 16. Four plays later, Wilson ran the ball 10 yards on 
a reverse to pad the score for Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil was 8-15 for 151 yards, one touchdown and an interception. Rosas 
completed six of 12 for 86 yards and ran for two touchdowns.

HUNTINGTON BEACH EDGES NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Cunningham, Huntington Beach High School running back, listened carefully 
to the question and never hesitated in giving his answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't play any worse," he said. "We just couldn't get it going. We gotta 
get our act together." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine what Cunningham would have said if his team had lost. As it was, 
Huntington Beach overcame a miserable three quarters to defeat Newport Harbor, 
7-6, in a nonleague game Thursday night at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 3,500 sat in near silence for the first half and nearly half of the 
third quarter as the teams' offenses were silent, deadlocked in a scoreless 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Each team struggled to gain yardage. Newport Harbor (2-1) had only 109 yards of 
offense in the first half, Huntington Beach (3-0) had 81. It was tough to tell 
if it was exceptional defense or lousy offense that caused the problem. 
Probably a little of both, the teams' coaches said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't run effectively," said Jeff Brinkley, Newport Harbor coach. "In 
order to win we have to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Said George Pascoe, Huntington Beach coach: "We didn't do a good job. I'm happy 
with the defense (though)." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Josh Klein kicked a 32-yard field goal with 7 minutes 4 seconds left 
in the third quarter to give Newport Harbor a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Klein added a 34-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter and 
Newport Harbor led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
But something changed after that. The Huntington Beach players on the sidelines 
put four fingers in the air and said, "C'mon. Fourth quarter. It's ours." 
</P>
<P>
They proved to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Eisenman returned Klein's kickoff to the 47, but a holding call against 
Huntington Beach moved the ball back to the 39. It was still good field 
position and now the crowd was buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers came out throwing. On first down, quarterback Jeff Gibson threw to 
Chad Taylor for nine yards. Cunningham, who rushed for 109 yards in 18 carries 
and had an interception, gained a yard for a first down at the 49. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive completions to Eisenman gained 20 and 22 yards and moved the ball 
to the Newport Harbor 9. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham then carried nine yards for the touchdown. Tony Canini added the 
extra point and Huntington Beach had a 7-6 lead

COLLINS' BIG SECOND HALF LEADS LOARA, 28-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it was third-and-long for Loara High School, along came Coy Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Big gains by Collins on second-half draw plays and sweeps allowed Loara to 
maintain control of the ball and stop any chance of a Canyon comeback as the 
Saxons defeated the Comanches, 28-14, in a nonleague game Thursday night at 
Fred Kelly Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for (Collins) on third-and-long, second-and-short, third-and-short . . 
. ," Loara Coach Herb Hill said. "Yeah, we look for him." 
</P>
<P>
Collins, the county's fifth-leading rusher entering the game, broke loose in 
the second half, gaining 144 yards and scoring two touchdowns after being held 
to only 19 yards in the first half. He finished with 163 yards on 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Loara quarterback Sean Conner, who gained 97 yards on 16 carries, 
Collins helped the Saxons control the ball long enough to hold off Canyon. 
Conner also completed four of 11 passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It was the passing of Canyon quarterback Chuck Nickerson that kept the 
Comanches close. Nickerson completed 13 of 20 passes for 126 yards and one 
touchdown. However, with Canyon down 28-14 midway through the fourth quarter, 
Nickerson dropped a snap at the Loara 9. Loara recovered and then Collins and 
company ran out the clock with a 14-play drive that ended with a missed field 
goal.

EDISON DUMPS DOMINGUEZ, 30-16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Being at the right place at the right time three times in a row keyed Edison 
High School to a 30-16 nonleague victory over Dominguez Thursday night in front 
of 2,000 at Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
It also offered a prime opportunity for tailback Shane Sherman, who scored 
three touchdowns to lead the Chargers (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
Although Edison trailed, 16-13, late in the third quarter, its defense forced 
three turnovers, all of which led to consecutive scoring drives. 
</P>
<P>
With seconds remaining in the third quarter, Dominguez' James Jackson fumbled 
at his own three-yard line, thanks to a swarming Edison defense. Charger tackle 
Lawson Mollica recovered at the three, and Sherman scored what proved to be the 
winning touchdown on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of Dominguez' next possession, Dominguez running back Bruce 
Walker fumbled, and Edison's Miles Charlier recovered on the Dominguez 25. 
Eight plays later, Sherman scored again, this on a four-yarder, and Doug 
Merlino's kick gave the Chargers a 27-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But neither team was finished with this routine yet. On Dominguez' very next 
possession, quarterback Thomas Lyons was intercepted at its 32 by linebacker 
Nick Agosta. Although Sherman's work brought the ball to the 14, Merlino gave 
Edison its final score with a 24-yard field goal with 1:28 remaining in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman, who rushed for 69 yards in 22 carries, also scored Edison's first 
touchdown on a four-yard run in the first quarter. He said he and his teammates 
were particularly inspired Thursday night after their 37-10 loss to Capistrano 
Valley last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team worked really hard this week. That loss was real tough for us," 
Sherman said. "They (Dominguez) gave up really early tonight. That 45 (Walker) 
was really tired. We didn't give up. We had pride. They didn't. That's what it 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a highly recruited 6-foot 4-inch, 240-pound senior, looked sensational 
at the start, plowing over and through Edison's defense, and scoring his only 
touchdown on a 31-yard run in the first quarter. At defense, he was a threat 
too, but by the end of the game, he was little threat at all. 
</P>
<P>
Edison quarterback Donnie Smith, who finished 11 for 17 for 136 yards and an 
interception, looked especially sharp in the first quarter where he completed 7 
of 8 passes. Junior fullback Craig Shusterick contributed Edison's other 
touchdown on a six-yard run early in the third quarter.

STATE AGENCY NAMED DEFENDANT IN SUIT INVOLVING LINCOLN S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Corporations was added Thursday as a defendant in a 
lawsuit filed earlier this year on behalf of about 22,000 investors who stand 
to lose nearly $200 million from the collapse of American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The amended complaint alleges that the agency acted "in reckless disregard of 
its own internal findings" in approving the public sale of American 
Continental's debt securities, which were sold mostly through the 29 branches 
of its Irvine subsidiary, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The filing marks the first time that a government agency has been named as a 
defendant in the various lawsuits pending against the operators of American 
Continental, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Lincoln, which was 
seized by regulators and declared insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
And it comes after the Resolution Trust Corp. last week filed a civil suit in 
Phoenix against American Continental's Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. and most 
of the development company's officers and directors, claiming that they engaged 
in a conspiracy to siphon $1.1 billion in federally insured funds from Lincoln 
for their personal use. 
</P>
<P>
The investors' complaint, originally filed April 27 in Orange County Superior 
Court, was amended to include the agency after the state rejected a 
$250-million claim made by the bondholders. The complaint alleges that the 
Department of Corporations gave approval to sell the bonds even though it had 
sufficient evidence to show that Phoenix-based American Continental could not 
repay the debt it would accumulate through the sale of the securities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Corporations staff made its own analysis that the offering 
didn't make any sense," said Ronald Rus of Orange, one of the plaintiffs' 
lawyers. "Notwithstanding that, the agency found that a Big 8 accounting firm 
said it's OK and then approved it. 
</P>
<P>
"So whose fault is it?" he said. "I say they both are at fault." 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Lincoln's former operators, its outside accountants and 
its lawyers were engaged in "a massive fraud" to pump up Lincoln's earnings and 
net worth artificially and improve the company's stock price for their own 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
It also claims that Keating and other American Continental executives used 
politicians, whose campaigns they had contributed to, and other public 
officials to intervene in Lincoln's fight with regulators and to buy "extra 
time" to continue the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Bender, commissioner of the department, said the agency "acted 
appropriately" in approving the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what was required under the law and, in fact, more than what was 
required by law," she said. "When a court looks at this, I'm convinced it will 
find that we did nothing wrong." Agency officials previously said they 
contacted numerous state and federal agencies investigating the company and the 
S&amp;L but could get no concrete evidence to warrant a denial of American 
Continental's application to sell the debt securities. Bender said her agency 
had authority to bar the offering only if the public sale was found to be 
"unfair, unjust or inequitable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Allegations 
</P>
<P>
The amended complaint weaves a now-familiar web of political clout with a few 
bits of new allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Bender and her predecessor, Franklin Tom, had worked at the same Los Angeles 
law firm before joining the department. Tom, who quit in early 1987, returned 
to the firm and, within a month, began representing American Continental on its 
debenture application. A senior partner in the firm is Karl T. Samuelian, who 
had been Gov. Deukmejian's chief fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
One of Tom's first acts, the suit claims, was to ask the agency to move the 
file on American Continental from its San Francisco office to its Los Angeles 
office. The request came shortly after a staff lawyer in San Francisco warned 
Tom that the agency might take action against the company "if earnings 
continued to decline and the quality of earnings deteriorate," according to an 
agency report filed with the amended complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In the firm's Los Angeles office, the suit states, the file was put under the 
supervision of Robert L. Rifkin, a former law school classmate of Samuelian. 
Tom and the law firm, Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian, were 
named as defendants in the original suit. 
</P>
<P>
Rifkin and Samuelian could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people, mostly Southern California depositors, purchased 
American Continetal's debentures at Lincoln's branches. About three-quarters of 
them were elderly.

ELDER CARE: LATEST SERVICE OF WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

ARMONK, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Vahrenkamp knew her ailing father could no longer live alone, but she 
lived too far away to care for him. 
</P>
<P>
And just when she needed to research nursing homes, her job as a programmer for 
IBM in Boulder, Colo., required her to run a major business meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Vahrenkamp turned to her employer. Within hours, IBM's Elder 
Care Referral Service provided the names, costs and other information about 
adult care facilities near her father's home in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"They did the legwork. All I had to do was check these places out when I had 
time. I didn't have to find them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baby Boomers' Needs 
</P>
<P>
That IBM would offer such a service is testament to the needs of the baby 
boomers who are rising through the business ranks. Just as they are maturing as 
executives, many find their parents are more needy. "So many of us are going 
through this same kind of thing," said Vahrenkamp. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies also are coming to the realization that they have a stake in 
their employees' family problems. A study by John Hancock Financial Services 
found employees with needy parents are more likely to be absent from work and 
to suffer from job-related stress than others. 
</P>
<P>
"If elder care is a problem now -- and it is -- we had better find good, humane 
answers soon. If we don't, the future . . . will turn into a nightmare for 
millions of us," said E. James Morton, chairman of John Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, elder care was a "sleeper issue" tucked away behind child 
care, said Dr. Michael Creedon of the National Council on Aging. Creedon is a 
pioneer in elder-care services -- he's credited with coining the term -- and he 
points to population statistics to underscore the need. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 million people are over 65 today; that number will jump to 50 million 
in the early part of the next century. An estimated 2.6 million are 85 or over 
now; by the year 2000, that number will double. Studies also show that 41% of 
those responsible for elder care also have children to handle. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby boomers delayed childbearing, so there's a high proportion of late 
childbearing," Creedon said. "People in their 40s are also the most frequent 
group for parent care." 
</P>
<P>
At IBM, "30% of our population had some responsibility for an elder relative," 
said spokesman Jim Smith. "We wanted to provide more flexibility in dealing 
with home and family.' 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, IBM turned to Work Family Directions of Boston. Work Family Directions 
had initially helped IBM establish a network to help the company's 223,000 
nationwide employees find child care in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Work Family Directions formed the Elder Care Consultation and 
Referral Service. Alan LaRue, its director, said it collects information 
through 175 community-based agencies nationwide to provide to employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of the Largest 
</P>
<P>
For Vahrenkamp, "the worrying never went away," but the service helped her 
arrange transportation for her father to his doctors, talk knowledgeably about 
his condition and deal with Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
There are other elder-care organizations -- in New York City, for example, some 
companies work with the city's Partnership for Eldercare -- but Work Family 
Directions is one of the largest. Besides IBM, its client list includes 
Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty. 
</P>
<P>
For Aetna, elder care was an outgrowth of child care as it was for others, but 
it had to be handled "much more tacitly and quietly. Employees feel they 
shouldn't have to verbalize needs on this," said Sherry Herchenroether, the 
administrator of its family services program. 
</P>
<P>
"They deny the fact (of needing elder care) for emotional reasons. When they do 
realize it, it's with a sense of urgency," she said. Seminars Aetna had before 
introducing its program were so popular that more had to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Women have traditionally been care givers, both for children and for elderly 
parents who needed help. Today, many women work, Herchenroether said, and part 
of the problem stems from the fact that "there isn't anybody left at home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
During the Day 
</P>
<P>
Annie Smith, an Aetna licensing and contracts supervisor in Atlanta, moved her 
father-in-law in with her family four months ago because she was unhappy with 
his living arrangement with another family member. 
</P>
<P>
While her son can be company for him now, she worries about what will happen 
when the boy returns to school. Her call to the company's Elder Care Referral 
Service has found places where he can go during the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting around all day sleeping and eating is not good for anyone," she said. 
"I've got some data and I think I can get him into a senior citizen center for 
part of the day so he won't be alone." 
</P>
<P>
Herchenroether noted that for many of Aetna's 44,000 workers, "the employee is 
one place and the relative is far away, making it difficult for the employee to 
find out what she needs to know." 
</P>
<P>
While companies won't disclose the cost of the program, both IBM's Smith and 
Aetna's Herchenroether say the issue is not money, but attracting and keeping 
employees by offering services they need.

Trading places: The presidents of Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino 
Bank in Anaheim have switched jobs. Robert Ucciferri moved to Citizens after 
about nine months as head of El Camino, while Richard Helstrom, recently hired 
as president of Citizens, moved to El Camino. Ucciferri, who had been an 
executive at Citizens for 10 years, said he left late last year to take over at 
El Camino because he wanted to run a bank. When the president's post opened in 
July, Ucciferri asked to return. Helstrom was hired at Citizens but was willing 
to go instead to El Camino, Simpson said. Both banks are owned by Citizens 
Holdings.

<P>
President Bush appointed Christine Diemer Reed, executive director of the 
Orange County Building Industry Assn., to the board of the Federal National 
Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 37, of Corona del Mar, was named to a seat traditionally filled by a 
representative of the home-building industry. It is one of five seats filled by 
presidential appointment on the 18-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said she was "pleasantly surprised" by the appointment and said she would 
work to represent the building industry on the board of the private 
corporation, which buys mortgages on the secondary mortgage market, infusing 
new funds into the market. 
</P>
<P>
Reed had been director of the California Department of Housing and Community 
Development -- appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1987 -- before taking 
over the powerful local builders' trade association in July. The builders' 
group has 1,100 members.

<P>
THE ADVENTUROUS ROVA SAX QUARTET IS DEEP INTO EXPERIMENTAL SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the saxophone quartets that have sprung up in the last several years, ROVA 
is the most adventurous. Unlike the World Saxophone Quartet, whose members and 
inspiration come from the realm of jazz, ROVA has associated itself with the 
world of new and experimental music over the 12 years it has been in existence. 
</P>
<P>
That experimental tradition continues Saturday night when the quartet performs 
Alvin Curran's "Electric Rags II" at, fittingly, the Nelson Research Auditorium 
at UC Irvine. The performance is part of a daylong Electronic Music Symposium 
sponsored by the university and Buena Park-based Yamaha Music Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The work is composed of 30 three-minute pieces, or miniatures," said ROVA 
member John Raskin from Atlanta last week on the day after the group premiered 
the composition. 
</P>
<P>
"We use our saxophones with pickup microphones that feed into a computer that 
generates sounds. Our acoustic sound is amplified as well so that we have the 
sound of the sax quartet inside an electronic environment that is triggered by 
what we're playing. The computer's program is an interpretive program that 
interfaces with what we do." 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based quartet has been working the edge of the musical 
frontier since its founding in 1977. The group's name is an acronym of the 
group's original members: John Raskin, Larry Ochs, Andrew Voigt -- since 
replaced by Steve Adams -- and Bruce Ackley. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to collaborations with the Kronos String Quartet, Terry Riley, John 
Zorn, Anthony Braxton, Fred Frith and Henry Kaiser, ROVA has recorded more than 
a dozen albums for various labels, mostly of its members' own compositions. 
"Saxophone Diplomacy," recorded live during a 1983 trip to the Soviet Union, 
and its 1986 double album, "The Crowd" (both on the Hat Hut label), are good 
examples of involved structures and dynamic interplay on which the group's 
reputation rests. 
</P>
<P>
Curran's piece fits perfectly into the synthesis of structure and improvisation 
that ROVA has embraced over the years. "Some of the miniatures are completely 
improvised with minimal instruction," said Raskin. "Several of them are 
thoroughly notated, though most of them are a combination of improvisation and 
composition. Although Alvin's writing style is very different than ours, it's 
also very compatible with the way we work." 
</P>
<P>
Curran, a founding member of Musica Electtronica Viva, an experimental group 
established in the mid-'60s, has been working lately on what he calls 
"geographical music." His recent composition, "Maritime Rites," uses 
environmental sounds such as fog horns recorded along the Eastern seaboard to 
provide background for solo instrumentalists including saxophonists Anthony 
Braxton and Steve Lacy. Curran is now working on a new piece that utilizes 
recordings of wolves, Canadian geese and the sound of 20 million bats leaving 
at cave at dusk. 
</P>
<P>
The composer describes "Electric Rags II" as "a storybook of my musical 
interests and life. Every composer's work is autobiographical, but this in 
particular is like a collection of short stories. They range from rollicking, 
almost dance-like jazz music to unmoving, meditative pieces. I would say that 
90% of the piece is notated. Though the balance of improvisation is quite 
minimal, the entire effect of the music taken together is that of one long 
improvisation." 
</P>
<P>
Curran, who will be on stage Saturday manning the computer during ROVA's 
performance, said the piece was "created to suit any occasion of any duration. 
The entire set of 30 doesn't have to be played in its entirety -- one can 
construct shorter versions of the piece." 
</P>
<P>
Both Curran and Raskin felt that the "Electric Rags" premiere went well 
("Especially," said the composer, "considering it was the first performance 
with some very complex and heavy electronics"), though they disagree on the 
initial performance's setting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very exciting, actually," said Raskin. "We performed outside at an arts 
festival with a full moon and clouds dashing across it. Some of the music is 
extremely provocative and eerie, as well as funny, and it was a really great 
environment in which to enjoy the piece." 
</P>
<P>
But for Curran: "It wasn't performed in the best conditions -- a sprawling city 
park with a big festival free to the public. People who happened to be there 
wandered through and it was noisy." 
</P>
<P>
After the Orange County performance, the group will take the composition to San 
Francisco where it will be recorded live for New Albion Records. ROVA also 
plans a trip to the Leningrad Jazz Festival in November and upcoming 
collaborations with drummer Jack DeJohnette and L.A.-based clarinetist-composer 
John Carter. ROVA also has a backlog of compositions that they hope to record. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been coming up with a lot of our own compositions recently," said 
Raskin, "and now it's time to really harvest." 
</P>
<P>
 The ROVA Saxophone Quartet will perform Saturday at 8 p.m. at the culmination 
of a daylong Electronic Music Symposium at UC Irvine. Tickets for the concert 
only, held in the Nelson Research Auditorium, are $5.50 to $7.50. Admission for 
the symposium is $80. Information: (714) 856-5414.

CHINESE DINING EXPERIENCE IS EASY ON THE EYE, LESS SO ON PALATE, POCKETBOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The gentrification of Chinese food has reached new heights of absurdity. Take 
Five Feet Too, a high-sheen, more finished version of Laguna Beach's Five Feet. 
This is the sort of place that attracts glossy Newport Beach types who don't 
seem to mind snuggling up to kung pao chicken at $17 a plate. 
</P>
<P>
I do admit, however, that the restaurant has a striking design -- lots of 
jutting, angular cornices; an all-steel open kitchen; designer chairs; floor 
cacti taller than NBA centers and a collection of modern art (most of which is 
for sale) that could rival some small museums. Trendy stone-block tables are 
embellished with fresh orchid petals in little, pool-like candleholders, and 
long, thin, black-lacquer chopsticks offset by white napkins. 
</P>
<P>
A brilliant visual sense also dominates the food here. Colorful purees get 
dribbled onto plates, and fan-cut vegetable garnishes, rounds of goat cheese or 
mounds of raspberries turn up where you least expect them. But many of the 
dishes that chef-owner Michael Kang prepares feed the eye at the expense of the 
palate. The well-seasoned kitchen staff at the original Laguna Beach location 
might be able to bring off Kang's exotic attempts at contempo Chinese, but the 
inexperienced Newport team makes you long for anybody else's 5 combination with 
sweet-and-sour pork. 
</P>
<P>
On my ill-starred first visit, I let Kang's creative impulses affect my better 
judgment. I should have guessed the consequences, for instance, of ordering a 
smoked-chicken-and-goat-cheese won ton with an apple-raspberry-shallot coulis. 
Or the smoked Peking duck quesadilla: It came swimming in a funny, sourish 
pineapple relish and tasted no different than any soggy Mexican version. 
Furthermore, the duck might as well have been ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
Another annoyance turned up that night in the service department: The waitress 
informed us that she couldn't order our appetizers until we decided on our 
entrees. (I'm bothered by rules that put the restaurant's own convenience above 
customer wishes.) 
</P>
<P>
My advice is to avoid any dish that looks overtly precious. Daily specials are 
the worst offenders. Sauteed swordfish with a toasted almond sesame fig crust 
and a citrus butter is the kind of dish that could send nouvelle Chinese 
cuisine back to the Ming era. Worst new idea? Vegetable moo-shu with a tomato 
fondue -- and that's on the regular menu. 
</P>
<P>
Dishes similar to those at the original Laguna restaurant are a drastic 
improvement, but not quite as good as those at the source. Mama Kang's pot 
stickers with a ginger-soy vinaigrette are somewhat bland, but fun to eat. And 
the restaurant's signature dish, a deep-fried whole catfish, is excellent as 
usual, but comes in a braised tomato citrus sauce not nearly as good as the 
original ginger sauce. 
</P>
<P>
I had better luck on my second visit. Our first dish, curried spring rolls in a 
papaya mayonnaise with a lean filling of curried beef, had a delicate crunch 
and left a sweet, pleasant sensation on the tongue. The evening's soup -- a 
puree of wild mushrooms and fresh herbs -- had a terrific grainy, persistent 
flavor. And I liked the smoked trout salad with baby greens and papaya 
interestingly balanced by a vinaigrette flavored with basil, fennel and lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some basic flaws in the kitchen just can't be glossed over: Tough, dry 
rice; Fruits misused in sauces and salad dressings. And the irksome habit of 
serving wok-fried meats in cigarette-package-sized hunks, making them unwieldy. 
Mongolian lamb loin with shiitake and green onions, for instance, would have 
been delightful if it had been easier to eat. On the other hand, bite-sized 
portions wouldn't have eliminated the chewy texture of veal loin in a dish 
called Veal Chinois (it came with Sonoma sausage, squash and sun-dried 
tomatoes). 
</P>
<P>
I did enjoy Kung Pao Three, mostly chicken and peanuts with a few shrimp and 
scallops thrown in. The dish isn't necessarily better than one you'd find at 
your local mom-and-pop Chinese cafe, and it's probably three times the price. 
That may offend my wallet but not my taste buds. This restaurant could use a 
few of these more familiar dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts at Five Feet Too are surely the restaurant's most consistent course. 
One night I had a fine cheesecake with a rich, nutty crust. Another I had a 
smooth, velvety chocolate-hazelnut torte and a cocktail glass filled with fresh 
berries and a homemade white chocolate raspberry ice cream. The dessert chef 
knows how to use the humble raspberry. Take note, Mr. Kang. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet Too is expensive -- too expensive. Appetizers range from $5 to $9. 
Entrees are $15 to $24.

<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory is one of seven theaters -- and one of only two outside 
of New York -- to snag a chunk of $300,000 being provided for the production of 
six new plays as part of an AT&amp;T "New Plays for the '90s" project. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa theater will receive $50,000 for its staging of Howard Korder's 
"Search and Destroy," scheduled to open Jan. 12. The winning entries were 
selected from proposals submitted by 35 theaters.

SCR DECIDES NOT TO APPEAL BIG FUNDING CUTS BY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory has chosen not to appeal a large cut in funding from the 
California Arts Council, which cited a lack of "ethnic diversity" at the 
theater and shortcomings in its community outreach programs as the reasons for 
the cut. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel we have a case," Bonnie Britain Hall, SCR's development 
director, said Wednesday. "But given the council's cut-and-dried guidelines for 
an appeal, we don't think we could win." 
</P>
<P>
SCR was awarded $81,950 for its general operating budget in August, a slash of 
nearly 25% from the $106,000 received in 1988. Theater officials protested 
vigorously at the time and said they would consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
According to Arts Council staffer Saunty Singh, appeals may be filed on three 
grounds: the "misrepresentation of information" to the council in the 
evaluation process; "nonpresentation of required information" by the council 
staff, and "improper processing of the application." 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines specifically note that "dissatisfaction with denial of an award 
or the amount awarded is not grounds for an appeal," Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said three of SCR's 47 board members and five of its 60 staffers are 
Hispanic or Asian. All eight have become associated with the Costa Mesa theater 
during the past two years. There are no blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made tremendous improvement with respect to minority representation," 
Hall said. "Hiring minorities continues to be a priority of the theater." She 
also emphasized that many non-staffers who are employed by contract at the 
Tony-winning company come from minorities. Hall had no figures available, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reid, executive director of the Arts Council, said Wednesday that the 
council "does not have a quota system" for evaluating ethnic diversity, but he 
said the number of SCR minority employees and board members "doesn't sound like 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real tough issue with institutions basically producing art from the 
Western European tradition," Reid said. "The boards attracted to these kinds of 
disciplines -- theater in particular -- are often not particularly diverse. I 
hear this all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be in a position of criticizing one of the best theaters in 
this country. But if government doesn't say something about the issue, nobody 
will." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the theater would try to compensate for the $24,000 difference from 
private contributors. "It's early enough in the year that we can make up for 
that difference because of the strength and diversity of our fund-raising 
program," she said.

BEWICK'S WREN 
</P>
<P>
(Thryomanes bewickii) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Dark gray above, pale underparts with a long, sideways-flitting 
tail edged with white spots. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
also found in suburbs, farms and open woodland. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Insects and spiders. 
</P>
<P>
Song: A high, thin buzz and warble; varies geographically. Call is a flat, 
hollow chip. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Builds nest of twigs and grass in natural cavities, also amid roots of 
upturned tree or center of brush- pile.

LIFE ON THE CIRCUIT: CAR AFICIONADO'S DREAM: AN EVENING IN A FERRARI DEALER'S 
SHOWROOM, LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The Scene 
</P>
<P>
Drinks and hors d'oeuvres for about 200 autophiles at Newport Imports on Coast 
Highway in Newport Beach. Cruising the showroom and car lot after work on 
Tuesday were patrons and exhibitors of the seventh annual Newport Beach 
Concours d'Elegance, an antique and classic car show to be held at UC Irvine on 
Oct. 1. Proceeds from the Concours help underwrite the Assessment and Treatment 
Services Center, a private, nonprofit juvenile counseling program serving 
Orange County. This year's Concours will be local Ferrari lovers' field of 
dreams -- the daylong fete will include a "Friends of Ferrari" meeting and a 
host of Ferrari models of various vintages. (One of the ruby-colored cars is 
the show's poster prop.) Lee West, owner of Newport Imports, used Tuesday's 
thank-you party -- hosted by ATSC -- to unveil a new model 1990 Ferrari. For 
most of the two-hour get-together, the little red surprise was parked in the 
middle of the showroom, draped with a cloth cover, the object of many a 
sidelong glance. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous consumption, with a smile. "We have Ferraris and Alfas," said Sandy 
Zide, who carried her 3-month-old daughter in a shoulder sling. While Sandy 
cooed at baby Amy, husband Sheldon, a doctor, clarified: three Ferraris, four 
Alfa Romeos. "I collect them and I restore them," he said of his four-wheel 
harem. Ed Awad, a chemical engineer, allowed as how he owned just two Ferraris, 
but added quickly, "I'm about to buy another one." Jolene Engle -- who wore red 
leather pants, spike-heel boots and a sequined jacket with race-car patches 
buried in the shiny scales -- said she drives Jaguars and her husband, Dick, 
drives Ferraris (that's plural, two apiece). "Ferraris are for driving fast, 
and he does," she said with a giggle, glancing at her husband. "Hit the 
freeway, up to 180 -- wheee!" 
</P>
<P>
The Food 
</P>
<P>
Generous portions, as hors d'oeuvres go, and they did -- quick as you could 
hiss Testarossa, the servers' silver trays were plucked clean. Luckily for the 
hungry after-work crowd, the trays were restocked almost as fast. Among the 
tasty offerings supplied by The Upper Crust caterers were Gargantuan prawns, 
veal piccata, spinach and feta cheese frittata, and filet mignon en baguette 
with lemon caper sauce. Champagne and the usual assortment of nonalcoholic and 
mixed drinks flowed at the hosted bars. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode 
</P>
<P>
The men looked bankerly, doctorly, lawyerly in power suits and 
still-crisp-at-dusk shirts; the distaff side was all over the boards. Floral 
cocktail dresses. Basic black ensembles. Leather. Sequins. Mink. What's the 
dress code for cocktails at a car lot, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
William and Willa Dean Lyon, who left their classic car collection at home in 
their private museum, thank-you very much, and slid off Pacific Coast Highway 
to the waiting arms of the valets in a midnight blue Cadillac. Retired race car 
driver Dan Gurney, with his wife Evi. The Gurneys, who live in Newport Beach, 
said they haven't been able to make it to the Concours any of the past six 
years and won't make it this year either -- love to, Dan said, but he'll be on 
the road with his race team. Television actor Barry Bostwick. Concours 
chairwoman Lynda Shea, and her husband, Peter, who owns Entrepreneur magazine. 
Sally and Norman Loats, who heads the board of the Assessment and Treatment 
Services Center.

Overheard

STYLE: SHE CREATES 'L.A. LOOK' IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Menswear designer Jhane Barnes may live and work in New York, but most of the 
time she is California dreamin'. 
</P>
<P>
That's because California is the biggest market for the 35-year-old Coty 
Award-winner's designs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea why they're so popular here," says the strawberry blonde with 
the Elvis Costello glasses. "People are always saying the clothes have such an 
L.A. look, which is funny because I've never lived here and never spent much 
time here." 
</P>
<P>
It's the vibrant colors and light weights that give the clothes their Los 
Angeles personality. But Barnes' designs -- known for their modernistic 
patterns and multitextural fabrics in cool colors -- will have a slightly 
different look in seasons to come. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been using purples and teals for 10 years and find that now people expect 
purple in clothes; it's a standard color," said the designer during a recent 
interview at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. "But society is moving 
toward warmer colors. I think at least for the next 10 years we will see 
warmer-colored clothes in looser silhouettes for men." 
</P>
<P>
She also believes shoulders will be less severe and has included rounder 
shoulder pads in her latest jackets. Another trend she feels men will be 
seeking is fuller pants that drape rather than fitted pants that hug. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes -- who was in Orange County for a South Coast Plaza men's fashion show 
sponsored by GQ magazine and the Alex Sebastian men's store -- says one of the 
best things about visiting Southern California is seeing men wear her clothes 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference in the two markets, and I love California for this, is 
that Californians wear my clothes to work and the New York customer wears them 
during off-hours," she says. "I love the casual attitude Californians have 
about clothes." 
</P>
<P>
"This state is ahead of the country in that respect," she adds. "You keep 
hearing that we're entering an age of elegance for menswear, but I don't 
believe it. I think people would rather wear more comfortable clothes." 
</P>
<P>
For her fall line, Barnes weaves juniper green, berry red and purple with black 
and mahogany for three-button jackets and full-legged pants. Her cardigans 
combine lambs wool, cotton and wool, and many feature a high neck with 
contrasting pattern. 
</P>
<P>
(The clothes -- sold in Orange County at Alex Sebastian, Alex Sport, Neiman 
Marcus, Bullocks Wilshire, Indian Summer and the Look -- cost about $125 for 
shirts, $185 for pants, $425 for jackets and $55 for ties.) 
</P>
<P>
During the last few years Barnes has been experimenting by using a computerized 
hand loom to weave different designs and lately has arrived at what she 
considers the perfect combination of natural materials and Lycra to produce 
highly textured, eye-popping patterns for sweaters and pants. The synthetic 
material gives the finished fabric bounce and accentuates the textures of the 
woven patterns, and also keeps the sweaters lighter than if they were knit or 
woven in wool. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are horrified when I say I'm using Lycra because they think I'm 
doing stretch pants," she says. "But I'm aiming for the texture and the draping 
quality that you get when you use it." 
</P>
<P>
Influenced a great deal by architectural elements, Barnes creates geometric and 
Op Art-style patterns with her Macintosh computer. The pattern designs are then 
fed into her computerized looms, where assistants help produce swatches. These 
hand-woven swatches then go to the mills, where the clothes are manufactured. 
The finished product is what Barnes calls "architextural." 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that architecture was ahead of fashion," she says. "I look 
around and see that buildings are more inspired than the clothes we wear. We're 
always lagging behind." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, who grew up in rural Maryland, is a two-time Coty Award winner (1980 
and 1984). She was named by Cutty Sark as the Outstanding Menswear Designer in 
1982 and won the Council of Fashion Designers of America Menswear Design Award 
in 1981. Along with her men's line, Barnes creates fabric designs for 
commercial interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Clothes have gripped the designer's attention since she was a teen-ager. The 
outfits she made for herself and her friends so impressed her high school 
principal that he asked her to design uniforms for the school's dance band. 
When word got out, she was swamped. In fact, she nearly missed her senior prom 
because she was so busy finishing up all of her friend's formals. 
</P>
<P>
Although Barnes once had a women's couture line, she found menswear more 
captivating. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to like menswear in high school," she says. "It seemed like the guys 
never had any attention before and I noticed they actually really loved 
clothes, but they didn't think they should. It was time they got some 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she adds, designing clothes for women is not as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
"The women's fashion industry is not a nice business," she says. "There is much 
more freedom in menswear." 
</P>
<P>
She says when she was creating women's clothes the stores tried to dictate too 
much. Buyers said she should design longer skirts or shorter jackets. She 
wanted to design what she believed looked good, not what the buyers needed to 
balance out their inventory. 
</P>
<P>
She realizes, however, that most famous designers make clothes for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in it for the publicity," she says. "I don't care if I'm ever famous. 
I think menswear is very important and that's why I'm doing it."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: BULLY NOVEL COMES FROM REAL-LIFE EXPLOITS OF TEDDY 
ROOSEVELT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the stuff that rip-roaring Westerns are made of: 
</P>
<P>
The dude from the East, his health fragile and his life in ruins after his 
mother and beloved bride die the same day, comes West to seek solitude. 
</P>
<P>
He becomes a rancher in the North Dakota Badlands, the untamed wilderness ruled 
by the handsome and notorious Marquis De Mores, principal landowner and 
pretender to the throne of France whose beautiful young wife is from the dude's 
New York social set. 
</P>
<P>
When the Badlands are invaded by a mob of night-riding vigilantes, "whispered 
rumors hold that the Marquis himself leads them." Dozens of men are lynched in 
an effort to rid the area of its small ranchers -- including the dude from New 
York, who "must use his burgeoning outdoorsman's talents in combination with 
his Easterner's knack for organization and politicking to bring down the 
Marquis." 
</P>
<P>
It is, as the publisher says, "a sprawling epic of the American West of the 
1880s." 
</P>
<P>
But what reads like fiction is based on reality. 
</P>
<P>
The dude from the East is 24-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, the main character in 
"Manifest Destiny" (Penzler Books), Brian Garfield's biographical novel that 
dramatizes "the true story of the coming of age" of the 26th President of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising how little fiction there is in that book, although I did write 
it as a novel," said Garfield, who recently appeared at book signings at Book 
Carnival in Orange and the Bookstore in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City author's next Orange County book signing will be from 2 to 5 
p.m. Sunday at Waldenbooks, 665 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (Also scheduled to sign 
are Melodie Johnson Howe, author of "The Mother Shadow," and the 
wife-and-husband writing team known as A.E. Maxwell, authors of "The Art of 
Survival.") 
</P>
<P>
Garfield, who is best known for his novel "Death Wish," said he had the idea 
for a biographical novel about Theodore Roosevelt's Western exploits for at 
least 25 years, "and I was always convinced somebody else must already be 
working on it. It's such a good story and nobody has done it in fictional 
form." 
</P>
<P>
The author first visited Roosevelt's log ranch house in the Badlands five years 
ago. In doing his research for the book, he also dug through the Theodore 
Roosevelt archives at Harvard and at Roosevelt's home in Sagamore Hills, Long 
Island. Most of the material for the book, however, came from libraries and 
historical societies in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real nice that 100 years ago everybody wrote," said Garfield. "They wrote 
incessant letters and kept diaries and memoirs. Everybody who knew Theodore 
Roosevelt in those days naturally sat down and wrote a book about him when he 
became famous." 
</P>
<P>
When 24-year-old Theodore Roosevelt arrived in the Badlands, Garfield said, he 
was not the big, robust character that usually comes to mind. He was 
underweight, sickly, extremely nearsighted, suffered from asthma and spoke with 
a squeaky voice. 
</P>
<P>
"He had everything going against him," said Garfield. "Despite all those 
drawbacks and shortcomings, he was just a natural leader. He had this most 
incredibly charismatic personality. People . . . were eager to follow him." 
</P>
<P>
When Roosevelt first arrived in the Badlands, Garfield said, he was "ridiculed 
as a stumble-bum dude. Within a year he was elected chairman of the Stockman's 
Assn. You couldn't keep him down." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Manifest Destiny" is fictional to the extent that Garfield couldn't 
know what the characters said to each other or what they were thinking and 
feeling at the time, he said all the characters and events are real. 
</P>
<P>
"The plot of the story, oddly enough, is a very strongly structured, almost 
traditional Western," he said. "Roosevelt's life became essentially the basis 
for what we grew up with as the Western formula. His experiences in Dakota were 
pretty parallel to that: a small rancher menaced by land grabber. . . . He 
finally went up against the big bad guy. The bad guy challenged him to a duel. 
. . . It's your classic Western formula. That's why I was just flabbergasted 
nobody else did it." 
</P>
<P>
Garfield, who has written "somewhere between 60 and 70" fiction and nonfiction 
books, in addition to screenplays, alternates between writing contemporary 
novels and historical novels such as "Wild Times," which was based on Buffalo 
Bill's Wild West shows. 
</P>
<P>
"It drives my publishers and agent absolutely up the wall," he said, "because 
they can't typecast me." 
</P>
<P>
Poetry chosen: The American Poetry Assn. has selected six poems by Arthur 
Winslow of Westminster to appear in "American Poetry Anthology," a treasury of 
current poetry. Poets interested in publication may send up to six poems on any 
subject to the American Poetry Assn., Dept. CT-67, P.O. Box 1803, Santa Cruz, 
Calif. 95061. Each poem must be no more than 20 lines, and the poet's name and 
address must be included on each page.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park woman and her newborn son were in a hospital intensive-care unit 
this morning after she was struck by a pickup truck while crossing a street 
near her home and doctors delivered the child by Cesarean section, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Gutierrez, 21, was in serious condition at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center and her son was in critical but stable condition, hospital officials 
said. Another child, Gutierrez's 18-month-old son, Adon, was under observation 
at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles for minor cuts and bruises, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, who was 8 1/2 months pregnant, was carrying Adon across Canoga 
Avenue near Ingomar Street when they were struck at 5:20 p.m., Thursday police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was not crossing at an intersection or crosswalk when a southbound 
pickup driven by a 29-year-old Canoga Park man struck her. The driver was not 
cited and police declined to release his name. 
</P>
<P>
Adon was taken by helicopter to Childrens Hospital. His mother was taken by 
ambulance to Northridge. Police said she suffered numerous injuries, including 
a broken leg and pelvis, which necessitated the delivery of her child.

STOLEN CAR CHASE ENDS IN NEWHALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men in a stolen car were arrested this morning in Newhall after a chase on 
the Golden State Freeway that reached speeds of 125 m.p.h., the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Yanacek, 21, and Michael Distefano, 22, both of Hollywood, were 
captured about 2:30 a.m. when the stolen Acura Legend that Yanacek was driving 
was struck by a CHP car on San Fernando Road near 4th Street, officers said. No 
one was injured. The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, the 
CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began when Los Angeles police spotted the stolen car on Vineland 
Avenue. When officers attempted to pull it over, the car sped away and entered 
the Golden State Freeway and headed north. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP took over the chase, and officers said the car reached a speed of 125 
m.p.h. before exiting the freeway at Lyons Road. The car sped on surface 
streets at 100 m.p.h. before crashing through a construction barrier on San 
Fernando Road and slowing in an unpaved area, the CHP said. A CHP car 
broadsided the stolen car when it attempted to turn north in the southbound 
lanes, according to CHP reports.

The acting No. 2 official of the General Services Administration resigned 
abruptly after being told that "adverse information" about him had turned up in 
a security investigation, GSA officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The information surfaced a year ago but had been held from the man and other 
top GSA officials, the GSA said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Austin, acting administrator of the agency that serves as the 
federal government's landlord, said David Godfrey submitted his resignation as 
chief of staff on Sept. 15, effective Oct. 15. Austin said the "adverse 
information" included "possible substantial outstanding debts incurred in 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Godfrey was a Midland, Tex., banker, real estate developer and businessman 
engaged in oil and gas operations before he became the regional administrator 
for the GSA in 1987.

BUSH SLAMS DEMOCRATS IN N.J. RACE;

PRESIDENT LENDS A HAND TO GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE

President Bush, trying to help Republicans score a come-from-behind victory in 
the New Jersey governor's race, portrayed Democrats today as soft on crime and 
said liberal Democrats "cherish new taxes like moths drawn to a flame." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a fund-raiser for GOP candidate Rep. Jim Courter, Bush painted 
the gubernatorial contest as a choice between "the old and new New Jerseys." 
</P>
<P>
Outrunning Hurricane Hugo up the Atlantic Coast, en route to a weekend stay at 
his home on the Maine coast, Bush stopped in New Jersey to help lift GOP 
spirits in one of only two races for governor this fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Environment, Jobs 
</P>
<P>
He said Republican leadership would champion the environment, education, jobs 
and the war on drugs, and that New Jersey's residents should "oppose those 
liberal Democrats who cherish new taxes like moths drawn to a flame." 
</P>
<P>
"The failed policies . . . of the 1970s just aren't good enough," Bush said. 
"Not for New Jersey, not for the United States of America. They're not good 
enough to tackle drugs or crime. Or to protect the environment or do better as 
a nation in education. They're not good enough for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the $500-a-person event raised $700,000 for Courter's uphill 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Courter is opposed by Democratic Rep. James J. Florio in the contest to succeed 
Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double-Digit Lead 
</P>
<P>
Florio, a liberal Democrat who ran a close campaign in 1981 against Kean, has 
been given a double-digit lead over Courter in public opinion surveys. Kean is 
not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Today's visit by Bush was part of a hard-fought effort to keep the governor's 
seat in the Republican column, and the President was arriving as both Florio 
and Courter debuted their first television ads. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been marked by controversy over abortion and homosexual 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Florio favors the right to abortion, while Courter has been accused of 
vacillating on the issue. He has said he personally opposes abortion, but would 
not force his views on state residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rankled Homosexuals 
</P>
<P>
Courter has also rankled homosexuals by saying he supports legislation to bar 
them from jobs that involve children, although he later softened the comment by 
saying he would not push for such changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
Before settling in at his vacation home, Bush planned to make a brief stop at a 
tree farm in nearby Wells to make a new pitch in his campaign for a reduction 
in capital gains taxes, which are imposed on profits from sales of real estate, 
stocks and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is using a tree farm to advance his campaign for a capital gains tax cut 
because tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on profits from their sales. 
The Administration contends that many tree farms are small, marginal 
operations.

MEDICAL CARE OF DISABLED BABIES HIT

<P>
The denial of food, water and lifesaving medical care to babies with 
disabilities is a "significant civil rights problem" demanding greater 
supervision of doctors, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission said today. 
</P>
<P>
A report approved by seven of the eight commission members said hospital 
committees and state and federal agencies all have failed to adequately enforce 
the 1984 Child Abuse Amendments, which require care except in cases when it 
would be futile or inhumane or when a baby is chronically comatose. 
</P>
<P>
The 513-page report, released after four years of work, charged that doctors 
are usually "the prime movers" in denying care even when parental approval is 
obtained, and said they often give advice on the basis of misinformation about 
the quality of life for the disabled and mentally retarded.

WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS DRUG DEAL PLOY

<P>
President Bush's spokesman today defended the luring of a drug dealer to the 
park across from the White House so the President could show crack cocaine on 
television and say it was bought there. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the whole point" of the sting operation by the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, said Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the DEA we wanted to show that crack could be easily obtained in any 
neighborhood in Washington, not just in the ghetto," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was nothing wrong in luring the dealer into the park so 
undercover agents could make the "buy" of crack cocaine there, and that it did 
not constitute entrapment. The area, Lafayette Park, is not known for drug 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
William McMullan, assistant agent in charge of the DEA's Washington field 
office, was quoted in today's editions of the Washington Post as saying, "We 
were going to make that undercover buy anyway. What difference does it make 
where it happened -- whether it was in front of the White House. . . or in 
front of the Supreme Court?" 
</P>
<P>
The sale of three ounces of crack to an undercover agent was made at 11:30 a.m. 
on Sept. 1, four days before Bush held up a plastic bag of the substance and 
told television viewers, "This is crack cocaine. It was seized a few days ago 
in a park across the street from the White House." 
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the White House asked the Justice Department if it 
could provide some cocaine for the President's speech; Justice asked DEA and 
McMullan was asked if he could move a planned purchase "four or five blocks 
away" closer to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy" to change the location, McMullan said. At first the suspect 
seemed not to know what or where the White House was. Told it was the 
President's house, he said, "Oh, you mean where Reagan lives."

Three members of the Nobel Prize selection committee for literature have quit 
over the body's refusal to speak out against threats to British author Salman 
Rushdie, but the committee has refused to let them go. 
</P>
<P>
Novelists Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten submitted their resignations to 
Sweden's Academy of Letters with a third member, Werner Aspenstrom, Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Academy Chairman Sture Allen said the resignations could not be accepted. "The 
work will go on. Members serve for life so we cannot grant their resignation 
requests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's late leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Muslims 
worldwide to kill Rushdie for blasphemy against Islam in his book "The Satanic 
Verses." Rushdie has been forced into hiding by the threat. 
</P>
<P>
In March the 18-member Academy issued a statement deploring attacks on freedom 
of speech but failed to mention Iran or the Indian-born author. It is the first 
time since the Academy was founded in 1786 that a disagreement has been made 
public. The Academy is to announce the 1989 Nobel Prize winner in literature 
next month.

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner met today with Los Angeles investor 
Alfred Checchi to disclose findings of his review of Checchi's $4-billion 
takeover of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
But the Transportation Department will not comment on the meeting or on 
Skinner's findings, said Hal Paris, a department spokesman. The findings may be 
made public next week, Paris added. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner "didn't want Mr. Checchi reading about (the findings) in the paper," 
Paris said. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi could not be reached for comment after the meeting and a Northwest 
spokesman did not immediately return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi led a group including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines that agreed during the 
summer to pay $121 a share for NWA, based in Eagan, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner has expressed concern about the foreign ownership and safety of 
airlines taken over in leveraged buyouts. Northwest, the nation's 
fourth-largest airline, was saddled with a $3.1-billion debt after the 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner has the power to revoke the airline's operating certificate but that is 
considered unlikely.

Amway Corp. has agreed to pay $38.1 million to settle charges it avoided paying 
Canadian duties, and in exchange the government dropped a $125.4-million suit 
against the direct sales company, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek said the government filed notice 
to drop the suit Wednesday in the Federal Court of Canada. Amway initiated 
negotiations to settle the case a year ago, he added. 
</P>

"It's not a bad settlement," said the spokesman, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Amway officials at the company's headquarters in Ada, Mich., were not 
immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's revenue agency had accused Amway of avoiding custom duties by 
undervaluing merchandise it exported from the United States to Canadian 
distributors during a six-year period beginning in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-year-old lawsuit sought money for unpaid customs duties, sales taxes and 
the value of the Amway products that crossed into Canada during those six 
years.

Chrysler Corp., in the midst of a $1-billion cost-cutting program, today 
announced it is selling 45% of its share in the Japanese auto maker Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. for $592 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it would see an after-tax profit of about $310 million, or 
$1.33 a share, from the sale to 25 Japanese financial institutions. The money 
goes to Chrysler's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is we didn't need it to meet the short-term cash needs of 
implementing our billion-dollar cost-cutting program," Chrysler Chief Financial 
Officer Robert Miller said today. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the money will help fund a five-year product-development program, 
meet pension obligations and provide more capital for a stock repurchase plan. 
</P>
<P>
"This will just give us an added bit of balance-sheet strength for those 
purposes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The move will reduce Chrysler's equity in Mitsubishi to 12.1% from 21.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"This has turned out to be a very good investment. By selling, we don't think 
the party's over by any means," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. remains as strong as ever and is 
a critical element of our future plans," Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said in 
a news release today. "Given today's market conditions in Japan . . . we feel 
that this is a good time to reduce the size of our stake in MMC and realize 
some significant value for our shareholders."

Food and Drug Administration officials said today they are worried by the 
pattern of side effects reported by users of Halcion, the world's best-selling 
sleeping pill, and said they wanted advice from a panel of outside experts. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Anello, an FDA official, said reports of amnesia, anxiety, 
hallucinations, confusion, intentional injury and seizures have been recorded 
for Halcion far out of proportion to the drug's market share. Halcion, 
triazolam in tablet form, is made by Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"Halcion has been the subject of recurring waves of adverse reports since its 
introduction into the domestic market," Dr. Paul Leber of the FDA staff told 
the agency's Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Leber said the agency staff is seeking the outside panel's advice because it 
does not know how to interpret the side effect reports. He said the FDA 
Advisory Committee could react in a variety of ways, from banning the drug to 
doing nothing.

JOHNSON 'UNCOMFORTABLE WITH' PSYCHIATRIST; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK TUG OF WAR: WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE METS?

New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson pulled team psychiatrist Alan Lans into his 
office before Thursday night's game amid growing concern among his players that 
Lans is assuming too much power in the running of the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"I said there are some things I am uncomfortable with," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson would not specify. But there are signs that the psychiatrist is playing 
a major role in the running of the Mets. It was Lans -- not the manager -- who 
called the team meeting Tuesday at which Johnson and Darryl Strawberry nearly 
came to blows. The sources said Johnson loudly reprimanded Lans once he found 
out he had arranged the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admitted Calling Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Lans admitted he called the meeting, saying, "I said, 'Let's have a meeting and 
get it over with.' That was no particular role of mine. I mean, anybody could 
have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Lans apparently played a role in the decision not to have 
Dwight Gooden throw in the bullpen. Johnson wanted Gooden to throw in 
preparation for a start Sunday. But after a meeting with Lans in the trainer's 
room, Gooden did not throw. Johnson said he did not know why. But Lans did. 
</P>
<P>
"He had some soreness, and the decision was to slow his progress," Lans said. 
Asked who made the decision, Lans said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago this week, Johnson said his decision not to start Gooden against the 
Cubs was based in part on Lans' input. 
</P>
<P>
And several Mets players said they are wary about what they tell Lans because 
they know he is a direct link to General Manager Frank Cashen, the man who 
hired him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Dr. Lans was here to help the people out of rehab and keep them on 
the right course," said Tim Teufel, referring to Gooden, Keith Hernandez, 
Mackey Sasser and Jeff Musselman, players who have had problems with cocaine or 
alcohol. "I don't think we need a psychiatrist to win ball games." 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Lans left his role at St. Luke's Hospital and the Smithers 
Alcoholism and Treatment Center, a rehabilitation center in New York, and he 
has since confined his practice to working with the Mets. He travels with the 
club, has unlimited access to the clubhouse and sits in on closed-door team 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays cards with guys like he's trying to be one of their buddies," Randy 
Myers said. "It's like a fan who's hanging out in the clubhouse. It's one thing 
to have someone available if a player wants someone to talk to. It's another 
thing to have him hanging around every day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion on Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Said David Cone: "There is a little confusion as far as to when we do call a 
team meeting. Is it for the team or is it for the front office, too? There is 
some confusion there. You might as well invite the front office in. That needs 
to be clarified." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lans: "I'm not a front-office person. That's clear." Asked if his job was 
defined by Cashen or by himself, Lans said, "By me." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has assumed a more active role on this 10-game road trip because of 
"natural frustrations" associated with the Mets' position in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were five games ahead, I'd probably be watching these games on TV," he 
said.

The surprise announcement by the Boston Celtics that the National Basketball 
Assn. club wants to buy WFXT-TV in Boston could also involve the Red Sox of the 
American League, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
Celtics officials had begun talking to the Red Sox about the possibility of the 
baseball team becoming a part owner of the television station before agreeing 
in principle to purchase the station from Fox Broadcasting, according to 
today's Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement Tuesday, Celtics co-owner Don Gaston and Fox President 
Robert Kreek announced the agreement but did not provide details. 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed estimates of the station's price range from $20 million to $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Gaston gave more details of the team's involvement with WFXT. He said 
once the deal is finalized, Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox Broadcasting, 
would still have a financial interest in the television station. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic agreement does envision Murdoch retaining a financial interest," 
Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Cohen, vice president and treasurer of the Celtics, also said the 
condition that Murdoch stay involved in the station was part of the purchase 
price.

Yannick Noah will be out of tennis for more than a month after burning himself 
while trying to light a barbecue, his doctor said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, ranked 14th in the world, received second-degree burns to his 
right thigh Monday after a can of gasoline exploded and set his trousers on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
His doctor, Dominique Leviet, said the burns will take at least three weeks to 
heal and he will need to rest for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
Noah will miss a tournament in Switzerland starting Oct. 2 and is unlikely to 
play in the Paris Grand Prix event beginning Oct. 30.
