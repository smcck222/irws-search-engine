FAR FROM ANY COAST: PIECES OF THE AMERICAN MIDLANDS BY C. W. GUSEWELLE

<P>
Every so often gifted American writers come along to chronicle a particular 
part of Americana and in so doing leave a wondrous and indelible imprint in the 
reader's mind. With the publication of these 15 essays on rural Midwestern 
life, C. W. Gusewelle elevates himself to the level of E. B. White, William 
Least Heat Moon, Willie Morris and other noted observers of the American scene. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a quarter century Gusewelle has written a popular column for the 
Kansas City Star and all the while made it his business to peer into the odd 
and often difficult lives of Midwestern outlanders -- the ones who work the 
coal mines in Illinois and Kentucky or try to farm hardscrabble Missouri land 
or eke a living out of the Ozark mountainsides. The picture he paints is as 
stark and real as the countryside itself: adversity, triumph, failure, success, 
waste, foolishness, wisdom -- always with the enthusiastic eye and ear of a 
sort of modern-day Darwin, reveling in the discovery of some new proof of 
historical continuity, living or dead. 
</P>
<P>
Take for instance the piece entitled "Moonrise to Mourning: Echoes of the 
Race," written 20 years ago but updated recently. Here Gusewelle describes a 
foxhunt in Southern Illinois. Not the tally-ho kind of foxhunt on horseback, 
but a truly Americanized version of the sport in which, "Seldom is the fox 
caught. And never is he meant to be. So it is not truly a blood sport; there is 
innocence in it. The point is essential, and to understand it you should be 
acquainted with the country." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the most beautifully written of these essays -- and Gusewelle is a 
finely tuned lyrical writer -- this story reveals a group of old men and boys 
in a remote part of the state who meet periodically around campfires on cold 
autumn nights to "run their hounds," after foxes. They squat around, listening 
in the dark for the sound of their dogs, talking of hounds running and hounds 
lost and it is mainly in the running and the pursuit that they are consumed -- 
not a kill. 
</P>
<P>
In "Memories of a Country Neighborhood," Gusewelle returns to a remote Missouri 
village that once housed three hotels, a bank, and other enterprises. "Gone, 
all of them, to one or the other of those two old friends, fire or rot." 
"Before the Mountain Fell" recalls the ravages of strip mining on the people of 
a Kentucky hamlet and here he describes one woman who is battling the big 
mining companies and the government that permits them to ruin her land: 
</P>
<P>
"She is in all ways a child of the mountains. She knows the hardship, the 
heartbreak, the violence there. She understands the greed and corruption of 
mountain politics. She is acquainted with the forces that have disfigured and 
would ultimately destroy the mountains themselves and the people who dwell in 
them. What distinguishes Edith Easterling is the fierceness of her belief that 
she and people like her, acting on their own behalf, can somehow prevent this 
destruction. The evidence to date suggests that she is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"The Promise of Elysian" reveals certain truths about a little Minnesota town. 
In "The Fragility of Skepticism: A Report of the Mud Camp Expedition," 
Gusewelle recounts the very funny story of how he and some friends camped for 
days in a dismal Illinois swamp called "The Scatters," trying to capture or 
photograph a manlike creature reported to be living there. 
</P>
<P>
"The Broken Twig" is a poignant tale of the downfall of the foreman on 
Gusewelle's Missouri farm; how he helped try to save the man from himself, only 
to be mired in a sinister maelstrom of bitterness and violence. And after the 
foreman had finally gone, "Bringing in the Sheaves: A Harvest Journal," is a 
hilarious chronicle of the author's tribulations in trying to bring in a wheat 
crop by himself. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the bittersweet account in "The End of Loving the Land," in 
which Gusewelle details the sad end of his attempt at a farming career and the 
loss of his life's savings. Here he is concluding the last insult, a tax audit: 
</P>
<P>
"In the end . . . it was demonstrated that I had not ruined myself for gain. 
But there remained, in the mind of the IRS, the possibility that the farm was a 
hobby and an amusement -- in other words, that I had ruined myself for 
pleasure. To lay this last suspicion to rest I was invited to submit an 
informal statement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I sat down to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Broken machinery. Broken men. Pig-eating sows. Bulls gone lame while breeding. 
Money-eating tenant houses. Fields of mown and rotting hay. Flash floods. 
Fires. Barren cows. Four-cent-a-pound grass seed. Rust in the wheat. Morning 
glories in the soybeans. Droughts that opened fissures underfoot. Threatened 
violence. Deceit and betrayal and disappointment without end. 
</P>
<P>
"I put it all on paper, as I have done here. . . . It is a queer experience to 
write a summary of the last more than 20 years of your life and to watch as it 
unfolds into a fool's story. The story of Job pales alongside the compendium of 
tribulations I set down, all of them perfectly true. When it was finished, we 
howled with laughter, my wife and I -- the laughter of hysteria and 
heartbreak." 
</P>
<P>
Gusewelle has peopled these essays with common folk whom, with the touch of a 
novelist, he has made uncommon -- alive. There are some uneven spots here and 
there -- some of the stories don't hold up quite as well as the rest. But by 
the end, my main wish was that the book was longer. I did not want to leave 
these folks so soon.

STRANGERS FROM A DIFFERENT SHORE: A HISTORY OF ASIAN AMERICANS BY RONALD TAKAKI 
(LITTLE, BROWN: $22.95; 512 PP.; 0-316-83109-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bharati Mukherjee, Mukherjee's last book, The Middleman &amp; Other Stories, 
won the 1988 National Book Critics' Circle Award. A novel, Jasmine (Grove 
Press), will be published later this month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a February morning in 1988, in a large, dingy chamber of the federal 
District Court House in Manhattan, a clerk handed me my Certificate of 
Naturalization listing my height, weight, color of eyes ("brown"), hair 
("black") and complexion ("medium"), then a judge led me and more than 150 
other petitioners (most of whom seemed to be of "medium" or "dark" complexion) 
through the pledge of allegiance and pronounced us legitimate Americans. For 
us, the new citizens, this was a moment of intense emotions. Strangers hugged 
and kissed. For America, too, this was proof that the principles of democracy 
and equal rights had triumphed. There had been a time not that long ago in 
America's immigration history when I, educated, law-abiding, eager to be 
American, would have been denied citizenship simply because of my "medium" 
complexion. 
</P>
<P>
For Americans and Canadians of Asian extraction, however, the battle for 
acceptance doesn't stop with winning the right to become citizens. I became 
painfully aware of how the New World marginalizes its Asian-looking citizens 
when I was co-authoring a book on the 1985 terrorist-bombing of an Air India 
jet en route from Canada to India. Three hundred and twenty-nine people died 
when AI Flight 182 exploded in mid-air; in terms of body count, that terrorist 
incident remains the world's bloodiest. Ninety percent of the victims were 
Canadian citizens. But because those citizens were Canadians "of Indian 
origin," a senior External Affairs official explained to me, the Canadian 
government perceived them as being Indian rather than Canadian, and Canada's 
prime minister, in a rush of mis-channeled sympathy, sent a cable of condolence 
to India's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
It is this Asian-American, 150-year-long, two-phase fight for legal and 
psychological acceptance that Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at 
the University of California, Berkeley, skillfully uncovers and forcefully 
records in "Strangers From a Different Shore," his fifth book on American 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Takaki's aim is to correct the Euro-centric tilt favored by the majority of 
American social historians, to render visible Asians' contributions to the 
making of America, and to firmly establish the pluralism of American culture. 
His scope is vast: He chronicles the very distinctive immigration odysseys of 
the Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Filipinos, the Asian Indians, the 
Vietnamese, the Hmong. And his method is extraordinary, seaming together 
meticulous scholarship, impassioned analysis, popular culture and personal 
memoir. The result is a compelling and timely document about America's changing 
responses to the threat of de-Europeanization. 
</P>
<P>
It was to California of the 1850s, staggeringly underpopulated and glittery 
with gold dust, that the first Asian immigrants -- Chinese prospectors -- 
rushed. These were gutsy, hard-working pioneers who experienced the push/pull 
syndrome familiar to most immigrants: as with their European counterparts, the 
Chinese were "pushed" out of their homeland by poverty, and "pulled" in to 
America by promises of self-improvement. And, at least at first, the Chinese 
were accepted. In Jan., 1852, Gov. John McDougal of California described the 
newcomers as "one of the most worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens -- 
to whom the climate and the character of these lands are peculiarly suited." 
Theirs should have been a happy story. 
</P>
<P>
What the Chinese soon stumbled against however, Takaki argues, was the violent 
panic of white labor unions. Racism was a tool that labor leaders and savvy 
politicians exploited to break the power of white capitalists who employed the 
cheap and diligent Asian work force as "scabs." Labor unions successfully fed 
the public's fears about miscegenation and de-Europeanization, and created a 
backlash against the Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Takaki is particularly dogged in tracking the changes in public perception and 
official rhetoric. The "worthy" adoptees suddenly became the "servile" hordes 
crowding America's shores, men too "dissimilar from ourselves in customs, 
language and education" to be assimilated into the Founding Fathers' ideal of a 
homogenously white and Christian sovereign state. Even a respectable newspaper 
such as the New York Times labeled the Chinese "a population befouled with all 
the social vices . . . with heathenish souls and heathenish propensities . . 
.", the enemy of the American Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
America needed Asian labor, but white Americans didn't want Asian compatriots. 
The All-American solution? Pass new race-related laws that reduce the Asian 
entrant to a low-waged transient, permanently ineligible for citizenship; 
reinforce the vicious myth that Asians are "sojourners," only Europeans are 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
To be deprived of citizenship is to be rendered invisible, mute, marginal. The 
Asians were both too "invisible" and too "visible" a minority. This is the 
paradox against which Takaki rightly rages. 
</P>
<P>
"Strangers" provides fuller information on the Chinese, Japanese, Korean and 
Filipino groups than on South Asians and recent political refugees. But it does 
include a succinct and astute chapter on America's strategies for keeping out 
Indians, Asia's "Caucasian" immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Takaki is at his best when he quickens scholarship with tableaux of immigrant 
life. With Chinese railroad workers, we shiver through the rough winter of 
1866. "The snow drifts, over sixty feet in height, covered construction 
operations. The Chinese workers lived and worked in tunnels under the snow, 
with shafts to give them air and lanterns to light the way. Snow slides 
occasionally buried camps and crews; in the spring, workers found the thawing 
corpses, still upright, their cold hands gripping shovels and picks and their 
mouths twisted in frozen terror." 
</P>
<P>
And Takaki is very affecting when he empowers the long-silenced or the 
inarticulate with voice. A Japanese-American woman interned during World War II 
recalls, "I felt wonderful the day I left camp. We took a bus to the railroad 
siding and then stopped somewhere to transfer, and I went in and bought a Coke, 
a nickel Coke. It wasn't the Coke, but what it represented -- that I was free 
to buy it, that feeling was so intense." A Hmong hog farmer in California 
explains: "When you pull a plant out of the ground without any soil around its 
roots -- soil from where it was grown -- and transplant it, the plant will have 
trouble surviving." 
</P>
<P>
Takaki startles when he reminds us repeatedly that it was President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, an American icon, who "issued Executive Order 9066, which targeted 
Japanese Americans for special persecution and deprived them of their rights of 
due process and equal protection of the law." F.D.R. did not incarcerate German 
and Italian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The heroic white American in this narrative is the late Atty. Gen. Robert 
Kennedy who, heady with Civil Rights victories, told the Congress in 1964: " 
'Everywhere else in our national life, we have eliminated discrimination based 
on national origins. Yet, this system is still the foundation of our 
immigration law,' " and who, in spite of protests from exclusionist groups such 
as the Daughters of the American Revolution, negotiated new legislation that 
fractured forever America's Euro-centric self-image. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on "the Model Minority" myth is magnificent. But one wishes that 
Takaki had allowed himself a longer discussion of the post-1965 wave of Asian 
immigrants, especially of the new class structures and the new gender and 
generational relations evolving within the immigrant communities. Perhaps that 
will be the subject of this prolific author's next work. 
</P>
<P>
"Strangers" is an important book. Given the documented flight of Anglos from 
Southern California in the '80s and the increasinly reactionary stance of the 
urban white middle class, this book should be required reading on campuses.

I am in total agreement with Tara Dawn Wadlington (Viewers' Views, Sept. 3). I 
too feel that "Love Connection" ought to match up individuals of different 
races. The dates then might be more enjoyable for both the participants and the 
audience. I am definitely voting for cross-race dating on "Love Connection."

Television with a past, present and future touch comes to the small screen this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The past is represented by new half-hour episodes of the old adventure series, 
"Lassie." The syndicated show about a family and its beloved collie airs 
Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. on Channel 9. Youngsters Wendy Cox and Will Nipper flank 
Lassie on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
Come Saturday, the late-night time slot for "It'z Fritz," a new KNBC-TV 
comedy/variety series hosted by weatherman and stand-up comic Fritz Coleman, 
will be from 1 to 2 a.m. on Channel 4. Guests on the opener are "Saturday Night 
Live" regular Kevin Nealon, rock group Transvision Vamp and comedienne Diane 
Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
The future -- 1995 Los Angeles, to be precise -- provides the setting for 
"Alien Nation," the new Fox Broadcasting series airing Mondays at 9 p.m. on 
Channels 11 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Scarabelli, Lauren Woodland and Sean Six (from left) play the wife and 
children of "newcomer" police detective George Francisco (Eric Pierpoint), who 
are trying to assimilate into mainstream society. STEVEN LINAN

It is appalling enough to know that in 1989, we would have a need for a "Miss 
Black America Pageant," but it is an extra slap in the face when the broadcast 
is plagued with audio problems. The entire show was the pits.

ANTHOLOGY OF ALTER EGOS; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING THE PAST BY THOMAS BERGER (LITTLE, BROWN: $18.95; 292 PP.; 
0-316-09149-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas M. Disch, Disch is the author of several novels, and a recent 
collection of new and selected poems, Yes, Let's (Johns Hopkins University 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Literary culture and polite society are governed by many assumptions honored in 
theory but ignored in practice. One such would have it that hating people is as 
wrong as eating them. The civilized ideal is to comprehend all and then 
forgive; even so, polls show that a majority of people favor capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Berger is a hater, or to put it more genteelly, a misanthrope. A 
misogynist too, for that matter, often of the street corner variety whose dirty 
jokes all spring from the same wishful premise: "There's only one thing they 
want, and they can't get enough of it." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly on the evidence of the female characters in his latest novel, 
"Changing the Past," Berger's estimate of the sexual mores and stratagems of 
womankind mirrors Lear's: "Down from the waist they are Centaurs, though women 
all above." (Act IV, Scene VI). 
</P>
<P>
In the first and most extended of several such scenes, high-school freshman 
Jack Kellog finds it "simultaneously horrifying and thrilling" to be fondled by 
his Centaurette classmate Betty Jane Hopper, who "far from being the Sunday 
schoolgoer of . . . innocent assumption . . . was a shameless whore." 
</P>
<P>
But lechery is only one item on Berger's bill of indictments against the human 
race, and when he is not cranking out ribald fancies of innocent males 
corrupted by female concupiscence, his invention and invective are both much 
livelier, and sometimes even deadly. 
</P>
<P>
He is at his best when he imitates the summary narrative style of biography, 
rather than in extended dramatic scenes for which he lacks the marksman's eye 
and craftsman's patience of Tom Wolfe in his no less misanthropic but so much 
more persuasive "The Bonfire of the Vanities." But at its own natural hastening 
pace, "Changing the Past" can carry the conviction and impact of a newspaper 
obit or one of the "true histories" of Daniel Defoe. 
</P>
<P>
Formally, "Changing the Past" is a fantasy about a New York copy editor who is 
offered the opportunity to erase the life of tame probity he has been leading 
(a life recently darkened by the discovery that his only son is dying of AIDS) 
and to try on larger destinies for size. 
</P>
<P>
He becomes, in turn, a real-estate tycoon, a stand-up comic, a famous novelist 
and a radio psychologist whose wife is elected President. Each of these 
alternate lives proves dissatisfying and, eventually, disastrous. Yes, Berger 
seems to be assuring his readers that "you may travel far and wide, mid 
pleasures and palaces, but finally there's no face like your own." 
</P>
<P>
The notion is not original to Berger: J. M. Barrie handled it with memorable 
flair in his 1917 drama, "Dear Brutus." In Berger's handling, this fantastic 
premise is little more than a pretext for publishing three quite independent 
novelettes as a novel. The alternate lives of copy editor Hunsicker seem 
neither to spring from his character nor to illuminate it, and even in the way 
he shows Hunsicker experiencing his revised lives, Berger is inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
In his first new life, Hunsicker jumps into the skin of a contemporary 
(mid-'80s) millionaire skirt-chaser, spends a few hours riding around in his 
new identity but unable to grab hold of the steering wheel of his will. The 
next three incarnations are handled without any reference to the passenger-like 
Hunsicker and tell cradle-to-grave stories of the three different louts who 
have nothing in common but the same surname, Kellog, and a general tendency to 
make the worst of their opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
So forget the frame, as Berger mostly does. The separate stories are enjoyable, 
especially the first, a vitriolic account of the rise and fall of a 
Mafia-sponsored nightclub comic, Jackie Kellog. He attains national celebrity 
when he's taken under the wing of a Sinatra-like crooner, Tony Gamble, who 
offers him this advice on the art of stand-up comedy: 
</P>
<P>
"Do what you been doin', only nastier. Draw blood, you know? People love that. 
Be a good contrast for when I come on with the ballads. People like to laugh, 
and they like to cry. That's what we do, kid, get the feelings out of them. You 
might say we're kinda doctors." He threw back his head and chortled. "Or 
whores!" 
</P>
<P>
Berger's own theory of humor is not much different from Gamble's -- jokes are 
weapons, and laughter the baying of a pack of predators. Berger knows whereof 
he speaks, since he is himself a skilled comedian and cruel satirist. One would 
expect, then, that he would do as thorough a job of demolition on the literary 
world in his account of the hapless novelist, John Kellog, but John is a much 
less ambitious target, a writer with little talent except for satisfying the 
insatiable sexual appetite of agents and editors. 
</P>
<P>
His novels are romans a clef sopping with self-pity. As a character, he is less 
plausible than the comic Jackie, and as a target of satire, less 
representative. Berger's story might have been satisfying if he had followed 
John's practice of basing his inventions on real life. Venom is not effective 
against straw men. 
</P>
<P>
The third Kellog is a bogus "doctor" purveying advice about sex on daytime 
radio. C. V., though briefest of the three, is best suited to Berger's gift for 
rapid-fire narrative invention, since each of the callers to the talk show can 
sketch out his or her own brief outline for another Bergeresque comedy of 
terrors. Watching their woes mount to preposterous heights of woefulness is a 
little like looking over the author's shoulder as he sketches out the plot of a 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, like his comic and his talk-show host, is an improviser. He writes 
quick, clear, uncomplicated prose and spins out plots that have the ring of 
modern-day commedia del arte (which is probably the reason his novels "Little 
Big Man" and "Neighbors" translated so well into movies). One happy consequence 
is that Berger is prolific, with seven novels since 1980. A less happy 
consequence is that his performance is erratic. When he's on a roll, he can be 
great fun, but when he's not, he lacks the patience to patch out a lack of 
immediate inspiration with mere hard work. In "Changing the Past," he's on a 
roll no more than half the time, but half of Berger's roll is not only better 
than none, it's delicious.

After sitting down for a relaxing two hours of Sunday-night television, I was 
once again reminded of the horrendous quality of new shows. On Aug. 27, I 
reluctantly watched the new TV movie "L.A. Takedown" on NBC. I found it not 
only an insult to the entertainment industry, but to myself as a viewer as 
well. The movie opened with a steamy sex scene that I found completely 
unnecessary to the entire story, except maybe to capture the attention of a 
shallow audience. The majority of the two hours was spent covering numerous 
shootings: good guys, bad guys, innocent bystanders. As a matter of fact, the 
only thing I found vaguely impressive about the movie were the seemingly 
endless rounds of ammunition shot all over the open city streets. By the time 
the movie finally ended, there were no arrests for our heroes, the police, to 
make -- all of the criminals had been killed. What a lasting impression to 
make: The best way to solve a problem is simply to kill it.

HOW TO DOFF A SUIT OF ARMOR;

<P>
PHYSICAL CULTURE BY HILLARY JOHNSON (POSEIDON PRESS: $16.95; 105 PP.;

<P>
"Physical Culture" is a novella about five days in the life of a middle-aged 
man named John, the retiring accountant for a mattress factory in an 
unidentified suburban town, who is an active masochist. John has a young 
acquaintance named Stephan, a procurer, whom he knows from the "health" club 
he's frequented in the city, Physical Culture. As the book unfolds, he also 
develops a relationship with a young woman named Liann, an alcoholic who works 
at the mattress factory and is the daughter of the woman he drives to work each 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is narrated in the first person by John, but, especially at the 
beginning, it's an opaque, elliptical first-person, almost entirely preoccupied 
with physical states and processes. In several sentences, for example, the 
author assumes the narrative perspective of the male sexual organ, which, sans 
sexual play, is something this reviewer can't remember seeing before in 
expository prose. 
</P>
<P>
This seems even more provocative in light of the fact that the author, Hillary 
Johnson, as the publicity kit for "Physical Culture" announces with some pride, 
is a 23-year-old woman born in Burbank, Calif., who now lives with her husband 
in Portland, Ore., and Calcutta, India. If the author were a 45-year-old 
ex-convict from Lompoc, would the reviewer have found the sentence more 
plausible? Hopefully not. Still, there is an admirable boldness in this first 
novel, which contains a grimly vivid portrait of the subterranean S&amp;M 
world. John reports: 
</P>
<P>
"The first person Stephan ever introduced me to was a man six-foot five, with 
an orange beard that I remember distinctly because the hairs were twice as 
thick as any human hair I had ever seen. They were curly, too -- tight, wide 
curls. He took off my shirt and wrapped my upper body in barbed wire, under my 
armpits and down my arms, then dressed me in a padded vest, a starched white 
dress shirt, and evening jacket, and took me out dancing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(Dancing) I could see little dimes, quarters, and pennies of blood fall to the 
floor, as if through a hole in my pocket, and get scuffed into streaks by a 
herd of feet." 
</P>
<P>
At her best, Johnson commands a forceful, evocative prose ("a restaurant where 
I can hear a whole flat of glasses shivering against each other in the 
kitchen"), and she possesses a sure sense of how to play a scene for maximum 
effect and then move on. As John and Liann, each with their separate shame, 
grow closer, her touch is especially graceful, and these scenes, which might be 
set into a far more conventional story, indicate a writer of real promise. On 
the other hand, a stylistic "innovation" in which a line ends with a period 
before the meaning is clear, and then is concluded in the first line of a new 
paragraph, never grows into anything beyond distracting mannerism. 
</P>
<P>
The jacket copy and several endorsements from writers promise a denouement that 
will reveal the deeper personal reality that underlies John's masochism, and 
it's certainly to Johnson's credit that she's written a novel on so 
sensationalistic a subject that for the most part keeps its focus trained on 
the minutely human, the quotidian. The emotional climax occurs when John allows 
his naked body's visible history of abominations to be glimpsed by Stephan and 
Liann, and finally, a little later, alone in front of a mirror, looks himself. 
</P>
<P>
It's a powerful scene that promises further growth and change, but the book 
begins to feel somewhat simplistic as it rounds into its final stretch. John 
goes back in memory to being 9 years old in "a family full of wits and buffoons 
and practical jokers enjoying the hideousness of the day. I wondered why my 
body felt uncomfortable, as if I were clanking around in a suit of armor." Yes, 
one wants to interject, welcome to the human race. 
</P>
<P>
If physical pain can overwhelm emotional pain, Johnson indicates, then perhaps 
the pain is less. Then too, there is the control exhibited in writing one's own 
experience, decreeing the atrocities oneself. In the end, of course, it's a 
closed circuit in which life, in any larger sense, has been edited out. What is 
affecting in "Physical Culture" is that while John may have all but forgotten 
it, even as he advances toward its graces, Hillary Johnson for the most part 
keeps her eye steadily on that larger life.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: READING AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS: IMAGES AS HISTORY BY ALAN 
TRACHTENBERG (HILL &amp; WANG: $25; 326 PP.)

Photographs say much about the eye of the beholder -- what Emerson called "the 
transcendental eyeball." Alan Trachtenberg offers glimpses into the perceptions 
and values of photographers and their pictures, "a history of photographers 
employing their medium to make sense of their society." Trachtenberg focuses 
not on the subject matter in pictures, but rather on "the point of view of the 
photograph itself, the interpretation it allows viewers to make of its 
subject." Insofar as there is a single theme to the book, it is that American 
photography has represented -- often in spite of itself -- the violent economic 
and social upheavals of the hundred years beginning with the emergence of the 
art in 1839 and ending with the publication of Walker Evans' "American 
Photographs" in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Trachtenberg zeros in on five time periods; following the current fad, he calls 
them "moments." The first deals with the era of the daguerreotype and considers 
the portraiture of illustrious Americans and the elitist Roman models of civic 
virtue they convey. The second treats the Civil War, in particular Mathew 
Brady's photographic chronicle. The third takes up post-Civil War photographers 
of the Western natural views that would soon be familiar to tourists (like 
Yosemite and the Rockies). The fourth presents photographers as social 
commentators from the 1880s to World War I. The last concentrates on Walker 
Evans' photos from the 1920s and '30s; these, Trachtenberg says, use 
photography as a political art to present the theme of American anonymity. The 
book moves implicitly from the portraiture of an identifiable ruling elite to 
the anonymity of Evans' vision, reflective of populist transformations in the 
American political and social consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the movement is only implicit points to a failure to knit 
together the discrete chapters. Trachtenberg, a professor of American Studies, 
makes the all-too-common mistake of confusing textual analysis -- "reading" -- 
with historical analysis and understanding. The clutter of critical 
paraphernalia of recent literary fads from Foucault to Barthes detracts from 
the substantial merits of the book and lends an obscurity to the exposition. 
However, when Trachtenberg allows his quest for the meanings of the photographs 
to take him to literary sources he clearly knows well (Hawthorne, Melville, 
Emerson) that his writing is persuasive and exciting. Benjamin Kilborne

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: REPORTED SIGHTINGS: ART CHRONICLES, 1957-1987 BY JOHN 
ASHBERY EDITED BY DAVID BERGMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $35; 417 PP.)

Poet John Ashbery, whose "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" won the Pulitzer 
Prize for Poetry in 1975, is perhaps less well known for his art criticism. The 
best of these essays, written over the course of 30 years and ranging over such 
topics as Dada and Surrealism, the expatriate American art community in Paris, 
the careers of Jackson Pollock, Giorgio de Chirico, Henri Michaux, architecture 
and wallpaper, are collected in this volume. 
</P>
<P>
Ashbery writes as a keen, informed, but disinterested observer. Analyses of 
painterly qualities and habits recombine with personal responses or musings. "A 
painter like (Jackson) Pollock . . . was gambling everything on the fact that 
he was the greatest painter in America, for if he wasn't, he was nothing, and 
the drips would turn out to be random splashes from the brush of a careless 
housepainter." 
</P>
<P>
In his essay about expatriate American artists in Paris ("American Sanctuary in 
Paris") Ashbery writes of "the advantages of isolation" to the creative 
process, and the importance of breaking from tradition to claim an individual 
style. "It is as though (these artists) had given up all efforts at trying to 
please a public, whether French or American, and had gone back to pleasing 
themselves." But it is in his essay on the painter Esteban Vicente that Ashbery 
is at his most original and enlightening. The artist, Ashbery reports, has 
tried "to get rid of brushstrokes, which had begun to seem to him as something 
false . . . (and often) made to substitute for genuine passion and 
inventiveness in painterly abstract painting." Ashbery elucidates this 
sentiment with a recollection of a Mutt and Jeff strip, "in which Jeff went 
into business selling honey with a dead bee in each jar as proof of genuineness 
. . . frantic brushwork is often the dead bee in Abstract Expressionist 
painting." Elena Brunet

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: INTERFERENCE: HOW ORGANIZED CRIME INFLUENCES PROFESSIONAL 
FOOTBALL BY DAN E. MOLDEA (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 436 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Michael Harris, Column edited by Sonja Bolle.

<P>
"Most Americans," Dan E. Moldea says, "view sports as a vehicle of inspiration 
and entertainment" -- and as something to bet on. The estimated 25 million 
people who wager tens of billions of dollars on National Football League games 
each year eagerly accept the NFL's assurances that these games are honest. They 
don't know, or don't care, that the 10% "vigorish" that bookmakers charge on 
losing NFL bets provides the underworld with more illegal gambling income than 
all other sports combined. They prefer to believe that the league has 
rigorously investigated gambling and drug scandals, that team owners are 
sportsmen and that players always give their best. These are myths, Moldea 
says, but "powerful forces in America have built empires around these myths." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is quite different, according to Moldea, a veteran crime reporter 
whose last book was "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob." The NFL 
claims that gamblers have made only two attempts, both unsuccessful, to fix 
games in the league's 60-year history. Instead, Moldea says, as many as 70 
games may have been fixed outright or manipulated to affect the point spread 
set by mob-connected oddsmakers. Even when games are honest, gamblers use their 
close ties to the NFL to gain inside information. Widespread drug use by 
players gives the mob even more leverage. What Moldea calls "the sweetheart 
relationship between the federal government and the NFL" has reduced many a 
promising investigation into the league's dirty secrets to the equivalent of 
three downs and a punt. 
</P>
<P>
"Interference," in contrast, is like a hard-nosed fullback, gracelessly written 
but packed with names, dates and places, hitting the holes until the defense -- 
one's incredulity -- gives way. This is not the first time such accusations 
have been hurled; longtime NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle dismissed a 1983 PBS 
TV expose of the league as "a rehash of press clippings, gossip and rumor." 
Moldea's targets could say the same, but the weight of evidence is 
overwhelming. Moldea, shows, for example, how former Los Angeles Rams owner 
Carroll Rosenbloom partnered mob figures in business throughout his career. He 
was also a heavy gambler who, when he owned the Baltimore Colts, bet $1 million 
on them to win the 1958 NFL championship game with the New York Giants -- a sum 
that puts the recent Pete Rose baseball scandal in perspective. And Rosenbloom, 
Moldea makes clear, was -- and would be today -- just one of the boys. Michael 
Harris

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: THE SOUNDS OF THE JAZZ AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All those lovely images in "The Great Gatsby" came flowing out of my cassette 
player, but what moved me, what made me hit the rewind button, was something 
more ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
A schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Rise from bed, 6 a.m. Dumbbell exercise and wall scaling, 6:15-6:30 a.m. Study 
electricity, etc: 7:15-8:15 a.m. Work, 8:30-4:30 p.m. . . . Practice elocution, 
poise and how to attain it, 5:00-6:00 p.m. . . . Read one improving book or 
magazine per week." 
</P>
<P>
As you may recall, that was the regimen followed by the modestly born Jimmy 
Gatz of North Dakota, who made himself into one of the great inventions of the 
Jazz Age, Jay Gatsby. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in this, F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work, is more poignant than the 
moment when Gatsby's father reveals the self-improvement schedule written on 
the last fly-leaf of a paperback copy of "Hopalong Cassidy." 
</P>
<P>
"The truth was," wrote Fitzgerald, "that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, 
sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God -- a phrase 
which, if it means anything, means just that -- and he must be about His 
Father's business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he 
invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to 
invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end." 
</P>
<P>
And when did Gatsby abandon any chance that he might pull it off? When he 
kissed Daisy Fay on a magical, moonlit night in Louisville, Ky. Here's 
Fitzgerald: "He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his 
unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again 
like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning 
fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch 
she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald biographer Andrew Turnbull writes that the author was counting on 
big sales -- at least 75,000 copies -- for "The Great Gatsby" when it was 
published in April, 1925. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald were well into their lavish life-style and 
were living on the French Riviera partly on the proceeds from the author's 
first two books. 
</P>
<P>
(It was also at this time that Fitzgerald wrote Maxwell Perkins, his editor at 
Scribner's, and urged him to take a look at a young writer named Ernest 
Hemingway. "He's the real thing," wrote Fitzgerald.) 
</P>
<P>
Inexplicably, "The Great Gatsby" sold only 23,000 copies when it came out, and 
Fitzgerald was so discouraged he began laying plans to go to Hollywood and 
write screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
For the critics, though, "Gatsby" represented major growth for Fitzgerald. T. 
S. Eliot wrote the author after reading the new book that ". . . it seems to me 
to be the first step that American fiction has taken since Henry James." 
</P>
<P>
Why there are not more recordings of "The Great Gatsby" is a mystery to me. 
</P>
<P>
The only rental I found is offered by Recorded Books. Luckily, it is read by 
the incomparable Frank Muller, who adopts a tone for the book's narrator, Nick 
Carraway, that perfectly fits Nick's amazement at the outrageous events he 
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly rental for this unabridged 4 1/2-hour recording is $9.50. For those 
building a shelf of recorded classics, the Muller reading can also be purchased 
for $21.95. 
</P>
<P>
If you have wanted to own a reading of a modern classic by the legendary 
Alexander Scourby, there is also that chance here. Scourby, who died in 1985, 
has the rich, cultured voice that Nick Carraway surely would have had in his 
later years. 
</P>
<P>
Listening Library sells the Scourby reading to individuals and libraries for 
$44.95. G. K. Hall sells it to libraries only. In addition to "The Great 
Gatsby," you get five Fitzgerald stories, including "Babylon Revisited" and 
"The Lost Decade."

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTIANA GREGORY, Gregory is the author of Jenny of the Tetons (Harcourt 
Brace Jovanovich) and The Legend of Jimmy Spoon (HBJ), due out next spring. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 50 years ago Hardie Gramatky, an animator with Walt Disney Studios, 
decided to branch out on his own and pen a children's book. The result was 
"Little Toot," the tale of a lovable tugboat's adventure in New York Harbor. 
Since its 1939 publication, scores of youngsters have listened to the story and 
stared at its inviting pages. 
</P>
<P>
When the author died 10 years ago at age 72, he left behind the nearly 
completed manuscript of Little Toot and the Loch Ness Monster (G. W. Putnam's 
Sons: $13.95; 48 pp.; ages 3-6) along with notebooks stuffed with sketches and 
ideas for the end product. His widow, Dorothea Cooke Gramatky -- also an artist 
-- colored several of his black-and-white drawings and fashioned two 
illustrations out of his original artwork. Their daughter, Linda Gramatky 
Smith, finished the text. 
</P>
<P>
The result is clearly a labor of love. Curious as ever, Little Toot ventures 
across the ocean in search of the Loch Ness Monster, a "fierce, awful" 
creature, Grandfather Toot explains. The Scottish loch is crowded with 
"bleeping and blurping" boats, also hunting for Nessie. Finally, as mist rises 
on the water and the cliffs loom overhead, Little Toot meets the legendary 
monster and learns that things are not always as they seem. Toot's courageous 
deed will please children right up to its satisfying end. 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 20th anniversary of another classic, "Very Hungry 
Caterpillar," and, to celebrate, the artist has something new to charm 
youngsters. Eric Carle's Animals Animals (Philomel Books: $18.95; 70 pp.; ages 
4 and up) is a feast of color accompanying 60 poems about creatures from ants 
to yaks. Those familiar with Carle's lumpy "Caterpillar" will immediately 
recognize his tissue paper collages and splashes of acrylics and finger paints. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Whipple gathered the poems, from sources as diverse as Shakespeare and 
the Bible, American Indians and Japanese Haiku, X. J. Kennedy and Judith 
Viorst. Sample "The Octopus" by Ogden Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me, O Octopus, I begs, 
</P>
<P>
Is those things arms or is they 
</P>
<P>
legs? 
</P>
<P>
I marvel at thee, Octopus; 
</P>
<P>
If I were thou, I'd call me Us. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the unspoken ideas behind picture books is that the text and 
illustrations should be able to tell the story independently of the other. A 
Country Far Away (Orchard Books: $12.95; 32 pp.; ages 3-6), written by Nigel 
Gray and illustrated by Philippe Dupasquier, will evoke blank looks in children 
who are only listening, but put those listeners on your lap, spread these pages 
in front of them and oh! What a story. The top half of each page shows a young 
African in his village, the bottom half shows a blond American in his suburban 
neighborhood. Each frame is richly detailed with parallels as well as 
distinctions between the two cultures. "Today it rained" shows the Africans 
joyously holding their hands to the sky as parched crops are watered; the 
Americans, meanwhile, are seen snug in their homes or walking under umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
Amy the Dancing Bear (Doubleday: $12.95; 32 pp.; ages 3-6) is singer/songwriter 
Carly Simon's first book, based on a bedtime tale she told her children when 
they were wee and full of reasons about why they should be allowed to stay up 
later. Amy is a bear full of such excuses. She is charming and sweet, so the 
mother gives in -- again and again. Predictably, Amy outlasts her mom and ends 
up putting her to bed. The illustrations by Margot Datz are lovely, with 
flowered borders and dreamy colors. The worst part is not that the small, 
italicized text causes eye strain, but that the mother is portrayed as being 
weak and indecisive.

Caldecott Medalist Paul Goble tells another delightful fable about the 
trickster named Iktomi (eek-toe-me), which in Lakota Sioux means spider. Native 
Americans love telling on this fellow who, like the spider of folk literature, 
is clever but careless and always showing off. A cautionary tale children are 
sure to understand without help from moralizing parents, Iktomi and the 
Berries: A Plains Indian Story (Orchard Books: $14.95; 32 pp.; ages 4-7) will 
teach children about hunting and berry gathering while its exquisite 
illustrations reveal traditional Indian dress, customs and sense of humor.

With Halloween around the corner, the shelves are heavy with new holiday books: 
tall, thick, silly, serious and wretchedly terrifying. The following are just a 
few of the best. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Sommer-Bodenburg's If You Want to Scare Yourself (Harper &amp; Row: 
$12.95; 106 pp.; ages 7-10), illustrated by Helga Spiess, includes four short, 
shivery stories told to Freddy by his parents while he's confined to bed with 
an infected leg. The pages have easy-to-follow type with excellent ink 
drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Another easy reader is Nate the Great and the Halloween Hunt, written by 
Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and illustrated by Marc Simont (G. P. Putnam's Sons: 
$11.95; 48 pp.; ages 6-9). Nate, the pint-size detective, and his dog Sludge 
are off on a new case: Rosamind's kitten is missing; it's Halloween night; the 
streets are dark, and there's an old haunted house down the block! For those 
who like to burrow with a flashlight under the blankets, this slim book has a 
built-in shiny cover so there'll be no telltale rustlings of a paper one. 
</P>
<P>
The Spooky Eerie Night Noise, written by Mona Rabun Reeves and illustrated by 
Paul Yalowitz (Bradbury Press: $13.95; 32 pp.; ages 3-6), is a pleasant, not 
too spooky or eerie, story for preschoolers. The monster pictures are soft and 
droll, as is the surprise ending.

YOUNG ADULT BOOKS: RED ROVER, RED ROVER BY GEORGE ELLA LYONS (ORCHARD BOOKS: 
$12.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Bottner, Bottner's most recent novel for young adults is Let Me Tell 
You Everything: Memoirs of a Lovesick Intellectual (Harper &amp; Row).

Ah yes, loss and abandonment. Who hasn't experienced them while making their 
way from the nursery to their first job? "Red Rover, Red Rover," by 
award-winning author George Ella Lyons, is the story of Sumi Mitchell, a 
12-year-old who finds that the absence of the people she loves beckons her to 
find a home within herself that she didn't know she possessed. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, Papa Gene's death was the beginning. Not the day he died, but all 
that came after his dying," writes Lyons, simply and movingly. Grief stricken, 
Sumi's mother, temporarily closes her heart. Sumi's brother goes off to prep 
school and the promise of a musical career, thus giving up the stewardship of 
his younger sister's future. Naturally Sumi turns to her best friend, Keezie, 
only to learn that she is moving to another town. 
</P>
<P>
Adolescence is harrowing and unpredictable. We suddenly wake up with large ears 
or unexpected inches or oddly changed voices; our body seems not so much to 
burst out but to outburst. The plot of "Red Rover, Red Rover" in some ways 
mimics this phenomenon: Like growing up it is not neat and comes in spurts. 
There are several themes that seem unrelated. First, there is Sumi's blossoming 
appreciation for reading and music. Second, there is her body: Her mother 
refuses to be candid about menstruation, thus leaving Sumi to feel shame and 
confusion. And because Sumi is overweight she diets, then starves herself. Then 
there is the disturbing fact that her female classmates are hiding their 
intelligence and painting their nails during English class. And finally there 
is the appealing Mrs. Waltz, already an idol, whom Sumi hopes will become a 
friend. Throughout the book there is the theme of letting go of the way the 
family existed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The prose style here is fluid, confident, sometimes lyrical, occasionally 
baffling. We care about Sumi; we want her to find her equilibrium, to lose the 
weight, to understand her womanhood, to find her courage and to admit to her 
grown-up name: Stephanie Ann Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
The story spans the years of 1962-63. Why did the author choose this period, 
then not exploit it? So much of significance happened in the early '60s: Yuri 
Gagarin went into space, the Pill was invented, the Civil Rights movement was 
brewing, the Peace Corps was established and women began to march out of the 
kitchen in order to raise their consciousnesses. The whole country was poised 
at a moment of captivating hopefulness and riveting change. Some of Lyons' 
characters could have easily reflected this altered landscape and thus 
broadened the scope of the book; 12-year-olds are subject to curiosity and 
observation about their environments. 
</P>
<P>
The author is aware of the revolutionary force that music was becoming. Sumi 
receives a Peter, Paul and Mary album from her brother's girlfriend and 
eventually trades in her flute for the thrill of the folk chords that she can 
pluck on the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
For Sumi, this is the year she finds the music of her life; that important 
moment when young people truly understand that they are really on their very 
own journey, distinct from family and school friends, trends and social 
expectations. As Sumi comes to the realization of the preciousness of her own 
mysterious potential, we are glad we took the time to accompany her. 
</P>
<P>
For me, that unforgettable discovery came one autumn, when I was about 12, 
seeing the dazzling brightness of the leaves upon the ground and being startled 
at my own singular consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Sumi is going to be a person. 
</P>
<P>
Unlived Affections (Harper &amp; Row: $12.95), a first novel by children's 
literature critic and lecturer George Shannon, also begins with the death of a 
grandparent. When 17-year-old Willie Ramsey buries his grandmother, he is 
finally able to unlock his deceased mother's bedroom door. Inside it are the 
secrets of his parents, whom he has never known. 
</P>
<P>
It is 1964 and Willie's father Bill is in far off Kentucky, admirably pursuing 
his dream of becoming a master furniture builder. But as Bill's letters to his 
new wife lamentably reveal, along with his passion for carving beautiful cherry 
chairs, he discovers that he is a man who loves men and not women. In the 
nightlong tormenting but necessary confrontation with his past, Willie, a 
dedicated swimmer, discovers why he has been afraid to jump into life's deepest 
waters: to be able to love or trust. 
</P>
<P>
This is a compelling story of a father and son, each finding themselves, and 
the courage it takes to live the truth.

HOSTESS JEAN HOWARD'S PARTY SHOTS CAUGHT HOLLYWOOD OFF GUARD IN A MORE 
GLAMOROUS AGE

THE LOW, SPRAWLING Spanish-style house, hidden by tall hedges along Coldwater 
Canyon, has been the scene of some of Hollywood's most glamorous parties. The 
stars who passed through its doors included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh, 
Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle Oberon, 
Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo and Judy Garland. For more than half 
a century, it has been the home of Jean Howard (above), legendary hostess, 
professional photographer and chronicler of stars at play when Hollywood was 
still a small, close-knit town. She has brought together her experiences in 
"Jean Howard's Hollywood," a book of her photographs from the early 1930s to 
the early '60s to be published by Harry N. Abrams next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of Hollywood as a person," says Howard, seated in her living room, 
which retains the chinoiserie accents and tortoise-shell-paneled pedestals that 
were the trademarks of Hollywood's premier decorator, former silent star 
William Haines. "In the '30s, Hollywood was still sort of a teen-ager and was 
still growing up in the '40s. Hollywood came into its own in the '50s -- really 
achieved its maturity. I call them the Nifty '50s." 
</P>
<P>
Howard, now 78, became a witness to that history when she came to Hollywood 
from Dallas in 1930 to break into movies. She became a Ziegfeld girl and an MGM 
starlet but gave up acting after her marriage to super-agent Charles Feldman in 
1934. Although they were divorced in 1946, she and Feldman remained friends and 
continued to host parties together. In the mid-'40s, Howard studied photography 
at the Art Center in Los Angeles; later, she won assignments from such 
magazines as Life and Vogue to cover films in production and shot portraits of 
such great '50s stars as Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. All the while, Howard 
kept up with her busy international social life as seasoned party-giver and 
party-goer. 
</P>
<P>
While looking at the photographs in Howard's book, it is difficult not to be 
dazzled by the sheer glamour of her celebrated subjects, captured so 
unobtrusively with her camera. She assures you that her friends were as relaxed 
as they seem in the pictures. It's also difficult to ignore two elements that 
date the photographs: the omnipresent cigarettes, and the dress, formal even 
for casual lawn parties. "People dressed reasonably," Howard says. "In those 
days, men always wore jackets and ties in the evening, and the girls wore 
cocktail dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Hollywood parties today are purely for publicity," Howard says, "but 
our parties were purely for fun. They were usually on Saturday night, so you 
had Sunday to get over them. If there were parties on Sunday, they were always 
early, because everybody had to get up on Monday morning and go to work." 
</P>
<P>
Certain parties stand out in Howard's memory. "One of them was a most wonderful 
tea dance George Cukor gave for Vivien Leigh," she says. "It began at 4 
o'clock, and he had found enough good-looking single fellows who could dance, 
and not one woman was left sitting down. The husbands could go off and talk 
business, and we women could dance and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Warner had a party almost every Sunday night, and they were my favorites. 
You would see some rushes and a movie. Jack was the first to have a screen that 
came up from the floor. Jack didn't just show Warners pictures but the best 
movies before they were released, and nobody was allowed to comment during the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles, Howard received a phone 
call from Pat Lawford, John F. Kennedy's sister: "Jean, I'm in a terrible spot. 
Jack suggested I call you. Jack would like to see a lot of people, and we 
haven't enough room." Howard told Lawford that there would be "no problem" and 
hastily assembled 60 members of Hollywood's elite to honor the next President. 
</P>
<P>
"The party ended at around 4 in the morning, and as I was straightening up, I 
heard a scratch on the window. It was Jack. He said that every place was closed 
and asked if I could scramble him some eggs. I did, of course, and we talked 
till dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie was a great friend of Jack's, and later on, we were invited to the 
White House. I think Jack was paying me back for the scrambled eggs. . . . I 
couldn't very well take my camera to the White House, but Jack said, 'Why don't 
you photograph me? After all, I am the President.' " 
</P>
<P>
Howard intended to take the President up on his offer, but history intervened, 
and for her, as for many others, his assassination brought an end to a carefree 
era.

wife of Gary Cooper; actresses Dorothy Dandridge, Merle Oberon and Judy 
Garland. Says Howard: "What I remember best about the party was Richard Burton, 
after a few drinks, kissingeverybody, including Clifton Webb. Personally, I 
don't think Clifton minded that a bit." Atthe time, she recalls, "life was 
getting to be one party after another. It was too much, so I left town for a 
year and a half. When I came back I said, 'God, where is everybody?' " ; Photo,

Billy Wilder gave a party for Marilyn Monroe and everybody in town came. That's 
when Marilyn and Clark Gable met for the first time. There were thousands of 
photographers. My picture of Marilyn and Clark dancing must have been like 
everybody else's -- it was a publicity pose if I ever saw one. But as you can 
see, Clark Gable knew exactly what to do with Marilyn." ; Photo, Below: "This 
was Joseph Cotten's 4th of July party at his home (in Pacific Palisades in 
1955), and that's Jennifer Jones in the pool (center). He (Cotten) had this 
brass band, and it inspired a conga line. Usually a quiet type at parties, 
Jennifer Jones led the guests straight down the garden path to the swimming 
pool, white linen dresses and all. You would never know she had just lost 'Tea 
and Sympathy' to Deborah Kerr." ; Photo, Virginia Zanuck, left, and Gene 
Tierney at Darryl Zanuck's Palm Springs estate, Ric-Su-Dar, in 1946. "Gene came 
over for lunch with Howard Hughes. . . . I believe she must have been pretty 
smitten -- as many others were -- with him at this time." ; Photo, In the late 
'40s, Hollywood's croquet fever touched off what Jean Howard describes as a 
party "that lasted three years." In the midst of the craze, movie-industry 
types were challenged to an East Coast versus West Coast playoff. Joseph 
Cotten, above, was rooting for the West team at Ric-Su-Dar in Palm Springs. At 
left, Cesar Romero, left, and Tyrone Power discuss strategy. Jean Howard

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE WORLD WE CREATED AT HAMILTON HIGH BY GERALD GRANT 
(HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A thoughtful meditation on the problems of secondary education in America 
during the latter 20th Century. The first section of the book, a fictionalized 
history of a composite "typical" high school between 1953 and 1985, reveals the 
effects the shifting mores of those troubled decades had on class structure, 
curriculum, teaching and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Grant's theory of education, which comprises the second half of the 
book, is more problematic. He argues that all education must have "a strong 
positive ethos" (i.e. a moral basis) but fails to resolve the thorny question 
of how to establish that ethos in a pluralistic and increasingly fragmented 
society. His call for community consensus as first step seems naive, if not 
unrealistic, at a time when the decline of the American educational system is 
the subject of widespread debate and controversies rage over teaching 
evolution, sex education, AIDS prevention, the importance of minority cultures 
and instruction in languages other than English.

ENDPAPERS: PRELUDE TO A FOREST JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESTER R. BROWN, Brown is president of Worldwatch Institute. The text above 
is the foreword to A Forest Journey by John Perlin, 1989 by John Perlin, with 
permission of the publisher, W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc., which was reviewed in 
The Times on Sept. 3 with, unfortunately, serious errors. Reviewing from 
incomplete bound proofs, David Graber, having praised the work warmly, faulted 
it for its lack of a summary relating its contents to the present day and for 
its lack of notes. The final, finished book, however, included Brown's 
foreword, in lieu of any other summary, and, more important, included nearly 70 
pages of notes plus a full index. Book Review regrets not checking Graber's 
review against the finished book.

<P>
The destruction of the world's forests is one of the major concerns of our age. 
Each year the world loses about 37 million acres of forests. According to 
United Nations' estimates, nearly 40% of Central America's forests were 
destroyed between 1950 and 1980. During the same period, Africa lost 23% of its 
forests and the Himalayan watershed 40%. 
</P>
<P>
The problems associated with deforestation include depletion of firewood 
supplies (still the primary source of energy for 2 billion people, or 
three-quarters of the population of the developing world), severe flooding, 
accelerated loss of soil, encroaching deserts, and declining soil productivity. 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the developing world these problems have assumed disastrous 
proportions. Fuel wood shortages plague 57 developing countries, adversely 
affecting more than a billion people. Torrents from monsoons pouring down 
deforested Himalayan slopes kill thousands in India and Bangladesh every year. 
Denuded Nepal's biggest export is its soil, which falls into rivers at an 
alarming rate and ends up in the Indian Ocean. Many scientists suspect that the 
spread of the Sahara Desert and the resulting famine in countries of western 
Africa have been brought about, at least partially, by deforestation. A further 
consequence of rapid deforestation can be seen in Haiti, where a continual 
decrease in the amount of arable land has resulted in smaller harvests even as 
the population grows -- no doubt a prescription for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The worst has yet to come. If the current rate of deforestation continues 
unabated, much of the world's remaining tropical forests will disappear by the 
year 2000, and with them, many of the Earth's plants and animals. The loss of 
these forests will create an energy crisis for 2 billion human beings who will 
lack sufficient quantities of wood with which to cook their meals and heat 
their dwellings. In their desperate search for fuel, they will destroy more 
distant forests, thereby accelerating erosion, climatological changes, and 
desertification, and possibly bringing about widespread famine. 
</P>
<P>
People living in the developed world face an equally catastrophic future if 
worldwide deforestation continues. New research suggests that the loss of 
forests exacerbates the greenhouse effect, which is caused by carbon dioxide, 
emitted by burning fossil fuels, building up in the atmosphere and retaining 
solar heat that would otherwise escape, resulting in global warming. Leaves of 
trees, on the other hand, absorb carbon dioxide, removing it from the 
atmosphere. Adapting to such global climatic changes will prove costly, 
especially for the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is 
predicted that drying trends will severely cut crop yields. Furthermore, the 
cure for dreaded diseases such as AIDS and cancer may reside in some plant as 
yet undiscovered that grows in the rain forest -- if destroyed, humankind will 
be forever denied such help. 
</P>
<P>
The future state of the world's forests, especially our tropical forests, seems 
so bleak that one commentator rues, "There appears to be no way civilization 
and rain forest can share space; the former devastates the latter." John 
Perlin's new book, "A Forest Journey: From Mesopotamia to North America" (W. W. 
Norton: $19.95) shows us that we can delete the word rain and this statement 
rings true whenever and wherever civilizations have risen and flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the present assault on our forests, as Perlin chronicles so ably, is 
part of the same cycle begun thousands of years ago. Every Old World starts out 
as virgin land attractive to human settlement. Subsequent exploitation by 
humans wears out the land, forcing them to move on to their next "New World." 
This quest for new frontiers, which many have thought peculiar to the American 
experience, is but a repetition of an age-old process that has occurred again 
and again in the course of time, beginning in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years 
ago and continuing today. But "A Forest Journey" does not merely prophesy 
disaster. It also presents hope: that we can learn from past mistakes and break 
out of the cycle of deforestation and land degradation that undermined earlier 
civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
"A Forest Journey" is more than just a chronicle of devastation. It describes 
the movement of Western civilization in a most unique and fascinating manner. 
The book takes one resource, wood, the principal building material and fuel of 
past societies, as its starting point, showing how wood served past societies 
and demonstrating its influence on their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Perlin shows, for example, that the urgent need to find new sources of wood has 
been an important cause -- insufficiently noted -- of large population 
movements throughout history. England's attraction to North America during the 
17th and 18th centuries was in great part due to the paucity of its own timber 
supply and an awareness of the great store of trees in the New World. Similarly 
motivated colonization movements had already occurred in more ancient times. 
One of the chief reasons the Romans colonized Gaul and Spain was to take 
advantage of the abundant forests they could use to fuel mining operations and 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcities of wood also have triggered major technological changes and 
advances. Insufficient quantities of fuel forced Late Bronze Age metallurgists 
on the island of Cyprus to develop many ingenious methods of conserving energy: 
For instance, they recycled scrap bronze to reduce their consumption of wood. 
Eventually, acute shortages of wood impelled these metalworkers to manually 
remove iron from copper slag, resulting in an important human step, our entry 
into the Iron Age. Wood shortages in ancient Greece and Rome taught architects 
to exploit solar energy. Thousands of years later, the scarcity of timber 
forced the English to enter the fossil fuel era, substituting coal for wood as 
the principal fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Wood scarcities have forced governments to take an active role in the 
allocation and protection of this precious resource. Hammurabi, the great 
codifier of laws in Babylon, saw to it that government officials regulated the 
felling of timber and the distribution of its end products so as to put a stop 
to the profligate use of wood by his subjects. Authorities on wood-less Delos 
in Hellenistic times monitored the sale of imported firewood and charcoal, 
believing that the distribution of such valuable sources of energy should not 
be controlled by a few powerful fuel merchants, who otherwise would have had 
consumers at their mercy. To ensure the availability of sufficient quantities 
of firewood for those living in Rome, the government commissioned an entire 
fleet of ships for the sole purpose of gathering wood from the dense forests of 
France, Spain, and North Africa. The Venetian Senate of the 15th and 16th 
centuries passed a number of laws aimed at protecting its dwindling forests, as 
did the English Parliament of the 16th and 17th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1900 BC Crete was merely another island in the Aegean, until its rich 
forests attracted traders from the deforested area of Mesopotamia. The commerce 
in wood between Crete and the Near East injected such wealth into the economy 
that Crete was transformed swiftly into one of the region's most powerful 
states. Likewise, Macedonia, an insignificant backwater country on the fringes 
of the Greek world, became the immensely rich and influential power of the 
Mediterranean after the Greeks had exhausted their own supplies of wood and had 
come to depend on Macedonia's forests for fuel and building material. The 
Macedonians soon translated their wealth into political and military power, 
resulting in the conquest of nearly the entire known world by their king, 
Alexander the Great. Millennia later America's untouched forests laid the 
foundation for its allure as the land of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, lack of wood has brought about the economic and social decline of 
civilizations when alternative wood sources could not be found. Once the 
Classical Greek states lost their hold on accessible supplies of timber, they 
became subservient to wood-rich Macedonia. England, by contrast, forestalled 
decline by developing its coal resources. 
</P>
<P>
The causes and objectives of many wars and revolutions become clearer when we 
take the presence or absence of wood supplies into account. The Athenian Empire 
and the Peloponnesian League fought for possession of northern Greece and 
Sicily's forests. Conflict over rights to timber between the American colonists 
and Great Britain helped lead to revolution. England reserved America's best 
stands of trees for its navy while the Americans wanted the freedom to cut down 
whatever woods they wished. Without its wood resources, America's bid for 
independence would surely have failed. All of America's ships were built 
locally and there was an abundance of charcoal to produce iron for weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
Ecologically concerned voices are loudest and most heeded when important 
resources such as wood appear to be on the verge of depletion. Plato vividly 
warned the Athenians in the Critias of the consequences of deforestation. Cato 
taught the Romans the best ways to husband their scarce wood supplies. Many 
years later, John Evelyn campaigned to save the few remaining forests in Stuart 
England, writing his famous conservation tract, "Sylva." The destruction of 
America's great Eastern forests served as the stimulus for the development of 
American ecological concern. 
</P>
<P>
Deforestation throughout history has left soil at the mercy of the erosive 
forces of nature. Formerly productive lands turned into sterile, 
drought-plagued regions. Famine ensued, bringing down powerful and prosperous 
societies. Stripped of its forest cover, the magnificent civilization of 
Knossos declined. Such a change in vegetation and soil conditions assured that 
this region would never again support the population or enjoy times as 
prosperous as it had in its "Golden Age" when Cretan power held sway over much 
of the eastern Mediterranean. The loss of soil on deforested hillsides also 
caused a sharp decline in agricultural production in the great Mycenaean 
Kingdoms of Bronze Age Greece, resulting in reduced crop yields, 
impoverishment, and depopulation of the area. Rome, too, came to depend on 
others for food when its farmlands were cleared on the tree cover that had 
nourished the soil for ages. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout "A Forest Journey" we see a similar process repeated time and time 
again. Blessed by easy access to forests and rich soil, a society develops 
materially and people grow confident that nature will always provide for their 
needs. Prosperity and population invariably increase for a time. The faster an 
area develops demographically and economically, the greater are its demands on 
the remaining forest and agricultural lands. To ensure the continued flow of 
adequate amounts of wood and food, societies rely on colonization, diplomacy, 
and military ventures. Ultimately, however, the attempt to maintain high 
economic and population growth over time, in the face of dwindling resources, 
results in decline. Substitute wood for oil in today's world and the parallel 
becomes sobering. 
</P>
<P>
These are just glimpses of what's in store for the reader of "A Forest 
Journey." Each page is replete with valuable information on the important role 
that wood played through the ages -- its influence on the development and 
decline of societies through judicious use or depletion of this valuable 
resource. The book is a treasure trove of knowledge. In my opinion, "A Forest 
Journey" is destined to become a classic and stand alongside such important 
works as George P. Marsh's "Man and Nature" and Ken Butti and John Perlin's "A 
Golden Thread." What's more, "A Forest Journey" makes great reading.

JUSTICE PREVAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As you rightly state in "Justice Prevails," by Philip Hager (Aug. 13), the 
removal of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, Justice Joseph R. Grodin and 
Justice Cruz Reynoso from the state Supreme Court in 1986 was caused by a 
well-financed campaign led by Gov. Deukmejian and supported by reactionaries 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
Almost three years have gone by since that election, and the state Supreme 
Court with its conservative majority has not allowed one execution. We have 
lost three outstanding justices because the people of this state were duped by 
falsehoods and distortions. Executions were not the issue for the governor and 
his followers. The three jurists just were too liberal.

Whereas "Poison Is My Profession," by Gene Stone (Aug. 6), indicates that only 
six toxicologists practice in Los Angeles, this figure surely applies only to 
medical doctors specializing in poisons and not to toxicologists in general. 
The California Assn. of Toxicologists, for example, has more than 100 members 
in the Los Angeles area alone and includes forensic, clinical, environmental, 
analytical and genetic toxicologists. We've had a hard enough time being 
understood since "Quincy" introduced our field to TV viewers; we would welcome 
not being written nearly out of existence.

It is curious that no ophthalmologists or ear, nose and throat surgeons were 
quoted, even though many of these well-trained surgeons perform cosmetic 
surgery competently and with excellent results. What we really have here is a 
turf war, with the plastic surgeons attempting to create a monopoly for 
themselves by legislating away their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
As an internist, I have no ax to grind with either group, but I do want 
patients to be free to choose whichever type of cosmetic surgeon meets their

I read with interest the Looks column "Risky Business," by Paddy Calistro (Aug. 
13), about in-office surgery. As an anesthesia provider in Beverly Hills and 
West Los Angeles for a number of plastic surgeons, I am in full agreement that 
some less-than-optimal office surgi-centers exist. 
</P>
<P>
Although many procedures can be performed using only local anesthetics, longer 
and more involved procedures require heavy sedation or general anesthesia. Only 
a trained anesthesia provider can do this safely. Your article ignored the fact 
that a number of these procedures are now performed, using potent sedatives 
and/or anesthetic drugs, by untrained hands.

ANTI-SAVINGS POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan's column ("Rise in Savings For Retirement Not A Fluke," Aug. 20) 
quite rightly suggests that it is despite, not because of, our anti-savings tax 
laws that our citizens are sacrificing more to save more for a more serene and 
sooner retirement. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone benefits from a higher savings rate, as proven by juggernaut 
Japan. Their tax laws encourage, not discourage, individual savings. That's the 
capital that is fueling their impressive growth. 
</P>
<P>
Short-sighted beyond belief was the provision in the 1986 tax reform act that 
cut back on the already minimal $2,000 IRA instead of increasing it two-, 
three-, or four-fold. Why? The pursuit of short-term tax dollars, and never 
mind the deleterious long-term effects on economic and individual entities. 
</P>
<P>
Why not learn from the Japanese that capital (savings) is a capital idea -- in 
progressive capitols?

ANTI-SAVINGS POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning James Flanigan's column in August, as a baby boomer, I'm not going 
to rely on Social Security just because the government says it's "safe." That's 
like letting a drunk drive you home, just because he promises he will deliver 
you home "safely." 
</P>
<P>
Once you realize that the so-called cash reserves are really just paper, you 
won't feel so secure. Here's how the government "invests" the Social Security 
surplus. They just give this extra money to other government agencies that need 
it. That agency then issues Social Security a bond (really an IOU). 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the buildup of the Social Security "cash" reserves is really just a 
buildup of the national debt. The money isn't in a bank account, waiting to be 
withdrawn. When the baby boomers retire, the national debt must be converted to 
cash to pay benefits. How will this happen? Either the government must develop 
a surplus in other areas,or it must put a tremendous tax burden on our 
children. Both of these aren't very likely. Most likely, Social Security will 
cut our benefits. 
</P>
<P>
I'm relying on my own savings for retirement.

CHINA'S PROFOUND INSTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Edward A. Gargan, Edward A. Gargan, the New York Times bureau chief in 
Beijing from 1986 through 1988, is now the Edward R. Murrow Fellow at the 
Council on Foreign Relations.

<P>
In a 1980 interview with the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, Deng Xiaoping 
observed, "For a leader to pick his own successor is a feudal practice. It is 
an illustration of the imperfections in our institutions." Deng was referring 
to the series of attempts by Mao Tse-tung to anoint the man who would follow 
him as China's supreme leader. For more than a month now, Communist Party 
members in Beijing have been whispering about Deng's own efforts in that 
direction -- his latest choice to be pre-eminent among the next generation of 
leaders is the innocuous party chief Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
As China staggers toward Oct. 1, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the 
People's Republic, it remains riven by a political instability so profound that 
it is impossible to assay the country's future with any confidence. Devoid of 
any institutional strengths, China's polity remains as bound to the whims of 
one man as it did on Oct. 1, 1949 -- when Mao stood atop the Gate of Heavenly 
Peace and proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic. Where Mao 
never interested himself in creating a party or government structure that could 
endure in his wake, Deng has tried but failed. Leadership succession, a litmus 
test of political stability, has eluded China. 
</P>
<P>
China's first president, Liu Shaoqi, was the first of those formally designated 
to succeed to paramount power. Liu traced his friendship with Mao to 1932 and 
the early guerrilla wars. By 1945, Liu was regarded as second only to Mao -- 
and often acted in Mao's stead. Through the 1950s, Liu exercised sweeping 
influence over domestic policy and, in 1958, when Mao announced he intended to 
retire from daily affairs, Liu was named chairman of the People's Republic. The 
People's Daily, the official party organ, began describing Liu as Mao's 
"closest comrade-in-arms." In 1961, Mao told the Sunday Times that Liu would 
inherit the mantle of supreme leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Mao spoke too soon. Five years later, when the ideological tidal wave of the 
Cultural Revolution crashed over China, Liu was swept into political oblivion 
as the country's "No. 1 capitalist roader." He was hounded from his home by 
Mao's minions, imprisoned and, in 1969, died on the concrete floor of a prison 
cell, lying in his own excrement. By then, however, Mao had found a new 
"closest comrade-in-arms," Lin Biao, the minister of defense. Lin, a brilliant 
general during the 1940s guerrilla campaigns, enthusiastically embraced the 
Cultural Revolution and Mao's call for attacks on the party Establishment. Mao, 
for his part, declared Lin the new prince-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Lin, slavish in his public adulation of Mao, fanned the political hysteria of 
those years. Then he disappeared from view in September, 1971. The story that 
emerged from China months later was he had betrayed Mao and, after his attempt 
to seize power had failed, he fled to the Soviet Union, his plane crashing in 
Mongolia. Another version had him gunned down by Mao's guards in a wooded 
compound west of the capital. In any case, Mao again remained without a 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
Not until he was on his deathbed, in 1976, did Mao try again. This time he 
supposedly told an obscure party official from Hunan, Hua Guofeng, "With you in 
charge, I am at ease." This blessing was intended, so Hua proclaimed, to confer 
ultimate power. He became chairman of the party. With Mao's death however, Hua 
lost his principal supporter, and a coalition of senior party officials, who 
had been purged during the Cultural Revolution, soon wrested power from the 
hapless Hua. The coalition was led by Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, Deng had established his authority over the party and began the 
process of rebuilding a Communist Party shattered by a decade of factional 
conflict and ideological tyranny. Already well into his 70s, Deng busied 
himself with laying the groundwork for a stable transition to the next 
generation. He turned to Zhao Ziyang -- an accomplished official from Sichuan 
Province who had revitalized the critical agricultural sector -- to head the 
government as prime minister. To lead the party, a demoralized institution 
floundering for direction, he chose Hu Yaobang, a peppery, witty and irreverent 
Hunanese. These men, Deng declared, would supervise the restructuring of 
China's economic and political life and permit the generation of revolutionary 
leaders, led by Deng himself, to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's carefully woven succession began unraveling as the decade wore on and 
the implications of profound economic change began to threaten the older 
generation's political orthodoxy. The country's intelligentsia, exposed to the 
world beyond China and freed to begin thinking and working on their own terms, 
became restless under the shackles of ideological orthodoxy. In December, 1986, 
university students marched through more than two dozen Chinese cities, 
demanding greater freedom of expression and more democratic political 
institutions. Deng responded angrily and swiftly. He dismissed Hu Yaobang and 
installed Zhao in his place, ordering in the meantime a reassertion of 
ideological conformity. Deng, pressured by his octogenarian contemporaries who 
feared an erosion of China's socialist soul, appointed Li Peng, a 
Moscow-trained engineer suspicious of many of Deng's economic reforms, as prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
But change swept across China. After Hu's sudden death in April, China's 
students and intellectuals again took to the streets, this time in numbers 
vastly greater than two years earlier. At times, more than a million Beijing 
citizens clogged the capital's streets, demanding basic civil rights, freedom 
of expression, a more democratic political order, an end to the party's 
monopoly of power, an end to the pervasive corruption that gripped the 
bureaucracy. Deng reacted savagely, ordering tanks and troops to crush the 
protests. Thousands were massacred in the process of retaking Beijing from its 
own citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Deng turned on his chosen successor. Zhao Ziyang was stripped of his 
post and placed under house arrest. His closest aides and advisers were 
arrested or purged. Each week that passes, still more of Zhao's proteges are 
being dismissed from posts as provincial governors, economic advisers, party 
secretaries. For counsel, Deng again relied on the aged coterie of retired 
party leaders who now exercise control of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a vacuum within the next generation of leadership -- apart from Li 
Peng, a man detested throughout China -- Deng plucked the inoffensive, if 
incompetent, party secretary of Shanghai, Jiang Zemin, to lead the 
47-million-member Communist Party. Before becoming Shanghai party chief, Jiang 
had been the mayor, but was replaced because of his inability to rejuvenate the 
city's stagnant economy or surmount the sclerotic municipal bureaucracy. But 
Jiang exhibited one trait that appealed to Deng. During both the 1986 student 
protests and the much larger demonstrations this spring, Jiang led the swift 
suppression of the movements. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Jiang arrived in Beijing, Deng gathered the party leadership to 
inform them the new leader would wield dominant authority. "We must consciously 
defend the core, which is none other than Comrade Jiang Zemin, everyone's 
comrade," one version of Deng's remarks goes. Reports from Beijing suggest some 
quiet disbelief at Deng's statements. Jiang, despite his formal ascension to 
the party's highest post, has no power base and is viewed as a man whose 
devotion to conventional political orthodoxy meshes comfortably with his 
unimaginative approach to economic change. But most of all, it is whispered in 
Beijing, Jiang's anointing will be no more secure than that of his numerous 
predecessors.

<P>
The Bush Administration's calculated decision to meet three of America's 
greatest problems -- education, crime and drug use -- with spending commitments 
worthy of Ebenezer Scrooge may be the start of the new political wars of the 
1990s. Democrats and Republicans must now move on to the central debate: Are 
America's social dilemmas largely the result of liberal sociology and its 
erosion of personal responsibility, or have skinflint conservative economics 
taken over blame? 
</P>
<P>
Although the GOP starts with the edge, there are too many valid points on both 
sides for an easy victory. Just as the Democrats won't easily break free of 
their permissive, spendthrift past, it's hard to see the GOP ducking its image 
of being more interested in low millionaire tax brackets than child poverty. 
And it's also tricky for Republicans to credibly demand "reform" after two 
decades of White House control. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the stakes could hardly be higher. By 1992, if voters still perceive 
liberal sociology as America's cultural weakness, and demand toughness and 
tradition as the remedy, the continuing crisis will be tantamount to "Reelect 
George Bush" advertising. However, if the public decides that streets are 
unsafe and children's opportunities are collapsing because the Republican 
Administration won't raise taxes that might interfere with Palm Beach yacht 
owners or Wall Street megadealers, then the nation's plight will become a 
Democratic call to arms. 
</P>
<P>
Recent history is with the Republicans, however -- because refusal to commit 
more than modest new program funds in education, crime and drug abuse extends a 
proved GOP fiscal and electoral strategy. Toughness and values -- an end to 
permissiveness, a return to basics in education, plus harsher sentences and 
penalties -- have been carrying the day politically since the rise of Ronald 
Reagan, George C. Wallace and Richard M. Nixon in 1966-68. Voters have 
repeatedly responded to the conservative case. Weekend furloughs for 
first-degree murderers and marijuana legalization proposals -- all liberal 
conceptual flaws and political embarrassments -- still nurture skepticism of 
liberalism's capacity for hard-boiled cultural solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, then, not only have good reasons to oppose spending as a solution 
-- better to keep values and toughness pre-eminent -- but they also have 
Machiavellian reasons not to worry about the need for success. On the contrary, 
the greater the decay of education or breakdown of society or fear of drugs, 
the more likely the electorate is to embrace conservative arguments for 
additional authority to impose traditional values -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, for example, Ira Glasser, executive director of the 
American Civil Liberties Union, attacked Bush's just-released drug program as 
"a joke -- a hoax on the public," in part because of "its utter disregard for 
the ever-worsening conditions in our nation's inner cities." Yet within a few 
days, opinion polls began showing the public's very different assessment: White 
House proposals didn't crack down hard enough. Huge majorities favored quick 
searches and other new police measures -- one poll even found a 62% majority 
saying they would give up "a few of the freedoms we have in this country" to 
reduce drug use. If anything, the GOP's political ability to scoff at the ACLU 
is even greater now, with this intensified public drug concern, than during the 
1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Another great irony is also relevant -- the contrast between abstract public 
support for higher federal outlays to deal with problems ranging from education 
and housing to health and drug use, and the electorate's simultaneous 
skepticism of Democratic proposals for doing exactly this. Not only has a 
20-year reputation for wasting taxpayers' money, coupled with naive sociology, 
given liberalism a profound credibility problem, but it has also armored 
Republicans against Democratic attacks on the GOP's reluctance to spend. 
</P>
<P>
These perceptions, however, may be about to change. Despite their reputation, 
Democrats haven't been all that spend-crazed recently, while high support for 
more spending in specific areas partly reflects the public's awareness of how 
much federal "human resources" outlays have been curbed during the 1980s. 
Moreover, programs for the low-income groups prominent in today's depressing 
crime, education and drug-abuse statistics have been notable casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the larger change would lie less in new public affection for the Democrats 
-- or new middle-class empathy with the underprivileged -- than in three 
growing doubts about GOP economic priorities. 
</P>
<P>
First, by the time Bush's term is up in January, 1993, the Republicans will 
have held the White House for 20 of the last 24 years. Because problems with 
education, crime and drugs have intensified during this period, one can wonder 
how much longer voters will let Republicans blame liberal "values" or softness. 
Besides, the economic polarization of the 1980s, with a 3%-5% of national 
income shifting from the bottom half of Americans to the top 1%, has become a 
factor in the lower groups' disarray. 
</P>
<P>
Second, GOP refusal to propose significant new outlays in response to such 
problems as crime, drugs and education -- new spending in Bush's 1989 education 
program is less than Michael Milken's bail bond -- is as much a matter of 
economic priorities as values. Camouflaging chintziness with values, after all, 
not only puts the Democrats on the cultural defensive, but gives the 
Republicans a philosophic framework for maintaining emphasis on the 
marketplace, a minimal role for government, low taxes on the wealthy and the 
resultant capital formation and investment. This priority may have been correct 
back in 1980, when incentive economics were still missing in Washington, but it 
may be less valid today. 
</P>
<P>
And third, the GOP's insistence on keeping low tax brackets rather than raising 
money to deal with acknowledged national problems has an upper-income bias that 
class-conscious Democratic politicians seem to be fingering with mounting 
enthusiasm. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said recently, "It doesn't take a 
genius, just a school parent or someone who lives in an unsafe neighborhood, to 
realize that billions of dollars that might be used for falling bridges and the 
drug war will end up in minks and Jaguars when the top rate drops to 28%." 
Similarly, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that more Democratic 
politicians are going to be talking about the GOP's refusal to spend money on 
crime, drug control and education so they can keep the under-taxed rich in 
penthouses and private schools. Where Cuomo trod carefully, others will tread 
demagogically. 
</P>
<P>
This, then, is where the battle over solving national crises with unfunded 
government must lead -- into what could be the decisive political and 
philosophic fight of the early '90s. If conservative cultural macho and 
Scrooge-like fiscal policy are no longer the answer, America's political mood 
could change. But if today's mood continues, then officers of the ACLU may want 
to check their passports.

SELF-DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I congratulate Claudia Luther ("When a Terrible Dream Becomes a Terrible 
Reality, Raw Instinct Takes Over," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 13) on being able to 
scream. Now, how about doing something more effective than relying on others to 
come to her aid, such as taking a women's self-defense class? Classes are 
usually low cost and can be taken in the evenings or on the weekends. For a 
woman to think she can defend herself merely by screaming is ludicrous, which 
is why I took a defense class. 
</P>
<P>
Women should not be expected to trust only a scream to suffice, and Ms. 
Luther's column, while heartening, stops short of reality.

What's all the uproar over Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial? Get a clue, folks. Do you 
really think she deserves the credit for making a mockery of our legal system? 
In America everyone is entitled to a trial by jury. With legal fees at $400 an 
hour (Part I, Sept. 18), this is a system only the rich can afford. So what's 
the fuss? We are supporting this show, and I for one am delighted to be getting 
something back for my entertainment dollar.

Following your excellent coverage of the events taking place in Eastern Europe, 
especially the escape of the hundreds or thousands of young East Germans from 
Hungary to the West, I am reliving the moments of joy and euphoria that I felt 
when I escaped from Hungary to Austria with my brother during the night of Nov. 
24, 1956. It is an indescribable feeling that can only be compared to giving 
birth to a child. 
</P>
<P>
I am very proud of Hungary and would like to thank Austria for helping the 
refugees of Eastern Europe all these years.

If Southern Californians think that bottled water tastes great compared with 
tap water, that is fine. If they believe there is more safety in drinking 
bottled water than water from their public system, they may be allowing 
themselves to get ripped off. After all, one water official notes that a gallon 
of bottled water costs more than a gallon of gasoline, even though much of the 
bottled variety came directly from the tap in the first place and was much less 
costly than gasoline to refine. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
indicated that more than half the city agency's customers buy bottled water for 
drinking and other consumption uses at a cost averaging $14.40 a month, in 
addition to their DWP bills. Nineteen percent run their city tap water through 
special filters installed in home before they drink it. Some do both. The study 
showed that 54% of those who have bottled or filtered water buy it for better 
taste. But 40% do so for safety reasons. And of all the bottled water marketed 
in the nation, an astounding 36% is sold in California. 
</P>
<P>
The point must be made clearly: Water distributed by Los Angeles is safe. It 
meets all federal and state health standards. So does water wholesaled by the 
Metropolitan Water District to an area of 14 million Southern California 
residents. Sometimes tap water is cloudy, but only because of air, not because 
of impurities or contaminants. In a taste test conducted a couple years ago, 
blindfolded experts often picked Los Angeles city water over bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
To many, bottled water tastes better, but paying 800 times the cost of public 
supply water does not necessarily buy any safety.

In view of the discussions currently taking place over the dollar amount to be 
given to Poland, and the statement by Lech Walesa that Poland does not want the 
entire sum in dollars, but would like to see foreign businesses invest in his 
country, it occurs to me that there is an enormous untapped source of private 
funds in this country. I refer to those people of Polish background who send 
money to relatives in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that emergency legislation be passed enabling such donations to be 
deducted from one's income tax as a legitimate expense. It is difficult enough 
to support one's own family in this country but to support one's relatives in 
Poland, as many do, is a double burden.

SO, WHAT ABOUT CHILD CARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are a variety of explanations for why comprehensive child-care 
legislation has stalled in the House of Representatives. Some say that it is an 
honest difference in political philosophy over the best way to ensure funding 
for child-care programs; other say that it is another example of the 
congressional turf battles that have killed too many worthwhile proposals in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
We suspect the holdup can be attributed to a little of each. But philosophy and 
egos aside, there will be no valid excuses if the House fails to agree on a 
coherent way to help the nation's parents deal with the demands of providing 
their children with decent care while they are working. 
</P>
<P>
At present there are two competing proposals, one from the House Education and 
Labor Committee sponsored by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) and 
another from the House Ways and Means Committee by Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.). 
The Downey proposal is a block grant/tax credit plan, while the Hawkins bill 
would create a new, specific funding mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
Many child-care activists who advocate the Hawkins bill say the Downey bill 
does not provide enough money; they worry about the degree of commitment the 
Ways and Means Committee has to tough standards that should be set for those 
who provide care for infants, toddlers and children. 
</P>
<P>
Those who support the Downey bill say that there is a strong commitment to high 
standards in the legislation and that their bill is the only one that would 
provide guaranteed, ongoing funding, because child care services would be 
financed through an existing grant program. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are a range of services that both sides agree deserve federal support 
-- such as early childhood development and after-school programs and expansion 
of the respected Head Start program -- plus basic child care. Nearly 60% of all 
women with children younger than 6 years are now in the work force. By 1995, 
two-thirds will be employed. As the Children's Defense Fund reports, the image 
of a full-time mother with a spouse who brings home enough money for the family 
represents 1 in 14 American families today. 
</P>
<P>
The committees' failure to quickly reach a compromise could mean a potentially 
devastating setback for a comprehensive child-care program. And the continued 
indecisiveness opens the door for window-dressing legislation that accomplishes 
little, such as a tax-credit-only proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders in the House need to remember that only the children will suffer if 
substance takes a back seat to form.

On Sept. 14, President Bush doubled Polish food aid to over $100 million this 
year. This is in addition to the tens of millions of dollars the United States 
has already paid or committed to Poland. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman 
of the Agricultural Committee, wants the President to do even more, including 
forgiveness of the over $2 billion in agricultural debt already owed to us 
(Part I, Sept. 15). Not to be partisan, Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.), just 
returned from Poland, relays to us the immediate need now for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's see, we're doing all of this to support the new government in Poland, 
a Marxist state in the best tradition. The new government has absolutely no 
hope of becoming democratic. Meanwhile, back in this hemisphere, we have a 
semi-democratic state in Central America, whose people want to be democratic, 
but whose government is controlled by a dictator, and turning quickly Marxist. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that when the American leaders lack the guts, and the people the 
insight, people in our own back yard who need our help and support suffer? Why 
are we aiding a Marxist state, leaning democratic, and shutting off support to 
a democratic state, leaning Marxist? Isn't it easier to prevent things than to 
change things? Is there anybody sane out there?

ERMA BOMBECK: FOOT SOLDIERS IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's frustrating to declare a war and have no one show up for it. That's what 
has been happening in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the pride and the spirit of our young people marching off to battle to 
conquer the enemy. We can't even get their attention. We have begged the "Yes" 
generation to form the battle cry "No!" We have threatened them with horror 
pictures of an egg frying in a skillet with the explanation, "This is your 
brain on drugs." We have flashed their friends, their sports heroes and their 
rock legends on the 10 o'clock news as they shielded their eyes from the shame 
of their addiction. They still consider it a big joke. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know anymore what it would take to make just one child think twice 
about trying drugs, but I'm going to give it a shot: 
</P>
<P>
A little over two years ago, I gathered a bunch of kids around me and put their 
stories between the covers of a new book due out this week called, "I Want to 
Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to Boise." The title doesn't mean a 
lot unless you know that these are the three wishes of a 9-year-old girl in 
Washington state who is recovering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
All the kids in the book are recovering from cancer. You want to talk drugs? 
You're a civilian when it comes to their expertise. For more than 30 years they 
have been in the front lines of cancer research trying out every experimental 
drug that comes down the pike to see if it kills or cures. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the kids are so little they can't pronounce or spell the drug 
they are taking, they're like a walking drug store. What do these "goodies" do 
for them? Sometimes a drug curls feet and hands into positions that could be 
temporary or not. Others cause hair to fall out. Some create mood swings and 
sores in the mouth and down the esophagus. A few of the drugs render muscles 
useless and the users must have a wheelchair. Many have a genetic impact. Some 
drugs blow them up like an inflatable beach ball. Others make them lose weight 
and they become so weak they can barely hold on. 
</P>
<P>
If I sound angry, count on it. You bet I'm sore. I'm angry because in a society 
where the drop-out rate from school is a national epidemic, I met a girl 
desperate to finish high school. In a world where people have every right and 
hope of becoming 70 or 80 years old, a little boy is fighting to be 8. Peer 
pressure, you say? You want to know what peer pressure is? It's a bald-headed 
12-year-old girl at her first school dance! 
</P>
<P>
One young man in remission said he tells his friends who do drugs, "You want to 
do drugs? Do chemotherapy for a year. It'll make you feel just as lousy." 
</P>
<P>
These kids don't have a choice. You do.

ROGER SIMON: HIS BIRD IN THE HAND DIDN'T WIN VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is good news from the Murder Capital of America. 
</P>
<P>
No, the crime rate has not gone down. 
</P>
<P>
No, drug use has not been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
No, it is no safer to walk the streets of Washington, D.C., now than it ever 
was. 
</P>
<P>
But, yes, Washington Mayor Marion Barry has apologized for flipping the bird in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
If you are unfamiliar with this particular piece of American vernacular, 
flipping the bird is what some call the "Single Finger Salute" and what others 
call the "Big Pink Flamingo." 
</P>
<P>
It is also known by the more generic "rude gesture." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Mayor Barry attended a street festival in Washington where he was 
greeted in the usual way: He was jeered, heckled, booed and given many Pink 
Flamingoes. 
</P>
<P>
But Barry responded by flipping the bird back at the crowd. (I believe this is 
called a "re-bird.") Many people were shocked and said this was beneath the 
dignity of an American mayor. 
</P>
<P>
I disagree. I think there is nothing beneath the dignity of an American mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is a trifle tense these days, which may explain his behavior. He is 
running for re-election while also under investigation for alleged drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign motto I have suggested for him -- "Vote for Me While I'm Still 
Free!" -- has met with no response as of yet from the mayor's office. But he is 
probably too busy making rude gestures in public. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Barry made the gesture, local TV stations in Washington were in a 
quandary. If they broadcast the mayor's gesture, weren't they just as guilty as 
he? 
</P>
<P>
So big meetings were held to discuss the ethical and moral implications of 
running the videotape. They went like this. 
</P>
<P>
NEWS DIRECTOR: "Is the tape in focus?" 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCER: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
NEWS DIRECTOR: "Is it in color?" 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCER: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
NEWS DIRECTOR: "Run it." 
</P>
<P>
So the gesture ran on TV and then the newspapers got a copy of the picture from 
the TV stations and then they ran it. 
</P>
<P>
About 275,000 people had attended the street festival and only a few thousand 
were able to see and be insulted by Barry's gesture. But when the media 
broadcast and published the gesture, we were able to insult millions. 
</P>
<P>
Don't thank us. We're just doing our job. 
</P>
<P>
One TV anchorman I watched referred to what Barry did as an "obscene" gesture 
that raised a "serious question of his judgment." 
</P>
<P>
I thought this was laying it on a little bit thick. Anyone who watches football 
or baseball on TV sees people make that gesture all the time. 
</P>
<P>
In one famous example, when one fan flipped the bird at the TV camera on 
"Monday Night Football," Don Meredith explained: "That's just his way of saying 
'We're No.1.' " 
</P>
<P>
But many people were very angry at Barry. One of his opponents for mayor, 
Sharon Pratt Dixon, held a news conference to say Barry's gesture proved he "is 
now essentially politically impotent." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had any idea what she was talking about, but it gave everybody an excuse 
to run the videotape of the mayor and the Pink Flamingo again. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Rockefeller made the same gesture to a crowd while he was vice president 
in 1976. Yes, Nelson Rockefeller was vice president of the United States. It 
was under Gerald Ford and America had temporarily run out of real vice 
presidents and Rocky volunteered to fill in until a full-time nonentity could 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Rockefeller was not making a rude gesture by raising his middle 
finger to the crowd. What few people know is that a reporter had just shouted 
out to him: "Hey, Nelson! It's 9 a.m. How many billion dollars have you made so 
far today?" 
</P>
<P>
And Rockefeller raised his finger in the international monetary signal for: 
"Only one, but it's still early in Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
Just a few days ago, Mayor Barry was forced to apologize to the public. He said 
he made his gesture only because of "beer-drinking hecklers" who had made rude 
remarks about his mother and wife. 
</P>
<P>
I think it was good of Mayor Barry to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
But in the future I think he could avoid a lot of bad publicity if he just 
resolved his conflicts with foul-mouthed, beer-drinking goons the way most of 
the people in his city do.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: VOICES OF ANCESTORS SING ACROSS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after dawn on a May morning in 1930, two Australian gold prospectors 
led an expedition into the highlands of what is today Papua New Guinea and 
discovered a civilization of 1 million people who had never before had contact 
with the outside world. It was perhaps the last epic encounter between 
"advanced" Western society and an ancient culture long sheltered from foreign 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
That first moment of contact in New Guinea represented both an end and a 
beginning, for once a single people meets another, each is changed forever. But 
out of change can come respect and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
The highlands meeting is instructive to our contemporary world, so often marred 
by racial tension and conflicts based on religious or cultural antagonism, 
ignorance or fear. An old man rubbed one of the anthropologist's white legs to 
see if it was painted. Some of the older women wept with joy, for they believed 
the strange figures who had suddenly appeared were ancestral spirits returned 
from the dead. To the highland women, all people had always been one people. 
</P>
<P>
During my own recent expedition in New Guinea, I met a Catholic priest, Father 
Danbui, on the remote Sepik River, far from the highlands. The tribes along its 
banks speak nearly 200 languages, testifying to the remarkable cultural 
diversity of this nation. 
</P>
<P>
Father Danbui had been born in New Guinea and had been converted to 
Catholicism. As we sat in a house on stilts overlooking the muddy river, he 
explained to me that Sepik people sought in their own timeless legends an 
explanation for how strangers came to be among them. He told the tale of two 
brothers -- the elder married and stable, the younger a bachelor with inventive 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
One day the younger brother and his brother's wife were gathering wood at the 
river. After the work was done, the two went bathing and later the young 
brother began drawing beautiful designs in the sand. The woman, pleased at the 
sight and innocent of the consequences, asked him to trace the same lovely 
images on her back. As he did so, some villagers came upon the two. The younger 
brother was expelled from the village for his transgression with his brother's 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
According to Father Danbui, when German missionaries arrived in the village in 
the 1870s, the local people were startled by their white skin and blond hair, 
and by their metal tools that enabled them to build unfamiliar things. Seeking 
an explanation for who these odd people were, the villagers -- ignoring the 
difference in skin color -- decided that, in these missionaries, the exiled 
brother had returned. 
</P>
<P>
Father Danbui uses this story to illustrate how foreign religions came to be 
accepted, and practiced, by tribal people. In fact, he himself embraced a 
foreign religion, but not by abandoning traditional beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
When New Guinea achieved independence in 1975 and became the nation of Papua 
New Guinea, Father Danbui -- at the urging of his people -- became the 
equivalent of province governor. 
</P>
<P>
He steers a path between culture and politics, between social integration and 
tribal autonomy. Above all, he seeks to combine outside ways with ancient 
tradition, because he is proud of his birthright. When he conducts Catholic 
Masses, the music for the Mass is often played by local people on sacred wooden 
flutes -- flutes that have been used in Sepik rituals for countless centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Their rich-toned sounds, however, are more than music. For the celebrants of 
the Mass, they are the voices of ancestors singing across time, the voices 
again of one people.

ZAN THOMPSON: A NEW HOME IS A MOVING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I will tell you why I had four jars of cardamon. The shelves of the pantry that 
I had built in the kitchen are so deep, I can't see to the back of the shelf. 
Thus, when I am overcome with the conviction that I am able to bake exotic tea 
cakes (I can't) that contain cardamon, I trot to the store and buy another jar. 
</P>
<P>
The recipe calls for one-half a teaspoon, so through the years, you can 
accumulate quite a bit of cardamon, all of which is stale or at least musty, so 
it goes out. The same holds true of a dozen or more rarely used spices. 
Usually, I just thrust it back in the pantry thinking, "I'll get at that stuff 
one of these days." 
</P>
<P>
I am still moving. I feel as if I have been doing this forever. Several good 
friends have helped me to my delight. Some of them are fast and enthusiastic 
but occasionally are swept away with the need for empty shelves. Now, I have 
almost two weeks left of living in this house, so I have to have the basic food 
and pots and pans. That is why I was at the market at 6 a.m. yesterday buying 
coffee filters and coffee. One of my fast-moving volunteers had packed the 
filters and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen boxes all marked kitchen and all heavily taped. The 
prospect of opening all of the boxes until I came to the filters and coffee was 
just too much. I went to the store vowing that henceforth I would keep the 
coffee stuff in the bedroom. It was only by emitting a long, high-pitched 
scream that I kept the coffee maker from being wrapped and taped and done away 
with. 
</P>
<P>
I am moving to a place called Laguna De La Paz in La Quinta, which is beyond 
Palm Desert. What goes around comes around has again been proven. The original 
hotel at La Quinta was built in 1926 and was a weekend retreat. My mother and 
father used to go down for weekends. Not I. It was not a kid place. 
</P>
<P>
And now I will be just down the road from the renovated hotel. I just will not 
be there as soon as I thought I would be. There are two salesmen selling these 
houses, Jeff Petrus and John Pedalino. Jeff is a delightful young man who has a 
Scottish terrier named Reggie. I have a note that says my house will be 
finished on July 16. That was the date given to me last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it seems it will be closer to Oct. 16. The people who bought my house are 
moving in Oct. 5, at which time Peaches and I and our lares and penates will 
have to be out. I heard this news with a sinking sensation because I have just 
had the couch, love seat and a channel-back chair re-upholstered. Jeff's 
suggestion is that the movers put the stuff in a house that is finished. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Peaches and I will stay with my good friend Jean Erck for 
whatever length of time it takes to finish the house I selected from the pretty 
pictures. The houses are tan, peach, or sand. Mine is peach. Right now, it's 
hard to tell because there is no plaster on the house, just the black paper and 
the chicken wire. It takes a high heart and great imagination to believe that 
this will turn into a house. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who works for the developer who is building this instant neighborhood 
said that if my lot number had been one less, it would have been finished with 
the preceding 10 houses. Now, it is in the next group of 10. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be city permits and electric meters that are the main stumbling 
blocks. It might be possible that Peaches and I could move into the house, but 
we wouldn't have any electricity, lights, air conditioning, a plug for the 
computer that is going to trail after me like a mean dog, an electric 
typewriter or any of that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure that when all this awful backing and filling is over, I will like the 
house. At least, I hope so. It stands at the foot of what I think are the Santa 
Rosa Mountains. They are great, rugged mountains that catch the dawn sunrise 
and turn purple, then pink and finally brown. At sunset, the light show 
reverses its sequence. I have seen it at Jean's and it's perfectly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
The people who are building Laguna De La Paz say that they would be willing to 
put me in a hotel and there are hotels in the desert that take furry friends. 
But that 10 days or whatever will be much easier at Jean's. At least, for me 
and Peaches. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen utensils I have left are interesting. A miniature muffin tin and 
three frying pans. That's what is left in this kitchen. I have never used the 
muffin tin. Pat's daughter bought it for me and made me some muffins when she 
came out to help her mother move. I have a feeling that is what I'll be dining 
on for the next 10 days, muffins and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Please do not ask me how the moving is going. It isn't. It's at a dead 
standstill. I cannot face one more box and the scream of the tearing of the 
tape is like a banshee's wail that pierces my ears. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the phone has stopped working so I can't use the modem to send this 
to The Times. I'm now going to my lawyer's office where I can find a phone. 
Maybe they'll have muffins and coffee. I certainly hope not.

Your in-depth report (on "Famous for Being Famous") failed to mention Angelique 
(I think that's her name) -- the Hollywood poster bimbo. 
</P>
<P>
I remember reading or hearing somewhere that she has a manager to make her 
famous. She's not an actress, not a major league ball player and doesn't 
endorse a product to my knowledge. But she's aspiring to be famous.

In the article, "Famous for Being Famous" (View, Sept. 12, by Nikki Finke), 
there was passing reference to Charles Nelson Reilly as being a PFBFer (People 
Famous for Being Famous). 
</P>
<P>
Let me, for the record, say that, besides his occasional appearances on 
"Hollywood Squares," Reilly is a talented and accomplished director. His 
credits include: "The Belle of Amherst," which won Julie Harris her fifth and 
record-breaking Tony Award for Best Actress in a Broadway play; several other 
plays starring Harris; and the recent critically acclaimed "At Wit's End" by 
Joel Kimmel and starring Stan Freeman. In addition, Reilly teaches and directs 
at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Reilly is famous for reasons other than these, but surely his talents 
far surpass getting into the tabloids weekly or having annual face-lifts. I 
think his fame justifiably comes from his raucous and genuine ability to make 
people laugh.

ON VIEW: RAINDROPS -- BUT NO CLOUDS -- CAMP OUT AT CHILDRENS CHAIN DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soppy tuxedos, sprinkled designer gowns and wet hair became simply de rigueur 
at the big black-tie do given by the Childrens Chain of Childrens Hospital. 
What started out as the most sophisticated of evenings -- balmy cocktails on 
the front lawn of Richard Sobelle's magnificent colonial in Brentwood Park -- 
turned into alarm as raindrops skittered on guests moving to the tennis court 
for a sit-down dinner by the sculpted 14-foot Eugenia hedge. 
</P>
<P>
As guests began to sit, clouds dumped dinosaurian raindrops. Some rushed for 
the poolhouse, others to the living room and the barbecue corner. More doubled 
over under orange and lemon trees. The rain ceased. Then it began again. Start 
and stop. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the crowd stayed until 12:30 a.m., dancing up a storm to Daniel 
Savant's Orchestra. The band got the driest spot, to protect musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Amazing kudos to these: Laney Techentin and Joan Graves, who moved under their 
table and ate their dinner camp-out style. Golden kudos to Nancy and James 
Birdwell and Richard and Jenny Schreiber, who with their guests, ate under 
brightly colored Mary Poppins-style umbrellas they had the foresight to bring. 
Silver kudos to George and Karen Harb, Wayne and Jo Ann Ratkoviche, Gary and 
Laurie Griff, Kyle and Nancy Kirwan and Alan and Cuchi Clark who dined with 
vintage wine at their tables sheltered only by coral napkins. Plastic kudos to 
Richard and Stephanie Johnson, whose dancing-est pals fashioned plastic rain 
suits from coverings borrowed from Somerset Catering. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chain president Tink Cheney and ball chairman Brooke Young (in the 
most fabulous black Carolyne Roehme one-armed black taffeta), had chorused: "It 
isn't going to rain. It isn't going to rain." Their husbands, James Cheney and 
James Young, winked in disbelief. Wishing did not make it so. 
</P>
<P>
Some were saying they hadn't had so much fun since camp. As for Silver Birches, 
which did the magnificent tall centerpieces, it had well-watered posies. As for 
Pamela Clyne, Childrens Chain dinner dance chairman seven years ago when the 
dance was totally rained out, she was one of the last to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Well, folks, this is what society does to raise gobs of proceeds for charity. 
It would have been mucho thousand less had they rented a tent to outfox the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
MEANWHLE: Nearby, in the neighborhood, under plenty of cover, Clarice and Ed 
Ellis were hosting an elegant party to welcome former Angelenos Mary Alice and 
Pen Tudor back to town from New York. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: To Yvonne Fedderson, surprising her best friend Sara O'Meara Sigholtz 
at an enormous birthday at the Bistro Gardens. . . . To Susie and Ted Field of 
Beverly Hills, who headed the luncheon/fashion show for the Young Musicians 
Foundation at the Beverly Hilton. . . . To the Friars honoring the late Johnny 
Green at a tribute evening. . . . To Keenan Behrle, chairman of the UCLA Annual 
Fund. . . . To Norvel and Helen Young, for their 50th wedding anniversary 
party. 
</P>
<P>
HONORS: In its most successful efforts to encourage corporations to promote 
health in the business world, the American Cancer Society, Central Los Angeles 
Unit, last week honored Donald R. Beall, chairman and CEO of Rockwell 
International, with its prestigious Sword of Life award at a luncheon at the 
Regent Beverly Wilshire. Rockwell has led the pack, providing 120,000 Rockwell 
employees with workplace cancer screenings and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in the audience included Edward Cazier Jr., chairman-elect of the 
American Cancer Society (California division), Nancy Keating (Los Angeles 
president), Dr. Esther Hays, Beall's wife Joan and Assistance League president 
Beverly Thrall. 
</P>
<P>
CAN'T MISS: The Huntington Medical Research Institute's celebration for 
neurosurgical research and brain tumor immunotherapy Saturday at Joey Leslie's 
estate in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: Wellesley College alumnae and their president Nan Keohane mapped 
plans last week for their largest campaign ever: $150 million. . . . Friends of 
the Julia Ann Singer Center, headed by Fay Kozberg, held their annual fashion 
fund- 
</P>
<P>
raiser at the Beverly Hilton with designer Michael Novarese, honoring the 
Foundations of the Milken Families. . . . The Music Academy of the West in 
Santa Barbara is reveling in the excitement of auctioning 60-some items in 
Montecito at the party organized by Mrs. Yoel Haller, Mrs. Julian Smith and 
Mrs. Thomas Fly. 
</P>
<P>
AGENDA: Hermes hosts the Hermes Grandprix of Los Angeles during the Los Angeles 
International Jumping Festival this afternoon at L.A. Equestrian Center. . . .

Foundation annual fall luncheon in the gardens this week. . . . Seth Baker gave 
the black-tie dinner at the Regency Club for the sixth anniversary of Beverly 
Hills (213). . . . United Way Campaign chair James Miscoll was at the forefront 
of the United Way kickoff last week at California Museum of Science and 
Industry.

SYMBOLS MAY SURPRISE VISITORS TO SYNAGOGUE 
</P>

COCHIN, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not only Hindu temples but a synagogue constructed in the 16th Century rank as 
major tourist attractions in southern India. 
</P>
<P>
The synagogue stands at the end of a winding street in Mattancherry, part of 
the port city of Cochin on the southwest coast in the state of Kerala. 
</P>
<P>
As they approach the synagogue, visitors are taken aback by street signs that 
indicate they are in "Jew Town." And they are shocked by the swastikas that 
decorate the buildings along with the Star of David. 
</P>
<P>
Guides quickly explain that in India, the swastika antedates Hitler. It is an 
ancient Hindu religious symbol that denotes good fortune. Furthermore, the 
"spokes" face in the opposite direction from those of the Nazi emblem. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Cohen, synagogue caretaker, emphasizes that the name Jew Town is not 
degrading. "It's a great honor here," he said, adding that early Jewish 
settlers were respected by their Indian hosts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Jews 
</P>
<P>
The first of the Jews are said to have landed in AD 72 at Cranganore, an 
ancient seaport north of Cochin. Some theories hold that they arrived earlier, 
before the Christian era. 
</P>
<P>
In AD 379, a date that is also disputed, the Jewish leader Joseph Rabban was 
named prince of the village of Anjuvannam by the king, Sri Parkaran Iravi 
Vanmar. Facsimiles of the copper plates that listed Rabban's honors and 
privileges are sold at the synagogue as souvenirs. The originals are in 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Marauding Moors and the Portuguese eventually destroyed the Jewish settlement 
at Cranganore, which was known as Shingly, and the last Jewish prince, Joseph 
Azar, swam to Cochin carrying his wife on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
The Jews then placed themselves under the rule of the Maharaja of Cochin, and 
in 1568 built their place of worship next to his palace. This story is told in 
a series of paintings by Hindu artist S. S. Krishna that are on display at the 
synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
A more thorough account of these events is in a pamphlet titled "Kerala and Her 
Jews" by S. S. Koder. Visitors can buy a copy for five rupees (about 30 cents). 
</P>
<P>
Many of the old-time Cochin Jews were spice traders, and that business still 
thrives. Trucks laden with sacks of cardamom, pepper, ginger, turmeric and 
other seasonings often crowd the narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
The once thriving Jewish community has dwindled to fewer than 30. Many have 
migrated to Israel in search of work and marriage opportunities that are 
lacking in Cochin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Bar Mitzvahs 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who remain are elderly. Cohen is 65 and has no plans to resettle 
in Israel. "What will I do there? Even the army won't take me," he said. The 
youngest member of the community is a 16-year-old girl who is expected to 
leave. Bar mitzvahs are a thing of the past because there are no boys. 
</P>
<P>
Although the community is small, services are held regularly on Friday nights 
and Saturday mornings. The synagogue has no rabbi. "Any of us can conduct 
services," Cohen said. Elders -- those who are older than 70 -- officiate for 
the high holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Cochin Jews speak the local language, Malayalam rather than Hebrew, but use 
Hebrew for services. 
</P>
<P>
And they follow strict Jewish dietary practices, including the use of a 
separate set of utensils and china for Passover. Instead of mutton or beef, 
they eat fish or chicken. Cohen handles the kosher slaughter of the chickens. 
</P>
<P>
The synagogue is open to visitors from 10 a.m. to noon and from 3 to 5 p.m., 
except on Saturdays and Jewish holidays. 
</P>
<P>
It is a small structure with furnishings from Europe and Asia. The chandeliers 
came from Belgium, as did the glass that holds the Eternal Light, which burns 
before the Ark containing the scrolls of the Torah. A silver basin and pitcher 
for washing hands were made in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The 420-year-old brass pulpit is Indian. And the striking blue and white 
Chinese tiles that cover the floor were imported from Canton in 1762. The tiles 
are hand-painted, and each is slightly different from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Women worship in an upstairs gallery that is screened off by brass latticework. 
A plaque indicates that the mosaic flooring in an anteroom for elderly 
worshipers was donated by Luis Lindau of Mexico in memory of his late father, 
Max Lindau. That was a recent gift, the result of the younger Lindau's visit to 
Cochin a dozen or so years ago, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Another point of interest is a framed stamp issued by the government of India 
in 1968 commemorating Indira Gandhi's visit to the synagogue. The 20-paisa 
stamp says "Cochin Synagogue, 1568-1968" and shows the pulpit, Ark and Eternal 
Light. "You can't get it now," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Israeli Visitors 
</P>
<P>
Among the tourists who visit the synagogue are Israelis who have learned of it 
from Cochin emigrants. A young woman touring India after completing her Israel 
military service was moved by what she saw. "It isn't the beauty, it's the 
meaning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cohen, there were once eight synagogues in Kerala. Only the one in 
Mattancherry still functions, and one day the Cochin Jews will no longer be 
able to form the quorum of 10 that is required to hold services. 
</P>
<P>
But the end of this unique community will not mean the end of the synagogue. 
"We'll hand it over to the government to keep as a monument," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>

HOORAY FOR HOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I have just returned from our first vacation in New Zealand. It was 
a great success, due to reading about June Hawes of New Zealand Travel Hosts 
(Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips, Feb. 26). 
</P>
<P>
The farms and B&amp;Bs that June reserved for us were excellent. These are not 
the cheapest (nor most expensive) places to stay in New Zealand, but they are 
the best. We feel that the people who were our hosts have become our friends. 
They were important in helping us determine the best use of our time in their 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The optional evening dinners that are available were the best food we had on 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
We would recommend New Zealand Travel Hosts, especially for first-time 
travelers to New Zealand. The address is New Zealand Travel Hosts, 279 Williams 
St., Kaiapoi, Christchurch, New Zealand.

HOME PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was fine that Stephen J. Frazier of San Diego wrote to correct an error on 
the river that flows through his home state of Vermont (Letters, Sept. 10), but 
why did he have to add the last sentence: "I only hope you didn't encourage too 
many of them to visit"? 
</P>
<P>
If he is so protective of his home state, why isn't he back there protecting it 
instead of being in San Diego taking advantage of its opportunities? Did 
California discourage him from visiting or moving in? Isn't there enough room 
in the United States for each of us to find our own chosen visiting or living 
space?

BALLOON PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled to see the photo in the (Sept. 10) Travel Section of the cruise 
ship releasing a cloud of balloons over the sea. Someone in the cruise business 
needs to realize that those deflated balloons look like food to sea birds and 
animals and, after being swallowed, can block their stomachs. Starvation 
results. 
</P>
<P>
There have to be other ways to create a celebratory atmosphere which won't 
endanger the environment in which these creatures live and whose very existence 
heightens the enjoyment of the cruise goer. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope those in charge of celebrations on the ships will search for less 
hazardous ways to send off a cruise.

<P>
RANGIROA, French Polynesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gauguin could have painted the colorful picture that came into focus through 
the faceplate of my snorkeling mask in these aquamarine waters of the South 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A coral sculpture shaped like the head of a tiki god had a golden glow. Small 
fish created a rainbow of colors around it. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I were snorkeling in the lagoon shaped by the atoll of Rangiroa in 
the Tuoamotu archipelago about 200 miles northeast of Tahiti, where Gauguin 
arrived from Paris near the end of the 19th Century to begin his greatest 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The lagoon is a sea within a sea. It could contain the entire island of Tahiti 
within its stretch of 42 miles by 16 miles, surrounded by the rim of Rangiroa 
atoll that rises with its lush tropical foliage and two Polynesian villages 
above the submerged crater of an ancient volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Two passes through the rim, with tidal currents between the open sea and the 
lagoon, help to make these waters one of the great destinations on this planet 
for the adventurous traveler who enjoys snorkeling and diving. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Tuamotus were once barrier reefs that surrounded volcanic islands. 
As eons passed, the inner islands subsided, leaving only the rims and coral 
reefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underwater Life 
</P>
<P>
Here on Rangiroa, in the heart of the world's largest collection of coral 
atolls, you can view a fabulous variety of underwater life by inflating your 
life vest and riding the currents to and from the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
This adventure has to be carefully coordinated with a pickup by the inflatable 
boat or outrigger canoe that provides your base for snorkeling or diving near 
the reefs. 
</P>
<P>
If you are renting your own outrigger or small boat, check in advance for the 
timing of the current so that you don't end up too far out to sea or into the 
lagoon when the tide changes. This flushing of the tidal currents keeps the 
aquamarine waters of the lagoon crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived in the Rangiroa lagoon aboard the Wind Song sail cruiser with 120 
adventure-minded fellow passengers, including 19 certified scuba divers and at 
least twice that many snorkelers. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dag Dvergastein, our Norwegian skipper, and the pilot brought the Wind 
Song between the reefs of the tidal pass into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
From the anchorage, slipping or jumping over the rim of the inflatable took us 
instantly into a coral underworld with more fish than we could possibly 
identify or name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diving Excursions 
</P>
<P>
If you arrive in the lagoon with your own sailboat, or aboard the 
passenger-carrying freighter or one of the smaller cargo carriers serving the 
islands of French Polynesia, you can arrange for snorkeling and diving 
excursions from the villages of Taputa and Avatora. 
</P>
<P>
Scuba diving centers are based at Kia Ora Village Hotel across the pass from 
Taputa, and at the Raie Manta Club in Avatora. 
</P>
<P>
There are also daily flights between Tahiti-Faaa Airport and Rangiroa. The 
46-passenger Air Tahiti planes make the flight in about an hour. One-way fare 
is about $100 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
All of Rangiroa has scarcely 1,400 inhabitants, most of them in or around the 
two villages. 
</P>
<P>
For longer stays than a Wind Song or cargo vessel stopover, there are three 
hotels and nine pensions and private homes with accommodations for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Kia Ora Village, the largest of the hotel complexes, has only 25 thatched-roof 
bungalows in a coconut grove beside the beach. Amenities include a restaurant 
and bar with tables on the beach-front deck, where guests or visitors from the 
beach and the reefs can relax after snorkeling and diving. 
</P>
<P>
When we had finished our underwater adventure along the reef, we tendered from 
the anchored Wind Song to the Kia Ora and went snorkeling from the beach into 
another coral world alive with multicolored fish. Some of them came close 
enough to look right into our faceplates. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for a twosome at a Kia Ora Village beach bungalow are about $270 U.S. a 
night, including breakfast and dinner. Among free activities for guests are 
snorkeling, sailing, bicycling, windsurfing and fishing. One of the optional 
activities is scuba diving with a qualified instructor. 
</P>
<P>
A plaque at the Kia Ora reads: "Welcome to Kia Ora Village -- first hotel of 
the atolls, founded in 1972 by three lovers of the Tuamotu Islands -- Serge 
Arnoux, Robin Angely and Laris Kindynis. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Carnoux and Angely had wandered to the Tuamotus from France; Kindynis from 
Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Pension and private home accommodations start at about $30. For information in 
helping to plan a Rangiroa underwater adventure, check with your travel agent 
and contact the Tahiti Tourist Board, 12233 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 110, Los 
Angeles 90064, (213) 649-2884.

New underwater adventure tours: 
</P>
<P>
Tropical Adventures of Seattle, worldwide dive tour specialists since 1973, now 
represent the Aggressor Fleet of six 110-foot aluminum live-aboard boats for 
divers and underwater photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Each boat houses a maximum of 18, with comfortable cabins, meal service and a 
photo center for daily film processing. 
</P>
<P>
Four regular tours in Caribbean waters include dive destinations off Bonaire 
and Curacao, Belize and the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Belize dive sites offer such famed underwater destinations as Half Moon Wall, 
Long Cay Drop-Off, Southwest Cut, Terminator Wall, the Elbow, Silver Caves and 
the Blue Hole. 
</P>
<P>
The package price of $1,195 includes accommodations aboard and all meals for 
eight days and seven nights. You make your own flight arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Another new Tropical adventure combines a dive photograph expedition to 
Tanzania with a photo safari in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
"This coast," points out Lynn Goddess, co-owner of Tropical Adventures, "is 340 
miles long, entirely protected by an immense coral barrier reef, and offers one 
of the finest collections of marine life in the world -- whale sharks, huge 
grouper, manta rays, moray eels and an amazing potpouri of colorful reef fish." 
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania &amp; Kenya Coast Dive-Photo Safari offers accommodations, meals 
and all related expenses, including round-trip air fare from New York, at 
$4,195 per person.

CONSUMER REPORT: CHARTING PROGRESS OF AIRLINE CHARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's getting more and more difficult to differentiate between charter and 
scheduled airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Some charter airlines list their flights on the computerized reservation system 
used in most travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Some charter airlines may even offer a variety of fares and travel classes. 
</P>
<P>
Martinair Holland, a charter airline, will begin a class of service called Star 
Class this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The seats will be wider, reclining, and with a deeper pitch," according to 
Janice Holden, assistant vice president of Martinair. "Basically, this section 
and class will correspond to the business sections of scheduled airlines. We'll 
also have a separate check-in for (Star Class) passengers." 
</P>
<P>
Fares for the upgraded service are expected to be $150 to $250 above round-trip 
economy class. 
</P>
<P>
Charter airlines are also offering more varied fares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refundable Fare 
</P>
<P>
"We have a Y-class fare which is good for one year and is refundable, just as 
with regular airlines," said Janny Davis, sales/marketing manager of LTU 
International Airways, a Los Angeles-based charter. "If passengers want to 
change their return date in Europe, they can do so on a stand-by basis with no 
extra charge." 
</P>
<P>
LTU also offers a Q-class fare, which is costs less but is non-refundable. 
</P>
<P>
"This fare has conditions that call for full payment 48 hours after ticketing, 
and there's a $100 charge for making flight changes in Europe," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinair offers a regular economy fare that comes with a $75 cancellation 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have an APEX fare with the same kind of conditions that scheduled 
airlines have on their advance-purchase, one-way and stand-by fares. We have 
five fares, so we're still way behind the scheduled airlines, but we're getting 
there," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
And on most charters, travelers should be able to get a full refund before 
departure if the operator changes the price by more than 10%, makes major 
changes in itineraries or changes the departure time by more than 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deregulation Helped 
</P>
<P>
Why the similarities? 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation has had a great deal to do with charter airlines becoming more 
like scheduled carriers, Martinair's Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
"Charter airlines found they had to compete more directly with the scheduled 
airlines to survive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there still are differences in charter flying. 
</P>
<P>
"We operate like scheduled airlines except that we don't have the same 
frequency. However, we maintain our schedules religiously, regardless of how 
many passengers we have aboard," said Heinz Niederhoff, president of DER Tours 
and general service agent for Condor Air Lines, a Lufthansa subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide passengers with a seat in a nonsmoking section, though we are not 
obliged to," Holden said. "It's a voluntary procedure on our part, and we do it 
for competitive-service reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learn Baggage Rule 
</P>
<P>
Charter airlines may not allow as much luggage as scheduled airlines do. Before 
traveling, passengers should find out what the luggage allowance is for both 
check-through and carry-on bags. 
</P>
<P>
Overbooking policy is another difference. 
</P>
<P>
"As a scheduled charter airline we're not obliged to follow the rules on 
overbooking," Holden said, "but we always make sure that passengers can fly by 
making alternate arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of providing amenities to passengers affected by canceled or delayed 
flights or lost baggage, charter airlines have individual policies similar to 
those of scheduled airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"In our case, depending on the circumstances, we can provide accommodations, 
meal vouchers, messages to people and baggage replacements," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
When booking a trip on a charter line, make sure that any travel insurance, 
such as for trip cancellation or interruption, covers charters. Some charter 
airlines may offer their own form of protection.

DINING OUT: RELISHING SINGAPORE CUISINES 
</P>

SINGAPORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask people in Singapore for the name of a good restaurant and they will always 
ask what kind of food you want to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Say Chinese, Indian, Malay or even French, and they will again ask what kind. 
Variety is the spice of dining in Singapore, and the variety can be bewildering 
to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Banana Leaf Apolo restaurant. Scrupulously clean, the tables have 
large pieces of banana leaf at each setting. 
</P>
<P>
We were warmly welcomed. Soon after sitting we were surrounded by waiters 
carrying steel pots filled with steamed rice, curried vegetables and papadums 
-- a crisp Indian bread made from chickpeas. 
</P>
<P>
Stop here and the bill will run about $3 Singapore per person, for all you can 
eat. If you want meat (we tried a moist and very spicy chicken and fishhead 
curry) the bill will double. Add lassi, a yogurt drink, or a beer, and you 
might spend $10. You can eat with a spoon or with your fingers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheap Dining 
</P>
<P>
Dining in Singapore is ridiculously cheap. We figure that about $30 Singapore a 
day will buy three squares and a couple of snacks in between. What you get for 
that is remarkable. (Prices listed are in Singapore dollars that recently 
exchanged for $1.85 per $1 U.S.) 
</P>
<P>
But if your travels are to include taxis, find out where you are going from the 
hotel concierge, take a map and be prepared to direct the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Annalakshmi restaurant is another Indian experience. It is vegetarian cooking 
at its best, and the selection of vegetable and rice dishes is huge. We chose 
the buffet for $15. 
</P>
<P>
You fill up big silver platters and small bowls with noodles, lentil soup, 
curried vegetables such as squash, potatoes and onions, and various chutneys 
and condiments, including a wonderfully cooling dish of radishes in yogurt. 
Fragrant tea, mango lassi (a habit-forming drink of yogurt and ripe mango) and 
hot bread were brought to the table. 
</P>
<P>
The room was quiet, decorated with rich fabrics and filled with Indian 
families. The restaurant is part of a cultural foundation that offers classes 
in Indian dancing and musical instruments. You may see a class in progress in 
one of the spaces outside. Several shops sell costume jewelry and clothing used 
in dances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawker Stalls 
</P>
<P>
Singapore's fascination with food is most evident in the famed hawker stalls 
that are now found in the various food centers around the city. "The hawkers 
are an old Singapore tradition," said Violet Oon, an expert on the cuisines of 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
"The hawkers used to come through the neighborhoods with bicycle carts laden 
with food. We could recognize them by their calls, and would know when the 
especially good ones were coming. The stalls you see today are the descendants 
of those carts, often with the same families running them. Today a hawker 
license is the hardest thing to get in Singapore. Everyone wants one; it's good 
business." 
</P>
<P>
On Oon's recommendation we sought out the Ellenborough Market Stalls. 
</P>
<P>
Ellenborough's stalls are on the third and fourth floors of a large Chinese 
market, with vendors selling huge quantities of dried seafood. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped on the third floor and selected a variety of grilled and steamed 
fish, a great cabbage broth and chili noodles, all for about $3. The hawkers 
were delighted to see us and helped us select local specialities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Many Westerners 
</P>
<P>
Oon had assured us that Chinese business leaders regularly entertain at 
fourth-floor stalls but that the food seemed to be about the same. Dining at 
Ellenborough is a real adventure, and you won't see many other Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors head for the stalls at Newton Center just off Newton Circus. At 
night the crush of people can be overwhelming, although the hawkers will help 
you find a table from which you can venture forth to select from dozens of 
stalls. (One member of the party should stay at the table to maintain 
possession of it.) 
</P>
<P>
Satay vendors serve chicken or beef grilled on bamboo sticks with a spicy 
peanut sauce -- 20 came to $6. We ordered two dozen chili prawns for $15 and 
the huge shrimp arrived whole and ready to be opened by hand. 
</P>
<P>
We ordered Pomfret, a small local fish that was grilled and served on a banana 
leaf. Fruit stalls sold fresh litchi, durian, rambutans and star fruit. 
Mangosteens were in season, so we bought a huge bunch of the sweet fruit for 
$8. 
</P>
<P>
We also tried hawker stalls at Empress Place, where we breakfasted on chili 
noodles for $1.50. At Bugis Square the won-ton noodles in broth and the chicken 
rice were both excellent. The Satay Club is well known and popular, but we 
preferred the satay at Newton Circus. 
</P>
<P>
You can feel secure eating anywhere in Singapore, as the country has one of the 
toughest health departments anywhere, and each stall and restaurant is visited 
daily by a health inspector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Guidebooks 
</P>
<P>
Because food is a national obsession in Singapore, the quality and variety is 
exceptional. The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (8484 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 
510, Beverly Hills 90211), phone (213) 852-1901 offers several guidebooks to 
eating in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Or you might consider joining one of Violet Oon's culinary tours. They are an 
easy way to sample a variety of Singaporean cuisines. She also is responsible 
for a monthly publication called "The Food Paper" that provides information on 
what is new in Singapore dining. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of our stay in Singapore Oon suggested that we try another side of 
Singapore food. We found ourselves at the Brasserie at the Marco Polo Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a well-loved restaurant in Singapore," she said. "It gets a lot of local 
business and the food is very good." We agreed, as we dined on fresh white 
asparagus flown in from France, green asparagus from Thailand and a wonderful 
chicken that came from a local farm. 
</P>
<P>
You really can dine around the world in Singapore. 
</P>

A TASTE OF TRAVEL: SAMPLING THE LITTLE JOYS OF AUSTRIAN HOME WINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM UPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is a two-girl wine," the mayor of Gumpoldskirchen, Austria, was saying, 
as we sipped a crisp little Gruner Veltliner. 
</P>
<P>
What the mayor meant was that the wine we were sampling was so exceptional that 
it would attract two girls, rather than just the usual allotment of one. No 
doubt about it, the two-girl wine was a wine of distinction. 
</P>
<P>
But this was a drink for a moderately serious occasion, as the wine tasting the 
mayor was hosting had turned out to be. Under ordinary circumstances, the 
entertainment would have seemed extraordinary, but the October day was 
beckoning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean, Herbed Air 
</P>
<P>
And we were missing the best reason for wandering the vineyards: to smell the 
clean, herbed air; to see the countryside dappled with the weakening fall sun 
and to sip the spritzy, raw new wine of the harvest while laughing with friends 
and snacking at a table littered with cold roast goose, smoked ham, salami, 
cheese, freshly baked bread and salad. 
</P>
<P>
As the day slipped into late afternoon and the sun struggled for survival, we 
tasted the fruit and the joys of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
And they were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
We had been lured to this heurigen, a private wine tavern standing guard over 
vineyards, by a leafy garland hanging above the door. At harvest time, usually 
for a few weeks in October, the green boughs signal the arrival of the new 
wine. The adjective heurig means, literally, "of this year." 
</P>
<P>
Similar to the celebrated fall arrival of Nouveau Boujolais, enjoying the new 
Austrian wine has more to do with participation in an event than with exquisite 
flavor. It is a tradition begun in 1784 when Emperor Joseph II ruled that 
vintners in suburban Vienna could sell their own wine on their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
The rustic taverns are furnished with wooden benches and long tables. Often 
there is a fireplace and a garden in which to spend a sunny day. Sometimes 
there are a few musicians playing the accordion, the violin, the guitar, the 
zither. Sometimes there is singing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blend of Countries 
</P>
<P>
The self-service buffet food is simple and delightful, a blend of the 
countries, such as Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia and parts of 
northern Italy that were once united under the Austrio-Hungarian Empire and 
contribute to Austrian cuisine. The wine is usually drunk courageously from 
quarter liter mugs. 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings the taverns fill with Viennese searching for a spot free of 
tourists in which to sample a light evening supper. This light refreshment 
follows a day of as many as six meals and snacks, including a large midday meal 
and some of the best pastry in the world. The Viennese like to eat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Complex Menus 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Vienna, modern heurigen look-alikes are open year round and some 
offer complex menus. But by law, the traditional heurigen has a limited menu. 
It is open only for a few short weeks in the fall until the wine fermented from 
the previous harvest runs out. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional taverns lie on the outskirts of Vienna in the vineyards that 
surround the city. By rental car, a 30-minute drive south will take you to 
Gumpoldskirchen in Lower Austria. A few tours also visit the wine regions. 
</P>
<P>
For details, call or visit the Vienna Tourist Board next to the State Opera, 
Karntner Strasse 38, 43-59-74 (or from the United States, precede the number 
with 011-43-1). Some tours also may be booked out of major hotels. 
</P>
<P>
You need only drop by for a snack. Or you can spend the afternoon basking in 
the sun and conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Recreating the heurigen experience at home is not easy, because the wine and 
Austrian location are essential. But to duplicate a sense of the event, set up 
a picnic serving any new white wine or sparkling apple juice with assorted cold 
cuts and cheese, fresh rye bread with caraway seed and an assortment of cold 
salads such as the one that follows. It's perhaps best if you can take your 
picnic to Austria. But should that prove difficult, a back-yard picnic table is 
a reasonable substitute. Just don't forget to serve the wine in mugs. 
</P>
<P>
COLD RED CABBAGE WITH APPLE 
</P>
<P>
1 large, tart apple, peeled and shredded 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 head red cabbage, shredded 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons frozen apple juice concentrate, defrosted 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
In medium bowl, combine shredded apple with lemon juice and toss. Add cabbage. 
In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, apple juice concentrate, oil and caraway 
seed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss with cabbage. Makes about 6 
servings.

SECRETS SHARED: HANDYMEN IN HIGH DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, Collins is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we published our story on handymen ("Fix It Yourself? Most Still Call 
Handyman" July 16), we asked you to share with readers any advice you might 
have on finding a good handyman, or even the name of your favorite workman. 
Here is a sampling of the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Editors 
</P>
<P>
"His name is Alex and I've used him for 10 years. He can fix anything from A to 
Z and he's very conscientious. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He has installed new faucets and plumbing, put in air conditioners, replaced 
electrical outlets, installed new light fixtures and painted inside and outside 
my home. Now he is putting in sprinkler systems in my front and back yards. 
There is not one job he can't do." 
</P>
<P>
In dozens of letters like this one from Livia Kalman in the Fairfax area of Los 
Angeles, readers attested to the rare qualities of their handymen, whom they 
seem to have found with a combination of good luck, good neighbors and 
recommendations from the local hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
And in most cases, they were willing to provide names and numbers, a very 
generous action on their part, because many people guard their handyman like 
the gold at Ft. Knox. 
</P>
<P>
Kalman's handyman, Alex Messinger, (213) 655-7341, who lives in the Fairfax 
area, has a master's degree in electrical engineering from Slovak Technical 
University of Bratislava in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
He fell into handyman work soon after arriving in the United States when his 
landlord needed several repairs in his apartment building. "That's how it 
started, by word of mouth," Messinger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Bit of Everything 
</P>
<P>
Apartment manager Joyce Chapin needed a little bit of everything done for the 
West Los Angeles building she manages -- plumbing, electrical, carpentry and 
roofing -- so she inquired at Raes Hardware store on Santa Monica Boulevard, 
which has since closed. There, she found an employee, John Martin, who 
moonlighted as a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
In time, his brother, Bob Martin, came with him to help with the burgeoning 
list of chores, and Bob Martin, (213) 836-4890, still works for Chapin. "He is 
friendly, reliable and does almost everything," Chapin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A second West L.A. reader, Shirley Saxton, also recommended Martin. "I can't 
say enough about his kindness, efficiency and ingenuity," she wrote. "I call 
him, 'my technician.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Dearborn of Venice was lucky enough to rent a cottage several years ago 
to David Felix, who turned out to be, in her words, "a Jack-of-all-trades." 
Felix built a fence for his landlady, landscaped, did some minor plumbing and 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
"He's quite artistic and will even recommend colors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Before her chance meeting with David Felix, (213) 287-3739, Dearborn had 
pursued several recommendations from her local hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
But, like many homeowners looking for a helping hand, she found that "one man 
was very talented, but also very booked up. I would describe my search for help 
as a hit-and-miss situation, so I call myself very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing Dearborn's comments on Felix was Michelle Friedman of Santa Monica: "He 
is an excellent, careful and exact handyman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Hiring Tips 
</P>
<P>
Joni Halpern of San Diego wrote to say that she wished she had read the 
handyman article years ago. Over time she has picked up a few tips of her own: 
</P>
<P>
"I engage potential hires in conversation about the job to be done," she wrote. 
"I want to know exactly, in detail. . . . Do they explain what they will do and 
why? Do they take time to look closely at the job area? 
</P>
<P>
"If they recommend expensive major repairs, do they suggest a second opinion? 
If they use implied threats about what will happen if I don't do extensive 
repairs, I cross them off my list. . . . Finally, do they stick to business?" 
</P>
<P>
Halpern recommended Wayne Glover, (619) 296-9966, because he "is careful, 
experienced and quiet," she wrote. "Before starting a job, he explains the 
details of the job and the fact that he prefers using top-grade materials. He 
completes the job within the estimated time and he cleans up his mess each day, 
so that family life can proceed as normally as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"He examines every job carefully to determine whether there is some hidden 
cause of whatever problem the homeowner reports. For example, there were cracks 
in the ceiling of my living room, and other handymen said it was simply a 
matter of filling them and painting. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Glover went under the house, examined the structure and found that a 
portion of the house was sinking due to poor drainage. He fixed the problem 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Glover worked for many years in industrial maintenance and found himself being 
called upon to help friends, so he decided to try the handyman business full 
time. "The challenge of making things right" keeps him going, Glover said. 
</P>
<P>
We also heard from handyman Curt Kinkead of Posey, a small community near Lake 
Isabella in Kern County, who asked that we do not print his phone number or 
address, because, he said, "I already have as much work as I can handle." But 
he wanted to offer some advice to the readers: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . there is no substitute for being an educated consumer," Kinkead wrote. 
"Before you even think of calling a handyman, buy or borrow from the library 
one of those books on how to fix anything in your home and read the section 
that deals with your particular problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have questions or find complications not covered by the book, take some 
Polaroid pictures of the situation and head for your friendly local hardware 
store. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . when you have a thorough understanding of the problem, then call the 
handyman, have him analyze the problem and give you an estimate. If his 
proposed solution differs markedly from what you learned was needed, or if he 
insists on doing more than is needed, thank him for his time and call somebody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A General Contractor 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Huston of Chatsworth praised her "handyperson," J. B. Newman, (818) 
703-7146, "a skilled general contractor who does superb work on every job she 
tackles, large and small. . . . I have confidently recommended her work to many 
family members and friends." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Steele, (818) 761-8468, came highly recommended by Lance Thompson, a 
free-lance writer in Sun Valley. A former drummer with the British rock 'n' 
roll band The Herd, Steele learned to do handyman things the hard way. He 
accepted a job as a building manager several years ago and in preparation, 
disassembled everything with working parts in the apartment that came with the 
job -- refrigerator, heaters, air conditioning, dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still alive to tell the tale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Innate ability was the reason Batiya Keigler of West Los Angeles recommended 
Steve Katz, (213) 413-9750. "He a natural. Everything he touches he fixes," she 
said. "I say that he has golden hands. . . . He's only $15 an hour, and he can 
even fix cars. He's the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jewel of a Gentleman 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Kern of Los Angeles wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I have found a jewel of a gentleman . . . who can do just about anything and 
if he cannot, he has the resources to get it done. I have had him do carpentry, 
masonry, electrical and plumbing." Her handyman is John Winfield of Studio 
City, (818) 760-7831. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Nathe of West Hollywood said her handyman, Michael McGonigle, (619) 
434-2166, lives in San Diego, but works in Orange County and Los Angeles as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a fabulous remodel for me in my condo," Nathe wrote, "and has installed 
skylights, hung doors, built fireplaces and is a trained Corian installer. . . 
. Several friends recommended him highly to me and I have only glowing 
remarks." 
</P>
<P>
Another letter writer was The Times' bridge columnist, Alfred Sheinwold, who 
recommended his handyman, Bob Buckley, (818) 708-3800, as "competent, reliable 
and not too pricey." Added Sheinwold: "He's quiet, but articulate. (There's a 
contradiction!)" 
</P>
<P>
From Monrovia, Pat and Elizabeth Chaney praised their handyman, Steve Schrum, 
(213) 259-8695, who, like many handymen, is also a general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patient and Thorough 
</P>
<P>
"He is patient, conscientious and thorough in his work," they said. "He has 
been of invaluable help restoring to its original beauty our 1914 home." 
</P>
<P>
Janis Brock wrote from Thousands Oaks to recommend her handyman, Kevin Suitter, 
(805) 499-2326. "He is multitalented and reliable," she said, and she sent 
along his leaflet, which says: "Call me first, if I can't do it, I recommend 
someone who can." 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, we heard from a Long Beach reader, Michiko Sakimoto, who voiced 
the concern of most of those who have been fortunate enough to find a competent 
and fair handyman. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a neighborhood with a lot of elderly people. And while she felt 
compelled to let us know about her handyman, she asked us not to tell too many 
people because she and her neighbors rely on him and if he were to become too 
busy, she worries that he wouldn't have enough time for his older clients. 
</P>
<P>
So Handyman Bill, who helps out so many of those along Lewis Avenue, your 
clients are grateful.

PLANNING YOUR GARDEN CAN REQUIRE A SOFT(WARE) TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, Schenden is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How difficult is it to fill in that little gap in your yard where the ferns 
fried and the day lilies choked and died? 
</P>
<P>
If you've got a green thumb, it may not be a problem. If you're all thumbs -- 
and none are green -- you may seriously want to consider asphalt -- unless you 
own a home computer. 
</P>
<P>
A new computer program called RootDirectory could appear like a ray of sunlight 
to homeowners and apartment gardeners who know nothing about plants but who 
can't justify paying someone else to tell them where to put their petunias. 
</P>
<P>
Books such as Sunset Western Garden, Hortus Third or any of a number of 
do-it-yourself gardening books can be extremely helpful if you know what you're 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
But with this program, the answers can be supplied for you by punching a few 
keys; all you do is answer some simple questions, such as: Where do you live? 
How big is your planting space? Do you want shade? 
</P>
<P>
This budding phenomenon is the brainchild of Randy Farrar, a lifelong gardener 
-- and software developer at TRW. The program is the hybrid born of Farrar's 
combining his knack for computers with his love of gardening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect match," said Farrar, 31, who developed the program during lunch 
hours, after work and on weekends. "And it's as easy to use as a microwave. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much information out there for gardening. There's an information 
overload. The program organizes it all. In Sunset (Western Garden Book), say 
you want a bulb-like flower, you want it to bloom in summer in filtered shade. 
You go to the index . . . and you have to jump around to look things up and 
cross reference -- and it may take you a half an hour, or hours, to figure it 
out. That's why everyone's growing petunias. 
</P>
<P>
"With RootDirectory, the program asks you what you want and gives you a 
detailed list of choices." 
</P>
<P>
Farrar is convinced that with his program, indoor types (i.e. amateurs) can 
plan their yards with the aplomb of a landscape designer. Whether planting a 
simple bulb or planning an extensive landscape, it can be as productive as 
consulting a gardening expert, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that, essentially, is what users of RootDirectory are doing. All of the 
information contained in the program was gathered through Farrar's extensive 
research -- and his own experience. 
</P>
<P>
Farrar has always been at home with Mother Nature. From age 14 he worked in a 
nursery, watering, pulling weeds -- and doing research with plant breeding and 
plant materials. 
</P>
<P>
He branched out in college, earning a bachelor's degree in agricultural 
business management at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. At Cal Poly, he developed a 
sense for recognizing what he considers good and bad gardening practices. 
</P>
<P>
"The instructor wanted us to use pesticides to kill off moths," he recalls 
about one field project. "We had to put on these space suits, and I asked, 'Do 
I have to wear this?' He said, 'You do if you want to have children.' 
</P>
<P>
"It convinced me -- and set my philosophy about pesticides -- you don't need 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insects and Pests 
</P>
<P>
In his Insects and Pests module, Farrar offers his own home remedies and proven 
natural methods (organic is such a yuppie term, he said, flinching) to rid a 
garden of pesky intruders -- and there's no space suit or threat to fertility 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
With the insect and pest program, gardeners can find a solution to their pest 
problem if they know what the intruder looks like, or "the program will ask for 
a damage report," Farrar said, and the perpetrator can be identified that way. 
</P>
<P>
"If the leaves are being chomped on, and there's slime all over, that's a snail 
or slug," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the pest is identified, the program "will give you information on their 
life cycle, because if you can control that organically, you can pretty much 
eliminate the problem for several years -- I have, and this area is notorious 
for snails and slugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Farming Methods 
</P>
<P>
After college, Farrar went into farming. "It's what I really wanted to do," he 
said. But he didn't have unrealistic fantasies of living life like farmers of 
yesteryear. His ideas had to do with experimenting with new farming methods and 
improving efficiency, like farming in beds: Instead of turning the soil over, 
"you cut down 12-14 inches into the soil. Beds are permanent and they aerate 
the soil." And incorporating a chicken coop with a greenhouse: "The heat from 
the chicken coop keeps the greenhouse warm." 
</P>
<P>
The best examples of Farrar's gardening philosophy are right in his own yard. 
Farrar, his wife, Sheri, and two daughters, Lindsay, 4, and Natalie, 7 months, 
live in a cozy home on a small lot in Redondo Beach -- small enough that most 
people wouldn't even worry about landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
But in this limited space, Farrar grows raspberries, nectarines, boysenberries, 
plums, apples, tangerines, vegetables and an array of lush plants arranged in a 
neat and attractive landscape -- and all grown organically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third World Projects 
</P>
<P>
Farrar has put hundreds of hours into his software project, but he has some 
pretty lofty goals for all his efforts. "My ultimate goal is to do Third World 
projects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the attractive features of his computer program is that it gives the 
user the ability to call up a definition of an unfamiliar word by simply 
putting the cursor on the word and pressing a "hot button." The definition then 
appears over a portion of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
In the tree module, for instance, you can "call up trees that can be dwarf and 
the tree type will be highlighted -- evergreen, deciduous, needled-evergreen." 
You click on deciduous and a definition appears that says: "Tree that loses its 
leaves in summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost is $29.95 
</P>
<P>
Similar programs put out by companies like Ortho for the nursery trade sell for 
$1,000 or more; each one of Farrar's modules costs $29.95. Why the difference?

"Gardeners are cheap to begin with -- I am," Farrar explained. "You don't want 
to spend a lot on a gardening tool, and that's what I want this to be. I don't 
want them to spend any more on this than they would on a good gardening tool." 
</P>
<P>
To use the program, you begin by choosing a module (trees, flowers, insects and 
pests, etc.). Say you chose the tree module. First, you find your zone on a 
color-coded map of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
(The Los Angeles coastal area is Zone 10; the San Fernando Valley is Zone 9.) 
You click on Zone 10, and the computer will ask what function you want the tree 
to have. ("Trees need to be planted for a purpose, not just stuck somewhere," 
Farrar said. "Most people have a purpose, they just can't explain it.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intelligent Gardening Tool 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to ask specific questions about the tree's purpose: Do 
you want fall color? What color? What height? (Click on a graphic that shows 
tree heights compared to a 6-foot man -- "people don't realize how tall '75 
foot' is," Farrar said.) How do you want it to look? (Another graphic shows 
tree forms from round to umbrella-shaped.) 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to buy this software for one tree," Farrar says. "But you can 
use it as an intelligent gardening tool." 
</P>
<P>
And you can put together a drought-tolerant, shady, sunny, appetizing, 
tantalizing landscape with all the information within your reach -- as long as 
you have an IBM-compatible personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person has all these knowledge bases, he does not need a landscape 
designer," Farrar said. "It's a useful tool for the professional gardener and 
horticulturist as well as for people who don't know anything about plants." 
</P>
<P>
If gardeners find bugs in their system, there's no need to fear, Farrar offers 
two free upgrades (system updates) -- and "a minimal charge" for future 
upgrades, so owners of RootDirectory will always be up-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
Like with all good software, "it'll never be finished," Farrar said. 
</P>
<P>
INFORMATION ON ROOTDIRECTORY The software require an IBM or compatible personal 
computer, 640K memory; EGA and hard disk. Call or write for mail-order copies 
of trees, flowers or pest modules ($29.95 each): GardenTech, 1730 Goodman Ave., 
Redondo Beach, Calif. 90278; (213) 372-5810.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: PORTLAND SETS EXAMPLE IN URBAN DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although architecture is arguably the most permanent of the arts, the focus of 
the profession can be very ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, the focus has been on how buildings look and what sort of 
statement they make. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, there seems to be a healthy shift in the focus to a concern with 
how buildings function within particular settings, how people use buildings and 
how buildings affect the life around them. 
</P>
<P>
It's also appropriate that this issue of design priorities -- being at least as 
concerned with the experience of buildings as with their potential individual 
expressiveness -- be raised in this damp Northwest city. 
</P>
<P>
It was here seven years ago, that the bulky, grossly colored and flamboyantly 
decorated municipal building designed by Michael Graves was unveiled, and 
subsequently hailed, and then condemned as a landmark of the Post Modernist 
movement. The Princeton-based architect was touted by profession icon Philip 
Johnson, acting as a competition adviser to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The building generated star status and a bevy of commissions for Graves. And it 
put Portland on the architectural map as the site of the "most important 
significant American building of the decade," according to a prominent East 
Coast design critic. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seven years later, the Portland Building, as it is called, seems oddly 
faded and does not command a second look, except for a monumental, figurative 
sculpture of a graceful maiden above its entrance. It remains, as it did when 
dedicated, an isolated architectural object, not particularly friendly to 
passing pedestrians or users. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the design focus in downtown Portland these days has shifted and 
broadened. It is distinguished not only by the preservation of landmarks, but 
also how buildings are sited and scaled, and how they are knit together by 
streets and sidewalks to create an engaging urban scene. 
</P>
<P>
We are not talking here about the image of a building or an ensemble of 
buildings as an isolated object, leaden with symbolism, to be viewed as a piece 
of sculpture, preferably from a distance. But rather, about how buildings 
function at ground level, what spaces they create, the experience of bordering 
sidewalks and streets, broadly defined in the design profession as the public 
realm. It is the stuff of urban design. 
</P>
<P>
Helping is Portland's traditional sensitivity to open space, light and air -- a 
sensitivity heightened by the cloudy conditions here part of the year. When the 
sun shines, everyone wants to enjoy the rays and not be in the shadows of a 
bulky building. Accommodating this are wide sidewalks, a network of open 
spaces, edged with benches and spotted with fountains, several inviting plazas 
and parks, and an attractive light-rail system serving downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The result is an accessible, humanistic city offering a wealth of lessons in 
urban design. These include how buildings are scaled so as not to overwhelm 
streets, how their ground floors line the streets with engaging shops and 
stores, how detailing such as brickwork lends color and safety to pavements, 
how parks are made inviting to all and how people are encouraged to park their 
cars and get out and walk, even in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the lessons are not new. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Portland is going on in varying degrees in many other 
cities. San Francisco a few years ago approved an imaginative, if 
controversial, plan to protect its downtown streetscapes that many felt were 
being overwhelmed by indifferent commercial monoliths. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a renewed appreciation in our design reviews of how critical 
pedestrian life is to the building, the street and the city," comments Edward 
Helfeld of the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
And San Diego is looking much closer and carefully at how new developments 
might generate more active street life, instead of discouraging it or 
channeling it into the privatized world of a mall. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings should not be viewed as pieces of sculpture but as part of a puzzle, 
suggests Michael Stepner, who recently was appointed to the newly created 
position of city architect. He notes his major concern is urban design. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles there also seems to be an increasing awareness of the importance 
of urban design, particularly in the planning of large-scale developments. 
</P>
<P>
Note the recent debates concerning the shaping of the open space for Phase 2 of 
California Plaza, the interest in the streetscape designs in the Library Square 
area and the concern for how the Grand Avenue Plaza proposal will affect the 
historic scale and tone of 7th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Most environmental reviews now include an urban design element evaluating how 
particular developments will relate to neighboring buildings, and bordering 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"As the city becomes more dense, the nature of the spaces between the buildings 
becomes more critical," observes senior city planner Deborah Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
This increasing awareness should be especially encouraging to those concerned 
with the livability of the city. 
</P>
<P>
After all, contrary to some opinions, Los Angeles is more than some sort of 
facade seen from a freeway erected overnight like a backdrop for a movie set, 
but a place where some people might actually want to get out of their cars and 
stay awhile.

SPEAKING OUT : SAVING PLAN NEEDS BETTER APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER WELCH, Christopher Welch is a financial analyst for Raleigh 
Enterprises, a West Los Angeles real estate conglomerate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a would-be homeowner, I am always keenly interested in people's new ideas to 
break into the housing market, an idea very remote for most of us young people. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Jason-White, in his article "Fresh Plan for Buying First Home" (Sept. 
10), discusses a plan for potential home buyers to get into the market. 
Unfortunately, he ignores some of the most pressing problems, concentrating 
only on the financial workings of his suggestion and how it will help the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, but given my current housing situation, helping the government is 
not very high on my priority list. In fact, it is the government that should be 
helping people like me. 
</P>
<P>
But we should at least examine Jason-White's proposal to see if it makes 
financial sense. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to see young people getting into a savings program for 10 years, 
then purchase a home at the end of that time and have it paid off in the next 
five years -- a 15-year method to own your own home, free and clear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saving for Home 
</P>
<P>
Sounds pretty good, in theory, but there are a number of serious flaws in this 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
First, the proposal requires the example couple (earning $40,000 a year) to 
save $650 a month. 
</P>
<P>
A modest sum, to be sure, considering that this couple will also have to pay 
about $700 for rent, $400 for food, $400 for cars, $150 for insurance, not to 
mention clothes, VCRs, going to a movie once in a while, or maybe saving for a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
I am being facetious, of course. To save $650 a month would kill me, or anybody 
else making that kind of money. And that is where the real problem is, the one 
Jason-White ignores. 
</P>
<P>
If the example couple follows his program, they will be spending 50% of their 
net income on housing or saving for housing. And half of that is not 
contributing to their future in any way. Non-tax-deductible rent is the biggest 
obstacle to saving for home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
If the government truly wants to help the young get into the market, they 
should allow deductions on rent paid. Of course, that creates some other 
problems for the government, specifically reducing revenue when it needs it the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eliminate Tax Deduction 
</P>
<P>
Another major problem with the proposal is that it advocates low-leverage 
transactions. This is not a good idea. The less a person puts into an 
investment that he or she is controlling, and that is appreciating, the higher 
that person's return on his or her investment. 
</P>
<P>
Low leveraging also will almost eliminate the only tax deduction still 
available to individuals -- the mortgage interest deduction. 
</P>
<P>
The trade-off, Jason-White claims, is that you will be saving $256,000 in your 
lifetime earnings. Let's examine this proposal. 
</P>
<P>
If the example couple follows his plan, in 15 years they will own a $300,000 
home free and clear. However, what happens if that same couple follows a 
different path? 
</P>
<P>
Let's say they purchase a starter condo for $125,000 and finance it with an FHA 
95% mortgage. Let's also assume that our couple has no money to put down, so 
they take a $10,000 advance on their credit cards to make the down and closing 
costs, and pay it off (at 15%) over five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Appreciation 
</P>
<P>
Their monthly payment for housing (including condo fee) would be less than if 
they opted for Jason-White's proposal, and they would own their own home. 
</P>
<P>
But most important, they would get any appreciation on the property. Using 
Jason-White's numbers, I calculated that he used an appreciation rate of 10% 
and an inflation rate of 5.5%. The condo buyers, if they sell at the end of 
five years, will realize a profit of $75,000 (a return of over 30%), to be 
applied against a new home, which could now be a house of about $235,000. Their 
payments would still be less than those advocated by Jason-White. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the next five years, their proceeds from the sale of the house 
(again, using the same assumption factors) would be $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, if the buyers wanted to own their home free and clear in five 
years, they could opt for Jason-White's financing packaging, with the same 
monthly payment, but get a house worth about $400,000. If they opt for 
traditional financing, they could afford a $600,000 home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignores Politics 
</P>
<P>
Other major problems that Jason-White ignores include the direction of national 
politics, which have been tending to promote slow-growth initiatives, down 
zoning and other anti-development factors. These will force the housing supply 
to grow at a much slower rate than previously. 
</P>
<P>
And where will housing be located? Today, for affordable and decent housing, 
young people are being forced outward, at least an hour's drive from business 
centers in Los Angeles. Prices jumped upward of 20% in Palmdale last year, 
making it too expensive for many people. Where to now? Indio? Mojave? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are a number of flaws with my proposal also. I do not 
recommend purchasing a home by getting a cash advance on your credit card. 
There are ancillary costs, fees and it will appear on your TRW credit report, 
severely diminishing your chances of getting adequate financing. 
</P>
<P>
The FHA financing I proposed is also an impossibility, given current maximum 
loan amounts, but that is a problem the government could, and should, address. 
</P>
<P>
Jason-White thinks we need "fresh thinking on how to finance home ownership," 
but before we can do that, we need to break some old habits of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, the mortgage-interest deduction, that mainstay of American 
housing policy for decades, does not foster home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Savings 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Smolker Letter, a real estate newsletter published in 
Los Angeles, "The federal government now spends, through tax subsidy, about 
four times more on middle- and upper-class housing than on housing subsidies 
for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
While it may be justified to state that renters should simply save more money, 
their paltry return on savings accounts (which is taxed), can not possibly keep 
up with inflation in the housing market. Moreover, statistics show that 
homeowners managed to save 16% of total household income, while renters could 
save only 4% from 1983 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jason-White's thinking that it is good to own a home free and clear is also 
somewhat flawed. Already mentioned is the fact that you lose any tax deductions 
you might have had otherwise (which over a 30-year loan period would be 
$200,000). 
</P>
<P>
The other problem is that you have $300,000-plus of equity locked up in a 
house, doing neither the homeowner nor the economy any good. This is a very big 
problem for the elderly, who own homes free and clear, but have made no 
arrangements for a regular stream of income from which to live. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government has approved, on a limited basis, the use of reverse 
mortgages. These provide cash flow to the owner each month, and the lender gets 
the home at some certain date in the future. Many elderly people are afraid of 
these mortgages, because if they live longer than the term of the loan, they 
are without housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
French System 
</P>
<P>
A "fresh" way of thinking might be to develop a system similar to what the 
French call viager. This system provides for young people to make deals with 
older people who own homes free and clear, where the young provide a regular 
monthly sum to the elder (based on the home's worth and an estimate of how long 
the elder will survive -- tricky tasks), and in return, when the elder dies, 
the young people receive the home, free and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on individual circumstances, it could be very beneficial for one or 
the other in the deal, but as they say, nothing can be gained if nothing is 
risked. 
</P>
<P>
Risk is really what it's all about, and if history is any indication, it's a 
big risk not to be in the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot just sit by while people are being told to wait 10 years to buy. Buy 
now.

<P>
One of the most distinctive of bulbs is native mostly to California, the 
Mariposa tulip, Calochortus. Looking somewhat like a small tulip, but much more 
wildly marked (some contain every color imaginable including splotches of red, 
purple, yellow and brown) and often fringed or covered with hairs, these bulbs 
have fascinated gardeners at various times, especially earlier in the century 
when they were promoted by nurseryman Carl Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
With many now endangered in the wild, and with a new interest in drought 
resistant plantings that often use natives, there is also a renewed interest in 
the calochortus and a small society has been formed. Their newsletter, 
naturally named "Mariposa," is just starting up and subscriptions will costs $2 
a year for four issues. Write to Mariposa, 260 Alden Road, Hayward, Calif.

GARDEN NEWS: BENEFICIAL WORMS?

<TEXT>
<P>
"But why are you pouring worms on the lawn?" asked my wife from a great 
distance, as I was trying to describe what nematodes are. One of the more 
fascinating of the new organic controls employs tiny (make that microscopic) 
worm-like nematodes that find, attack and kill larvae living underground, or 
close to the ground, such as cutworms, root maggots, wireworms, the 
helmet-headed larva of June beetles (which chomp on lawn grass roots and which 
were my intended target) and a host of other creatures that attack vegetables, 
flowers and lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Biosys, a biological pest control company in Palo Alto, California makes this 
product, called BioSafe Lawn and Garden Insect Control. What you get in the 
large box is a plastic bottle with what looks like window screening inside, 
plus a package of "activator." 
</P>
<P>
The screening is coated with a gel that contains the dormant nematodes (which 
can be stored refrigerated for up to six months). You add water and the 
activator to release the nematodes and then put this mixture is a watering can 
or hose-end sprayer and apply it to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Each box contains enough of the little creatures (probably billions) to treat 
an area 22.5 feet by 10 feet, or 225 square feet. Because it is not a poison, 
it is not harmful to the environment, people or pets. It is not yet commonly 
available at nurseries but is becoming available. Scanmask is a similar 
nematode product available through the mail, from Ringer, 9959 Valley View 
Road, Eden Prairie, Minn., 55344-3585, (800) 654-1047. One pint sells for 
$14.98. It treats 200 to 370 square feet depending on pest type. ROBERT SMAUS

THE ONE-HOUR PROJECT : AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CURE FOR STICKY WINDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Santa Monica free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever go to open a window or sliding door and find that it is stuck so badly 
that you either cannot budge it at all or have to struggle with it inch by 
inch? Very frustrating to say the least, especially during hot summer weather. 
</P>
<P>
Before you call a carpenter or handyman, I have a few suggestions to help you 
"keep your cool" by keeping the most common windows and doors operating 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
If you are having trouble with wooden "double hung" windows, i.e. windows that 
lift up and down, you will probably find that there is a paint seal between the 
sash and the window frame. To break the seal, force a putty knife with 2-inch 
wide blade into the joint by tapping it lightly with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Work it all the way around the sash on the inside and outside. Once the window 
is free, try to open it manually. If it still sticks, go to the outside and 
insert the tip of a large flat blade screwdriver under either corner of the 
sash and gently pry it up. Be sure to alternate between the left and right side 
as you lift. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the window is unstuck, you may notice that it is still hard to 
operate. The best way I have found to correct this is to lubricate the tracks 
with ordinary Vaseline. 
</P>
<P>
First wipe off any dust or debris from the tracks and then dip a paper towel 
into the Vaseline. Lift the sash as high as possible and apply a light coat to 
the lower tracks. Close the window and repeat for the upper track. Finally, 
test the window three or four times. You should find a vast improvement right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
For sliding aluminum windows, doors or screens that stick or do not slide 
easily, you will need to clean and lubricate the track. With the window or door 
closed, use a broom or vacuum cleaner remove any debris from the exposed track, 
then open the window or door and repeat for the other side of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, spray both sides of the track with a liberal amount of WD-40 spray 
lubricant (available at all hardware stores). All sliding window and door 
tracks should be cleaned and lubricated every other month to keep them running 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
French windows (windows that hinge like a "mini" door) are very prone to 
sticking becauses the wood expands and contracts with changes in the weather, 
causing the window frame to rub against the jamb. To correct this, look for 
contacts points (either lines or chafe marks on the paint) on the edge of the 
window frame. With a piece of coarse sandpaper, rub the contact points you find 
until you reach bare wood, then test the window for fit. 
</P>
<P>
If it still sticks, open it again and check for new contact points to sand. 
Repeat this procedure until all contact points have been removed and the window 
operates freely. (The above procedures also work on full-size doors that stick 
or rub the jamb). By the way, a good short-term remedy for windows or doors 
that rub the jamb lightly is to apply a thin coat of Vaseline to the contact 
point(s) as a lubricant. 
</P>
<P>
Casement windows are windows that hinge on the side and swing to the outside by 
means of a crank mechanism. When they stick, they can usually be fixed with a 
well-placed dose of WD-40 spray lubricant. Spray the track on the window, the 
hinges, and the crank mechanism itself. Operate the window a few times and 
spray again if its operation is still not smooth enough. 
</P>
<P>
If the window is wooden and rubs the jamb when closing, follow the procedures 
described above for French windows. If the window is made of metal, check if 
excess paint on the window frame is getting in the way. Remove any built-up 
paint with a knife or chisel.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: RAISING THE COMFORT LEVEL IN AN OLDER MOBILE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I live in an older mobile home. It is uncomfortably hot in the summer 
and chilly in the winter. What is the best method for adding insulation to the 
roof? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Typically, there are only 1 to 2 inches of roof insulation in older 
mobile homes, and it may have settled and deteriorated over the years. A 
properly insulated roof can cut your total utility bills significantly, 
especially air-conditioning costs, and increase your comfort year-round. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent method to increase the insulation level of your roof is to add a 
roof-over. This is actually a second roof built over the existing one. 
Additional insulation is first laid over the old roof. 
</P>
<P>
There are two basic types of roof-overs for mobile homes. One type uses a 
sheet-metal roof made of aluminum or steel. The other type uses a heavy, 
flexible "rubber-type" sheet. This is the same type of flexible material used 
to cover some football stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
The flexible roof-over offers several advantages. Since it is a continuous 
membrane, it waterproofs your roof. Some are manufactured as a single sheet and 
others are pieced and glued together at the site. The flexible sheet is sealed 
around the top edge of your mobile home with caulk and fixed in place with an 
aluminum strip around all the edges. 
</P>
<P>
Since it is nearly white, the new flexible roof also reflects away much of the 
sun's heat. This significantly reduces the amount of heat that radiates in 
through your ceiling. Roof rumble and noise from rain and hail are also 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
If you are handy with tools, you should be able to install a flexible roof-over 
yourself. You can purchase them in kit form with do-it-yourself instructions. 
It is often less expensive to locally purchase some of the items, like 
insulation. 
</P>
<P>
You have a couple of choices for insulation. One option is a very high-density 
fiberglass batt insulation. It must be very dense so it doesn't permanently 
crush under the weight of the sheet material and rain or snow. 
</P>
<P>
Another method uses rigid foam board insulation. This packs in more R-value per 
inch and produces a very flat and level look to the roof. It is slightly more 
expensive than the fiberglass batt insulation. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 380, showing a list of 
manufacturers of flexible and sheet-metal roof-overs, information and 
specifications of roof-overs, sample do-it-yourself installation instructions, 
and a small sample piece of the flexible sheet. Please include $1 and a 
self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, Los 
Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

Oversized Fuses Can Lead to Dangers 
</P>
<P>
Q: My house still has fuses in the electrical panel. There are 20- and 30-amp 
fuses in it. Would it save any electricity to put 30-amp fuses in all the 
sockets to reduce the resistance through the fuses? 
</P>
<P>
A: You should never increase the size of the fuses in a panel. The fuses are 
sized based on the gauge of the wire in the walls. If a small-gauge wire 
carries too much current, it can get too hot and cause a fire. A 
larger-capacity fuse will not reduce the overall resistance and losses. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in an older house, fuses often blow. When the houses were built, 
they were not designed for many large electrical appliances. Although fuses 
sometimes are a hassle, they offer excellent protection.

SAN BERNARDINO SALES DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a scalding spring, the market for new home sales in San Bernardino County 
cooled considerably during the summer, according to the Competitive Housing 
Market Report issued this month by the Meyers Group. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers' audit of all new residential projects in the county from June through 
August showed that sales totaled 2,482, which was 16.26% below the 2,974 units 
sold from March through May. 
</P>
<P>
As sales dropped during the quarter ending Aug. 31, detached-home prices 
increased slightly, with the base median price rising from $153,940 to 
$153,990. With limited numbers of condominiums and townhouses available, the 
base median price for attached housing remained at $101,990. 
</P>
<P>
The market flattened in part because San Bernardino draws buyers from Orange 
and Los Angeles counties, where housing has shifted from a seller's to a 
buyer's market, said Steve Johnson, vice president of a Meyers Group division 
based in Corona.

THE TOUGH NEW SNAIL ON THE BLOCK 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Some people go to the Los Angeles County Fair to see pigs wallowing in sawdust 
or to ride the Giant Slide or to buy the latest slice-and-dice contraption or 
to admire the prize-winning decorated cakes. 
</P>
<P>
But some go for the snails, says Raymond Harrie. "I've heard a lot of people 
say they wouldn't come if it wasn't for the snails," says Harrie, a slight man 
with stringy blond hair and bloodshot blue eyes that make him look as if he's 
been spending a lot of time in a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Harrie, 34, a resident of Apple Valley, has about a quarter of a million of 
them over in the commercial part of Flowers and Garden, right there among the 
bonsai trees and miracle plant food and wind chimes and convertible hammocks 
being hawked by tradesmen. Seed your yard with Harrie's killers, he suggests, 
and they'll blow away those pest snails that have been eating your dahlias. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the tough new snail on the block," says Harrie, who brims with 
good-natured snail humor. 
</P>
<P>
Browsers in the exhibit hall see Harrie's sign, complete with blow-ups of 
killer snail throttling pest snail, and they move apprehensively toward the 
booth, ready to stop short if some leashed gastropod mollusk the size of a 
Labrador retriever, antennae quivering, should suddenly dart out from under the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
"What do the killers eat?" asks one browser. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch those fingers," says Harrie mischievously. "Don't fall asleep in the 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
Take away the livestock exhibits and the home arts, and the County Fair is a 
lot like a big medicine show, with pitchmen giving demonstrations of scroll 
saws or synthetic chamois cloths or signing up passers-by for hot tub drawings 
and encyclopedia raffles. The fair, snake oil salesmen and all, runs through 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the time-honored tradition of the medicine show, there's often an element of 
exaggeration to those enticing sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look Like Dead Mollusks 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, for example, hawkers were selling wood lathing machines ("They'll 
make any man happy"), cushions with battery-operated "fingers" (offering "the 
secrets of Shiatsu, a 1,000-year-old Japanese tradition in finger pressure 
massage"), amazing buffing rags and vegetable slicers that can make scalloped 
potatoes in 10 seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
At first sight, Harrie's claims about his killers seem a little exaggerated, 
too. The snails look a lot like little sea mollusks. Dead ones. 
</P>
<P>
Harrie, who runs a snail-growing company called Bio-Con Systems, keeps them in 
little plastic containers, like cottage cheese vats, which go for $20 apiece. 
There are 100 to a container, thin, elongated creatures that don't seem to be 
moving at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the wrong time of day," says Harrie blithely. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, he says, compared to his little Rumina decollata snails, the garden 
variety pest snail is a world-traveling marauder, ranging freely across gardens 
and yards, stopping for a meal or two of marigold or lettuce before moving on 
in a perpetual journey of destruction. The Genghis Khan of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
But in a good year, the killer snail, a burrower who was probably introduced to 
California many years ago on citrus trees imported from North Africa, may 
travel 60 feet. That's the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
"What he does is consistent with what you're trying to do in your yard," Harrie 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the little crawlers don't climb all over your walls and 
windows, leaving slime trails on your driveway or destroying your plants, like 
the pest snails. But they do eat dead leaves and help to aerate the soil, like 
earthworms. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a composter," says Harrie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freeway Nuisance 
</P>
<P>
Not so the marauders (Helix aspersa). They proliferate in slimy concentrations 
of 2 million per acre, Harrie says, and they love irrigated freeway medians and 
shoulders. In San Bernardino County, before the county introduced killers like 
Harrie's 15 years ago, there were so many pest snails that they created slick 
spots on freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"People were sliding into bridge pilings," says Harrie, an agricultural 
biologist who works full time for the San Bernardino County Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials confirm that Decollata snails have been used for at least 
seven or eight years to stop pest snails. "The main problem was that the pests 
were detrimental to plants," says Paul Drew, area superintendent for Caltrans' 
Los Angeles metropolitan district. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not a problem any more," added Drew, a 22-year veteran of Caltrans who 
used to work as a landscape specialist. "Eight years ago, there was a big 
anticipation (of pest snail proliferation). Then we went into Decollata." No 
more Helix aspersa. 
</P>
<P>
And no chemicals were spread in the process, Drew said: "It's biological 
control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shell-to-Shell Combat 
</P>
<P>
The killer snails often don't kill, Harrie confesses. They wound. They follow 
the pest snail's slime trail and attack it while it's laying eggs, he said, 
twisting into the shell like a screw. "Sometimes the pests survive the attack, 
but when they do, they're clinging to the wall with their wounds," he says. 
"That's an inactive snail." 
</P>
<P>
It's also one that can't procreate. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure these guys will win?" says one of the many curious who stop at 
Harrie's booth, pointing skeptically at some of the inert little creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable," Harrie says. "You see, he doesn't fight fair." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chemical Problems 
</P>
<P>
Serious gardeners are impressed. "I have a lot of snails," says Reiko Kawasaka, 
a San Gabriel woman who has just bought two vats of killers. "They eat up all 
the aspidistra and the dahlias and even the marigolds. I used a lot of 
chemicals before, but I was afraid they'd seep into the soil." 
</P>
<P>
Ron and Betty Edgerly have seen a pest snail almost as big as his fist in their 
Glendora yard. "They strip the flowers and leaves," said Betty. "Have chemicals 
worked? Not really. We still have snails." 
</P>
<P>
"Buy a whole lot," said Ryan Bushik, 10, to his mother, who described the boy 
as the "snail patrol" in her Buena Park garden. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves stomping on them," said Julie Bushik. 
</P>
<P>
Harrie looks admiringly at his little killers. "It's basically just a selfish 
little animal," said Harrie, tucking the $20-bills bills into his pocket. "It 
won't share its territory with other mollusks." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT ARE KILLER SNAILS? Predatory snails used to control pest snail populations

<P>
Feed on dead plant matter but not on live plants. 
</P>
<P>
Attack and eat pest snails as a territorial behavior.

COMMITTEE SET UP TO RAISE FUNDS TO RECALL TUCKER 
</P>

<P>
A political action committee has been established to raise money for a recall 
campaign against Mayor Walter R. Tucker, and organizers say they will serve the 
mayor with a recall notice at the Oct. 3 City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee to Recall Mayor Walter Tucker was established by Basil Kimbrew, a 
local activist and a paid political consultant, after the mayor suggested at a 
Sept. 13 press conference that the city dismantle its Fire and Police 
departments and contract with Los Angeles County for those services. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, citing the city's poor financial health, said Compton could no 
longer afford its own Police and Fire departments and that the county could 
provide the same level of public safety service at a lower cost. Tucker's 
suggestion drew angry responses from firefighters and police officers, some of 
whom are talking about joining the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tucker Says He's Not Worried 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said last week that he is not worried about the talk of recall and 
accused Councilwoman Patricia Moore of being behind it. "Her stooges, her 
cronies," are organizing the recall effort, he said. "She's in it as thick as I 
don't know what." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew managed Moore's successful campaign this spring to oust incumbent 
Councilman Floyd James. Kimbrew also managed the unsuccessful campaign of 
Tucker's opponent in the mayoral runoff election in June. Tucker, a 64-year-old 
dentist, was elected to his third mayoral term, garnering more than 60% of the 
vote . 
</P>
<P>
Moore denied having anything to do with the recall effort. "That's giving me an 
awful lot of credit and influence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew also denied that Moore was involved. He said he and Benjamin Holifield, 
his partner in the recall effort, will be joined Tuesday or Wednesday by a host 
of other Compton residents at a press conference to launch the recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew said the group is seeking to recall Tucker because the mayor lied 
during the election campaign by insisting that the city was financially sound. 
At the time, some city officials were acknowledging privately that there would 
be a severe budget crunch this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Administration in Turmoil 
</P>
<P>
After the June election, when the council faced the task of putting together a 
new budget, it became clear that the city was in poor financial health. About 
100 employees were laid off, the city's ambulance service was abolished, and 
some police and fire officers were demoted. City Manager James Goins also was 
abruptly fired by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said this week that he did not know at the time of his reelection 
campaign that the city was financially strapped. "Staff said there wasn't 
anything wrong," Tucker said, insisting that it is the city manager's job to 
prepare the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Once the city clerk certifies a recall notice, proponents would have 120 days 
to gather about 8,000 signatures on petitions asking the council to hold an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew insisted that he had no candidates in mind to replace Tucker if the 
recall is successful. Moore said: "I have not envisioned being anything else 
but a good council person." 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort, Kimbrew said, will be built around a group called Concerned 
Citizens of Compton. Kimbrew and Holifield, a local businessman who was an 
unsuccessful candidate in this year's City Council elections, organized the 
group this summer. They claim to have about 120 members. 
</P>
<P>
Police in particular are likely to play an active role if there is a recall 
election to oust the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"He's attacked us job-wise and we don't think he has any foundation to be 
talking like he's talking," said Marvin Branscomb, president of the Compton 
Peace Officers Assn. "He hasn't done his homework," said Branscomb, referring 
to the mayor's assertion that the city could get the same level of service if 
it dissolved its Police Department and contracted with the county sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Though the police union has not formally addressed the recall issue, Branscomb 
said, he believes many of his members would be heavily involved in a recall 
campaign. "I can see some of our officers carrying petitions," Branscomb said. 
</P>
<P>
Eli Curtis, head of the firefighters union, said its executive board had 
instructed him not to make public statements about the mayor's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department ranks are split on the issue of a county takeover. Many older 
firefighters who also hold command positions in the department are worried that 
the county would not absorb them into its ranks. Younger firefighters, many of 
whom eventually shift to the county department, are not as worried, according 
to Compton Fire Department sources. 
</P>
<P>
However, one longtime Compton firefighter said he expects his union to 
contribute time and money to any recall effort. "Face it," said the 
firefighter, who asked not to be named, "this guy doesn't want us around, so, 
we don't want him around. That's the bottom line."

his chalk across the walls of his home in China's Zhejiang province. 
</P>
<P>
"I just liked drawing," the bespectacled artist, now 50, says simply, in 
Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Jiang, his creations were rewarded with praise instead of a 
spanking. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half a century later and halfway across the globe, the unassuming Jiang 
is still the subject of praise. In fact, he is touted by some as one of the 
most exciting and original artists to emerge from China in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"He is (China's) most creative, most modern artist," said Henry Riseman, 
director of the New England Center for Contemporary Art. The museum, in 
Brooklyn, Conn., has introduced the work of Chinese artists for each of the 
last 15 years, and now displays 36 of Jiang's paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang appeared on the American scene as a visiting artist in 1983 and never 
returned to China. Working from his home in Arcadia, he marvels at how well his 
pieces are selling at galleries throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His paintings, which were censored in China because they so starkly violated 
conventional style, evoke romance and maternal love with cultural symbols, 
vibrant colors and complex lines. 
</P>
<P>
The shapes and forms of subjects take on more importance than the content, he 
explained in a 1981 essay he published in a Chinese art journal. A 1985 
painting -- "Line Symphony" -- appears at first glance to be a pleasant maze of 
white lines with splashes of green and yellow, red and blue. A closer look 
reveals a flock of birds in flight, cranes and a fish interwoven into the 
sensuous outlines of four reclining women. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been nothing like this before," said Jamie Ellin Forbes, publisher of 
Sun Storm Arts Magazine, based in Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first came, nobody had had a taste of this (genre) of art yet," Forbes 
said, adding that academicians in this country are just getting interested in 
Jiang's paintings. "He has staying power," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang, a graduate of Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts, bristles at some 
reviewers' suggestions that his works are merely a borrowing of Western modern 
art techniques to depict Chinese themes. 
</P>
<P>
Although he admires modern European artists such as Picasso, Kandinsky and 
Chagall, he notes that abstract work is not new to Chinese art. 
</P>
<P>
"There were artists in the Tang Dynasty who put paint on their own bodies, then 
rolled on paper to create abstract paintings," he points out. He himself was 
inspired by ancient Buddhist murals that portray nude figures and complex 
designs, as well as by primitive cave paintings, with their bold use of color. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang was also fascinated by the lives and rural customs of villagers in the 
ethnically diverse province of Yunnan, where he spent 19 years painting 
political posters and murals for the Mao Zedong government during the Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
After hours, he worked late into the night developing his own style on the 
wooden planks of his bed, rebelling against the traditionally simple 
compositions of officially approved art and the taboo against nudity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enraptured by Tribesmen 
</P>
<P>
While living in Yunnan, he became enraptured by the people of a local tribe 
known as the Sani, whom he portrayed in a government-commissioned mural that he 
painted at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In another painting, titled 
"Moon Dance," four Sani women cavort in the glow of a red moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they danced until dawn!" said Jiang, laughing at the memory of the 
nightly celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
He later continued to paint as a professor at the Yunnan Art Institute. But he 
received hints that the government did not appreciate his experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
At an exhibition for artists from the Yunnan region at Beijing's National Art 
Gallery in 1981, Jiang was excluded from television coverage, and officials 
convened a meeting after the show to condemn his efforts as "not suitable to 
socialism." Later his works were rejected for permanent inclusion in the 
gallery's collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so sorry for that action," Jiang said. "I don't think it's an artist's 
museum; it's a government (tool)." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the restrictions on his work, he decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in the United States in 1983, Jiang settled in Minnesota. In 1986 
he moved to Arcadia to escape the cold winters. He lives with his wife, 
Zhaolin, and two sons in a four-bedroom home with a pool and billiard room. 
</P>
<P>
The Tian An Men Square massacre in June has reinforced his view that liberties 
under the Chinese government are too unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pained," he said. "People want freedom -- artists, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Switch to Oil 
</P>
<P>
Although most recently Jiang has worked with acrylic paints on rice paper, he 
intends to switch to oil on canvas soon. His paintings sell for between $20,000 
and $65,000, but he says commercial success is not his primary goal; 
recognition from the art world is. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's agent, Minnesota gallery director Allan Fingerhut, said such a goal 
won't be achieved overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so new, it takes (museums) a while to absorb it," Fingerhut said. 
Although about 50 of Jiang's paintings have been sold this year alone, "it 
really takes about 20 years of being out there for any recognition or 
acceptability by the public and institutions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Riseman of the New England museum is organizing a national 
university tour of 22 of Jiang's prints, which will begin in the spring. And 19 
of Jiang's works will be on exhibition at the "Art Expo Cal 1989," to be held 
at the Los Angeles Convention Center next month. 
</P>
<P>
While he continues his struggle for recognition, Jiang has decided to make 
America his permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
He smiled, then answered: "Freedom, no limit."

AFTER ANOTHER CUT IN SIZE, AIRPORT PROJECT WINS PLANNERS' OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sprawling commercial office and retail project next to Santa Monica Municipal 
Airport is getting smaller and smaller. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission Thursday voted 4 to 0 with one abstention to reduce the 
project, to be known as Santa Monica Common, to between 600,000 and 750,000 
square feet from the 1 million square feet to which it had been reduced 
earlier. The developer, Reliance Development Group, had agreed to a city staff 
recommendation that the project be reduced from its original proposal of 1.3 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation now goes to the City Council, which will hold a 
public hearing on Oct. 3, and make a final decision the following week. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Ralph Mechum proposed the further reduction because it would have 
less impact on traffic. Some commissioners disputed the projected traffic in an 
environmental impact report and said that by recommending the smaller project, 
any margin of error would be remedied. 
</P>
<P>
However a spokesman for the developer discounted the commission's decision as a 
vote "to go home. They could not reach a consensus," said attorney Chris 
Harding. The council cast its vote shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Harding said that the smaller project would not be economically viable. He said 
it would have to be between 822,000 and 1 million square feet for it to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the City Council will act irresponsibly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory for Residents 
</P>
<P>
The further reduction of the project represents a victory for many homeowners 
in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Santa Monica and the Mar Vista area of Los 
Angeles. Although many residents were pushing for no project at all, most were 
willing to accept a smaller project. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought they would go this low," said Greg Thomas, a Los Angeles 
resident. "I'm elated." 
</P>
<P>
With a smaller project -- to be built on a portion of 37.56 acres of city-owned 
land at Bundy Drive and Airport Avenue in the airport's southeast corner -- 
there would be no "significant" effect on traffic, according to an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1-million-square-foot proposal, three intersections -- all in Los 
Angeles -- would have been "significantly" affected during morning rush hour, 
the environmental report found. Those intersections were Bundy Drive and Ocean 
Park Boulevard, Centinela and Rose avenues and Centinela Avenue and Palms 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Curran, the city's director of community and economic development, had 
said that, despite those potential traffic problems, the project had been 
scaled back to a "prudent level to recommend approval of the project." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Office Space 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how the project would be scaled down was unclear Thursday night. 
However, under the 1-million-square-foot project proposed by the city staff, 
the amount of office space would have been 977,000 square feet. The other 
components would have been 21,370 square feet of retail space, 7,250 square 
feet of restaurants and 8,700 square feet for a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
The project would have been built in three phases, with completion expected by 
mid-1996. It would have covered 29 acres, with the remainder available for city 
facilities for cultural and recreational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the project would be on Bundy Drive, just north of the 
current intersection with Airport Avenue. The main road would accommodate two 
inbound and four outbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents of Sunset Park northwest and southeast of the airport oppose the 
project because they fear it would create traffic problems on their already 
increasingly congested narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Much Traffic 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Mar Vista and other Los Angeles neighborhoods complained that, 
because of its location, the project would result in traffic pouring onto Los 
Angeles streets without residents enjoying any of the financial benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project, including former Santa Monica Mayor James Conn said 
it is needed because of the revenue it would produce. 
</P>
<P>
Financial estimates for the smaller project were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1 million square foot proposal, the city would have received one-time 
payments of about $5.85 million in housing and parks fees and $507,200 in fees 
for building and engineering permits. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School 
District would have received $243,500 in development fees. 
</P>
<P>
The city would have received about $1.25 million annually in taxes and fees 
beginning in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest source of revenue would be rent. The developer would make annual 
payments on a 55-year lease on the land -- with two 10-year extensions 
available at the developer's option -- and the city also would get a percentage 
of revenues received by the developer from project tenants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projected Rental Income 
</P>
<P>
Under the larger project, the city estimated that its rental income would total 
$28 million for the first 10 years after completion and $103 million for the 
first 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The developer is seeking a development agreement, which would protect the 
developer from any mid-project rules changes by guaranteeing that the project 
can be built under current city building standards. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 people attended a public hearing on the matter recently at the Santa 
Monica Civic Auditorium. Most of the audience appeared to oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the city needs the revenue the project would generate, but 
opponents said traffic problems the project would create outweighed any 
financial gain.

TURNBULL CANYON FIRE VICTIMS DECLARED ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL DISASTER REPAIR 
LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Owners of 14 homes that were destroyed by a July 3 brush fire in Hacienda 
Heights may be breathing a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
The area, 1,500 acres of charred fruit orchards and upper-middle-class homes, 
has just been declared a disaster area by the U.S. Small Business 
Administration, making homeowners eligible for loans to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
The swirling blaze tore through Turnbull Canyon and ruined two garages, seven 
vehicles and 10 other structures, whose owners can also apply for the loans 
through the agency's Los Angeles branch. Damages to structures and personal 
property were estimated at $5.2 million, and $1.8 million worth of landscaping 
and orchards burned. Land and property worth about $1.6 million was uninsured 
or under-insured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rebuild Lives' 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrific news because of all the devastation," said Judy Hammond, 
spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who represents 
the area. "It was not only an emotional hardship but a financial hardship. The 
money will help rebuild lives." 
</P>
<P>
The disaster program offers up to $100,000 for each damaged home, up to $20,000 
for personal property, and up to $500,000 for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of financial assistance from local agencies prompted Schabarum and 
his colleagues to turn to the state, which in turn asked the Small Business 
Administration to declare the ruined area a disaster area. Although the recent 
action comes 2 1/2 months after the fire, applicants probably won't see money 
for three more months, said Lynda Schuler, spokeswoman for U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-Calif.), who announced the agency's decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"When the (October, 1987) Whittier earthquake came through, they expedited the 
funds," Schuler said, "but (the victims of the Hacienda Heights fire) are a 
small number, at least in the government's eyes."

'INDUSTRIOUSNESS' OF SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first page of Sunday's (Sept. 17) Westside section reported on the 
industriousness of Santa Monica officials. They are very busy indeed -- busy 
attempting to destroy Los Angeles residential neighborhoods. They will reap the 
monetary benefits of an expanded Santa Monica Airport, while Los Angeles 
residents bear the brunt of the increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
They also have been working to ram a light rail line through along Exposition 
Boulevard. It would go through commercial property in Santa Monica and through 
lovely residential areas in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Where will they strike next?

HOUSING IN THE PICO-FAIRFAX AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Homeowners Pass on Money to Save the Neighborhood" (Times, Sept. 7). 
</P>
<P>
This article describes a serious problem facing our community today -- bad 
urban planning. A good general plan should be well-thought-out and consistent. 
It balances the needs of neighborhoods with the needs of the city as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The Pico-Fairfax area has been zoned and master planned for multiple 
residential use for many years. There was little demand for that kind of 
development in this location until recently. With the continued growth of Los 
Angeles, new housing is sorely needed. Some of that need for moderate-priced 
housing, close to downtown and near good bus transportation and important roads 
(i.e. Santa Monica Freeway, Pico, Venice &amp; Washington boulevards) can be 
met in this area, just as the community plan envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Without close-in housing, people will travel further and add to traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
If our political leaders are sincere about effecting a better balance between 
jobs and housing in the Los Angeles region and encourage new moderate-income 
housing, master plans should not be so easily superseded by accommodating 
politics and, as your staff writer astutely reported, avaricious property 
owners.

WRESTLER WILL TEACH OTHERS HOW TO DEAL WITH THEIR HEAVY PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to wrestle with a weighty problem? Want to learn how to wrestle with a 
weighty problem? 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a wrestling buff you love to wrestle, and you run out of lawns and 
living rooms; you get thrown out of the house, and you have to find a place," 
said Verne Langdon, 47. So, Langdon created Slammers Wrestling Gym in Sun 
Valley. He says it will be the first of its kind in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The gym is scheduled to open to the public the first week of October. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tennis clubs, volleyball courts, football fields, baseball diamonds 
and even roller rinks," said Langdon, a tall, muscular, blond-maned man with 
pearly white teeth and giant hands that could most assuredly make zucchini 
squash out of any pencil-necked geek who got in his way. 
</P>
<P>
Slammers, housed in a unit of an industrial warehouse complex on Branford 
Street, materialized after Langdon saw the need for a place where pros and 
amateurs could work out and train between matches, as well as a need for a 
professional wrestling school in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we wrestlers don't have to take a back seat anymore. No more wrestling in 
the grass or knocking over somebody's heirloom gimcrack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dean of Education' 
</P>
<P>
Langdon, a producer and writer in the motion picture and record businesses, 
said that his partner Wesley Eure will operate the gym, but that it will be 
professional wrestler Lillian Ellison who will be the principal trainer and 
"dean of education." 
</P>
<P>
Better known as "the Fabulous Moolah" and giving her age only as "14 years 
older than my daughter," Ellison started training when she was 12 and turned 
pro three years later. She says she never looked back. Today she owns "Camp 
Moolah," a wrestling school in South Carolina, and laughs easily about her 
33-year career and her plans for Slammers. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting inside the taped area of what will become the wrestling ring, she said, 
"I'm going to be teaching everybody how to wrestle." The clamor of workmen 
putting finishing touches on the walls and ceiling made her pause a moment. 
"It'll be the real style of wrestling. Professional holds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, I weighed 100 pounds, and everybody told me I wasn't 
going to make it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in her eye confirms that her passion for wrestling hasn't diminished 
over the years, despite her having suffered a broken neck, broken collarbones 
(including a compound fracture), fingers, toes, a dislocated knee, a dislocated 
shoulder and numerous broken ribs during her career. "They said I wasn't going 
to make it," she repeated, "but I did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disdains Mud Wrestling 
</P>
<P>
The Moolah's knowledge will be imparted in a course designed for men, women and 
children in sessions five days a week for three months or three days a week for 
six months. The cost is expected to be about $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it because I enjoy it, and I know what a hard time I had getting 
started," she said. "There's so many girls and men who want to get started and 
don't know how, and there's not many promoters who will help newcomers get 
started." A mention of mud wrestling in Hollywood doesn't sit well. "Mud 
wrestling," she replied curtly, "is not wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
For Langdon, the school represents a dream come true. "I've wanted to do 
something like this since I was a kid," he said, remembering when his father 
took him to the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. "The cigar smoke, beer and 
popcorn smells, the American Legion band playing 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' I 
love the wrestling and the stars of today, but wrestling at the Civic and being 
there with my dad those nights, it just beat everything." 
</P>
<P>
The experience, he said, instilled in him the thrill of the sport forever. 
</P>
<P>
Langdon said he spent three months looking for a building. "I thought the 
difficult thing would be to get the ring. But that was easy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Right Spot 
</P>
<P>
The building needed ceilings at least 10 1/2 feet high. And many places turned 
him down after hearing of his plans. A standard response was, "We're really not 
interested in having something like you in our building," Langdon said. It came 
together for him, however, in Sun Valley, with a combination of the right 
building, roof height and price. And, he said, "It's not too far from my home." 
</P>
<P>
Langdon and the Fabulous Moolah insist that there is a big difference between a 
wrestling gym and one used for boxing. 
</P>
<P>
In wrestling, the ring is a bit smaller and there are three ropes instead of 
the four used in boxing rings. Rope work, Ellison said, is very important in 
wrestling. Wrestlers need to bounce off the ropes and if they're not careful 
they'll go through them. 
</P>
<P>
At Slammers, mats for Greco-Roman style wrestling will also be provided. A hall 
of fame will display tapes, photos, films and books on some of wrestling's 
greats: for example, Gorgeous George, the Torres Brothers and Mr. Moto, and 
current heavyweights Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's All Work' 
</P>
<P>
Langdon and the Fabulous Moolah scoff at the suggestion that wrestling is pure 
put-on. 
</P>
<P>
"People get confused about the shows," Ellison said. "My robe and attire, 
that's my show. And I show it off when I get into the ring. But when I disrobe, 
there's no show; it's all work. Like any other professional sport, wrestling 
has to be entertainment, too, otherwise everybody is going to fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Langdon agreed. "It's not easy to learn, and it's not easy to know the holds. 
It's not easy to get out of something that someone else has got you in that 
hurts a lot. It's tough, and it's tough to learn," he said, pulling up his left 
pants leg to show an 8-inch scar where someone fell on him the wrong way, 
shattering his leg so badly it took 16 permanent screws to put it back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Langdon said he welcomes anyone who likes to wrestle: amateurs, professionals, 
novices or fans. Even wimps. "Everyone except Pee-wee Herman," he said with a 
laugh, then quickly changed his mind. "Nah, Pee-wee can come, too."

On a busy day, things can get really slow around Jan Gordon's house. 
</P>
<P>
She has been known to have more than 30 turtles and tortoises in her Sylmar 
back yard, all of them looking to her for food, shelter and, yes, comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"Gardeners are notorious for leaving gates open, and people find lost tortoises 
walking down the street all the time," said Gordon, who for the last six years 
has been adoption coordinator for the California Turtle and Tortoise Club's San 
Fernando Valley chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"The animal shelters have our phone number, the zoo has our number and any time 
they get a tortoise they don't know what to do with, they turn it in to us." 
</P>
<P>
Formed 25 years ago to provide information on the proper care of various 
species of turtles and tortoises, the club has six Southern California chapters 
and nearly 2,500 members. Groups meet monthly, Gordon said, and also work in 
cooperation with the state Department of Fish and Game to place endangered 
tortoises in people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supply and Demand 
</P>
<P>
This tortoise "adoption" is a major focus of the club. Finding homes for the 
reptiles -- some of which weigh more than 50 pounds -- isn't difficult. "The 
average wait for a California desert tortoise is one year, and there's a 
four-year wait for females," Gordon said. Other types of tortoises are in 
demand, she said, but none is as sought-after as the California desert 
tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage breeding, Gordon added, female desert tortoises are placed only in 
homes where there already is a male. The club has had the policy for some time, 
but members say it is even more important now because the California desert 
tortoise was placed on the endangered species list by the Department of Fish 
and Game in July. Earlier this month, the federal Bureau of Land Management 
quarantined 37,700 acres in the Mojave Desert to protect the tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been dying off by the thousands," said Marc Graff, a Los Angeles 
psychiatrist and president of the club's San Fernando Valley chapter. "Part of 
it has been due to developers and off-road vehicles, but a lot of people have 
brought them back from the desert and then didn't know how to care for them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the uprooted tortoises developed a respiratory disease -- possibly 
caused by smog -- and many were taken back to the desert when their owners no 
longer wanted them, Graff said. Soon the disease spread to other desert 
tortoises. "They've been dropping like flies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than place the California desert tortoises back into their natural 
habitat, club members ask that they be turned in to the club. They also stress 
the importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Homes 
</P>
<P>
"They're becoming like the condor, and that's why captive breeding is so 
important," Gordon said, adding that homes with unfenced swimming pools, 
aggressive dogs or easily escapable yards would probably be ruled out as good 
homes. "We have to protect these guys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After a California desert tortoise is placed in a new home, Gordon said, the 
owner fills out a permit that is mailed to Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The California desert tortoise, which cannot be legally sold in pet stores, 
isn't the only species in trouble. Many of the more exotic tortoise species 
have been threatened by the worldwide destruction of rain forests. Their 
numbers, too, are dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago we had all kinds of tortoises. Now it's extremely difficult to 
get ahold of any of them," said Michael Gutierrez, manager of the Pet Emporium 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Some South American tortoises, which Gutierrez said were easily found five 
years ago, can now cost $800 in pet stores. Greek tortoises, which sold for $65 
three years ago, now cost $275, he said. A five-inch pancake tortoise from 
South America sells for $90 at Pet Emporium. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market went down, but the tortoise market has gone up," Gutierrez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The club, however, does not charge for tortoise adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
Although many club members breed turtles or tortoises, Graff said most did not 
join for that reason. Most simply needed more information on how to care for 
their pet and heard about the club through the turtle grapevine -- pet owners, 
pet stores and club members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out from Boston to go to law school and I brought my two tortoises with 
me. When one of them got sick, though, I realized I was just flying by the seat 
of my pants," said Michele MacDonald, a Silver Lake attorney who discovered the 
club two months ago. "I've found out some things not to do and have gotten some 
good advice from other turtle lovers." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Connors, a UCLA biochemist whose Reseda home is the stomping ground for 40 
turtles and tortoises, learned some similar lessons early on. While still a 
student, Connors kept several tortoises in his Santa Monica apartment. 
Uncertain of what to feed them, he put them on a typical college student's 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pizza for Tortoises 
</P>
<P>
"I used to feed them pizza," he said, smiling somewhat sheepishly. "It wasn't 
the best possible diet for them." 
</P>
<P>
So just what is it, newcomers inevitably ask, that catches a turtle's culinary 
fancy? It depends on the species, comes the inevitable answer. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who has box turtles and California desert tortoises, as well as several 
exotic species -- including a diamond-speckled Greek tortoise and a red-nosed 
variety called the red leg tortoise -- says that just like with people, tastes 
among tortoises vary. As a result, she said, pleasing their palates can be time 
consuming. 
</P>
<P>
"I go outside every morning and it can take me two hours just to feed them 
all," she said. "Desert tortoises are vegetarians, and so I'll feed them peas, 
carrots, corn, lettuce, hibiscus flowers and dandelions. Red legs tend to like 
fruit more. Box turtles like snails and earthworms." 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget about varying that menu. "Tortoises get bored with the same 
thing day after day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Learning 
</P>
<P>
Betty Alice Kinder, secretary of the San Fernando Valley chapter, said she has 
been around tortoises since she was a child and is still learning things. Sixty 
years ago, she said, a tortoise her mother found along the California Aqueduct 
became a member of the family. Kinder had the tortoise as a pet until its death 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was operated on for bladder stones," she said, a touch of sadness in her 
voice. "But I guess she was just old." 
</P>
<P>
Club members point out that, with the proper care, many tortoises can outlive 
their owners. Desert tortoises can live to be 100. Box turtles, which can grow 
larger than a man's fist, can live to 40 or 50. Galapagos tortoises, which 
often resemble slowly moving boulders and can weigh several hundred pounds, may 
live to be older than 150. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect mine to be around a long time," Gordon said. "I put them in my will 
for my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Not all questions the group hears have to do with eating habits or illnesses, 
though. Susan Lockhart of Reseda joined the club in 1985 when she was given a 
tortoise and didn't know how to care for it. Now she has a different problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Mean One 
</P>
<P>
"I just got this European tortoise, and he's a mean one. He bites my other 
tortoises and I'm not sure what to do with him," Lockhart said at the club's 
annual chapterwide meeting, held recently at Casa de Tortuga (Spanish for 
"Turtle House") in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, Casa de Tortuga is a fitting place for the gathering. Owned by 
retired businessman Walter Allen, the house, tucked away on a residential 
street and resembling the homes next to it, is literally wall-to-wall turtles 
and tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who lives in another home he owns next door, converted the residence 
several years ago for the benefit of the several hundred tortoises he has 
adopted over the years. Among the residents are two Galapagos tortoises named 
Daphne and Darwin -- Daphne is on permanent loan from the Honolulu Zoo -- that 
take up a large portion of one fenced lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Running pools in the back yard hold at least 100 water turtles, each one the 
size of a dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you remember the tiny, flat water turtles you got as a kid that always died 
within a week?" Connors asked as he looked into the pool. "Well, these are the 
same kind. It's just that very few people knew how to care for them properly." 
</P>
<P>
But Connors said of Allen: "He has it down to a fine art." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devoted Fans 
</P>
<P>
What is it about turtles and tortoises that arouses such devotion and interest? 
</P>
<P>
Some members say it is because tortoises are clean and don't shed like cats or 
dogs. Others are intrigued by a species that socialized with the dinosaurs. 
Gordon cites the affectionate nature of one 80-year-old tortoise that likes to 
fall asleep on her foot. Graff likes the way his tortoise scratches at the back 
door when she wants to come in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say they are particularly intelligent," Graff said. "But they hold 
your interest." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the group itself. Members say the meetings give them a chance 
to meet interesting people with varied backgrounds, with only one thing that 
bonds them all. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of warmth and a lot of friendly people," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of atmosphere, it would seem, that could bring even the shyest types 
out of their shells.

CENTER GIVES DEAF STUDENTS SOME HIGH-TECH HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY, Mackey is a regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deaf students returning to Cal State Northridge this semester are getting 
high-tech help with note taking. 
</P>
<P>
An experimental classroom with a built-in projection screen, fashioned after 
one at Gallaudet University in Washington, now allows deaf students to see a 
close-up image of a speaker while simultaneously reading remarks captioned at 
the bottom of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
"This changes the way deaf people will receive information," said Victor 
Galloway, director of the National Center on Deafness at CSUN. "It helps 
students in a classroom who are able to lip-read but who may be seated too far 
away. It also eliminates the need for an interpreter, since a court reporter 
simply types as the person speaks and it is transferred onto the screen." 
</P>
<P>
The classroom, however, isn't the only thing that is new on campus. Six months 
ago, the National Center on Deafness moved out of the cramped bungalow it had 
occupied for 27 years and into the spacious, new Jeanne M. Chisholm Hall. The 
move, students and faculty say, brought more than just an increase in breathing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Facility 
</P>
<P>
Housed now in a two-story, $2.7-million facility that includes state-of-the-art 
equipment, the National Center on Deafness, many people believe, has finally 
gotten the respect it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the largest support program for mainstreaming deaf students at any 
four-year college in the world, and yet the students here always wondered why 
the program was put in a temporary building," Galloway said. "When we moved 
into Chisholm Hall, it was a validation for them. Their self-image went way 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Those emotions, Galloway said, were not unlike sentiments expressed in March of 
last year by students at Gallaudet, the only liberal arts university in the 
world exclusively for deaf students. After 124 years of being run by a hearing 
administration, students, faculty and alumni there demanded -- and finally got 
-- a deaf president. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a major victory for deaf people everywhere," Galloway, who is deaf, 
said through his interpreter. "It symbolized the abilities of deaf people, as 
well as the changing way that deaf people are being perceived in the hearing 
community." 
</P>
<P>
It was not surprising then, that Gallaudet's first deaf president, I. King 
Jordan, was asked to be the featured speaker at the Jeanne Chisholm Hall open 
house last Saturday. The event was scheduled to coincide with International 
Deaf Awareness Week, which begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After the event, an awards banquet was scheduled for nationally recognized 
individuals who have made significant contributions in the field of deafness. 
</P>
<P>
Award recipients include Dr. Bernard Bragg, the deaf actor and mime whose work 
on stage and the PBS television series "The Quiet Man" is credited with paving 
the way for other deaf actors; U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), whose experiences 
with a deaf brother led to his sponsorship of several bills, including the 
recently passed Americans With Disabilities Act; Gary Olsen, executive director 
of the National Assn. of the Deaf; Ray Jones, past director of the CSUN center, 
and Julius Wiggins, publisher of The Silent News, a bimonthly newspaper by and 
for the deaf with a circulation of 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 18,500-square-foot Jeanne Chisholm Hall, built in brick with an open patio 
for studying or socializing, was completely funded through a donation to the 
university from former San Fernando Valley resident Grace Petri in memory of 
her younger sister. It is home to the center and the university's department of 
communicative disorders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Tests 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing the university's 215 hearing-impaired students with 
interpreting, note-taking, tutoring and counseling services, the center also 
has an audiology lab for hearing tests and one of the largest collections in 
the country of books and captioned videocassettes relating to deafness. 
</P>
<P>
Petri, 87, who lives in Palm Springs, didn't originally set out to help the 
university's deaf population, said Dorena Knepper, CSUN governmental and public 
affairs director. She was really more interested in doing something for the 
disabled in memory of her sister," Knepper said. "But she asked us, 'Well, what 
do you need?' We showed her the bungalow" that housed the center. 
</P>
<P>
Petri's affection for Chisholm, who died in 1978, appears to have gone far 
deeper than many sisterly bonds. For several decades, the two sisters worked as 
business partners in construction and industrial development, a field populated 
mostly by men. That partnership was largely responsible for the construction of 
Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, of which Chisholm was a co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded Council 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her involvement in philanthropic groups such as the Salvation 
Army and the YWCA, Chisholm also founded the Welfare Planning Council of the 
San Fernando Valley and helped found the local branch of the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a remarkable person, a wonderful woman to everybody," said Petri, who 
in recent years has lost much of her hearing. "She was so well known in the 
Valley and did so many things. I wanted a memorial to her." 
</P>
<P>
Petri, who has shunned publicity and initially stipulated that her donation 
remain anonymous, paused for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a beautiful building and it will do a lot of good," she said. "I think 
my sister would be quite happy."

SKY-DIVER LUCKY TO BE ALIVE AFTER CHUTE FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his hospital bed, with both legs in casts, rookie sky-diver Richard 
Leishman laughs about the moment in the Utah skies when his parachute failed to 
open fully. 
</P>
<P>
He was 4,000 feet above farmland of the Beehive State. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not mentally with it at that particular time," the Torrance resident 
recalled with a giggle. But it was no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
"My instructor kept talking to me on a one-way radio set. I thought I was going 
to land fine. I knew I was going a little fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his chute eventually opened almost all the way, its lines remained 
tangled and Leishman was unable to avoid a 15-foot ravine. He slammed into its 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The impact broke both legs below the knees. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just flopping around any which way when I rolled or slid down the 
hill," he said. "I was not a happy camper." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
End of His Vacation 
</P>
<P>
The event that ended his summer vacation began when some friends in Utah urged 
Leishman to try sky-diving. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like something fun to do. Then it came to the point of whether I 
could do it or not. Everyone has that fear of whether you will physically do 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conquering that fear was "the only macho thing involved," he said. "I wouldn't 
go out risking my neck if I thought I was going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Leishman, who works for Hughes Aircraft Co., took a four-hour course from a 
sky-diving firm called Cedar Valley Free Fall. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m. on Aug. 9, he strapped on a navy-blue and gray parachute, climbed 
into a Piper aircraft and took off from the Cedar Valley Airport. At 9,000 
feet, he and two instructors jumped, free-falling about 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Fall Was Fun 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of neat. It was different. . . . The fun part of sky-diving is 
free fall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His instructors, in accordance with their plan, pulled the rip cord to open 
Leishman's parachute. "It opened, but it didn't really open all the way. It had 
twisted lines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Leishman tried to remember what he had learned is an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
"They teach how to get out of twisted lines, but it didn't work," he said. "If 
it was just twisted lines, I would have gotten them out. There must have been 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Guthrie, the chief instructor for Cedar Valley Free Fall, said: "We will 
never know what happened." He said that Leishman could have avoided injury by 
following radioed instructions to cut his main chute clear and switch to the 
reserve chute. But Leishman continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"At 100 above the Earth, he had a collapsed parachute," Guthrie said, "At 50 
feet, the parachute got inflated again. He is the luckiest person on earth." 
</P>
<P>
The final twist was landing in the ravine. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened could not be duplicated," Guthrie said. "This ravine is the only 
obstacle in miles and miles of flat farm land," and if he hadn't smacked 
against the wall he probably would have come away unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the accident, Leishman has become the hot topic at American 
Fork Hospital in Lehi, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the physical therapists was in the area and he saw me coming down and 
he saw me land. He thought I had died" in the fall, Leishman said. The 
therapist told Leishman later that seeing the accident "had ruined his day, 
because he (thought he) had watched someone die. Then the next day he came to 
work and I was a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
His friends at Hughes, where Leishman works in inventory control, spread the 
word too. 
</P>
<P>
"My boss called me twice in the last two days and cussed me out because he 
needs me at work," Leishman said. "I would much rather be at work than a 
celebrity in a hospital bed." 
</P>
<P>
Leishman, a bicyclist and runner, said he will stick to those sports when his 
casts come off in six months. 
</P>
<P>
He said nothing like the accident had ever happened to him before, even during 
service with the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through boot camp and didn't get hurt," Leishman said. "I have learned 
my lesson. No-o-o, this kid is not going sky-diving again."

BACKWOODS BIKER BAR LACKS ONLY A PHONE 
</P>

<P>
In the market for a discreet rendezvous? 
</P>
<P>
The Pine Mountain Inn might be the perfect spot. 
</P>
<P>
It's out of the way. Coyotes far outnumber people around the ramshackle bar, 
which sits amid sage and juniper 28 miles north of Ojai off state Highway 33. 
Best estimates peg the population of locals at about six, give or take two or 
three. 
</P>
<P>
It's dark. The Pine Mountain Inn has no electricity, except for a diesel 
generator that's fired up for big parties and a solar-powered battery that can 
run a small radio and a few lights. 
</P>
<P>
It's cozy. The Pine Mountain Inn has no heat, save that from a wood stove. 
</P>
<P>
And it's definitely a spot where you can't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has No Telephone 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, according to owner Tom Wolf, Ventura County's most isolated 
watering spot may be just a little too isolated. 
</P>
<P>
The Pine Mountain Inn has no telephone -- and, despite a recent fund-raiser by 
its owners, it probably will remain without one. A donated cellular phone won't 
work in the remote spot without access to a U.S. Forest Service communications 
system, which authorities have denied. 
</P>
<P>
"The need up here is urgent," says Wolf, a former Ventura College biology 
instructor who bought the bar, a couple of cabins, some outbuildings and 20 
acres for $70,000 in 1977. "There's bears and rocks and ice and snow and 
summertime accidents." 
</P>
<P>
About 22 miles beyond the nearest telephone wire, the bar is a haven for 
bikers, who race there along tortuous switchbacks for a day in the sun on 
summer weekends. Hunters and campers drop in occasionally, and folks bound for 
a day of outback cross-country skiing happen by in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30-Minute Delay 
</P>
<P>
When they get in trouble, Wolf said, emergency help does not arrive as fast as 
it could because of a delay of as long as 30 minutes in getting to the nearest 
available phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost right away, we started to realize there are a lot of accidents out 
here. Up the road, a man flipped a Corvette. A couple of people rushed in to 
use the phone, but there was none. We went back there with our fire 
extinguishers, but by then the driver was burned to death." 
</P>
<P>
One man died after his motorcycle slammed into a hillside just a quarter of a 
mile from the bar, Wolf said. "He just lay there crumpled up for close to an 
hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bikers have collided with each other, with rock outcroppings and even, once, 
with a bear, he said. Hang gliders swooping off Pine Mountain have been 
injured, hikers have been stranded and hunters have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hikers Trapped 
</P>
<P>
"There are numerous accidents in that area," said Lt. Joe Funchess of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department. "The road is narrow and has quite a few 
switchbacks. Plus, we've had hikers trapped on cliffs." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Forest Service equipment that picks up weak radio signals and transmits 
them over the mountains to Ojai, Ventura and Santa Barbara is off limits to 
private businesses, Forest Service officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way the private sector can get in," said Ron Bassett, the Forest 
Service's district ranger in Ojai. "The traffic on Highway 33 is not our 
primary responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf investigated getting a CB radio for his mountain hideaway but found that 
they work only erratically. "We're 4,200 feet up, but we're surrounded by 
mountains," he said. "We can pick up Louisiana shrimp boats, we can get Mexico, 
but we can't get Ventura or Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Boxes 
</P>
<P>
By January, Caltrans plans on installing emergency call boxes every half-mile 
on sections of state roads in Ventura County, but the closest one to the Pine 
Mountain Inn will be about 35 miles away. And even if they were right next 
door, Wolf isn't so sure they'd help much. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that's put up along that road has two or three bullet holes in it in 
a little while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The freewheeling good times don't end at the bar's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Although the inn isn't pocked with bullet holes, it is festooned with dollar 
bills -- about 500 of them, tacked to the rafters, taped to antlers, rolled up 
and inserted into one nostril of a mounted deer's head. Customers leave their 
signed bills as deposits for future beers, sometimes along with their business 
cards. One man left a check for $5 million, marked "For Beer Only." 
</P>
<P>
Old whiskey bottles, a boar's head, a cow's skull, rusted ranch tools and a 
saddle also hang from the ceiling and walls. A tattered map of the Los Padres 
National Forest overlooks the pool table. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holds the Fort 
</P>
<P>
Wolf lives in a cabin at the place a few days a week but spends the rest of his 
time at his home in Oxnard. His manager, Shirley Bookout, lives there 
year-round and flips the burgers, orders the food -- the inn's refrigerator 
runs on propane -- and generally holds down the fort when he's not around. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, however, plans the bar's events. His fund-raiser last month -- complete 
with black-powder shooting contests, barbecue and bikini dancers -- drew more 
than 600 people. His Harley-Davidson parties have lured bikers from across the 
state. And in October, he plans to invite all hundred-odd people listed as 
"Wolf" or "Wolfe" in Ventura County phone directories to a party celebrating 
their diverse roots. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, emergencies worry him. If nothing else works, he says, he 
will take a crash course in amateur radio and pick up a ham operator's license. 
</P>
<P>
"We need dependable communications," he said. "That's all we ask."

BRAQUE AND PICASSO: ODD COUPLE; 
</P>
<P>
MOMA RETROSPECTIVE FOCUSES ON THE COLLABORATIVE BIRTH OF CUBISM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Today an epic exhibition opens at the Museum of Modern Art. Called "Picasso and 
Braque: Pioneering Cubism," it chronicles the birth of the century's most 
original and influential style in nearly 400 works. The event certainly ranks 
with the museum's landmark Picasso retrospective and its examination of 
Cezanne's late paintings. 
</P>
<P>
It's an astonishing show on many counts, not least of which is the fact that, 
after all these decades, it is the first in-depth sounding of the legendary 
collaboration between Picasso and Braque, then young Turks in their mid-20s. In 
larger cultural terms, it sets one wondering how an art becomes classic when, 
in the beginning, knowledgeable observers regarded it as a sham and a 
deception. 
</P>
<P>
I was mulling this over after flying in from Los Angeles for a press preview 
when the fates stepped in with an absurd and disturbing object lesson. 
</P>
<P>
It was raining hot water as I hurried back to the hotel after dinner. A young 
man stopped me, apparently to ask directions. He appeared ordinary but spoke 
oddly, as if retarded. 
</P>
<P>
He held out a bank safety deposit envelope that turned out to contain three 
coins packaged as you see them in collectors shop windows. The incident was too 
intricate to recount here in detail but it involved my telephoning the presumed 
owner of the coins, her refusal to deal with the street person and the offer of 
$1,000 reward (which I did not want) if I would return the coins. 
</P>
<P>
The finder demanded $100 claiming he was homeless and needed money for a place 
to stay. I gave him $80 -- all I had -- and returned to the hotel to assure the 
owner all was well. 
</P>
<P>
After interminable ringing, a man answered to inform me that the number was a 
public phone on the street. 
</P>
<P>
I had been seamlessly had. The adroit caper was distressing (and weirdly 
amusing) in many ways, not least of which was its resemblance to an artwork. It 
was like a piece of street theater or a chapter in "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities." No wonder people so often confuse art with an audacious rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
Like real con men, Picasso and Braque were risk-takers -- intransigent and 
subversive of convention. Like real con men they were out to create a seductive 
myth. They lived at least in part in the image of the outsider artist 
established by the 12th-Century outlaw poet Francois Villon and carried on by 
Artaud and Genet. The difference between the artist and the swindler may not 
even be so much one of morals or ethics as one of accuracy. The real con man 
uses artful guile to deceive, the artist uses it to get at the truth. Sometimes 
the distinction is not immediately apparent. 
</P>
<P>
By 1906, Picasso was considerably famous for pictures of circus nomads and 
street derelicts. That year he painted "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," a work so 
shocking he became a pariah even among his peers. Ironically, it was inspired 
partly by two ancient Iberian stone heads bought from an acquaintance. It 
turned out they'd been stolen from the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
Today "Les Demoiselles" acts as the revered iconic frontispiece of MOMA's 
remarkable exhibition (to Jan. 16). It was brilliantly organized by William 
Rubin, the museum's former chief curator of painting. 
</P>
<P>
The show demonstrates an unforeseen logic in the artists' intuitive quest. As 
we go through the galleries the works seem more and more like like a jazz duet, 
each player making riffs inspired what the other has just played, stopping for 
each other's flashy solos and joining again to weave a whole that has 
remarkable direction and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
As collaborators, the artists were the Odd Couple par-excellence. Their shared 
catalogue chronology begins in 1906. Picasso's photos show the Spaniard small, 
demonic and charismatic. His chronicle is punctuated with drama. He fears being 
embroiled with the law over the theft of the "Mona Lisa" and his stone heads 
from the Louvre although he is perfectly innocent. An artist friend commits 
suicide after a night with Picasso, punctuated with booze and opium. He breaks 
with his mistress for a new love. When working out of town he sneaks from 
village to village to avoid the old girlfriend and assorted hangers-on. Just 
one cliff-hanger after the next. 
</P>
<P>
Braque was big, handsome, athletic and so laid-back they called him "the gentle 
giant." He boxed, cycled and played the accordion. His vitae is as sleepy and 
professional as a dentist's. He goes to Ceret to paint, back to Paris to enter 
the salon, off to Le Havre for another show. Somewhere along the line he meets 
the girl he'll marry and that's that. Except of course for playing his part in 
forging the style of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast notwithstanding, the two heavily egoed men were irresistibly drawn 
together until, as Braque said, they were joined like two mountain climbers, 
seeing each other daily for endless talks and observations of progress. They 
struggled together to reach the same summit even without quite knowing what 
their goal was. Artists are like that. They go with the feeling they are "onto 
something." It turned out to be the art that would act as a metaphorical 
definition of our culture and resonate through literature, architecture, music 
and the objects of daily use. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, Braque was interested in the art of Cezanne, Picasso was into 
African as we see in the first galleries. Braque, outgrowing his beginnings as 
a Fauvist, painted landscapes at L'Estaque, searching for Cezanne's structure. 
Picasso, still smarting from the rejection of "Les Demoiselles," pursued the 
</P>
<P>
African quand meme. The exhibition includes such rare and powerful treats as 
the 1908 "Three Women" from the Hermitage. (A contemporary called it "a 
hideosity.") 
</P>
<P>
By hindsight and excellent curatorial guile we see an unexpected link. Both 
Cezanne and African art have to do with structure, which has to do with 
analysis. That's one important piece of our metaphor. This has been the 
analytical century par excellence from the probings of Freud to the 
anatomizations of science and philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the great beauties of the work is its intense seriousness. Picasso was 
never more sober and consistent, Braque never more intelligent and free of 
decoration. Analytic Cubism with its sharded space and silver-brown coloring 
has the moving gravity of Beethoven or an equation in higher physics. Cubism 
discovered relativity. Its space is ambiguous, exciting and curiously true to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In one painting Picasso introduced the motto, "Our future is in the air." He 
called Braque "Wilbourg" -- short for Wilbur Wright. Everybody knows the story 
of how Gertrude Stein compared Cubism to both military camouflage and aerial 
photography. When you look at Picasso's portrait of Ambroise Vollard, the art 
dealer's head is like the Wizard of Oz. It seems to float closer and further 
without changing sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Cubism predicted the idea of a world culture by becoming an art that frankly 
could not be anything but art -- like African art, like Oriental art. It 
predicted accordion-folded time and space that today brings the latest massacre 
in Beirut closer than the corner bistro. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't leave out the bistro. Both artists used the commonplaces of studio 
and cafe to make an epic art out of guitars, absinthe bottles and daily 
newspapers. They painted private jokes to each other and carried on amicable 
and productive rivalries -- as when Picasso, challenged by a Braque innovation, 
lettered "The Battle is Joined" into one work. He also made compositions that 
served as valentines to his mistresses. So the dynamic duo even hinted at Pop 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
The question of which of them "really" invented Cubism misses the point. Could 
Simon have done it without Garfunkle, Lewis without Clark? It was an authentic 
dialogue where each inspired other. Rubin is sure that Braque invented the 
papier colle but gives collage to Picasso, making a slightly crabby 
distinction. Picasso acknowledged his debt to Braque when he wrote, "I'm using 
your latest papery and powdery procedures." 
</P>
<P>
So much said, it has to be admitted that just about every time a work really 
grabs you here it is Picasso's. Braque's natural Gallic taste and restraint 
suffer except in the occasional masterwork like "Le Portugais" -- a triumph of 
elegant probity. Picasso is so forceful we come near to missing Braque's 
compositional innovation in works like "Man with a Violin" which predicts 
overall abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the garden variety con job, real art has no goal but to tell as much of 
the truth about the essence of its maker and his times as it can manage. 
</P>
<P>
The Picasso-Braque odyssey ended in 1914 when the Gentle Giant was called up 
for military service in World War I. Even before that Cubism had started to 
lose density in collage. The method allowed a suppleness of composition that 
brought out Braque's elegance and allowed Picasso to move into rich planar 
sculpture, but the galleries containing these works have a certain weary, 
rococo flimsiness. 
</P>
<P>
Cubism held up for decades and it will be a long time before anything touches 
it as art, but to tell the truth the show has something of the flavor of a 
period piece, classics of a bygone time. Ah, but what a time it was. 
</P>
<P>
Then a "bogus act of artistic charlatanism" could turn to pure poetic gold. 
</P>
<P>
In our odd present, when art art has become a commodity and adroit cynicism a 
virtue, a slick street-corner scam can feel telling and relevant, like an 
artwork. That's a bad omen.

STAGE WEEK: 'DIVINAS PALABRAS': A PLAY FOR THE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The title refers to the words that were said by Jesus Christ in defense of the 
prostitute Mary Magdalene," said Mexican director Xavier Rojas about Ramon del 
Valle-Inclan's 19-character drama, "Divinas Palabras" ("Divine Words"). The 
play will be the first entry of Bilingual Foundation of the Arts' 1989-90 
season and will be presented in Spanish and English on alternating nights. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a play that (attempts) to break up political and moral norms," Rojas 
added, speaking through a translator. "It dares to criticize the Spanish 
Crown." 
</P>
<P>
The story, set in a poor village in the 1920s, focuses on a church sexton and 
his adulterous wife -- and her overzealous struggle with her sisters-in-law for 
control of the village's child idiot, a "little monster" whose begging brings 
in consistently high revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was written (in 1920, the playwright) suggested that Spain should be a 
republic, that the people should elect their rulers, have their will made 
through them," Rojas explained. "This is a story about the village people, the 
beggars, the forgotten. All of their morals and aspirations have been broken 
because they're so ignorant. And the ignorance makes them believe in 
superstition, rather than believe in true faith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's set in Spain, but it could happen in Beirut, Mexico -- anywhere there is 
a culture of popular religion," the director continued. 
</P>
<P>
For Rojas (who's directing both the Spanish- and English-language versions of 
the play) the staging represents an opportunity to acquaint American audiences 
with the relatively unknown Spanish writer. And he believes that his own 
non-fluency in English hasn't hampered the work. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the play in Spanish very well, and I've read it in English," Rojas 
stressed. When working with the English-speaking cast, "I follow the movement 
I've suggested for the actors. Still, there are great difficulties, adjustments 
to be made. Some of the actors are very different (from cast to cast), so I 
have to justify their reactions and movements physically. But the real problem 
is rehearsing in Spanish -- then English -- then rehearsing each of the 
understudy casts. I only contracted for one play, not four!" 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language staging of "Divinas Palabras" opens Wednesday at 
Theatre/Teatro in the Lincoln Heights district; beginning Oct. 4, it will play 
in repertory with the English-language version. 
</P>
<P>
THEATER FILE: Harold Nicholas, Freda Payne and Theresa Hayes star in the Long 
Beach Civic Light Opera production of Duke Ellington's "Sophisticated Ladies" 
opening Oct. 5 at the Terrace Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Baker Hall is Willy Loman; Edith Fields, Christopher McDonald and 
Gregory Wagrowski his long-suffering family in Bill Bushnell's revival of 
Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, 
downtown. Bill Pullman, who was initially slated for McDonald's role, instead 
chose to remain with his pregnant wife in New York. Originally scheduled for 
Oct. 7, the opening of "Salesman" was delayed until Oct. 28 by an extension of 
Christopher Durang's "The Marriage of Bette and Boo." 
</P>
<P>
Business Week magazine celebrates its 60th anniversary Monday with a production 
of excerpts from four original playlets. It's a benefit for the Playwrights 
Theatre, at the Westwood Playhouse. The program includes parts of Laura Shamus' 
"Delicacies," Libbe HaLevy's "Kazoo," "Sorority Queen in a Mobile Home" by 
Kevin Mahoney and Michael J. DiGaetano, and Richard Polak's "Baby Bonds." 
Polak, whose "The Singles Guide" recently played the Richmond Shepard, is the 
artistic director of the Playwrights Theatre by night, and the vice president 
and manager of a consulting and insurance brokerage firm by day. Information: 
(213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: Following a run last May at South Coast Repertory, Marlane 
Meyer's modern-day Las Vegas tale, "The Geography of Luck," is playing at the 
Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dan Sullivan in The Times: "The play goes better than it did at South 
Coast. Not that the cast is necessarily more acute or that director (David) 
Schweizer has a firmer grasp of it intellectually. But he understands its music 
better." 
</P>
<P>
From Kathleen O'Steen in Daily Variety: "Schweizer deserves a good deal of 
credit for managing to convey both the bitterness and comedy here. It's not an 
easy feat considering Meyer's propensity towards dark, sordid images." 
</P>
<P>
Noted the Herald Examiner's Charles Marowitz: "At the heart of all this spiky 
imagery is a core of wet sentimentality, which ultimately saps the energy from 
(the play's) fashionable facade." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas O'Connor of the Orange County Register declared the LATC production "in 
several ways better than Orange County's . . . but this more theatrically savvy 
staging only distracts us from Meyer's tendency to turn precious in writing 
morality tales." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the staging with its original reading in LATC's New Works Project, 
the L.A. Weekly's Bill Raden said: "Meyer has tied up her original draft's 
intriguing loose ends with a redemption that comes too easily and neatly."

ON THE RECORD: THESE RECORDINGS HAVE A FAMILIAR RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A half-dozen years ago, manufacturers of the then-new digital compact disc 
decreed that CD represented the ultimate in recording technology and would -- 
could -- therefore propagate only the newest and latest. Sorry, no pre-stereo 
recordings. Ciao, Toscanini. Auf Wiedersehen, Furtwangler. At least that gave 
us reason to hold on to some of our 12-inch black vinyls. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, 'historical reissues' are no longer synonymous with recordings 
from the 1970s but have come to include the same, ancient material -- extending 
back even to pre-World War I vocals -- that quickly became part of the 
microgroove revolution 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The recording classics are immutable and keep returning, whatever the latest 
technological wrinkle. Scratchy 78s resurfaced as scratchy LPs and they, in 
turn, are now transformed into scratchy CDs -- although less scratchy, thanks 
to the efforts of musically sensitive engineers and the little silver disc's 
imperviousness to surface wear. 
</P>
<P>
Technology may change, but it has not created a new Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
These musings are inspired by the latest generous release of EMI/Angel's Great 
Recordings of the Century (GROC to the initiated), remasterings of recordings 
dating from the mid-1920s to the mid-'50s. Recordings that, like Godzilla (and 
Caruso), refuse to die. 
</P>
<P>
In the "they don't make 'em like that any more" category are three GROC tenors. 
Lauritz Melchior, with a collection of Wagner arias recorded between 1928 and 
1931 (69789), should make the CD generation marvel, as did their LP-reared 
predecessors, that anything human could emit such gigantic, stirring, 
sustained, vibrant sounds. Or that there was ever a sweeter-voiced, less 
sentimental yet more moving interpreter than John McCormack of Irish ballads 
and other home-and-hearth tidbits. Imagine craving another chorus of "Pale 
Hands I Loved Beside the Shalimar," one of numerous treasures in this 1930-'40 
collection (69788). 
</P>
<P>
Then be seduced by the artful manipulation of that most suave and worldly 
pracitioner of the Viennese operetta aria, the ultimate golden glottis, Richard 
Tauber, captured by the microphones in his glorious prime: 1927-1932 (69787). 
</P>
<P>
One becomes wary of greatly hyped matter more often discussed than reissued, 
such as the work of the young Yehudi Menuhin, drooled over in books but 
deprived of widespread recirculation by the erratic career of the mature 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Menuhin was a blooming wonder at age 16, as evidenced in 1932 recordings 
of the six solo sonatas and partitas of Bach (63035, two CDs) where sovereign 
technical command is joined to tremendous communicative power. 
</P>
<P>
No less striking is the 16-year-old's lovingly probing treatment of the Elgar 
Violin Concerto, with the aged composer conducting the London Symphony. The 
coupling (on 69786) has Beatrice Harrison as the compelling protagonist in 
Elgar's Cello Concerto, again under the composer's baton. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the availability of some awful post-prime playing from violinist 
Jacques Thibaud and pianist Alfred Cortot, one could be forgiven cynical 
anticipation of their collaboration on the three centerpieces of the French 
repertory: the duo-sonatas of Franck, Debussy and Faure (63032). 
</P>
<P>
Again, GROC offers a stunning reproof to the doubters. The playing (from 1927 
and 1929) is silken in tone, incomparably idiomatic, with a tasteful 
romanticism that overdoes none of the "enhancing devices" -- above all the 
employment of expressive violin slides -- that can make a modern listener wince 
at the mere thought of old-style playing. 
</P>
<P>
GROC cannot resist resurrecting the classic conductors' confrontation -- 
interpretive armageddon, the ultimate faceoff: the mystical master of Romantic 
subjectivity, Wilhelm Furtwangler vs. old clear-eyes-in-a-level-head, the 
composer's humble handmaiden, Arturo Toscanini. 
</P>
<P>
From Furtwangler we hear the oft-reissued 1952 Vienna Philharmonic studio 
recordings of Beethoven's First and "Eroica" symphonies (63033) and the 
"Pastoral," coupled (on 63034) with a dim-sounding, live 1948 Beethoven Eighth 
with the Stockholm Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
The clever folks at EMI have obviated hackneyed comparisons with the aged 
Toscanini of the NBC Symphony recordings. Rather, they take us back to live, 
late-1930s performances with London's BBC Symphony: Debussy's "La Mer" and 
Elgar's "Enigma Variations" (69784) and the Brahms Fourth Symphony and "Tragic 
Overture" (69783). 
</P>
<P>
These recordings project the intensity familiar from later Toscanini outings, 
but lack their freneticism, with suppler phrasing and even, in a hugely 
dramatic and lyrical Brahms Fourth, some string portamento! 
</P>
<P>
The career of conductor Guido Cantelli, Toscanini's protege but interpretively 
very much his own man, which ended with his death at age 36 in a 1956 plane 
crash, is recalled on a pair of GROCs made with London's Philharmonia 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
These ears have forgotten what to listen for in Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" and 
"Romeo and Juliet" other than scrappy execution, sluggish tempos and rhythmic 
flab, none of which is in evidence here (69785). 
</P>
<P>
That Cantelli's was a distinctive interpretive intelligence can be gauged from 
the coupling of Brahms' Third Symphony (the only one of these GROCs recorded in 
stereo) -- taut yet majestic -- and a Schumann Fourth notable for its 
propulsiveness and textural clarity (63085). 
</P>
<P>
The "what did they see in this?" question may arise in conjunction with a 
(mostly) 1930s collection of Bach concertos in which the soloist and conductor 
is Swiss pianist Edwin Fischer (63039). 
</P>
<P>
The question is answered with the observation that hardly anyone else was 
playing this music then, and that those few who did probably didn't play it 
with Fischer's contempt for Romantic indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a treasure from another short-lived artist, who became a cult object 
after succumbing to leukemia in 1950 at age 33: the Rumanian pianist Dinu 
Lipatti. 
</P>
<P>
Lipatti was an unlikely hero. His finically honed repertory was small, his 
public appearances relatively few, his style the very antithesis of 
flamboyance. Yet he touched the sensibilities, as a tragic poet, perhaps -- in 
the vein of Chopin himself, whose B-minor Sonata Lipatti plays with such 
touching songfulness and simplicity, along with works by Liszt, Ravel, Brahms 
and Enesco, on GROC 63038: one of the piano buff's recorded indispensables.

Recorded a year ago when she was 69, this disc of superb Arlen songs represents 
a comeback of sorts for soprano Farrell, who always had an interest in pop 
music. She was more successful than most classical singers in attempting to 
cross the line, yet her work has a slickness and sameness that is ultimately 
unconvincing. Here, she is at her best in the bouncy material such as "Let's 
Fall in Love," hopelessly out of her element in "A Woman's Prerogative," not to 
mention a passionless "Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe." In addition, 
there is a lot of flat singing, which may or may not be an intentional 
mannerism. Loonis McGlohon's arrangements suit the occasion. Walter Price

Ramey admirably lightens his sound for such numbers as "June is bustin' out 
allover!" and "The surrey with the fringe on top." "A fellow needs a girl" and 
"Some enchanted evening" are genuinely touching. But in such muscular, treacly 
numbers as "Climb ev'ry mountain" and "You'll never walk alone" he sounds for 
all the world like one of Verdi's fathers or priests singing in an English 
translation. Still, for show-tune aficionados the disc is worth having. Walter

In Patane's lackluster approach, Saint-Saens' most familiar opera still sounds 
like an oratorio with moving parts. Neither sufficiently suave nor enjoyably 
vulgar, the conductor offers little assistance to a mismatched, unidiomatic 
international cast. Even in 1973, when the recording was made, Ludwig sounded 
hollow at the bottom, and a voice never noted for pure sensuality makes rough 
going of Delilah's lush musical line. King's reliable, stolid Samson misses Old 
Testament fervor and even a dram of poetry. Originally issued on RCA, the 
compact disc remastering is excessively reverberant. Allan Ulrich

This disc is particularly welcome since it includes five songs released here 
for the first time and in repertory not generally associated with the beloved 
German soprano. The French is admittedly sketchy, the Italian not bad at all. 
However, over half the disc is given to Lied. She had been singing opera more 
than 20 years when she came to this country; her voice, never particularly 
beautiful, was hardly in its prime. The recordings here date from 1935 to '49, 
after her arrival here, yet the color and expressivity, despite a peculiar 
vocal production, make every word count. No texts. WALTER PRICE

Flotow's 1847 comedy about life among England's pampered rich receives a 
performance that infuses new blood into its faded charms. The cast and Wallberg 
strike an appealing balance between theatrical vivacity and stylistic 
refinement. In 1977, when the recording sessions were held, the microphones 
caught Popp and Jerusalem in pristine estate. Her delectable Lady Harriet and 
his Mickleford abound in sweetness and finesse. The digital remastering gives 
no cause for complaint. At mid-price, this is a "Martha" worth savoring. ALLAN

RECORD RACK: RANDY TRAVIS "NO HOLDIN' BACK." WARNER BROS. ** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE 
RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC) STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Travis is such a compelling country singer (rivaled only by John Anderson among 
post-'77 arrivals) that his voice alone on an album should be enough for a 
three-star recommendation. Dhe fact that this collection ends up with less 
suggests something is amiss with the material. 
</P>
<P>
Like Anderson, Travis sings in the dry 'n' drawl tradition of Lefty Frizzell 
and Merle Haggard. Unfortunately, he too has to depend on other writers for 
material because he is not a self-contained singer-songwriter like Haggard or 
Frizzell. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Anderson has had trouble in recent years finding songs that match the 
sentimentality and irony of country music as well as such early '80s hits as 
"She Just Started Liking Cheatin' Songs," Travis is having difficulty finding 
more tunes like "On the Other Hand" and "Forever and Ever, Amen." 
</P>
<P>
There are a few worthy moments this time, including the playfulness of "Card 
Carryin' Fool" and the romantic innocence of "No Stoppin' Us Now." But too many 
songs suffer from clumsy or listless imagery ("When Your World Was Turning for 
Me," "Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart"). A great voice is only half the equation 
in country music. ROBERT HILBURN

POP EYE: NIGHT OF THE HUNTER:

<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've been saying for years that Mott the Hoople is the great unsung band of 
the '70s. So imagine our delight to hear that Mott mainstays Ian Hunter and 
Mick Ronson are back together. The duo has a new album, "Y U I Orta," due out 
Oct. 3 from PolyGram, with an eight-week U.S. tour slated to begin in 
mid-October. You can also hear Hunter (who wrote Great White's current hit 
"Once Bitten Twice Shy") on Mick Jones' new solo album, which has a song, "Just 
Wanna Hold," co-written by Jones and another Mick -- Mick Jagger. . . . The new 
issue of RIP Magazine features an interview with Ozzy Osbourne, saying how hard 
it's been for him to conquer his booze addiction. ("Now I've got my own 
therapy," he explained. "And I'm back on the mend again.") Unfortunately, Ozzy 
was being too optimistic -- he's back in detox after falling off the wagon 
again. . . . With Mick Jagger and Co. on tour, it's somehow fitting that a 
young South Bay band called Eggplant has penned a song called "Rolling Stones" 
(which leads off the group's debut "Monkeybars" album). Actually, it's unclear 
whether the song is about the Stones or a group of interplanetary rockers 
posing as the Stones. Sample lyrics: "They spent four hours every night just 
messing up their hair so it would look like they didn't care. . . . they had 
their pick of the hottest girls on earth, who nine months after they left gave 
birth, they cared more about undressing the girls than leaving a forwarding 
address . . . they sounded like the Rolling Stones, meet the Rolling Stones."

What happened to the much-rumored boxed set MCA Records has been readying to 
celebrate the Who's 25th anniversary (which some of us feel has already been 
celebrated a little too much). We now hear it's been delayed till sometime next 
year. Also still in limbo: a live "Tommy" collection culled from the group's 
recent live dates. But here's a fascinating statistic (courtesy of Goldmine 
magazine): Since 1966, the Who have released 10 new albums -- but put out 19 
live, compilation and sound track records. Talk about living off past glories! 
. . . Blues great B.B. King will talk with KPCC-FM's Ann the Raven tonight, 
from midnight till 2 a.m. . . . And Pop Eye's all-time record for the longest 
thank-you note goes to funk balladeers Full Force, whose new "Smoove" album 
sleeve has about 3,500 words (!) of acknowledgments. Chatty greetings go to 
hundreds of stars, including LaToya (Playboy) Jackson, Arsenio Hall and Mike 
Tyson ("Keep up your winning ways -- also tell your sister we say hello"). But 
the best thanks go out to such non-celebs as "Mr. Leo and his great soul food" 
restaurant, Mr. and Mrs. Yim at Peter Pan Cleaners ("You're the best!") and 
Lakaiya, daughter of band member Bowlegged Lou, who Lou describes as being 
beautiful like her mother but having the brains of her father, Lou, who boasts: 
"I don't know where I get these high I.Q. sperm cells from."

ART NEWS: OAKLAND MUSEUM EXHIBITION: A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art lovers who also find excitement in that national pastime -- the game of 
baseball -- can combine both interests by visiting "Diamonds Are Forever: 
Artists and Writers on Baseball," an exhibition combining both visual artworks 
and literature on the game, opening at the Oakland Museum on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes 112 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and 
sculpture, and features works by artists including Claes Oldenburg, Raoul Dufy, 
Elaine de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Alex Katz and Eric Fischl. 
Featured literary passages on baseball are by John Updike, Garrison Keillor, 
Phillip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Neil Simon and others. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an absolute commonality of experience in the life of the (artists and 
writers) represented in the exhibition," said Don Grant, the museum's head 
preparator and exhibition designer. "Baseball is a part of all of our 
experience, at least at one point in time. And I think that's one of the 
reasons for (the artists') doing these works -- to give a sense of importance 
to the game and to people's experiences at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Grant said another reason for the exhibition, which was organized by the New 
York State Museum in Albany, is to "illustrate the mythic or iconic quality of 
baseball as it's perceived in many people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
One work that particularly illustrates that "mythic" quality, Grant said, is 
Michael Langenstein's "Play Ball." In a takeoff on Michelangelo's "Creation of 
Adam," Langenstein's post-card collage depicts Michelangelo's hand reaching up 
to the hand of God and passing him a baseball. The work illustrates the passing 
on of youth and innocence that can be accomplished through baseball, Grant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other themes depicted in the art works, Grant said, include "archetypal 
conflict situations (in which) one person is poised against all the elements," 
and works that "speak to how one's image as a kid growing up is . . . formed in 
relation to other kids (by) comparing oneself through baseball." As an example 
of the latter, Grant cited "Boys at Bat," by Eric Fischl, which shows "an image 
of a naked ball player, an older boy, batting, and a younger boy looking on." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is divided into five thematic sections -- The Place, The 
Equipment, The Players, The Action and Something Else, which involves less 
tangible elements such as childhood memories and the smells of spring -- runs 
through Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: Works of art by Los Angeles workers whose unions are affiliated with the 
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, and three paintings by union 
guest artist Phyllis Diller go on view Monday at the City Hall Bridge Gallery, 
201 N. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
The "20th Annual Union Artist Exhibit" includes 115 pieces of painting, 
sculpture and photography. Works by union members and their children were 
entered in a juried competition that included the categories of amateur works, 
professional works, high school and college works, grade-school works, and 
works by undocumented workers who have applied for amnesty through the county 
labor federation's Labor/Immigration Project. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federation, the purpose of the show is to call attention to 
the "hidden" talents of working people. 
</P>
<P>
ASIAN ART: Pasadena's Pacific Asia Museum kicks off its 12th Annual Festival of 
the Autumn Moon today with an open house and sale of art objects, collectibles 
and jewelry beginning at 4:30 p.m. in the museum's Chinese courtyard garden. On 
display at the open house will be fine art items -- such as "Lady With a Red 
Sunshade" by Dutch artist Pieter Haaxman, an oil painting by Leon Gaspard, 
Jacoulet prints and a rare painted-and-gilded seated Bodhisattva of the Ming 
Dynasty -- which will be auctioned at the Festival of the Autumn Moon Gala 
Dinner and Fine Art Auction beginning at 6:30 p.m. on Oct. 7. Tickets are $25 
each for today's open house and $175 each for the Oct. 7 dinner and auction. 
Proceeds will benefit the museum. Call (818) 449-2742 for more information. 
</P>
<P>
SENIORS: The entry deadline for the first Los Angeles countywide "Seniors in 
Art" exhibition is Oct. 2. The exhibition is open to all L.A. County residents 
who are 50 or older and will be held Dec. 18-Feb. 7 in the City Hall Bridge 
Gallery and other City Hall sites. 
</P>
<P>
Works may be entered in the categories of painting, drawing, mixed media, 
photography, printmaking and sculpture. For applications and further 
information, call (213) 485-4851.

' . . . LIBERAL VIEWS THAT CREATE RESENTMENT BETWEEN RACES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Come on, Feiffer -- your Sept. 17 cartoon is so anti-white and racist it's 
pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
It's people like you who have the opportunity to express your liberal views 
that create so much resentment between races. 
</P>
<P>
Your cartoon was out of line to state "any black who's famous we love, any 
black who ain't we kill." 
</P>
<P>
Does The Times really pay you for this type of trash?

Hilary Clay Hicks (Letters, Sept. 10) asks if Calendar couldn't just "stick to 
the performing arts." Maybe a deal could be worked out: Calendar would avoid 
discussing religion and religious people would stop discussing performing art, 
books, etc. Seems fair, and we'd all benefit.

CASTING JEWISH ACTORS AS JEWISH CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What I said in a telephone interview for Willens' article was that the 
Hollywood moguls used to anglicize the names of their stars, not that they 
changed their own names, as was incorrectly reported. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many celebrities apparently keep their surnames, but the television 
industry casts them with non-Jewish names. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Willens why couldn't Jack Klugman have been cast as Dr. Shapiro instead 
of as Dr. Quincy? How about Lt. Goldberg for Peter Falk instead of Columbo? 
</P>
<P>
The TV networks have never, to the best of my knowledge, made a Jew as a Jew 
the hero in a dramatic series. Supporting roles, yes, but not leading roles.

A RESPONSE RISING OUT OF 'THE ABYSS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Sheila Benson's "There's Truth in the Fine Details" (Aug. 20), I am 
appalled by her own lack of common sense in slamming "The Abyss." As director 
James Cameron's research assistant, let me clear up a few things. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ring in the door, which Benson assumes is gold, even though it's 
clearly made of white metal, is in fact made of titanium, which can withstand 
the pressure of several tons per square inch. This is made clear in both Jim's 
script and in Orson Scott Card's excellent novel of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As for the "breathing liquid for nine months" line, Benson should realize 
that although the fetus gets its oxygen from the mother's bloodstream until 
birth, it is completely immersed and living in amniotic fluid, which is the 
point of Monk's line in the film. In reassuring Bud that living in a liquid 
environment is not a new experience, he is playing with the facts in order to 
get across the concept. Even sticklers for detail like Jim Cameron and myself 
are willing to sacrifice a small amount of accuracy for dramatic clarity, which 
is a factor that many critics and researchers, including myself, sometimes 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The point of the rat-drowning scene was to see the rat survive, so rest 
assured that we didn't spend the time and effort consulting with various 
experts and the $400 a gallon for real liquid fluorocarbon just to kill the 
poor thing. Under the guidance of fluid breathing experts from Duke University, 
we did the scene for real . . . and the rat survived the scene, for real. 
</P>
<P>
As for technical jargon, submersibles, High Pressure Nervous Syndrome and 
hyperbaric drilling platforms, we researched them all extensively; neither Jim 
nor I is satisfied with (to paraphrase Benson) faking out 92% of the audience.

CLASSICAL PROBLEMS

Yolanda Krell's letter (Sept. 17) regarding the change at KFAC and Los Angeles' 
alleged lack of sophistication and culture was irritating in its 
simple-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
As a longtime resident and lover of Los Angeles, I'm tired of the L.A. bashers 
who complain about the dearth of culture in our city. Since when is classical 
music the only source of "culture"? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a thriving city for the arts, and home to many respected 
artists, musicians, writers, film makers, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has always been and continues to be a vital center for new music, 
design, theater and more, but I suppose Krell was too busy eating her "designer 
pizza" to notice.

I was happy to see television acknowledge Jewish people in the land of sitcoms 
and other series ("Being Jewish in Prime Time," Sept. 10, by Michele Willens). 
</P>
<P>
For too long we have watched holiday specials, some even hosted by Jewish 
people, with no mention of Hanukkah, and for too long has the occasional Jewish 
person in sitcoms been portrayed as weird, cheap or controlling an empire.

GANGS ARE BLAMED FOR 2 UNRELATED SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A confrontation involving gang members at a Lynwood eatery ended in violence 
Saturday when one man was killed in a hail of gunfire, and gangs were also 
blamed for a murder in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said the Lynwood altercation started when Richard Trevino, 
19, got into an argument with a couple of gang members outside Angelo's 
Burgers, 10990 S. Atlantic Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino and 10 friends were standing in front of the popular meeting place, 
according to sheriff's deputies, when two men walked up and started shouting 
gang slogans at them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returned With Gun 
</P>
<P>
A fight ensued and one of the gang members left and returned with a gun about 
1:15 a.m. He shot Trevino several times in the upper torso, Deputy George 
Ducoulombier said. Trevino died about four hours later at Long Beach Memorial 
Hospital. Authorities said they do not know if Trevino belonged to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
Lashawnte Taylor, 18, was arrested at the scene and booked on suspicion of 
murder, Ducoulombier said. A second suspect fled. Deputies do not know which 
one pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated slaying, Los Angeles police said Jose Juan Espana, 19, of 
Venice was killed when he was hit in the back by a shot fired from a car in the 
2000 block of Penmar Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Espana was pronounced dead at the scene around 2 a.m. Police said he was in the 
company of two gang members when the shooting occurred, but they could not say 
if he was a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
The four suspects were traveling in a red car. There have been no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driver Arrested 
</P>
<P>
In another shooting incident nearby, Santa Monica police booked a 35-year-old 
man for suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer and felony 
evading arrest after he led them on a wild, high-speed chase that ended with 
police firing 10 shots at his car. 
</P>
<P>
Archie M. Thomas, a Los Angeles resident, is being held without bail, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. W. Harry Kutzbach said the incident began at 2:30 a.m., when Thomas came 
within four feet of striking a policeman standing in the crosswalk at Santa 
Monica Boulevard and the 3rd Street Promenade. A car chase ensued, with police 
and sheriff's deputies trailing Thomas' car down Santa Monica Boulevard and 
then Ocean Avenue at speeds as fast as 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas lost control of his vehicle in the 6200 block of Venice Boulevard and 
crashed into a light pole and several parked cars, Kutzbach said. As police 
approached the car on foot, however, Thomas hit the accelerator and tried to 
run over one officer, Kutzbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Another officer fired at the speeding car, missing Thomas but hitting his 
automobile 10 times. Kutzbach said Thomas' car finally sputtered to a halt 
about 300 feet away, near the intersection of the Santa Monica Freeway and La 
Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who was unarmed, was arrested and treated for minor injuries before he 
was booked.

VOLUNTEERS TRANSFORM COUNTY EYESORE INTO A GREENBELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of neighborhood volunteers combed the bushes for empty beer bottles and 
Styrofoam coffee cups, yanked a few weeds and raked away tangles of dead ground 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
With the ceremonial placing of a 15-foot eucalyptus tree -- voila! -- the 
eyesore began to resemble a greenbelt again Saturday. "Hopefully, this is the 
start of something," said Jeff Baker, president of the homeowners' association 
that organized the cleanup of the 60-foot-wide strip of land on the east bank 
of the Los Angeles River in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and about 40 neighbors of the Wrigley area toiled on a couple acres of 
the largely barren lot that they say has been ignored by its owner, Los Angeles 
County. Besides improving the looks, they say they want to send a message to 
the county that the entire 13-acre riverfront strip from Willow Street to 
Wardlow Road should be left as an undeveloped, park-like greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Grabinski, a Long Beach City Councilman who represents the district, 
watched the clean-up and called it "a classic example" of how residents can 
band together to improve their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
And it all started with Andy Kowal's broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
Kowal, whose wife publishes the neighborhood newspaper, said he became 
interested in the fate of the vacant property as he lay at home recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to keep my foot elevated," Kowal explained as he hobbled around in a 
foot cast. "So instead of watching TV, I started calling the county and the 
city to see the status of the land." He said he found out that the county is 
offering the land for sale, a move that residents fear would bring new 
development on the edge of a tract of small, custom-built homes mostly built in 
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Researching further, he said he discovered that new development could force 
relocation of the several underground high-pressure gasoline and oil lines 
feeding local refineries that lace the vacant property. Also, rainwater runoff 
from the neighborhood collects on the property before finding its way into the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, he said, present a convincing case against development. Kowal 
said he contacted leaders of the Wrigley Assn. to organize Saturday's cleanup 
and went to the county for a permit. The county waived the normal $50 permit 
fee, which Kowal said he appreciated, considering the association was cleaning 
up county land. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he was told not to plant any trees. So he disregarded the rules 
and joined the whole crew in the planting of a single, symbolic tree, the 
eucalyptus donated by a Signal Hill nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Gabe and Cheryl Ferramola said they came to pick up trash to show their support 
for the neighborhood. "Because I live here, I'm concerned about development in 
the area," Gabe said. "We definitely don't want any developments."

CALIFORNIA STYLE STRIKES GOLD IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Tokyo's trendy Harajuku district, young men and women tote bags with the 
Body Glove logo and dance in L.A. Gear tennis shoes. At Sports Takahashi in 
Osaka, shoppers recently snapped up a test shipment of golf gear and 
accessories with a "Beverly Hills C.C." logo. One of the best-selling wines in 
Japan is San Francisco Vintners, a label that doesn't exist in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese consumers may be known worldwide for their penchant for Louis Vuitton 
bags and Chanel cosmetics, but California life-style products are capturing the 
fancy of many shoppers, particularly the free-spending young. Be it beachwear, 
surf wear, skateboards, golf equipment, UCLA sweat shirts or wine, California 
is hot. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction to the clothes, food, and leisure and recreation products 
reflect a special Japanese fondness for California. "The Japanese are, the best 
way to describe it is, like the song California Dreamin'," explained James B. 
Vaughn, who has lived in Japan for three years as director of the California 
Asian Trade &amp; Investment office in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"Their life in many ways is so regimented, so crowded, so congested, so lacking 
in all the things that California has -- the sunshine, beaches, the casual 
attitude, the speeding down Pacific Coast Highway with the convertible top 
down. As an escape from their normal life, they begin to dream and think about 
what life could be like if they were somewhere else. The question is, where 
would they be? They imagine California." 
</P>
<P>
"We market the California state of mind," explained Mark Walden, president of 
American Marketing &amp; Licensing, the Gardena firm that markets Body Glove 
wet suits, surf and beachwear and accessories in Japan. "We're selling the 
California life style, but the California life style is a state of mind -- a 
freedom-loving people. At Narita Airport, you now see tanned, young Japanese in 
bright clothing, with their sunglasses perched on their heads and wearing 
diving watches. Japan is even getting into it at the sushi bars with California 
rolls," an avocado and crab sushi creation of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
American movies and advertising help enhance the California image. Japanese 
golf and travel magazines bombard readers with exhortations to golf in 
California, the beach life and shopping on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Tokyo 
versions of popular California eateries such as Spago, Hard Rock Cafe and 
Trader Vic's draw crowds, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Leisure 
</P>
<P>
Even UCLA is cashing in on the California craze. Japanese consumers annually 
purchase about $12 million to $16 million of the Pac 10 school's T-shirts and 
sweat shirts in Japan. The demand, says Jack Revoyr, UCLA's international 
marketing manager, is "part of the appeal and charm of Los Angeles. It's a 
wonderful mystery." 
</P>
<P>
Helping all this along is Japan's big push to get consumers to indulge in more 
leisure activities as the six-day work week is gradually cut to five and 
vacations are encouraged in both the public and private sectors. Japanese 
retailers are selling the California style as a trendy way to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese buyers are roaming U.S. sports and leisure shows, like the recent 
Action Sports Retailer Expo in Long Beach. This weekend, representatives from 
16 California companies, including Los Angeles designer and manufacturer Ron 
Findley of Drop Dead Collection, took off for Japan to meet one-on-one with 
Japanese distributors and vendors under a California life-style trade mission 
organized by the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have market research that shows 15,000 wind-surfing boards were sold in 
Japan in 1988," explained Howard E. Crawford, who is going to Japan with the 
mission to try to sell his windsurfing boards that retail for $1,000 and up in 
the United States. "If we can get a small percentage, that would be excellent." 
</P>
<P>
Data on the volume of California life-style goods sold in Japan is hard to come 
by. However, a recent Japanese government report on the leisure market 
estimated 1989 retail sales of sporting and leisure goods at $10.8 billion, up 
5.9% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Sports Industry Institute of Japan showed that imports of 
sporting and leisure goods rose 47.3% in 1987 from the previous year. Imported 
brands like L.A. Gear and Reeboks, for example, accounted for about 90% of the 
3.3 million pairs of athletic shoes sold in Japan in 1988. Only 750,000 pairs 
were sold there in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Spending 
</P>
<P>
California exports of apparel and textiles to Japan rose to $70.3 million in 
1988 from $28.7 million the year before, according to Jock O'Connell of the 
trade consulting group, O'Connell Associates in Sacramento. "The dramatic 
increase in 1988 from 1987 suggests a sizable increase in California life-style 
apparel. They are not turning to California for underwear or yarn. In all 
likelihood it's the upscale, chic garments normally associated with 
California," said O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese households are flush with cash, having an average monthly 
disposable income of about $2,600, according to a Jetro survey. The young are 
known to be free spending. High school students, for example, will pay as much 
as $100 or more for a pair of stylish name-brand fitness shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the big demand for California life-style goods, selling in the 
Japanese market involves the intricate marrying of product with the right 
distribution, while satisfying finicky Japanese shoppers and their 
fast-changing demands. 
</P>
<P>
"My first impression was that people in Japan would buy anything with 
California on it," said C. Eric Kuskey, president of Cal X-Sport Inc., which 
markets Sideout Sport and Edgeware, two Southern California brands of surf and 
beachwear in Japan. "The Japanese are actually very savvy consumers. They know 
quality product, quality manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
Early pioneers taking the California life style into Japanese stores such as 
the Marui chain were California surfboard and beachwear makers like Body Glove 
and Ocean Pacific, whose product functionality was the most important. Their 
appeal initially was to the Japanese surfers who used the boards, wet suits and 
clothes for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Like life-style fashions around the world, the big boom came when the 
spectators wanted to dress like the surfers. "In Japan, most people are 
spectators, they are more conservative by nature. But the fashion-forward 
person wants to identify with the authentic stuff," explained Walden, whose 
company is a division of American Marketing Works Inc., the worldwide licensor 
of the Body Glove brand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distribution Networks 
</P>
<P>
He says the idea is to "seed" or get the product into the right shops in Japan: 
"It's like seeding clouds to get rain." 
</P>
<P>
Much of that exposure comes from carefully nurturing and working with the 
Japanese distribution network. "In order to make it in any country, do as the 
Romans do," explained Walden. "We hear Americans whining about barriers. There 
are no barriers, but it's a different system. We have studied (Japan) very 
carefully because it is very a important market." 
</P>
<P>
Body Glove has organized BG Japan for its Japanese licensees and distributors. 
"As a group, we meet in committees and decide our 'D/S/S program' -- that means 
direction, support, service program," for products sold in Japan, said Walden, 
who will say only that Japan is an "extremely profitable market" for Body 
Glove. "Japan is a world leader and a fashion leader in itself. It is crucial 
to our marketing around the world." 
</P>
<P>
California and other American products sold in Japan are typically 50% to 70% 
more expensive than they are in the United States because of Japan's labyrinth 
distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
"We will sell to a distributor who then sells to a wholesaler who then sells to 
a retailer who then sells to the consumer," explained Killick Datta, L.A. Gear 
vice president in charge of international operations and licensing at the Los 
Angeles firm. In the United States, L.A. Gear sells direct to retailers. "Those 
two extra steps along the way make our product extremely expensive," Datta 
said, noting that L.A. Gear has sold $10 million in merchandise wholesale to 
Japan during the past two years. "By the time it hit retailers, it was double 
that," Datta said. 
</P>
<P>
Others are not finding it as easy to crack the Japanese market. "We've been 
knocking on doors ever since 1985 when we went (to Japan)," explained Mark E. 
Charles, president of overseas operations at SIPA SIPA California, a San 
Clemente maker of lawn and beach games. He went through a number of 
distributors and believes that he has finally secured one that will get his 
products into Japanese stores. His firm and Cal X-Sport hope to cash in on 
beach volleyball, which is expected to be the next big fad in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese consumer is spoon-fed what the Japanese distributor decides it 
wants," observes Charles. 
</P>
<P>
That characteristic in the Japanese system has benefited Gary Van Dam, 
president of PCI Sports. He has never been to Japan in the 15 years since he 
took over the Westwood company from his father. Yet Japan accounts for $2 
million to $3 million, or 75%, of his annual sales of customized golf clubs, 
accessories and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volatile Market 
</P>
<P>
His products are featured in Japanese golf magazines, and Van Dam himself was 
listed in Who's Who's in golf in one issue of Choice Magazine, Japan's biggest 
golf monthly with an 800,000 circulation. He says he is puzzled over his 
exposure in the Japanese media. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dam and his sales staff of one, Mickey Nonaka, sell directly to Japanese 
retailers and some distributors who visit them at their small offices in 
Westwood. The two keep up on trends by subscribing to 10 monthly Japanese golf 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is constantly changing," Van Dam explained. "You have to stay on 
top of what's happening. It is amazing how fast things turn." He developed a 
house line of golf apparel and accessories under a "Beverly Hills C.C." logo 
that he made up. 
</P>
<P>
A test shipment of Beverly Hills C.C. goods to Sports Takahashi, an Osaka 
retailer, recently sold out in three days with no advertising. "Beverly Hills 
is most prestigious and everybody knows it," said Van Dam, noting that his 
Westwood business is "right on the border of it." 
</P>
<P>
He developed the logo because "we needed a name that tied in and would give a 
quality look. It is important to have a look, a whole package. It keeps out the 
copy cats." He added that the Japanese like quality and are willing to pay for 
it. A Taylor Made brand club, customized by Van Dam, sells in the United States 
for about $350. In Japan, it commands $500 to $800. 
</P>
<P>
Creating exclusivity for a product is important in Japan. Vintners 
International of Monterey County bottles wine under an exclusive private label, 
San Francisco Vintners (complete with a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge), 
which is sold only in Japan where it has been hugely successful. 
</P>
<P>
Darrel F. Corti, a Sacramento wine retailer, has developed two private label 
brands -- Protege and Poppy -- of California wine sold to Yoshiya Co., a Tokyo 
supermarket chain. The Protege brand is sold in the store. The Poppy brand, 
which features the California state flower on its label, is sold through a 
special gift program set up by Yoshiya whereby Japanese tourists purchase the 
wine as gifts during their California visits but take delivery of it in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
These purchases point to another fine point of Japanese consumerism. "They have 
a penchant for giving gifts," said Corti.

SHARING THE EARTH;

<P>
AT LAST, WAR-WEARY ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND DEVELOPERS ARE LEARNING TO WORK 
TOGETHER TO PRESERVE ENDANGERED SPECIES.

<P>
More than 20 years after a 3-inch perch called the snail darter stalled 
construction on a $137-million Tennessee dam, today's growing herd of 
endangered species, from foxes to phlox, is just as unpopular with builders and 
their bankers. It's not hard to see why. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California developers and state and federal agencies expect to pay 
more than $100 million for the land to protect what all parties refer to as the 
K-rat, the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat. Others have recently seen the 
once wide-ranging desert tortoise given emergency listing as an endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
A battle-toughened establishment of home builders, landowners, slow-growth 
advocates, environmentalists, urban planners, lawyers, hydrologists, biologists 
and assorted other consultants sees combat daily over the future of the brown 
hills and green glens of California. And many of those struggles hinge on the 
fate of the state's growing gallery of endangered, threatened and rare living 
things, which now number 254 sheep, salamanders, grasses, thistles and the 
like, with hundreds more waiting in the wings. Beyond this, the federal Fish 
and Wildlife Service has its own list, which includes 62 species in California 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have long yearned to be rid of the endangered species laws. Now, for 
long-debated environmental reasons, and with some misgivings, many 
conservationists working with scarce species may be willing to give developers 
much of what they want. 
</P>
<P>
The move is toward habitat conservation planning, which holds that the best way 
to save scarce species and accommodate reasonable development, is with broad, 
whole-habitat preserves that may involve groups of developments, collections of 
rare beasts and plants, and fewer but larger tracts of land. Piecemeal 
setting-aside of land has often created preserves that are too small for the 
species, or that ignore the interconnection of various species. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, endangered species often appear in clusters. The pressures of growing 
cities, for instance, often affect many organisms at once. Environmentalists 
now speak in terms of preserving healthy communities, not just single beasts in 
islands of habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Larger wildlife preserves also solve the problems of home range. The Florida 
panther, for instance, needs more room to roam than was realized when various 
small patches of land were first set aside for it. Each species may also have a 
minimum requirement to support enough individuals to keep a healthy gene pool. 
Now Florida conservationists are going back to set aside corridors of land to 
connect the smaller panther preserves. 
</P>
<P>
Many developers are ready for the habitat conservation approach. Long resigned 
to endangered-species expenditures as part of the cost of doing business, they 
welcome the chance to consolidate their problems with rare bugs and plants and 
to be able to plan with greater certainty. Disruptive lawsuits under the 
endangered species acts often enter the picture late in the day, when the meter 
is running on a developer's construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
The classic example of habitat conservation planning was also the first in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, developers were poised to build on San Bruno Mountain, the 
last large open space on the San Francisco peninsula. Of 3,000 acres, the 
builders agreed to set aside 2,000 as open space and for recreation. It wasn't 
until then that the endangered Mission blue butterfly turned up -- over the 
entire 1,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Under endangered-species law, this stopped the bulldozers cold. Even the 
accidental killing of a butterfly would bring automatic, and heavy, financial 
penalties. But in light of the earlier dedication of so much land to open 
space, this seemed unfair in the extreme. A San Mateo County supervisor set 
about to change the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot was an agreement among the several landowners and developers, the 
County of San Mateo, three cities, two state agencies, the local environmental 
lobby and the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to design the development to 
protect some 20 species -- not only the butterfly but also such endangered 
species as the San Francisco garter snake and scarce organisms not yet 
officially listed. Several hundred more acres were set aside as preserve. 
</P>
<P>
But since the planning was done early enough in the game, developers lost not 
one of their 3,000 planned houses in the deal. More to the point, the resulting 
amendment to the federal endangered species law ended developers' liability, 
when they agreed to this kind of multi-species protection, for accidental 
deaths. They could build without interference on the rest of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is saying we're going to walk away from using the endangered species 
laws," cautioned Richard Spotts, California representative of Defenders of 
Wildlife. "This is more taking us to a higher level, if you will. . . . People 
have seen this coming for a long time now, looking at systems instead of 
individual parts of the system." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are calm and reason about to arrive in the exploding Southern California 
housing tracts. While such habitat conservation plans may be in the works for 
the Stephens' kangaroo rat, they are still the exception. And absent such 
sometimes-tricky agreements, environmentalists are still likely to resort to 
their safety net, the endangered species laws. With predictable opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"About two weeks ago I saw a new map that just came out, on protecting the 
desert tortoise," said an unhappy Mel Wynn, president of the Building Industry 
Assn. of Southern California. "And the map showed the endangered species area 
running from the Antelope Valley all the way to Las Vegas, and all the area in 
between, a huge amount of ground. . . . That's pretty scary." 
</P>
<P>
"I sound like a real redneck," Wynn continued, "but I just see somebody sitting 
down and saying, 'Now, how can we stop these guys from developing?' And this 
was the brainstorm." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not all looking under rocks for endangered species," countered an 
exasperated Jill Swift, president of Friends of Caballero Canyon and a longtime 
Sierra Club activist. "We're working for something that our kids and 
grandchildren will savor and enjoy, instead of a 20-story condominium that's 
about to be torn down because it was built so poorly." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these scarce species have become sophisticated and powerful weapons, 
wielded by developers and environmentalists alike. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers now use the presence of an endangered species to bargain-down 
the price of land, arguing to landowners that their costs will be higher to 
build on that site. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, slow-growth advocates and environmentalists have found an 
uncompromising legal tool in obscure flora and fauna found nesting in the path 
of progress. Not only do endangered species laws disregard how much it costs a 
developer to preserve a rare grass or spotted owl, once they are discovered on 
a project, they move the battle from the political and to the judicial arena, 
where environmentalists have often been more successful, not being pitted 
against expensive lobbying campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
With the endangered species laws looming in the background, some builders will 
try to reach accommodation even before a battle develops. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of the newly found Riverside fairy shrimp, an animal which 
developers are likely to save before it is declared endangered; before, in 
fact, it has even been officially declared a separate species. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get out the cocktail sauce. The size of a cashew, this flimsy crustacean 
lives its brief, quiet life swimming upside down in as few as five small ponds 
in Riverside County, ponds that exist for a matter of weeks, or at most months, 
after the first big winter rains. The Riverside version is most easily 
distinguished from the 16 other species of fairy shrimp in California by the 
male's head appendages -- large for its kind -- which are used to grasp female 
shrimp during mating. They eat bacteria and are in turn eaten by wading and 
migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Eriksen, a bushy-browed ecologist and biology professor at the Claremont 
Colleges, has been studying fairy shrimp for 35 years. He was "dragged onto the 
environmental side" when his wife was sprayed with malathion, the same 
pesticide used against the Mediterranean fruit fly, two decades ago. A breeze 
wafted the spray onto her sewing porch as municipal workers debugged a nearby 
tree. When she complained, the men told her: "Oh, that's all right, lady. This 
isn't potent stuff at all. Just wait. In two weeks, that oak tree across the 
street? We're going to come back and spray that with DDT." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Clyde Eriksen joined Denton Belk, a world-renowned fairy shrimp 
expert from Texas, and Larry Eng, a shrimp researcher himself and an endangered 
species specialist for the California Department of Fish and Game, to conduct a 
survey of the state's fairy shrimp population. 
</P>
<P>
They studied all the embalmed collections that they could find, as well as 
fresh samples from sites around the state. Under the microscope they discovered 
what they considered to be four new species, including the Riverside shrimp. 
Eriksen also soon discovered that the only significant remaining pool in which 
the shrimp lived, called Skunk Hollow, was about to become part of Rancho Bella 
Vista, a development with more than 2,500 master-planned homes. 
</P>
<P>
Eriksen wrote to a Riverside County supervisor pleading that his new shrimp, 
and the endangered California orcutt grass found on the same site, "not be 
lightly wiped from the face of the earth." The Sierra Club rolled out its siege 
guns and the board of supervisors demanded a plan to save the Riverside fairy 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to the casual eye, the Skunk Hollow pool most of the time is a dry 
depression of slightly darker grasses in a farmed area of roughly a hundred 
acres. One proposal from the first developer was to physically transport Skunk 
Hollow somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Packard, president of Lane/Kuhn Pacific Communities, which bought the 
Skunk Hollow site in January, this time naming the project MountainView, knew 
that the rare crustacean was there. But Packard hasn't wasted a minute or a 
dollar arguing that the world could well do without the Riverside fairy shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough question here," said Packard one afternoon in his Escondido 
office, "that rather than fight . . . let's just make the assumption that it is 
in fact worth preserving, endangered or not, and figure out the best way to 
accommodate that preservation." Packard, seated at a conference table in the 
company of his attorney, admitted that he's something of a new breed of 
builder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very easy for a long time to paint this industry as the black hats," 
he said. "And I think to some extent our community has earned that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think there is a heightening of awareness" among many developers today, 
Packard said. "But I don't think you can ignore cost." 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases," explained Lindell Marsh, the attorney, "the issue you're 
dealing with is of a magnitude that one project owner really can't adequately 
address it. . . . When you have a species over an extended range, that's a real 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
This is the sort of vexation that all sides hope broad habitat conservation 
plans can solve. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Marsh is also the driving force behind what are known as the 
Starr Ranch discussions, a series of meetings over the past few years that were 
first held at the Audubon Society's Starr Ranch Preserve in Orange County. At 
these, environmentalists, planners, developers, public regulators and 
scientists attempt to develop ways to ease the friction between Southern 
California developers and their opponents. Habitat conservation plans are 
central to their discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think that at least with the big land developers, government agencies 
and environmentalists," said Marsh, holding his thumb and forefinger slightly 
apart, "we're that close to basic agreement." 
</P>
<P>
"As conservationists, we're sort of offering the olive branch," agreed Richard 
Spotts, of Defenders of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Still, environmentalists want to move with caution. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bean, a Washington-based senior attorney with the Environmental Defense 
Fund who has been a central figure in endangered species law for more than a 
dozen years, thinks that most conservationists favor the new plans, though some 
remain ardently opposed. Critics worry that developers can bring much greater 
economic resources than can nonprofit environmental groups to these complicated 
planning scenes. Habitat conservation planning may take a year or more of 
committee work and reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone disagrees with the potential of these habitat plans to be 
very useful," said Bean, who supports them. But he worries that most so far 
have been largely dominated by the developers. "The question left open . . . is 
whether they give away more than they should give."

SPECIES AT THE BRINK 
</P>
<P>
1 FAIRY SHRIMP 
</P>
<P>
A typical fairy shrimp. The Riverside variety was discovered so recently that 
no drawing exists. It has yet to be declared a new species, let alone 
endangered. But the shrimp is so rare that the owner of the largest pond where 
it lives has agreed to cooperate with environmentalists to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 DESERT TORTOISE 
</P>
<P>
The California desert tortoise, whose population has dropped by as much as 60% 
in some areas, was given emergency listing as an endangered species in July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 KANGAROO RAT 
</P>
<P>
The Stephens' kangaroo rat was placed on the federal endangered species list in 
October, 1988. Some 27 square miles of Riverside County may be set aside to 
preserve its habitat.

IMF FACES ROLE CRISIS AS LEADERS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual report of the International Monetary Fund has never been a real 
spellbinder, but this year its authors may have outdone themselves: The volume 
is so lackluster that even veteran IMF watchers had difficulty spotting 
anything new. 
</P>
<P>
Inadvertently, perhaps, the lapse may be symbolic. Only a few years ago, the 
152-country IMF was a major force in global economic policy-making, at the 
center of efforts to manage the global debt problem. 
</P>
<P>
But today, critics say the fund seems to be decidedly on the sidelines and 
searching for a role. The arrears on its loans to developing countries are 
mounting. Its managing director, Michel Camdessus, a former French treasury 
official, is under fire. 
</P>
<P>
"They really don't have nearly as much role as they had in 1983, '84 and '85," 
said Roger M. Kubarych, a former Federal Reserve Board policy analyst now with 
Henry Kaufman &amp; Co., a New York economic consulting firm. "Should they play 
a larger role? I don't think they can make a very convincing case." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome is important because the IMF, as the world's premier international 
economic organization, is charged with overseeing the world economy and 
managing the global debt situation. If it is not functioning at its peak, those 
aims are set back. 
</P>
<P>
Now the 45-year-old IMF, whose four-day annual meeting here beginning Monday 
will be attended by finance ministers from around the world, is facing some 
major decisions that are certain to affect its role for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that the fund needs more resources, Camdessus has mounted a vigorous 
campaign to persuade the IMF's 152 member governments to finance a doubling of 
the institution's overall lending pool, which has remained unchanged at $120 
billion since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The managing director argued at a press conference last week that the doubling 
is needed "in order to give confidence to our members that if they come with 
good policies, the support of the international community will be behind them. 
The fund is a monetary institution. It has to have sufficient liquidity" to do 
its job. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States, which is by far the IMF's largest donor and thus has the 
most say about any increase, is dead set against a doubling of the IMF's 
resources and is seeking to delay the decision at least until the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration asserts that the IMF has all the money that it needs to 
meet current demands and has not spelled out adequately what it might do with 
the additional funds. And it says Congress would not accept Camdessus' proposal 
even if the Administration pushed it. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF "hasn't been performing well enough to justify a 100% increase," said 
Henry R. Nau, a former National Security Council strategist now at George 
Washington University. Camdessus' proposal, he asserted, "is way out of line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfaction Runs Deep 
</P>
<P>
To critics, the most recent evidence of the IMF's shortcomings showed up during 
last summer's negotiations between Mexico and commercial banks over how to 
restructure and possibly reduce that country's $107-billion foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques de Larosiere, the IMF's managing director from 1978 to 1987, was a key 
player in hammering out such accords, often making the difference when the two 
sides could not get together on loan packages. But this year, the U.S. managed 
the talks alone. The IMF stepped in only at a late stage and did not play a 
significant role. 
</P>
<P>
And the dissatisfaction with the IMF runs far deeper than that. Those familiar 
with the IMF's role in negotiations with other countries say that its 
management is no longer exerting the kind of bold leadership that it once did 
on economic reforms by Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks complain that the IMF has "run away" by refusing to offer 
debtors the same sort of debt-reduction packages on its own loans that it is 
urging private banks to provide. The IMF now receives more in loan repayments 
from debtors than it makes in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Camdessus' penchant for pursuing his own agenda on major issues has 
alienated U.S. officials, who, as representatives of the IMF's largest and most 
powerful donor, have been used to having a far larger say in IMF policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 seven-nation economic summit in Toronto, Camdessus enraged James A. 
Baker III, then the U.S. treasury secretary, by openly backing a new joint 
Japanese-French Third World debt plan that was at odds with Baker's desire to 
stick with the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turf Battle 
</P>
<P>
That same year, he made an end run around Baker and other finance ministers to 
seek approval directly from heads of government for a new IMF lending pool 
designed especially for sub-Saharan African countries, many of which are tied 
to France politically. 
</P>
<P>
And last year, when the United States asked the World Bank to finance a 
critical loan to Argentina, Camdessus launched a bitter turf fight with that 
sister institution. Only after months of negotiations and a formal "concordat" 
between the two did that battle end. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he is flouting the Bush Administration again by campaigning hard for 
a bigger -- and far earlier -- boost in lending resources than Washington has 
said it would back. 
</P>
<P>
He also is mounting a surprise -- some call it quixotic -- attempt to persuade 
the industrialized countries to go along with issuing a new round of "special 
drawing rights," a form of paper reserves that critics say would unnecessarily 
boost global liquidity with little real gain. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time they try to make the SDR come back in one form or another and it is 
vetoed, it comes across as a blow to the prestige of the fund," said Rimmer de 
Vries, chief international economist for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as a result, the IMF has been virtually shut out of what is supposed to 
be one of its most important roles -- trying to get the United States and other 
big industrialized countries to keep their own economic houses in order. 
</P>
<P>
Although Camdessus is still invited to meetings of the Group of Seven -- 
finance ministers and central bankers of the United States, West Germany, 
Japan, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- it is mostly for cameo appearances. 
In effect, the G-7, as the group is known informally, has taken over the 
watchdog role for itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticisms Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
"The fund does not have any significant or major role in the G-7 process," said 
Alan J. Stoga, international economics specialist at Kissinger Associates, a 
New York consulting firm. "There are serious questions as to what is the fund's 
role. Why is it there?" 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. policy-maker argued that until the IMF has the political clout to 
prod countries such as West Germany and Japan to reduce their trade surpluses 
as America moves to trim its trade deficit, "it really isn't in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Camdessus himself dismisses such criticisms as unwarranted -- and just part of 
the job. "None of the gentlemen sitting around the table (of the IMF's 
executive board) is 100% happy with what we do," he told reporters last week. 
"But we live by consensus -- and that means you have to try to satisfy the 
largest number of people." 
</P>
<P>
IMF officials point out privately that much of what critics have complained 
about in recent months has either evaporated or turned out in Camdessus' favor. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the French-Japanese Third World debt plan, which the United States 
opposed so vigorously in 1987, has since been embraced by the Bush 
Administration in the global debt plan proposed last March by Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Fund officials note that although the arrears problem is a serious one, there 
are fewer countries in arrears today than there were two years ago. And some 
argue that Camdessus was right in refusing to go along with an IMF program for 
Argentina in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The managing director also is unimpressed with suggestions that the IMF should 
seek to carve out a new role. "What the fund has to do is to continue 
implementing" its current programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tired of the Battle 
</P>
<P>
Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, co-chairman of the investment bank First Boston 
International, noted that although Camdessus may not seem as bold as de 
Larosiere, he is operating in far different circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the debt crisis, when things were more hopeful, it was much 
easier for the fund to take a more aggressive role," Kuczynski said. Today, he 
said, both creditors and borrowers are tired of the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, banks are better able now to cope with potential defaults by 
Third World countries, and that has lifted the threat of a financial crisis 
that gave the IMF more leverage in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington University's Nau noted that de Larosiere's success stemmed 
partly from the fact that he had strong backing from Paul A. Volcker, then 
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The current chairman, Alan Greenspan, is 
less eager to plunge into crisis management. 
</P>
<P>
This week's meetings of finance ministers will be critical for the fund. 
Besides the question of how much and how quickly to increase its lending 
resources, the IMF must face another pressing problem: Many of its borrowers 
cannot pay back their loans. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that the amount of loans that are in arrears this year 
has mushroomed to nearly $4 billion or about 10% of the money that the 
organization has loaned to developing countries. Efforts to persuade countries 
to resume payments have been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
This week's battle over the size of the IMF's lending pool will be crucial to 
determine the future course of the controversial organization. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Guaranty's de Vries cautions against underestimating the IMF's staying 
power. "There's no question that the IMF is going into a declining phase," he 
said, "but I wouldn't write it off."

ARCHITECTURE: ENVIRONMENT BY DESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
HUSBAND-WIFE TEAM CREATES TOTAL PICTURE INSIDE AND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Environment, defined, in its modern sense, by the Oxford English Dictionary as 
"the sum total of influences which modify and determine the development of life 
or character," is a word that has come to cast a lengthening shadow over our 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
In response to this concern, environmental design has taken on an increasing 
significance for architects, landscape architects and graphic artists. Its 
impact blurs the usual boundaries between design disciplines, dissolving the 
barriers between the professionals who devise the interiors and exteriors of 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Graphic designers, particularly, have led the way in this fertile fusion of 
experts. They have broken out of their traditional box as the contrivers of 
corporate brochures and the designers of signs that decorate architecture, to 
deal with the spaces inside and between buildings, and the total look of the 
man-made environment. 
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife team of Deborah Sussman and Paul Prejza, practicing as 
Sussman/Prejza &amp; Co. Inc. in Culver City, is widely recognized as a pioneer 
of environmental design in the United States. Expanding from a basis of 
conventional graphics, Sussman/Prejza now conjures up sophisticated 
environmental scenarios that encompass everything from the gravity of 
near-architecture to the lighthearted creation of miniature worlds for toy 
fairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, architects and developers call upon us to help design 
environments that harmonize the look and feel of everything from the color of a 
wall to the configuration of the spaces surrounding and linking buildings with 
their neighbors," Prejza said. "What we have done in essence is expand our 
expertise in creating coherent images from a small scale to a larger one." 
</P>
<P>
Sussman/Prejza earned a national reputation for their designs for the 1984 
Summer Olympics, in collaboration with architects of the Jerde Partnership. 
Their Olympic pastiche of boulevard banners, lighthearted stars fallen from 
heaven and the jaunty pavilions they erected up all over the city drew wide 
praise for creating an unifying identity for the farflung Los Angeles Games. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Barton Myers, who has collaborated with Sussman/Prejza on many 
projects over the past decade, praises the designers for their "amazing skill 
in moving out into the wider environment, beyond the mere making of signs, 
logos and patterns that preoccupy most graphic artists." Sussman/Prejza has 
been an integral element in Myer's design team, from his proposal for the Grand 
Avenue development on Bunker Hill in the late 1970s to his recently won 
commission for the American Pavilion at the 1992 Seville World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Taken the Lead' 
</P>
<P>
"Paul and Deborah have taken the lead in breaking out of the usual restricted 
role of graphic designers," Myers said. "They have taken under their wing all 
the areas between and within buildings that often fell through the cracks 
dividing architecture, landscape and urban design in conventional practice." 
</P>
<P>
A major environmental design project currently on Sussman/Prejza's boards is 
the Citadel, a commercial development planned around the landmark Samson Tyre 
and Rubber Co. building in the City of Commerce, east of downtown. Designed in 
1929 by Morgan, Walls and Clements, the now-abandoned Samson factory features a 
crenelated wall nearly one-third of a mile long contrived to resemble a Cecil 
B. De Mille version of an Assyrian palace decorated with heraldic griffins and 
bas-reliefs of Babylonian princes. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the preserved facade of the old factory Sussman/Prejza are designing a 
140,000-square-foot factory retail outlet center and food fair to serve a 
nearby office park and hotel. After the architects developed the Citadel's 
schematic master plan and the landscape architects devised the basic layout of 
the open spaces surrounding the buildings, Sussman/Prejza fleshed out the 
project with a range of designs from tented stalls and glass pavilions to 
paving patterns and the internal architecture of the muscular columns and 
trusses of the old factory. With colorful booths, signs and streamers, they 
transformed it into a fanciful cathedral of consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman/Prejza have suggested that the Citadel development adopt the winged 
griffin as its integrating image. They would like to see a huge golden griffin 
soaring above the Assyrian palace as a beacon to attract motorists on the 
neighboring freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Symbolic Shorthand' 
</P>
<P>
"We always seek out the one striking visual metaphor that can become the 
symbolic shorthand for the whole design," Sussman explained. "Everything else, 
down to the tiniest detail, is keyed to that prime image or plays against it as 
a counterpoint. This device helps integrate the entire environmental scenario 
and gives it a sense of overall cohesion we think is vital to its humanity." 
</P>
<P>
In a recently opened Minneapolis shopping mall, Sussman's team came up with the 
idea of using the loon, the Minnesota state bird, as a symbol. The creature's 
staring eyes and vivid profile are repeated in many of the mall's signs and 
packaging, culminating in a giant gilded loon suspended over the mall's central 
stair. 
</P>
<P>
Prejza points to an increasing sophistication among architects and developers 
about the need for environmental design. The total look of a development has 
become a huge plus in an increasingly competitive commercial market. Kevin 
Staley, a partner in Trammell Crow Co., the Citadel developers, insisted on 
Sussman/Prejza's participation in the project "because of their nationally 
recognized leadership in environmental design, which has become such a vital 
ingredient in the success of major commercial projects." 
</P>
<P>
"Clients want to make a splash," Prejza said, "and they know we can give it to 
them. They know their design image is a vital ingredient in their corporate or 
market message to a public that has become sensitized to its man-made 
surroundings. They know design counts, at every level." 
</P>
<P>
To respond to the wide range of projects they are offered, Sussman/Prejza has 
structured its 40-person office into four fluid categories, each under the 
supervision of a senior associate. Exhibits, such as the annual Hasbro Toy 
Fair, are in the charge of Mark Nelsen. Scott Cuyler leads the section dealing 
with industrial design that involves free-standing objects, such as the road 
signs decorated with stylized Mickey Mouse ears for the planned Eurodisney 
complex outside Paris. Debra Valencia supervises the design of traditional 
graphics, including logos, brochures, posters etc. Fernando Vasquez oversees 
the design of architectural interiors and retail projects such as the Gaviidae 
and The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman and Prejza's unusual combination of training and talent explains the 
firm's unique expertise in environmental design. Educated as a graphic designer 
at Chicago's Institute of Design, Sussman honed her skills in the L.A. office 
of Charles and Ray Eames in the 1950s. "The Eameses were the world's first 
environmental designers, before the term was even invented," she said. "They 
crossed boundaries at will, designing everything, from children's games to 
houses, without changing hats. It was a wonderful apprenticeship for me." 
</P>
<P>
Trained as an architectural historian at Pennsylvania State University, Prejza 
was employed in the L.A. City Planning Department when he met his wife in 1967. 
Six years later they decided to set up practice together. Prejza's cool 
competence acts as a foil to his wife's exuberant imagination, and his grasp of 
the wider issues of urban design complements her passion for detail. 
</P>
<P>
Success makes Sussman feel that the sky's the limit. "My ambition is to design 
an airline," she said, "from the tickets through the flight attendants' 
uniforms to the arrangement of the seating and the painting of the planes. Air 
travel is one environment most of us have to suffer, and it has become 
increasingly stressful and ugly. Imagine what it would be like to fly with an 
airline in which everything you saw and experienced pleased the eye and soothed 
the nerves."

'AMERICA KILLED ANDRE'; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITY CHEF MICHEL RICHARD LOST HIS BEST FRIEND TO A ROBBER'S BULLET. NOW HE 
TALKS ABOUT THE DARK SIDE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM: MURDER, GREED, FEAR

<P>
On the night of July 10, an armed robber killed transplanted Frenchman Andre 
Coffyn while he was closing up his Wilshire District bistro, "Michel Richard." 
While his murder was no more important, no less important, than any other 
killing that occurs in Los Angeles, it received considerable publicity and 
sparked rumors of a "conspiracy" against the French community, prompting the 
State Department to make an official inquiry on the matter to the Los Angeles 
Police Department. Here, for the first time, Coffyn's best friend and partner, 
L.A. celebrity chef Michel Richard, talks about the murder's impact on his own 
life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever lost a friend?" said Michel Richard as he sat on the patio of 
his celebrated Citrus restaurant as the bright Los Angeles sunshine turned 
increasingly hazy with smog and sunset. "Because Andre was my best friend. He 
was my only friend. Andre was exactly the kind of friend I needed. And it's a 
great loss for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that if Andre was still living in France, he would still be alive. 
Because I think he was in the wrong spot at the wrong time. That person didn't 
come to kill Andre. He was looking for somebody wearing a nice watch, so he 
could sell it and make some money. And this way he could please his own needs. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's why I say America killed Andre." 
</P>
<P>
"No one's been arrested yet. There is not a great deal of evidence," says Los 
Angeles Police Detective Dan Andrews, who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a real strong description of the getaway vehicle we can trace. 
There don't appear to be any fingerprints. The Rolex watches that were stolen 
haven't turned up at a pawn shop or anywhere in Southern California that we can 
trace. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, there just aren't a lot of real good leads at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there are some similarities to other Rolex robberies in that this guy 
demands a watch. But that seems to have become a very popular pastime as far as 
armed robberies in L.A. County are concerned. Clearly, the word on the street 
is you can get anywhere between $1,000 and $10,000 for an expensive watch. So 
you go to an affluent neighborhood where most people are wearing nice watches. 
It's the law of averages." 
</P>
<P>
"Crime doesn't happen so much in France. Because when I was living in France, 
before I left in 1974 and came to America, I never worried about it. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, Paris is a beautiful city, but we do have problems. And I remember 
it was very rare to have crime happen to you. I remember that, 15 years ago, if 
you went to work late, people asked why. And when you said, 'My car has been 
stolen,' it was like a big deal. The entire village would go, 'God, did you 
hear that?' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm afraid that 50 years from now in Los Angeles it'll be, 'How come you 
don't come to work?' and you'll say, 'Because my husband was killed last 
night.' And people will say, 'Oh, so what.' It's just like normal. Something 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
"And, you know, we take this too easy. I mean, how many times has my car radio 
been stolen? 15 times? Yeah, so many times. And between Andre and me, maybe 
even 20 times. And then tell your friends tomorrow, 'Oh my God, somebody broke 
into my car.' And it's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to have been a simple robbery that went sour," Detective Andrews 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "There doesn't appear to be anything that Andre Coffyn did to provoke this 
incident. The gunman probably had no idea Andre was even the owner. He had a 
glass of wine in front of him, he was sitting in the cafe, socializing with the 
other patrons. He looked like a customer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"So that leaves us with a scenario where this guy is standing there 
perpetrating an armed robbery. He's got seven patrons sitting on the sidewalk 
cafe, so he's concerned about controlling these people. He's in a hurry, his 
adrenaline's pumping and he's holding an automatic weapon in his hand. He tells 
everyone that it's a robbery and to give up their watches and money, which they 
did. And the first person that he confronts, the one who was sitting closest to 
him, was Coffyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you know anything about weapons, but it doesn't take much as 
far as trigger pull is concerned to make a .32 automatic discharge. And it may 
just have been an inadvertent act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been any one of them who was killed. It just happened to be 
Andre." 
</P>
<P>
"I know somebody knows who did it. There's no doubt about it. Somebody knows. 
</P>
<P>
"And they should call the police and put the guy in jail because he doesn't 
have the right to take a gun and take a life. He should be put away some place 
where he won't ever do it again. He hurt so many people." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a composite drawing from the descriptions of witnesses," says 
Detective Andrews. "The suspect is a male black, approximately six feet tall, 
slender build, medium complexion, black hair, aged 25-26 years. He had on a 
dark-sleeved shirt with yellow stripes, dark pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there also might have been a getaway driver. We have one witness who 
heard the car speed away and saw a black Camaro-type vehicle. We have another 
witness who heard someone run up to the car and say something to the effect of, 
'Let's go.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What are the chances of finding this guy? I think what we need is somebody 
anonymously or whatever to tell us what happened. Because somebody knows. The 
driver of the car knows. Probably friends or acquaintances of whomever did this 
knows. It's going to take what we in this business call the 'magic phone call.' 
We need that desperately." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the day after Andre was killed, people called and said they're going 
to kill me too. What happened is somebody told me that they heard on TV that 
there was too much publicity about Andre's case and 'if you don't stop, we're 
going to kill Michel Richard.' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if it was real. But even if it's a joke, you're still afraid." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you exactly what happened. This thing got completely blown out of 
proportion," says Detective Andrews. "That's my estimation after investigating 
it quite extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after the murder, the neighborhood was swarming with news people. And 
you know how they are: They'll put a microphone in front of anyone. So then an 
elderly woman calls the 'Michel Richard' restaurant and says, 'If you don't get 
those reporters off my lawn, there's going to be another shooting,' and then 
hangs up the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we were concerned about this and we put a tap on the telephone of 
the restaurant that has the ability to trace phone calls. And we determined 
that it was just obviously some irate neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the news people out there at the restaurant stick a microphone in the 
face of a 20-year-old girl who works behind the counter making sandwiches and 
ask, 'How do you feel about this?' And she says, 'Well, I think it's really 
tragic. And not only that, but now we're receiving death threats.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So that night on the news, without calling me or trying to verify it at all, 
that's what they play, 'Death threats against Michel Richard.' So then some 
people who know the real Michel Richard are watching the news and they hear 
this and they don't realize they're talking about 'Michel Richard,' the 
restaurant. And so they call Michel and say, 'We understand from the TV that 
you're next.' So he goes into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get frantic calls the following morning from the family and friends of 
Richard and Coffyn and everyone else wanting to know about this conspiracy 
against French people and against French chefs and how Andre was killed because 
he was French and that Michel's going to be next. I even got a call from the 
planners of the Bastille Day party at Hollywood Park, where 10,000 people are 
expected to attend, including French government officials and movie stars and 
dignitaries. They're obviously upset and they want to cancel this event. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I tell them the whole story, and they go ahead with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, on July 14th, I get another call and it's a representative from the 
United States State Department. And he says, 'We've received formal inquiries 
from the French government and from the Ambassador of France regarding the 
murder of a Frenchman and the conspiracy against French people in Los Angeles. 
So what about it?' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I tell him the whole story, and that was really the last I've heard about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes, I'm still afraid now. 
</P>
<P>
"If I drive, I'm afraid. If somebody gets close to me, I'm afraid. If I hear 
some noise in my home, I'm afraid. The feeling won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid not only for me but for my kids. You know, you can't leave your 
kids on the street. My son is 6 years old and if he's on the street for five 
minutes, he'd be . . . I can't even imagine. But when I was his age in France, 
I used to go in the forest or in the mountains or fishing and my parents never 
worried about me. 
</P>
<P>
"But you raise your kids here and they don't have freedom. I guess, as parents, 
we're afraid of everything -- drug dealers, rapists, robbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been married three times, the first time when I was 18. And when I came 
to this country, I was a bachelor father raising my 11-year-old son all alone. 
I won't go into detail what happened to my son out of respect for him. But it's 
a long, long story. He had some problems. Drugs and all that. Everybody's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when you're an adult like us, if you take drugs you know exactly 
what's going to happen. But kids, when they're 12, 14, 15, they don't know. And 
there can be some bad person who tries to take advantage of them. And I'm 
afraid for my other three kids, a boy who's 13, another boy who'll be 6 on Oct. 
24, and a girl who'll be one year on Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm thinking about going back to France. Just thinking about it for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be mainly because I don't like America. It'll be for reasons of my 
profession and my kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Michel is a very complicated guy. He has the insides of an artist," says food 
writer Russ Parsons, who was dining at Richard's home on the night that Coffyn 
was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He switches moods very quickly. There are two sides to him. Everyone knows 
the Michel who is very good at being a jovial and teddy bear kind of guy, 
enjoying life. But it's a real mistake to take that for being happy-go-lucky. 
Because the other side of him is always wondering what life is all about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to America, I was 26. I wanted to learn English. But I never 
wanted to leave my country. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the ambitions there are different than here. In France, when 
you're a poor kid like I was, I never dreamed of becoming a rich man. It was 
enough for me to be able to pay your bills and raise your family and be 
rewarded for being a good chef. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Champagne country, a small town, Givet. I didn't have a father. 
He left my mother when I was 6. My mother worked in a factory. We had five 
kids, two girls and three boys. I was the second oldest. My mother was working 
so hard that I cooked for my brothers and sisters when I was 6 or 7. "When I 
was 14, I got a job in a restaurant with a pastry shop. I was kind of young, 
but they give you lodging and they feed you, and you make maybe $10 a month. 
But you don't need much more than that. And you worked long hours, sometimes 
from 5 a.m. until midnight. On your days off you picked apples and mushrooms or 
you cleaned the garden. You never, never stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so tough. Sometimes at night I would take my suitcase and head in the 
direction of the train station. But where was I going? My mother would never 
take me because she was remarried with somebody and I didn't like the guy. 
There was just no place to go. So I would go back and work. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when I opened my businesses here, it was so tough to find good 
employees. We had so many jobs to offer. And the problem, I feel so many times, 
is that people here don't know what it is to work. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's so rewarding when you work hard. It's so good for you. But that's 
something that this country didn't teach its kids, that working is the best 
thing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's why you have so many kids on the street. I don't know what they are 
looking for, but the main thing is to give them a good job. And if they learn a 
profession, they won't be lost on the street. And that's why you have a problem 
on the street like killing, raping. They're going to look for something they 
can do to get money." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing with Andre was a very shattering experience for Michel," 
explains Parsons. "He was just heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first couple of weeks, a lot of people thought he had been the one 
who'd been killed because when you heard it was the owner of the 'Michel 
Richard' restaurant, you thought it was Michel unless you knew he sold it to 
Andre several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Andre's murder, you didn't see the old Michel very much. His 
brother-in-law, who is the maitre d' at Citrus, would call me and say, 'Come 
here. You've got to get him out of this place because he's driving us crazy.' 
You see, it was hard for Michel to be happy with anything at that point. He 
felt guilty when he was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre came to America in 1980. How did we meet? I don't remember exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"But one day we were having a steak together, or maybe it was a duck breast, 
rare, and he said to me, 'Michel, I want to move to America and be partners 
with you.' And I said, 'Why not?' 
</P>
<P>
"That was like a Thursday. Two days later, he was in L.A. He became my best 
friend after. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved America. He really loved America. I miss France. But Andre was never 
missing France. I think, mainly, he wanted freedom. I think maybe he was afraid 
of the Communists back in France. I'm afraid of the Communists too. 
</P>
<P>
"When Andre moved here, he immediately started to work with me. As a cook, this 
guy could fix the best meal. And he was a gourmet. I mean, he had the palate. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold the 'Michel Richard' pastry shop in the Valley in 1986, and Andre 
moved to the one on Robertson because I was tired of the headaches and I was 
opening Citrus. So I said to Andre, 'Do you want to take that thing over? 
Because otherwise I will close it.' I was a co-owner of 'Michel Richard' for 
three years and then I sold it to him. His wife ran it during the day. Andre 
was involved in the restaurant only at nighttime because in the daytime he had 
a clothing business. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible when I found out about Andre. Let me tell you why. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just built a beautiful home for myself and my family near Sunset Plaza. 
So Andre came over Monday night for the first dinner we had together in my new 
house. We ate and then Andre told me, 'Michel, I have to go and close the 
restaurant at 10:30 p.m.' 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, Andre never worked on Monday night. Never. So we were together at 
10:30 p.m. and at 11 p.m. he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"And, you know, the coffee was not even cold. He hadn't finished his cigar." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two very French dishes -- salmon with sauce gribiche and cassoulet -- 
with two American wines in the French style, a Chardonnay and a pinot noir. 
Then cigars and Armagnac afterward," recalls Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Andre left, he came over and gave me a hug. Then he went to Michel and 
they shook hands. When he closed the door, Michel looked at me and said, 'When 
I see my friends, I always hug them. But Andre is my best friend, like my 
brother, and I only shake hands with him. I wonder why that is?' 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of hours later, the phone rang. Michel's wife, Laurance, answered 
it. And Michel -- without knowing who it was -- said, 'I always hate it when 
the phone rings late at night. It's always bad news.' Then we heard Laurance 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
"The phone rang and an employee said, 'Andre's dead.' So I jumped in the car 
with Russ and we went down to the pastry shop and Andre was dead on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"And the thing is, Andre never, never, had any enemies. He was the sweetest, 
nicest man. He didn't deserve this. That's why I'm upset. Why they kill Andre? 
Why? Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one bullet. In the head. He died immediately," Detective Andrews says. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose a wife, people understand. You lose a kid, people understand. When 
you lose a friend, they don't understand. We were so close. And though he was 
48 and I'm 41, he was like my little brother. He was more than a brother. He 
was a buddy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would see him all the time. He sometimes would come to my home and not even 
talk. He'd just sit down and watch TV. Or we'd talk for hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night, he'd bring over the bread and we'd eat and enjoy a cigar. Most 
people don't like cigars, but we would concentrate and talk about them like 
wine and forget the other problems. And when I used to travel to cook in San 
Francisco, Houston, New York, wherever, Andre would come with me and help me in 
the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, oh yes, my life is different. I'm grieving. I'm crying. And you know the 
saddest thing? Andre had a problem with his green card, so he couldn't go back 
to France to visit. And he was missing having great meals at great restaurants. 
So I would come back from my trips and tell him about my dinners. We'd talk 
about everything on the menu, and sometimes we'd try to duplicate the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
"And he always said, 'The first day I have my green card, Michel, I'm going to 
go with you and we're going to try all these restaurants.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he did receive his green card -- two days after he died." 
</P>
<P>
"Citrus had become a meeting place, of sorts, for the French community here. It 
was a French Foreign Legion," says Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that almost every Saturday when the restaurant isn't open for 
lunch that there would be a bunch of French people who would come and have a 
nice meal. Nothing fancy, just very simple home cooking like some short ribs 
and tomato salad. And they'd just sit and drink a bottle of wine and speak in 
French. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it became really important for these immigrants to have like this little 
island, this rock, that they could hold on to. And at the center was Michel and 
Andre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre was very much in love with the myth of America. Even though he didn't 
speak English hardly at all. You'd have to talk to him in sign language. But 
still he was in love with James Dean and American movies and the way we see 
ourselves, which is not really the way we are. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Michel's pretty much of a realist. He sees it for the good and the bad." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't give the impression that I'm not very happy in America. I love this 
place because the people help me to realize my dream. I can't really say what I 
think, how I feel, because it's not my country. If I don't like it, then I 
shouldn't stay here. 
</P>
<P>
"And, you know, a few years ago, a neighbor of mine said, 'Hey, dumb French. Go 
back to your country.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think America is a beautiful country, a great country. I'm not an American, 
but I love it. But everybody should work harder to make this country more 
pleasant and more beautiful instead of being upset and angry. It could be the 
nicest country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, Americans, they're hurting themselves. They're working so hard 
to try to make a bad country. Maybe I'm upset with Los Angeles because they 
took away my best friend. But even the rest of it too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become so ugly. You look at Sunset Boulevard, and it could be beautiful. 
But people want to promote so many products that you see Marlboro signs. You 
think that is beautiful? A promotion of bad products for your lungs? 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the beautiful homes in Beverly Hills are a dream of a lot of people. 
And I felt like there was lots here for me. It was true. "The American dream -- 
it is sometimes just a dream. Money-wise, I have it. But the most important 
thing in life is friends. Because without friends you're nothing. You can't 
live alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make money, you want to share your money with your friends. If you have 
a beautiful home, you want to invite your friends for dinner. Even if you have 
a big car, you want to show your friends your new car." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year at this time we had 25 murders in this division. This year we've 
had 40," says Detective Andrews. "I don't know if that's indicative of 
citywide. But, yeah, there does seem to be a pattern, for lack of a better 
word, of pretty random violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case got a lot of publicity at first. And now it gets very little. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of out of sight. Out of mind." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"If I went back to France, I'd like to open up a beautiful place in the 
country, like an inn. And I would love to make my customers very happy, to have 
them sit and relax in serenity. I would love to grow my own vegetables. And I 
would love to see my kids say, 'Daddy, we are going to pick some flowers,' or 
'We're going to go fishing' and just let them go. 
</P>
<P>
"And not be afraid that something would happen to them."

SCRAPPLE -- THE WAY TO A PHILADELPHIAN'S HEART

"What is scrapple?" shouted waitress Lynne Brown at the quizzical customer in 
the Down Home Diner. 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, you're not from Philly, that's for sure," laughed Brown, who promptly 
explained: 
</P>
<P>
"Scrapple is a Philadelphia dining specialty. It's a Philadelphia tradition. 
It's the leftover scraps of pig, everything but the oink, with cornmeal, 
buckwheat and spices thrown in. Try it with eggs, you'll love it." 
</P>
<P>
Just about every diner, restaurant and cafe serving breakfast in Philadelphia 
offers scrapple, which comes in precooked loaves, then is sliced and fried. 
When people order eggs, the waitress asks: 
</P>
<P>
"You want bacon, sausage or scrapple with your eggs?" 
</P>
<P>
Some order their scrapple fried crispy, some fried medium. Some want it soggy. 
Some smother it with ketchup, some with syrup, others with horseradish, apple 
sauce or apple butter. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from Philly eats scrapple -- blacks, whites, Chinese, Germans, 
Poles, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Italians," said Mario Monzo, chef at the Penrose 
Diner. "It's a very popular food." 
</P>
<P>
Penrose Diner waitress Cathy Blake noted that many eat scrapple for lunch and 
dinner: "There is an old saying 'Scrapple, potatoes and vegetables at lunch or 
supper is real eating.' " 
</P>
<P>
It may be the rage of Philadelphia but few outside this city or the surrounding 
Pennsylvania Dutch country have ever heard of scrapple, let alone tried the 
tasty dish. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia author Kenneth Finkel, who has written several articles about the 
breakfast specialty, is the city's scrapple historian. He even lectures about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Scrapple is a metaphor for Philadelphia. It was invented here, going back to 
the 1680s, to the very beginning of this city. It hasn't changed. It still has 
the same ingredients today as it had 300 years ago," said Finkel, the pied 
piper of the Philadelphia pate. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry and songs have been written about scrapple. For example this bit of 
doggerel from William M. Bunn's "Some After Dinner Speeches" was published in 
Philadelphia in 1906: 
</P>
<P>
"This world is all a fleeting show, 
</P>
<P>
Since Adam ate the apple, 
</P>
<P>
Its smiles of joy, its tears of woe, 
</P>
<P>
Deceitful shine, deceitful flow -- 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing true but -- 
</P>
<P>
Scrapple." 
</P>
<P>
"Scrapple's roots go back to medieval times to Holland and North Germany where 
remnants of butchered pigs were made into a meat pudding. This practice was 
brought to the New World, especially to Philadelphia," stated Finkel. 
</P>
<P>
"Once here, the Pennsylvania Dutch went a few steps further. They added 
cornmeal, buckwheat, sage, cloves and other spices." 
</P>
<P>
Scrapple is sold in Philadelphia supermarkets, corner grocery stores and 
butcher shops in 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-pound loaves for about $1.50 a pound. On the 
counter at Larry Fogarty's butcher shop in the Terminal Market, a small sign 
advertising "Hatfield Country Scrapple" lists the product's ingredients: "Pork 
stock, pork skin, pork hearts, pork snouts, pork liver, pork tongue, yellow 
cornmeal, wheat flour, salt, spices." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield Quality Meats, one of the biggest meat packers producing scrapple, 
sells upwards of 50,000 pounds a week and 2.7 million pounds a year, reports 
Abe Landes, the company's marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first products Hatfield made in 1895 was scrapple. It is one of the 
mainstay items that has made the company the success that it has been all these 
years," said Landes. 
</P>
<P>
Although a lot of people used to make their own scrapple years ago, very few 
people do now, Landes noted, "because it is too time consuming a process, too 
complex a recipe and it has to be made in such big batches. They buy it already 
made in the scrapple loaves at the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
"About the only place you find scrapple on the menu outside Pennsylvania is 
along the seashore in New Jersey, at Atlantic City, Ocean City and Cape May 
where Philadelphians vacation in the summer," Landes continued. "It's strictly 
there for the Pennsylvania crowd who demands their scrapple." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield and other meat producers ship scrapple to transplanted Pennsylvanians 
throughout the nation and even overseas. W.C. Fields (who came from 
Philadelphia) had scrapple shipped to his Hollywood home as long as he lived. 
</P>
<P>
"Philadelphians can't exist without scrapple," insisted scrapple historian 
Finkel.

PARTY PROPOSES RADICAL CHANGE IN SOVIET SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Communist Party on Saturday proposed reforms that would transform 
the country's highly centralized political and economic system into one based 
on federalism with extensive freedoms for its constituent republics and 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
A crucial element in the broad reforms now under way here, the move will 
reshape the Soviet Union, according to the party's policy document on ethnic 
issues, and it calls for extensive negotiations to reach a new constitutional 
formula for the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new system is intended primarily to pull the Soviet Union out of 
its current crisis over inter-ethnic relations by giving the scores of 
non-Russian minorities greater autonomy, the break with the past will be so 
sharp -- "a radical change," in the words of the party statement -- that other 
political, economic and social reforms will also be accelerated and expanded. 
</P>
<P>
"Solving ethnic problems is crucial for perestroika and the future of the 
country," the party statement declares. "Such a solution can and must be found 
only in the course of a revolutionary renewal of Soviet society. . . . 
Harmonization of inter-ethnic relations on a new basis is a supreme goal of the 
party's nationalities policy." 
</P>
<P>
The policy statement, approved at last week's meeting of the party's Central 
Committee, calls for negotiations to reach a new balance of powers between the 
central government and the 15 constituent republics and proposes the drafting 
of a new "founding document" for the Soviet Union to replace the one adopted in 
1922. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations would attempt to transfer into the political forum the sharp 
ethnic conflicts that have disrupted the country for the past 18 months and 
left nearly 300 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
But their scope would reach far beyond resolution of the demands of Estonians, 
Latvians and Lithuanians for the independence of their republics or of 
Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
In the process of resolving the relationship between the central government and 
the constituent republics, of the republics among themselves and of small 
minorities within this new framework, the process of political change would 
grow, Soviet commentators acknowledged in presenting the policy statement. 
</P>
<P>
With a new constitution under discussion by the Congress of People's Deputies, 
the new national assembly, these negotiations would give the new charter a 
focus much different from the present constitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Government's Powers 
</P>
<P>
The party proposes that the central government have the legislative power 
necessary to "define priorities in economic and political development" of the 
country as a whole, to provide for its security and defense, to conduct foreign 
policy and to undertake agreed tasks in the management of the economy, culture, 
science and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
But the republics, largely formed on the basis of ethnic groups around the 
periphery of the old Russian Empire, would retain full authority in all matters 
except those that they agree to delegate to the central government. In the 
event of disputes, they would be able to appeal to a constitutional court. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's present pyramid of political power gives the central 
government -- and the party leadership above it -- virtually absolute authority 
on any issue. Although the constituent republics legally formed the Soviet 
Union, the working reality has been that they are creations of the Communist 
Party and of the central government and thus subservient to them. 
</P>
<P>
The policy document stresses that each of the republics would maintain its 
"sovereignty and independence" under the new federal system, which would be 
based on their "voluntary association" to form the Soviet Union. The party says 
that it intends to move away from the current constitutional framework in which 
such rights exist -- but only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
The republics range in size from the giant Russian Republic with a population 
of 148 million to Armenia with 3.5 million and Estonia with only 1.6 million 
people. Each person would be a citizen of both his own republic and of the 
Soviet Union, a measure intended to answer criticism of past Soviet policy as 
"Russification" and forced assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy would give the republics primary responsibility for their own 
economies, and it encourages them to move more boldly into market socialism. 
They would own the natural resources in their territory and would operate the 
industrial and commercial enterprises that are now state-owned. They would be 
required, however, to pursue economic efficiency, full employment and "social 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania won permission from the 
Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, to move next year onto a new economic 
footing in which they will operate on a profit-and-loss basis independently of 
the huge central ministries that control most of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
With their new authority envisioned in the party's policy statement, the 
republics would be able to legalize the other political parties that are 
rapidly emerging and to adopt different governmental systems to replace the 
identical "Soviet socialist republic" models they now have. 
</P>
<P>
They would also be able to maintain their own contacts with foreign countries 
and international organizations, according to the policy statement. 
</P>
<P>
To protect minorities, the party plans to push for adoption of further 
constitutional guarantees of individual human rights and for greater authority 
for those autonomous regions where minority groups live. Religious observance, 
which will be protected by a new law on the freedom of conscience, would be 
able to play a far greater role than it has in the past in the republics and 
autonomous regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Ethnic Groups 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central government would continue its development efforts 
among the small ethnic groups of Siberia, the Arctic region and the Soviet Far 
East. 
</P>
<P>
The party calls in its policy statement for the use of local languages as a 
basic right as well as for the protection of ethnic cultures, but it says that 
Russian should be kept as the national language countrywide for ease of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, following similar actions 
by Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan, made its local language, Kirghiz, the 
republic's official language. There were heated objections from Russians and 
others who wanted to retain Russian, now relegated to the status of "the 
language of inter-ethnic communication." 
</P>
<P>
In the country's continuing unrest, three more people were reported killed and 
five injured in renewed clashes between ethnic Russians and Kazakhs in the 
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. The official news agency Tass said that 
groups armed with sticks, stones and metal bars fought in the town of 
Semipalatinsk on Thursday.

CATASTROPHIC CARE: TAKING BEATING, IT NEEDS FIRST AID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fanning a blaze that is flashing across the nation's political grass roots, 
Herman Mulman stands tall among a gathering of Seniors for Action at the Van 
Nuys-Sherman Oaks Senior Citizens Center and assails a new Medicare program 
designed specifically for their benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"This," declares the former postal worker, a 72-year-old graybeard in a flowery 
Western shirt and blue jeans, "is the most horrendous piece of legislation ever 
jammed down the throats of a minority of citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic health insurance program, hailed when it was enacted last year 
for finally protecting the elderly against ruinous medical costs, has instead 
turned into a catastrophe for those in Congress who created it. 
</P>
<P>
"In my seven years in Congress, no other issue has so captured the imagination 
of so large a group of constituents," Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The only question now is whether Congress will cut back the new Medicare 
program or consign it to the scrap heap. Proposals to repeal it, or at least to 
perform major surgery, will face a crucial vote in the House this week. 
</P>
<P>
The program sounds appealing enough. For America's 33 million Medicare 
beneficiaries, it provides financial protection against long-term hospital 
stays, massive doctor fees and the mounting cost of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But it created a grass-roots firestorm that caught the supposedly canny 
politicians who enacted it -- and even many Washington lobbyists for the 
elderly -- by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The sources of this rage are not hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic care program socks the most affluent and politically 
articulate elderly -- the 40% whose incomes are large enough that they must pay 
income taxes -- with a 15% surtax of up to $800 a year. But many of these same 
elderly say the new program's benefits largely duplicate free coverage many of 
them already have through private pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the elderly are not much happier. All of them, no matter how poor, 
must pay an extra $4 Medicare monthly premium in return for their new benefits. 
And even many of those who pay nothing more than the $4 a month say they have 
private insurance that already provides hospital, doctor and drug benefits just 
about as good as those now available from Medicare. All the elderly, rich and 
poor, share another complaint. The new program covers only a tiny part of what 
is usually the most catastrophic medical expense of all: long stays in nursing 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the surtax that's the big problem, it's the lack of benefits," says 
Joseph Schwartz of North Hollywood, former chief executive of a life insurance 
company. "I believe that the seniors would not give you a whimper -- I believe 
they would go along with an even higher surtax -- if there was a national 
health plan for everyone that took care of all the gaps we have today." 
</P>
<P>
And most galling of all to the elderly, the new plan violates a central 
principle of virtually every piece of social welfare legislation, including 
Social Security itself. It puts the cost entirely on the beneficiaries instead 
of spreading the burden over the whole population. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the rub," says Sally Abrams of North Hollywood, a red-haired former 
real estate broker and insurance agent. "They selected one group of people to 
pay an extra tax in addition to the regular tax. It makes many, many seniors 
afraid they will have to go on welfare." 
</P>
<P>
More mysterious than the revolt against the program is how official Washington 
-- Congress, former President Ronald Reagan and even the elderly's own 
representatives in the capital -- could have waded into such a swamp in the 
first place. Looking back, participants cite a host of factors: 
</P>
<P>
Proponents mistakenly assumed that a limited package of benefits would command 
almost as much appeal as the comprehensive one actually sought by the elderly 
but rejected by federal officials as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who proposed a catastrophic care plan, misgauged the impact of 
insisting that users of the new Medicare program be required to pay for all of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats, given a rare recent opportunity to expand a social 
program, added sweeteners to Reagan's plan and paid for them with a financing 
scheme that was intended to hit the rich harder than the poor but that also 
stung the bulk of middle-income elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite terming the catastrophic care plan inadequate, the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons lent strong support to it because it contained enticing new 
drug benefits -- benefits that helped not only the elderly, critics say, but 
also the lobbying group itself, which is a major drug marketer. 
</P>
<P>
Congress did not take seriously a flood of mail opposing the bill because the 
outpouring was prompted by a group widely criticized for its high-pressure 
fund-raising techniques and alarmist pronouncements -- the National Committee 
to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, headed by former Rep. James Roosevelt 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most new social programs, "there was never a constituent outcry for this 
particular legislation," says Judy Park, chief lobbyist for the National Assn. 
of Retired Federal Employees and co-chairwoman of a coalition of 46 groups 
seeking repeal of the surtax and a commensurate scale-down of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"The seniors were calling for long-term care," Park says, "but that was beyond 
the realm of possibility." The cost of insuring the elderly against 
nursing-home costs is estimated at up to $50 billion a year. The catastrophic 
care bill, by contrast, is expected to cost about $10 billion a year when its 
full benefit package kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the uproar, many of the program's initial champions in Congress are not 
ready to abandon it. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) suggests that "loose talk about repeal" is 
"dominated by a very small segment of senior citizens in this country," the 
ones who are faced with paying the maximum $800 surtax. 
</P>
<P>
Repeal "will deny someone's right to get an operation," Bradley says. "Do we 
try to make things less onerous on the basic taxpayer in the middle class, or 
do we try to help the top 5% of senior citizens" by removing the surtax? 
</P>
<P>
Senate Aging Committee Chairman David Pryor (D-Ark.), who hopes the program can 
be saved if it is trimmed, contends critics have serious misconceptions about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is psychology," he says. "They would rather go out and buy Medigap 
policies from insurance agents that they know and sing in the choir with. They 
don't understand what benefits they're going to have under this catastrophic 
program, but they understand what the guy down the street tells them about his 
policy. They believe him more than they believe us." 
</P>
<P>
But Pryor concedes that "the situation looks pretty desperate . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration supports the salvage efforts largely because of budget 
concerns. In its early years, the program is building up a reserve against the 
beefed-up benefit package that it will make available in 1991. The 
Administration is counting on the surplus generated by the catastrophic care 
program to reduce next year's federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The committees that wrote the catastrophic care bill are working to keep it, in 
truncated form. The proposal headed to the House floor this week from the Ways 
and Means Committee would cut the surtax in half but add another $3.50 a month 
to the Medicare premium paid by the elderly. A proposal before the Senate 
Finance Committee would reduce the surtax from 15% to 12% and the maximum 
surtax from $800 to $585. 
</P>
<P>
The way Berman sees it, Reagan "put us into a box" in 1987 when his 
catastrophic care proposal prescribed only a limited expansion of Medicare 
financed solely by beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance to really accomplish something during those eight barren 
years, and it caused us not to scrutinize reaction among seniors to the 
financing mechanism," Berman says. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), 
whose district abuts Berman's, was one of only 72 House members who voted 
against the bill. In a flurry of newspaper op-ed pieces, Beilenson argued that 
the measure "covered the wrong catastrophic needs" and would cost so much that 
Congress would be discouraged from ever extending coverage to nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
"A decent number of colleagues had reservations about the bill, but there 
seemed to be so much public support that it was bad to vote against it," 
Beilenson says now. He is pushing repeal "so we can go back to square one and 
provide the long-term coverage that everyone needs and wants." 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Retired Persons professes astonishment at the breadth of 
unhappiness. Officials figured to hear from only the 5.5% of the elderly who 
have to pay the full $800 surtax when they file their 1989 tax returns next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper, everybody else came out way ahead on the benefits," says John 
Rother, AARP's legislative director. "From our polling and meetings around the 
country, the key to the whole opposition is a misperception that everyone has 
to pay $800 or that most of them already have the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, about 70% of the older population has a Medigap policy and another 
10% has Medicaid, but those generally don't reach the long-term hospital care 
or drug benefits in the catastrophic program." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also accuse AARP of supporting the program to boost business for its 
mail-order drug service. Rother says a study by Money magazine found that there 
was "no possible AARP gain from the drug benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Far from the politicians and lobbyists, many of the elderly at the grass roots 
are tired of being told about their misconceptions and their greed. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that if you're over 65, you either are sickly or you're certainly 
not intelligent enough to figure out these scams," says Lucille Wildman, a 
retired interior decorator who attended the Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks meeting. "We 
do think, and we are aware of what's happening. And more and more of us are 
determined not to reelect any of the incumbents unless they make some effort to 
do something." 
</P>
<P>
Mulman puts it even more forcefully. "These congressmen who want to give 
themselves a 51% raise because they can't live on $89,500 a year are telling us 
who make $14,000, $17,000 and $20,000 that we are affluent and we can afford 
the surtax," he says. "It's fallacious, it's arrogant and it's cause for defeat 
of anybody who continually uses that argument." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COSTS AND BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
WHAT THE ELDERLY PAY 
</P>
<P>
Medicare premium: The monthly premium for Part B, which covers doctor bills, 
includes a catastrophic care charge of $4 in 1989, $4.90 in 1990, $7.40 in 
1991, $9.20 in 1992 and $10.20 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Surtax: The elderly who pay income taxes -- about 40% of the total -- pay a 
surtax of 15% up to a maximum surtax of $800 a year. The surtax rises to 25% 
and a maximum of $850 in 1990, 26% and $900 in 1991, 27% and $950 in 1992 and 
28% and $1,050 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT THE ELDERLY RECEIVE 
</P>
<P>
Effective Jan. 1, 1989: 
</P>
<P>
Hospital: Medicare no longer requires the patient to pay a share of costs after 
60 days of hospitalization. The patient continues to pay $560 for the first day 
of care, and all remaining days are free. 
</P>
<P>
Skilled nursing care: For patients recuperating from a treatable medical 
problem and requiring medical attention from a nurse, Medicare covers the costs 
even if the patients have not just spent at least three days in a hospital. The 
benefit is available for 150 days a year. Patients pay $25.50 a day for the 
first eight days. 
</P>
<P>
Hospice: The 210-day lifetime limit for the benefit is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty: States pay the monthly premiums and deductibles under Medicare for 
persons with incomes below 85% of the poverty line. All pregnant women and 
infants under 1 year old in families living below the poverty line become 
eligible for Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Sept. 30, 1989: 
</P>
<P>
Spousal protection: A spouse of a nursing home patient may keep more of the 
family income and assets when Medicaid begins picking up nursing-home costs. In 
California, which has asked for a waiver, this provision takes effect Jan. 1, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Jan. 1, 1990: 
</P>
<P>
Doctor bills: Patients still pay the first $75 a year in doctor bills and 20% 
of the rest, but Medicare picks up all additional costs when patients' costs 
reach $1,370 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drugs: Patient pay the first $550, and Medicare then pays 80% of 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Home health: Medicare covers home health care up to 38 consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
Mammograms: Medicare pays up to $50. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty: States pay the monthly premiums and deductibles for persons with 
incomes below 90% of the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Jan. 1, 1991: 
</P>
<P>
Prescription drugs and insulin: Patients pay the first $600 a year, and 
Medicare then pays 50% of the rest, rising to 60% in 1992 and 80% in 1993 and 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty: States pay the monthly premiums and deductibles for persons with 
incomes below 95% of the poverty line.

2ND TIME'S THE CHARM FOR CHANNEL SWIMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exhausted but triumphant Vicki Keith waded ashore in San Pedro Saturday 
after becoming the first swimmer to complete the 22-mile crossing from Santa 
Catalina Island using the butterfly stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a swim cap emblazoned with the maple leaf of her native Canada, Keith 
trudged onto Cabrillo Beach at 4:27 p.m., 14 hours, 53 minutes and 26 seconds 
after wading into the chilly Pacific near Emerald Bay on the island. 
</P>
<P>
"I never doubted I would make it," Keith said, "but there were three or four 
hours there that I was concerned it would be after dark." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determined Return 
</P>
<P>
Keith said she was unable to see the beach through gray haze. Then, she said, 
the shore finally broke into the view and she knew her arrival would be right 
on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The swim marked a determined return for the 28-year-old school teacher who 
failed to complete the same swim in July, surrendering to excruciating pain in 
her joints after more than 19 hours in the water. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Keith said she was sore but was able to continue. Unlike July's 
attempt, she said her performance was not daunted by jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
The swim capped a summer in which she completed three major marathon swimming 
feats -- crossings of the English Channel, the Juan de Fuca Strait separating 
the state of Washington from Victoria, British Columbia, and now the Catalina 
Channel -- all with the butterfly stroke. 
</P>
<P>
The stroke, in which both arms flail forward in the air and are then pulled 
through the water, expends so much energy that Keith said she had been told 
that swimming the channel would be impossible. She added that she hopes to 
start swimming again as soon as today -- and can't wait to return to using a 
regular crawl stroke after months of butterfly stroke training. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought of Sharks 
</P>
<P>
Keith said the trip generally went smoothly and her spirits remained high. But 
in the black, 68-degree seas of early morning, she said thoughts of a shark 
attack kept running through her head. 
</P>
<P>
"The first hour and a half, the only thing I could think about was sharks," she 
said. "I was looking everywhere." She said she saw anchovies and jelly fish -- 
being careful to avoid a sting -- and was even trailed by a school of dolphins 
without ever encountering a shark. 
</P>
<P>
Keith was accompanied along the way by a crew aboard the support boat, "Cold 
Spaghetti" out of San Pedro, and a team on paddle boards to authenticate her 
feat for the record books. She was aided by near-ideal weather conditions -- 
relatively calm seas and mild currents -- and she credited her navigator for 
choosing a successful route. She stopped several times along the way and 
treaded water as she talked with the crew and took quick gulps of hot chocolate 
or bites of fruit cocktail. Then she would resume the long, lonely ordeal -- 
churning along with 24 to 28 strokes a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Clark and Margaret Dickson, observers for the Catalina Channel Swimming 
Federation who went along to verify the swim, said Keith was in such a good 
mood that she teased members of her crew. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
63rd to Swim Channel 
</P>
<P>
She becomes the 63rd swimmer to cross the channel, albeit the first to use the 
unique stroke. The fastest crossing ever was made by Penny Lee Dean, swimming 
from the mainland to the island in September, 1976, in 7 hours, 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In attempting the marathon swimming feats, Keith was trying to raise money for 
local charities that include the Pediatric AIDS Clinic at County-USC Medical 
Center and the UCLA Children's Artificial Limb Bank. Her representatives said 
they did not yet know how much money she raised.

TENACIOUS MONO BACKERS USE SOPHISTICATED TACTICS TO BEAT DWP TO ITS KNEES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tourists come and go from the homey Mono Lake visitor center and store here on 
the west shore without having any hint of the sophisticated public relations 
war being waged on Los Angeles in the cluttered back rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A staff of eight -- backed by computers, fax machines and a yearly budget of 
$700,000, plus a Yale-educated director and five more operatives in Los Angeles 
-- alerts the world to any threats against the bright blue saline lake in the 
eastern Sierra Nevada. They cajole magazines into running articles on the lake, 
lead tours and sell Mono Lake coffee mugs and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Mono Lake Committee has amassed enough legal and political 
muscle to force the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- a powerful 
presence in the eastern Sierra -- to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation signed Saturday by Gov. George Deukmejian elevates the Mono Lake 
Committee's blue-jean clad activists to nearly equal status with Los Angeles in 
deciding the fate of the city's once-sacred rights to the water that flows 
naturally down four streams and into the primordial lake, one of the oldest on 
the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The bill marks a high point for the group, which recently has racked up victory 
after victory in its battle to reduce the amount of water Los Angeles takes 
from the Mono Lake streams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees City as Interloper 
</P>
<P>
The group began humbly in 1978 as an idea of David Gaines, a thin, bearded 
science student and bird lover. He regarded Los Angeles as an interloper bent 
on killing the scenic lake. For 40 years the city had dammed the stream flow 
and sent it south to Los Angeles by aqueduct. Denied any fresh water in almost 
years, the lake had dropped 40 feet, exposing 21 square miles of lake bottom. 
</P>
<P>
As the water level dropped the salinity nearly doubled, threatening to upset 
the delicate ecosystem. Thousands of California gulls, grebes and other 
migratory birds feed on brine flies and brine shrimp, which also are harvested 
commercially as food for tropical fish. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Gaines, the group managed to bring the isolated lake's threatened demise 
to world attention. They complained that the lowering water exposed nesting 
gulls to danger, including from coyotes who crossed a formerly submerged land 
bridge to Negit Island, one of two large islands. 
</P>
<P>
Before long the lake was pictured on the cover of Life magazine and featured in 
National Geographic and Sports Illustrated. The National Audubon Society took a 
key role in the fight to halt the evaporation of the lake, filing the main 
lawsuit that now threatens to strip Los Angeles of its 50-year-old water 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP, target of most of the group's barbs, at first tried to ignore Gaines 
and his band of graduate students, activists and summer interns. Only recently 
have city officials acknowledged the group's triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been a well-organized, effective group for a long time," conceded 
Duane Georgeson, DWP assistant general manager. "They've done a pretty good job 
mobilizing public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widely Publicized 
</P>
<P>
The group has publicized Mono Lake so widely that the U.S. Forest Service 
estimates that more than 250,000 people visited last year. More than 80,000 -- 
including thousands of Germans and Australians, drawn by extensive magazine 
coverage -- stopped into the visitors' center on the main street in the town of 
Lee Vining. 
</P>
<P>
More than 18,000 members pay $20 a year to belong, said assistant director 
Betsy Reifsnider. About 40% come from the Bay Area and California's north 
coast, where "Save Mono Lake" bumper stickers are a common sight. One-third 
come from Southern California, the rest from Sierra counties, the Central 
Valley and out of state. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the $700,000 annual budget -- up from $250,000 in 1984 -- is 
donated by members. The rest comes from foundation grants, sales at the store 
and fund-raising events, including adventure trips and an annual auction of 
fine wines. More than $80,000 was raised last month in pledges to bicyclists 
who rode from DWP headquarters in Los Angeles to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, selling the lake's charms has not proven difficult. The Mono Lake 
landscape is stark to some, the essence of California's physical beauty to many 
others. 
</P>
<P>
A 65-square-mile puddle of blue on the edge of a desert plain 6,000 feet above 
sea level, the lake is battered by desert heat in summer and freezing winter 
winds that swirl clouds of alkali dust not advisable for breathing. Mark Twain 
spent time on the larger of two islands, Paoha Island, half of which is owned 
by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On the shore, millions of brine flies keep up a constant buzz, kicking up in 
waist-high hordes when intruders come near. Swimmers can float in the water -- 
salty enough to sting the eyes -- and risk encounters with black, thigh-deep 
mud on some parts of the shore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In View of Sierra 
</P>
<P>
Views from the lake surface include the steep face of the High Sierra rising 
above 13,000 feet to the west. The even higher White Mountains loom east across 
the desert. To the south prehistoric volcanic craters and obsidian domes, and 
an eerie valley inundated in pumice that is part of the DWP's huge eastern 
Sierra land holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Tufa towers, columns of hardened salts and minerals, rise in places along the 
shore. The towers formed under water and were exposed by the dropping water 
level, becoming one of the lake's scenic lures. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the committee claimed its first major victory, convincing state 
lawmakers to establish a tufa reserve. Congress later designated the entire 
lake a national scenic area. The committee also managed to persuade the 
California Department of Transportation to post an official highway sign 
pointing tourists to the group's privately run visitor center. 
</P>
<P>
Committee pressure also helped secure state money for studies that have backed 
up the group's central contention -- that nesting birds, especially California 
gulls, were endangered by the dropping water level. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the studies -- including those by a state task force, the National 
Academy of Sciences and the forest service -- urged that the lake level be 
raised and kept at a higher level to ensure that the lake's birds survive. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to say the environmentalists were crying wolf about Mono Lake," said 
Martha Davis, committee executive director. "They don't say that any more." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines and another staff member, Don Oberlin, were killed in a January, 1988, 
car crash near here. Sally Gaines, his wife, is still co-chair of the group 
with Ed Groswiler, a former congressional aide who is an official of Pacific 
Power &amp; Light, an Oregon utility company. 
</P>
<P>
But the major force is Davis, a 35-year-old Stanford graduate who also holds a 
Yale masters degree in forest science. She was a Marin County parks 
commissioner before joining the group in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"As an environmental group (the committee) very wisely recognized early on that 
it wouldn't work to argue whether Los Angeles has the rights to eastern Sierra 
water," Davis said. "We haven't tried to turn back the clock. The focus has 
always been on protecting Mono Lake." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tilt Toward Preservation 
</P>
<P>
One tactic has been to mount pressure on the city through court suits, which 
have clearly started to tilt in favor of lake preservation over Los Angeles' 
water rights. 
</P>
<P>
The group has benefitted from 10 years of donated legal work from the large San 
Francisco firm of Morrison &amp; Foerster. Attorneys for the firm, representing 
the Audubon Society and the Mono Lake Committee, won a landmark ruling that the 
public trust doctrine forbids Los Angeles from killing off the lake and its 
streams to protect its water supply. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Los Angeles was ordered to release more stream water into the 
lake, and a court voided the city's licenses to collect any water from the Mono 
Lake area. The city, which obtains about 15% of its water from the Mono Lake 
streams, was allowed to continue diverting some water until it can reapply for 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become pretty clear that the California courts are not totally 
sympathetic to our arguments," the DWP's Georgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nature provided the crucial stroke of good fortune for the committee's 
position. Two winters of heavy snowfall caused water to spill over two of the 
city's dams in 1984, sending water down the streams that feed Mono Lake. With 
the water came trout, restoring fisheries that had died off when the city dried 
up the streams. 
</P>
<P>
State law forbids killing off a fishery to supply water to any aqueduct, so 
when Los Angeles resumed its normal practice of shutting off water to the 
streams, an anglers' group and the Mono Lake Committee filed suits. Those suits 
recently led to a preliminary injunction ordering the city to release what is 
left of this summer's Sierra runoff into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Reach Agreement 
</P>
<P>
The bill signed by Deukmejian on Saturday will set aside $65 million to help 
pay for an alternative source of water for Los Angeles. The bill's major catch, 
however, is that the city must first reach agreement with the Mono Lake 
Committee on where that water should come from. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson said they are looking to buy unused water from growers in the San 
Joaquin Valley, but Davis said the city could make up much of the water by 
conserving in Los Angeles. The committee has offered to help sell water 
conservation within the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to keep the door open with the city of Los Angeles," Davis said.

Two minor earthquakes rattled Southern California but caused no damage or 
injuries, officials said. The first quake, with a magnitude of 2.9, hit at 
12:19 p.m. about seven miles west of Rialto in San Bernardino County, said Hall 
Daily, spokesman at Caltech in Pasadena. The second quake came at 2:03 p.m., 
measured 2.4 and was centered three miles north of the Los Angeles Civic 
Center. That one was felt by residents of Silver Lake, Atwater, the Wilshire 
District and nearby neighborhoods, police said. Daily said the two quakes were 
not related. A quake with a magnitude of 2 is the smallest normally felt by 
humans. A 3.5-magnitude quake can cause slight damage in populated areas.

The Alaska criminal trial for fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood has 
been delayed until early next year. The significance of the case prompted 
prosecutors and defense lawyers to suggest a delay, and during a hearing, a 
state Superior Court judge canceled the Oct. 30 trial date and set Jan. 8 for 
the start. Hazelwood, 43, is free on $50,000 bail. He faces three misdemeanors 
-- operating the tanker while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil -- and three felony counts of criminal mischief. Hazelwood's 
lawyers have filed motions to dismiss some of the charges. The defense also is 
seeking to move the trial out of the small town of Valdez. Hazelwood was in 
command of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24, spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.

The English-speaking minority of French-dominated Quebec, who have watched 
their education and language rights erode, are looking to use upcoming 
provincial elections to force the government to treat their concerns more 
seriously. The main contenders in the Sept. 25 election are the Liberal Party, 
which was supported by 50% of the voters in a recent opinion poll, and Parti 
Quebecois, with 39% backing. But the upstart Equality Party, promising cultural 
guarantees for the Anglophone minority in the Canadian province, has the 
backing of about 5% of the voters and could win two or three seats in the 
National Assembly.

For the first time since World War II, Poland's Communist Party is not in 
control of the nation's broadcast media, as Solidarity journalist Andrzej 
Drawicz was named to run the state-owned television and radio networks. 
Drawicz, 57, a specialist in Soviet affairs and a former political prisoner, 
was named by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The choice to head the 
broadcast media was the major remaining question mark in Mazowiecki's 
government. The post will not retain its Cabinet rank, reflecting the new 
government's view that there should be nothing like an information minister 
trying to shape public opinion.

 -- Most members of Congress say it's time for a change in change. But others 
think the idea isn't worth a plugged nickel. At least 260 House members and 66 
senators are co-sponsoring legislation to change the "tail" sides of coins, 
replacing such pictures as Thomas Jefferson's home and the Lincoln Memorial 
with themes celebrating the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The "heads" would 
still carry portraits of Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
George Washington and John F. Kennedy, although the portraits would be revised. 
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) blocked similar legislation in the House last 
year. "On a scale of importance from one to 10, coin design change rates a 
zero," he said. And U.S. Mint Director Donna Pope said there is no evidence 
that anyone who doesn't collect coins "is dissatisfied with current coin 
designs, or even favors new ones."

 -- Famous fans sang the praises of Irving Berlin, "a legendary man whose words 
and music will help define the history of our nation," in the words of 
President Bush. Bush joined a Boston crowd of thousands in singing "God Bless 
America," one of the classic songs by Berlin, who died Friday at age 101. 
Ginger Rogers, longtime partner of Fred Astaire, said working with Berlin in 
the 1935 film "Top Hat" was "like heaven." Morton Gould, president of the 
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, said Berlin's works are 
"part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul." Former 
President Ronald Reagan expressed his sorrow in a statement that called the 
composer "a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred 
millions, and will live on forever." John Wallowitch, who had organized 
Christmas Eve serenades outside Berlin's Manhattan townhouse for more than two 
decades, said he and three friends went to the home after Berlin's death. 
Wallowitch said: "We just stood there and cried a lot and sang: 'I'll be loving 
you always.' "

 -- Two rare books written or printed by Benjamin Franklin were stolen from the 
University of Pennsylvania library, police said. Franklin printed "A Sermon on 
Education," by Richard Peters, in 1751. It includes a pamphlet by Franklin 
called "An Idea of an English School" and is worth $10,000. The second book, "A 
Log of Books to Be Sold," was written by Franklin in 1744 and is worth between 
$25,000 and $50,000. DAVE JOHNSON

The body of a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities 
and missing since early August was discovered in an abandoned well about 15 
miles outside Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Arab sources said. 
Masked Palestinians had reportedly kidnaped Salah Mohammed Hadi, 22. In the 
occupied Gaza Strip, two Arabs were wounded by army gunfire in clashes in the 
Nusseirat refugee camp, Arab reports said. The clashes occurred after a camp 
curfew was imposed and residents were forced to paint over political graffiti. 
A third Arab was reported wounded in a clash with troops in Nablus.

QUAYLE BACKS JAPAN TIES

Vice President Dan Quayle, who toured two northern Japan military bases on the 
third day of his Far East visit, said that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty must 
not be touched. "Anybody who thinks you ought to tamper, rewrite or modify the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is wrong," Quayle told reporters during a flight to 
Chitose and Misawa, the two main air bases guarding northern Japan. Japan's 
opposition Socialist Party has called for scaling back U.S.-Japan military 
ties. In the Philippines, the May One Movement, a 750,000-member labor group, 
accused the United States of attempting to pressure Manila to extend the lease 
on key U.S. military bases and vowed protests during Quayle's visit, which 
begins Tuesday.

BUSH SIGNS BILL AIMED AT FREEING MOTHER JAILED IN CUSTODY BATTLE

President Bush on Saturday signed a bill designed to free a Washington mother 
jailed 25 months ago in a bitter child custody dispute, and attorneys filed an 
emergency motion for her release. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush signed the bill to free 
Dr. Elizabeth Morgan "out of compassion for her plight." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by Congress amid growing national interest in the case. 
It applies retroactively to Morgan, who was jailed for failing to produce her 
7-year-old daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered visits with the girl's father, 
Dr. Eric Foretich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleges Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, a prominent plastic surgeon, hid her daughter and went to jail after 
alleging that Foretich had sexually abused the girl. Foretich has repeatedly 
denied those charges and at one point offered a $5,000 reward for information 
that would help find the girl. 
</P>
<P>
The child's whereabouts, however, remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after Bush signed the bill, Morgan's attorney, Adrian Roe, filed the 
papers with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals seeking her release. 
</P>
<P>
Court Clerk Richard Hoffman then began telephoning each of the nine judges on 
the panel in hopes that one could come to the courthouse and review the 
request. Despite the new law, Morgan cannot be freed without a judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing my best to transmit it to the judges, and that's all I can do," 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Roe said he was "hopeful the court will act promptly, but we have no 
guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cap on Contempt Jailings 
</P>
<P>
The bill takes advantage of Congress' authority to review district laws and 
among other things sets a 12-month cap for civil contempt child custody 
jailings. It also contains a so-called sunset provision, which means it 
automatically goes off the books in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), the House sponsor, and Utah Republican Orrin G. 
Hatch, who pushed the measure in the Senate, both have said that they were 
motivated by concern for Morgan's dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich and his attorney, Elaine Mittleman, have complained that the bill does 
not require Morgan to produce Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has been badly served by his advisers," Mittleman said in a 
telephone interview Saturday. "President Bush obviously loves children, but 
this bill does nothing to ensure that Hilary will ever see her father again."

2 ADMIT KILLING GALAN, BOGOTA GENERAL SAYS

Two captured men have confessed to killing a popular presidential candidate, 
the army says, and a congressional leader said he was contacted by Colombia's 
two most notorious drug lords with a new offer to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Bogota's half a dozen daily newspapers quoted an army general Saturday as 
saying the army now knows who hired the alleged assassins of Sen. Luis Carlos 
Galan, whose Aug. 18 killing led the government to declare war on drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
But Gen. Ramon Niebles did not disclose who ordered the killing, the newspapers 
said. Niebles made the statement Friday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The general was quoted as saying that the two men who confessed to killing 
Galan were part of a band called the Blackies. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were captured Thursday in a Bogota house where the army found 
weapons, ammunition and 220 pounds of dynamite, the general said. 
</P>
<P>
Twice before, police have said they captured Galan's killers -- once five men, 
and once 11 men. Both times the suspects were released after a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of Colombia's House of Representatives, Norberto 
Morales, told a news conference in Medellin that he was telephoned by Pablo 
Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, kingpins of the infamous Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Morales said Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha offered to invest millions of dollars 
in Colombian industry if a truce is reached. He said he had passed the 
information along to President Virgilio Barco Vargas, who has refused to 
conduct negotiations with the traffickers.

U.S., INDUSTRIAL ALLIES URGE DOLLAR CURBS BEFORE IMF TALKS

The United States and its six major economic allies declared Saturday that the 
value of the dollar has risen too high in recent months and vowed to continue 
intervening jointly in the world's foreign exchange markets to keep it from 
climbing further. 
</P>
<P>
In a regularly scheduled session on the eve of Monday's annual meeting of the 
International Monetary Fund, finance ministers and central bankers of the seven 
countries reaffirmed the same upper and lower limits for the dollar's value 
that they have maintained for 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The rise in recent months of the dollar (is) inconsistent with longer-run 
economic fundamentals," the group said in a formal communique. It warned that a 
further rise of the dollar above current levels "could adversely affect 
prospects for the world economy." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what impact the group's decision would have over 
the next few weeks. The dollar has been rising steadily since last spring and 
now is well above the ceilings that the Group of Seven -- as the ministers' 
group is known -- have been maintaining. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations were that the United States and its allies would intervene heavily 
in the foreign exchange markets in the next few days if only to offset any 
tendency by the markets to interpret Saturday's decision as a green light to 
push the dollar still higher. 
</P>
<P>
But the allies already have been selling dollars heavily in recent months in an 
effort to keep the dollar from rising further, and so far they have been 
unsuccessful. The U.S. currency has been above the upper limit they set for it 
for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to hopes by some U.S. strategists, the ministers apparently rejected 
any notion that the seven seek to reverse the dollar's rise by changing 
interest-rate levels in each of the major countries -- a move designed to ease 
demand for dollars and drive their value down. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan would have involved increases in interest rates in West Germany and 
Japan and -- possibly -- a simultaneous drop in interest rates here at home. 
But while Japan reportedly agreed to go along, West Germany demurred and the 
Federal Reserve Board declined. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing for reporters, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the 
ministers -- along with the governors of each country's central bank -- had 
agreed not to answer any questions on the dollar beyond the language in the 
communique. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, the language that the finance ministers used was stronger 
than that that the ministers used in their last public communique, in April, 
when they warned only that "a rise of the dollar which undermined adjustment 
efforts . . . would be counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday's communique, which declared that the dollar's recent rise had 
been "inconsistent with longer-run economic fundamentals," gave no hint of any 
new measures or policy changes beyond the intervention that the seven already 
have been pursuing since the trade deficit peaked in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven, as the ministers and central bankers are known informally, 
has been under heavy fire recently amid increasing questions about the 
credibility of its efforts to keep exchange rates stable as promised. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the United States, the Group of Seven includes West Germany, Japan, 
Britain, France, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the dollar has been rising for several reasons, among them sharply 
higher interest rates and lower inflation rates in the United States, political 
controversy in West Germany and Japan and perceptions of America as a haven for 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
But economists have been warning recently that if the dollar's value rises much 
further, it could make U.S. exports less competitive and increase demand for 
imports.

CARMELITE ORDER BACKS AUSCHWITZ CONVENT MOVE

Leaders of the Roman Catholic Carmelite order said Saturday that they support 
moving one of their convents from the former Auschwitz death camp in Poland as 
Jewish groups have demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Father Anthony Morello, general counselor of the Carmelite order, said he gave 
his order's assurances it supported moving the convent away from the Nazi death 
camp during a meeting with Sigmund Sternberg, head of the International Council 
of Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Morello said he affirmed that all along the position of the 
general of the order, Father Philip Sainz de Baranda, "has been that agreements 
must be honored." 
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say exactly when the meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg helped moderate the Auschwitz dispute when he announced Friday that 
the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, had assured him in a letter that the 
convent must be moved from the site of the death camp. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic and Jewish leaders agreed in Geneva in 1987 to move the Carmelite 
convent. The nuns were to be transferred to a nearby prayer center last 
February, but the center was not erected and the nuns remain at a building 
beside the Auschwitz camp. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp and other Polish church leaders later opposed moving the nuns. In 
defending the current site, Glemp made statements that some Jews viewed as 
anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Many Polish Catholics have supported keeping the convent where it is. They 
argue that the nuns are not harming anyone and that many Polish Catholics were 
killed at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish groups complained that the convent and its religious symbols are 
offensive at a site where 2.5 million Jews were killed as part of Hitler's 
campaign to exterminate European Jews during World War II. About 1.5 million of 
Auschwitz's 4 million victims were Polish Christians and other non-Jews.

The Soviet Union, continuing a major modernization of naval power, has deployed 
one of its newest nuclear attack submarines with the key Arctic northern fleet 
for the first time, Norway said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are upgrading the quality and firepower of the northern fleet all 
the time and there is little sign of disarmament in that area," said Col. 
Gullow Gjeseth of Norway's Defense Command. 
</P>
<P>
An observation plane from Norway, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, spotted the Akula-class submarine, which carries SS-N-21 nuclear 
cruise missiles as well as torpedoes, while on patrol in the Barents Sea two 
weeks ago. It photographed the vessel after it surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Gjeseth said the Soviet Union had previously deployed only three Akulas, all in 
the Pacific Ocean.

The state's Republican Committee on Saturday declined to censure state Rep. 
David Duke for his past as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has no authority to kick Duke out of the party, but two committee 
members who worked on the censure said they had done so because of Duke's past 
of "promoting racial violence, his anti-Semitism and his neo-Nazi 
philosophies." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Curran and Elizabeth Rickey, both of New Orleans, tried to introduce the 
resolution at the party's quarterly meeting. The resolution was tabled without 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
Curran and Rickey worked for Duke's opponent, John Treen, during the campaign, 
Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they can't accuse me of doing anything wrong. They can't question 
my stated platforms. They have to go back in my past," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, censured Duke after 
he won his legislative seat in February. But the state Republican Party has 
shied away from any move to censure Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, from Metairie, joined the klan in 1968 and left in 1980 after six years 
as grand wizard, a national post. Duke later founded a group called the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of White People, which he still heads.

Drawing cheers and applause from about 70,000 spectators, Korean folk dancers 
gently waving sashes and paper fans met with foot-stomping drill squads and 
heart-pounding drum teams Saturday afternoon at the 16th annual Korean Festival 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Billed with the theme "Today's Youths, Tomorrow's Leaders," the parade 
attracted youth-oriented floats, motorcades, dancers and other performers -- 
about 250 entries in all -- to the heart of Koreatown on Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time when Koreans celebrate our heritage, our community, our 
togetherness," said spectator Tong Soo Chung, 34, of Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said the parade was meant to celebrate a spirit of friendship. 
"We're not just for the Korean ethnic community, we're for the community as a 
whole," parade official Stanley Lim said. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators applauded a baton-twirling team, then watched intently as Korean 
folk performers in colorful costumes and masks danced to the cadence of a 
cymbal. Students of the Korean martial art Tae Kwon Do jogged down the almost 
mile-long route, stopping occasionally to demonstrate how aerial kicks can 
split wood boards. 
</P>
<P>
The parade capped a cultural festival sponsored by Korean community leaders in 
Los Angeles. U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, Mayor Tom Bradley and numerous leaders in 
the Korean community and local government participated in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Some spectators watched the parade from second-story windows or were perched 
atop retaining walls, but most of the crowd packed the sidewalks and spilled 
onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Chapple showed up to see her two teen-age sons whip out fast-paced drum 
beats as part of a drill squad's percussion quartet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to shock them," the 35-year-old Los Angeles resident said. 
"Usually, I don't go to these things. This is my first time."

MAN KILLED, OFFICER HURT IN SHOOT-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robbery suspect was killed and a Covina police officer was wounded Saturday 
in an exchange of gunfire, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the dead man nor the wounded officer was immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said the incident began about 5:35 p.m. when 
Covina officers received a call that two men were attempting to rob a liquor 
store near the intersection of Azusa Avenue and Grondahl Street. 
</P>
<P>
When the officers arrived, Estrada said, the suspects were gone. One of the men 
later was spotted nearby. The man fired at an officer and wounded him, Estrada 
said. The officer returned fire but the suspect fled into a condominium complex 
where he unsuccessfully tried to force his way into one of the units. 
</P>
<P>
When that failed, Estrada said, the man apparently tried to hide in a car 
parked in a nearby garage. He was spotted by officers from Covina and West 
Covina. The suspect fired at the officers who returned fire and killed him, 
said Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's homicide investigators were called in to help with the investigation. 
The wounded policeman was listed in good condition at Covina Intercommunity 
Hospital with a gunshot wound in his right side.

A 500-YEAR-OLD TRADITION BLAZES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
AN ANCIENT FORM OF JAPANESE DRAMA, OUTDOORS AND LIT BY FIRELIGHT, CAPTURES THE 
IMAGINATION OF AUDIENCES 
</P>

since 1959.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Noh by Firelight" or Takigi Noh is possibly the only public event in Japan 
today where you will see a stately matron in proper kimono sitting next to a 
teenybopper straight from the low-price, high-fashion boutiques of Harajuku, or 
a dark-suited businessman next to a leather-clad rock musician. 
</P>
<P>
For some unexplained reason, the presentation of an ancient form of drama under 
the stars has caught the imagination of the people of Japan so strongly that 
they flock to any outdoor venue to see it. The plays, however, continue to be 
somber and frequently esoteric dance-dramas (with the lead actor often masked), 
supplemented by broad, one-act comedies. 
</P>
<P>
Sadayo Kita, principal actor of the tour group that appears at the Japan 
America Theater Plaza on Tuesday and the following evening at South Coast Town 
Plaza in Costa Mesa, muses on the phenomenon. "Perhaps it is the natural 
ambiance of the stars and the moon and the trees," he says, "or the play of the 
light from the flames on the masks, giving them an added depth of mystical 
expression." 
</P>
<P>
"Or it might simply be the picnic atmosphere that helps people relax and open 
their minds to share an experience they never thought they would be able to 
enjoy in the confines of an indoor theater." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the variety of places it is presented today is vast. The number of 
shrines and temples (where it got its start) has increased and such unexpected 
spots as public parks, castle grounds and shopping malls have joined the list 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
There is even one high-rise office complex in the downtown Tokyo business 
district with a plaza between its towers, which becomes an ice-skating rink in 
the winter. In warmer weather, a stage of steel pipes and unfinished wood is 
set up for Takigi Noh. All together the unofficial count of Takigi Noh venues 
comes to about 100. 
</P>
<P>
And the traditional torches mounted on iron tripods are supplemented by complex 
modern lighting systems -- with strobes and lasers in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Major Noh ensembles have periodically appeared in Los Angeles -- and the Kita 
Noh company graced the Japan America Theatre three years ago. But those 
performances were all indoor events in contrast to the upcoming Takigi Noh 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, however, the history of sacred outdoor performances by firelight is 
extremely long, Kita explains. "The earliest records indicate that a festival 
was presented every February at the Buddhist Kofuku Temple and the Shintoist 
Kasuga Shrine complex in Nara beginning in the 9th Century," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Since this was 500 some years before the time of (Motokiyo) Zeami, the creator 
of the Noh drama as we know it today, the performing arts given by firelight in 
the early days was in the realm of primitive Noh, called Sangaku or Sarugaku." 
</P>
<P>
But the tradition proved a strong one. The story is told that when a certain 
shogun died on the day of a performance, an official order was passed down to 
cancel the festivities, but the actors insisted on going on anyway. They 
declared that the only things that could keep them from performing were the 
death of the emperor and rain. 
</P>
<P>
Today a temporary platform is provided, but at one time performances were given 
on the grass. If the grass seemed damp, an official and the leading actor would 
place five layers of Japanese rice paper (washi) on the grass and step on it. 
If moisture came all the way through, the performance would be canceled, but if 
even the top sheet remained dry, the show would go on. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1868, the joint precincts of the Kofuku Temple and the Kasuga Shrine was 
the exclusive home of Takigi Noh. However, its history was broken off in that 
year, it was not revived for 17 years, and its presentations remained quite 
fragmentary until after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Kita adds, "It was around the turn of the century that Noh was brought indoors 
for the first time. Even today, the (indoor) stage maintains something of its 
original outdoor dignity with a highly crafted thatched roof supported by 
pillars at the four corners, and its token area of white pebbles (which was 
much broader and meant to reflect the light of the sun during the day, and the 
flames of the torches at night, up onto the stage)." 
</P>
<P>
"The new cramped quarters resulted in a more staid, museum-like, 'official art 
form,' attitude among both actors and audiences, and the subsequent drop in 
attendance," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Takigi Noh began to rise in the late 1940s. During the 
ensuing decade, the Heian Shrine in Kyoto, the Kamakura Shrine in Kamakura, and 
the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo "took up the torch." Then in the '50s and '60s, about 
30 more shrines joined in, but it wasn't until the late '70s that the number 
began to burgeon with breathtaking speed. 
</P>
<P>
In a way it is all part of a general return to the "real" traditional arts and 
crafts by the Japanese people that seems to have been touched off partly by the 
opening of the National Theatre of Japan (for Kabuki and Bunraku, basically) in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
On the opening night of this U.S. tour of the Kita Noh Company and the Nomura 
family of Kyogen, the program will consist of two Noh plays with one Kyogen 
(comedy) in between. About 1,000 portable seats will be set up in the Japan 
American Theater Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The first Noh play, Zeami's "Takasago," is presented in an abbreviated version 
consisting of the final scene. Anshin Uchida, who dances the role of the deity 
in it, says: "We chose this half-Noh due to its ceremonial elements. It serves 
to purify the stage, bless the audience with good fortune, and bring peace to 
the entire land. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that this would be a most appropriate way to begin our Takigi Noh tour 
of the United States." Half-Noh are often given for such special ceremonial 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the previously announced "Persimmon Thief," the Kyogen is titled 
"The Snail" (Kagyu). The servant Tarokaja is sent out to find a snail for his 
master. Since he has never seen a snail before, he finds a warrior priest in a 
thicket and thinks he is a snail. The warrior priest decides to go along with 
Tarokaja as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Mansaku Nomura, who plays the warrior priest, explains: "The ending is a 
special celebratory one. In the more usual version, the master and Tarokaja 
chase the warrior priest off, scolding that he has tricked them." Like Sadayo 
Kita, Nomura has been designated an "Intangible Cultural Asset" by the Japanese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The final piece on the program is the classic demon-play "Maple Viewing" 
(Momiji-Gari) by Kojiro Nobumitsu Kanze. Sadayo Kita, who plays the devil-woman 
in it, says: "This play deftly shows two contrasting types of acting in a 
single character. A devil-woman is disguised as a beautiful high-ranking lady 
at first, and then reveals her true nature later." 
</P>
<P>
"Thus we have an elegant woman's dance in the first scene with a ferocious 
demon's dance and a battle scene in the closing part." 
</P>
<P>
The program for Costa Mesa will include the Noh plays "Sumidagawa" and 
"Kokaji," along with the Kyogen "Kakiyamabushi" (Persimmon Thief). Performances 
in Berkeley, Ithaca and New York City are also scheduled -- many of them 
indoors.

ONE JACKSON DIVIDES INTO TWO JAZZ QUARTETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milt Jackson lives a double life and would not object to enlarging that scope 
to triple or quadruple. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, when the Modern Jazz Quartet reunited after a breakup that lasted 
almost seven years, Jackson has divided his time between MJQ tours with his 
longtime companions -- John Lewis, piano; Percy Heath, bass; Connie Kay, drums 
-- and dates with his own quartet. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with the MJQ in February of 1952," he recalled recently during a 
visit to Hollywood with his group. "For all but three of our years together, 
we've had the same personnel -- Connie Kay replaced Kenny Clarke in 1955. 
That's an all-time record in music. And we've performed with 36 different 
symphonies, most notably the Stuttgart; we played with the Juilliard String 
Quartet, and recently we did a television show with Itzhak Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Modern Jazz Quartet takes off, I do these various other projects. I'm 
not one for long vacations -- I'm like Duke Ellington, who never wanted to take 
time off. There's only two other workhorses like that -- Dizzy Gillespie, who 
has no children and likes to keep traveling; and Ray Brown, who works 
constantly -- so much so that when we were together for a while, I had to tell 
him, 'Man, put a break in there somewhere; you can work yourself to death but 
you're not going to carry me with you!' " 
</P>
<P>
Two other aspects of the vibraphonist's career that have been neglected in 
recent years are his composing and singing. "People forget that my first 
profession was as a singer. I did the vocals on a whole album for Norman Granz 
in 1978, on Pablo, and there are two songs in there for which I wrote the words 
and the music: 'Heartstrings' and 'For Someone I Love.' 
</P>
<P>
"The best compliment ever paid me was when Quincy Jones said I could make a 
fortune as a composer and lyric writer. I haven't done much writing lately, but 
I'm in the process of getting a new idea together." 
</P>
<P>
One item on the Jackson agenda is a return bout with Ray Charles, his partner 
on a unique album some years ago. Another is a small combo sound for which he 
would like to do some writing, featuring Jimmy Heath on soprano saxophone -- "I 
love the sound he gets on that horn" -- and James Moody on flute. Both, like 
Jackson, are veterans of the bop years. 
</P>
<P>
As successful as he has been, Jackson feels that he and his contemporaries are 
still being held back by TV and radio. 
</P>
<P>
"How often do you hear the MJQ, or any good jazz, on TV? Or on radio?," he 
said. "I can remember when Symphony Sid was broadcasting live on ABC out of 
Birdland in New York and we could hear him in San Francisco or Dallas; and Sid 
McCoy came out of Chicago on NBC. Why is jazz sabotaged?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sabotage" is perhaps an overly strong word, but it is true that most disc 
jockeys have rock stars in their eyes and that virtually all the jazz 
television specials are seen via cable or public TV. Serious treatment of jazz 
on the three major networks is a hair short of nonexistent, with a few notable 
exceptions, such as Dr. Billy Taylor's interviews with musicians on CBS' 
"Sunday Morning." True, David Sanborn has his own series, but it leans heavily 
toward pop-jazz and fusion artists. The latter is another area about which 
Jackson has strong negative feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We experimented briefly with electronics in the Modern Jazz Quartet, and I 
hated it; I was so relieved when we abandoned it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be pure at heart and very dedicated to play our kind of music. 
Consider the music Miles Davis is playing today, compared to that beautiful 
music he played 30 years ago. Of course, he has a reason; he probably got some 
big advances from Columbia Records and wanted to make some records that would 
pay back those advances. You can't do that by making jazz albums." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Parker remains Jackson's principal hero, as he was when they played 
together on some of the early Dizzy Gillespie classics. "He was an amazing man, 
and there is a side of him that I never saw put in print -- the fact that he 
was very well versed in art, literature, philosophy, history. I talked to him 
at length and was astonished at his knowledge. There was a fine line too 
between his genius as a saxophonist, which we all knew about, and the other 
side of him, the drug addict; more people ought to know what a brilliant human 
being he was. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so dedicated to people like Bird, as well as Coleman Hawkins, Wes 
Montgomery, John Coltrane and, of course, Dizzy. I would come back from my 
grave to play with any of those giants at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"Acoustic music is my kind of music; I like the natural sound, the melodic 
content and the lyrical beauty. And, until the people we play for get tired of 
listening to it, that's the type of music I will always play." 
</P>
<P>
MODERN JAZZ QUARTET: "Fontessa." Atlantic 1231-2. **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Milt Jackson's famous blues composition "Bluesology" is heard here in its 
pristine 1956 version, recorded when the Quartet and Jackson were winning 
annual jazz polls as No. 1 in their respective fields. An extended version of 
John Lewis' title tune and chamber-jazz treatments of such standards as "Over 
the Rainbow" and "Angel Eyes," helped establish this as one of the MJQ's 
preeminent sessions.

HENLEY FORGIVES -- BUT DOESN'T FORGET; 
</P>
<P>
THE FORMER-EAGLE STILL STUMPS FOR SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS WITH 'THE END OF 
INNOCENCE' 
</P>

<P>
Don Henley is most proud right now of "The Heart of the Matter," the tender, 
regretful ballad that closes his latest album. It's a song of the balm that 
eases the human soul: forgiveness. He sings of mistakes and of learning to love 
and let go of the hurt, concluding, "You keep carryin' that anger, it'll eat 
you up inside." In this song, the veteran singer/songwriter, who topped the 
charts throughout the '70s with the Eagles and has bested himself artistically 
in the '80s as a solo artist, sounds like a Ticked Young Man who at 42 has 
resolved to obsess less and exorcise his demons. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, this is not a story about the mellowing of Don Henley. 
</P>
<P>
Not when he sees a world full of jingoistic presidents, intolerant 
fundamentalists, carnivorous journalists, media-hungry opportunists, 
environment spoilers, hungry land developers, bad architects, Joe Walsh and 
Oliver North still on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
"Fanaticism runs rampant in this country today, and it frightens me, frankly," 
said a flu-stricken, conscience-baring Henley. The singer was sipping mineral 
water and gnawing on his favorite peeves at his Malibu ranch between tour stops 
(which includes shows Tuesday through Thursday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
Saturday at the Santa Barbara County Bowl and Oct. 1 at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre). 
</P>
<P>
"I just read in the paper again about how some school system somewhere banned 
'Huckleberry Finn.' Shades of 'Fahrenheit 451.' It looks like we're going back 
to the Dark Ages, a time of superstition and fear. Racism is rearing its ugly 
head again. Ignorance and superstition are flourishing." 
</P>
<P>
Henley had just begun to get going. It was the sun and the illness that had 
turned his face ruddy, but one can imagine it's also the wellspring of 
indignation at a country he sees idling in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
"I still get fan mail from kids who ask me if it's true if 'Hotel California' 
is really a satanic album and if there is really a picture of Satan and/or 
(Satanist) Anton LaVey on the inside cover," he said. "That was a rumor that 
was started by some fundamentalist idiot preacher in the South, who actually 
put it in a book as if it were fact. If I could find him I would sue his brains 
out. . . . There are kids who believe this stuff, and it upsets me. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the song 'Little Tin God' is about too: Don't be a follower, don't 
be a sheep, don't go along with the status quo, don't believe everything you 
read, don't worship preachers or rock stars or anybody else. That is the 
message of this album, if anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been accused of being a cynic and a curmudgeon and a misogynist and all 
kinds of things, but if I didn't really care about people and about this 
country, I wouldn't bother with all this stuff. I would write fatuous little 
disco dance songs like everybody else. But I happen to love this country 
immensely -- and I like people, for the most part. They just disappoint me a 
lot of the time." 
</P>
<P>
That disappointment is the chief concern of "The End of the Innocence," the 
predictably assured new Henley album that is predictably a hit despite a 4 
1/2-year silence since his last album, "Building the Perfect Beast." This is 
especially true of the title song and recent Top 10 single, a lyrical ballad 
co-written with Bruce Hornsby which uses its resonant deflowerment imagery for 
mostly political -- but also sexual and familial -- purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"What originally spawned that song was my friendship with several people who 
come from broken homes, specifically where the father has left the family at 
some point," Henley said. "And it is a very deep and lasting effect on the 
children. We're all brought up with fairy tales, and all the fairy tales end up 
with 'and they lived happily ever after,' but the divorce rate doesn't quite 
bear that out. 
</P>
<P>
"The second verse is about America as a broken home and Reagan as the father 
figure. Besides alluding to Reagan, it alludes to the Iran/Contra scandal -- 
'since daddy had to lie' -- and there's even an allusion to the weapons buildup 
versus the farm crisis. The theme that runs through the whole album is one of 
heroes who aren't quite what they're cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Or you could take it as just a bittersweet love song between a boy and a girl, 
who's maybe losing her virginity or something." 
</P>
<P>
Romance and sexual release as saving grace in a world without purpose or papas? 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately the only thing that hasn't been corrupted, yeah, is love." 
</P>
<P>
Was Henley ever let down by a hero? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my heroes in the music business, perhaps. No, most of my heroes have 
been killed." He chuckles. He remains wistful about John F. Kennedy and Martin 
Luther King. "They didn't let me down. I still have a few heroes, not in the 
worshipful sense, but people that I admire and respect, people like Bill 
Moyers, the environmentalist David Brower, even a few politicians." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to ascertain just how much Henley still admires and respects Gary 
Hart. He has some harsh words for Donna Rice, who met Hart at one of Henley's 
Aspen mixers, and a verse in the song "If Dirt Were Dollars" seems to be about 
her, though the singer says it is also about Fawn Hall and H. R. Haldeman and 
anyone else who he feels has exploited dubious circumstances of celebrity for 
personal gain. In any case, some of his most pointed jibes are reserved more 
for journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We do live in an era now where the media are very voracious in their appetite 
to bring people down. Media wilding, I call it. It has its benefits and its 
drawbacks. On the one hand, people like (Jimmy) Swaggart and (Jim) Bakker get 
what they deserve, and people like Reagan don't get what they deserve, and 
people like Joe Biden get what they don't deserve. So it's kind of a mixed 
bag." 
</P>
<P>
The end result, as Henley sees it, is that a peeping-Tom populace now prefers 
politicians with rigid personal lives and suspicious 
</P>
<P>
agendas over candidates who have heartfelt agendas but make private messes. 
</P>
<P>
"People want robots for leaders now. They want perfect people. I'd rather have 
a guy with a big heart who makes a mistake once in a while, personally. The 
consequence of this is it's going to lead, and has already led, to no 
intelligent, sane person wanting to run for public office and subjecting 
himself to the glare of the kind of scrutiny that is so rampant now. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see some guy say exactly what he means and stand behind it and 
not be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Such a guy is, well, probably Henley, who makes liberal pronouncements from the 
stage in addition to the usually clear-as-day positions on his albums, and says 
he regularly gets death threats for it. Despite his forthrightness, and his 
willingness to put substantial pieces of himself into his songs, he has managed 
to stay a private person. 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of a couple of occasions," he added with a laugh. (Besides 
all the credit he got for "introducing" Hart and Rice, which turned out to be 
not quite true, he got some unwanted media attention from a 1981 no-contest 
plea to drug-related charges involving a 16-year-old girl.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy this bunk about 'public figures.' The attitude toward celebrities 
and politicians is: You asked for it, you don't deserve a private life. Well, 
I'm sorry but I do deserve and demand a private life. . . . My former 
girlfriend had to sell a home she had worked for since she was 14 . . . and 
move because some lunatic was following 
</P>
<P>
her and knew where she lived. . . . I don't owe people anything except the best 
work I can do." 
</P>
<P>
As the only ex-Eagle who has maintained an ambitious musical career, Henley 
won't say whether his sense of disappointment in people extends to a 
disapproval of the way his fellow former band members have treaded the water of 
the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"They all have their agendas and I have mine," he mused. "I'm not here to judge 
any of those guys -- except one, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed. The unstated reference is to his well-known anger towards Joe 
Walsh, who Henley claims was largely responsible for breaking up the Eagles. 
Walsh has received Henley's wrath for singing "Desperado" and "Life in the Fast 
Lane" -- two songs Walsh had little or nothing to do with -- on the 
just-completed tour with Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
"As Glenn (Frey) and I used to say, 'He's an interesting bunch of fellows.' I 
have nothing to say to him." 
</P>
<P>
Henley's a bit more sympathetic toward his other ex-bandmates. "I think I 
understand how Glenn (now focusing mostly on acting and commercials) feels. I 
think he sorta got a bellyful of the whole business, and he wanted to be 
healthy and happy, and he's pursuing a career in which he believes he can 
achieve that. It's not something I would do, but I'm not him. Timothy Schmit 
and I are pretty close; I produced a track for his upcoming album. He's 
probably the only guy in the group everybody's not mad at." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an extremely fortunate man," Henley reflected. "I've had fame and fortune 
beyond my wildest dreams, and it just keeps on coming -- to the detriment, 
however, of some parts of my personal life, which are quite obvious." 
</P>
<P>
By that, Henley -- who has touches of gray in his now-straight, ponytailed long 
hair -- alludes in part to the fact that he has just arrived home in a Porsche 
with a pretty girlfriend, but he is greeted by dogs, not offspring. "I 
certainly don't want to raise children here, and I would like to have some 
children in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in a very small town in Texas and moved here to Los Angeles a little 
over 19 years ago, and I have never felt quite at home here. I always feel like 
I'm just visiting. I think a lot of people feel that way, slightly rootless and 
dislodged. There's a very temporary feeling about L.A., and it's reflected in 
the new architecture, which is heartless and gutless and soulless stuff, 
temporary architecture for a temporary town." 
</P>
<P>
The song "Sunset Grill," from the last album, comes to mind: The big emotional 
climax in which he urgently promises to get himself and his gal out of L.A., 
followed minutes later by a denouement in which they order beers and resign 
themselves to the warm-weather unsettledness. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go back where I came from," he confessed. "It's a constant game of 
emotional Ping-Pong, an approach/avoidance conflict. So I'm sort of in a state 
of limbo. I'm floating over New Mexico somewhere."

LATINOS TAKE EXCEPTION TO KCET HIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps nowhere is the view of KCET's performance more divergent, the debate 
more strident, than in the Latino community over issues of hiring and 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the National Hispanic Media Coalition filed a petition with the 
Federal Communications Commission asking for denial of KCET's license-renewal 
application. The coalition claimed that there is an insufficient number of 
Latino employes, particularly in professional positions, at the station. But in 
recent weeks the FCC denied the petition and, 12 days ago, renewed KCET's 
license through November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Under the FCC's "50% of parity" guidelines, representation in a station's work 
force should measure up to at least half of the demographics of a particular 
ethnic group in the station's metropolitan statistical area. A spokesman said 
these are "internal processing guidelines" only. 
</P>
<P>
While lawyers for KCET and the coalition battled over which statistic to count 
-- whether the 24.4% figure in Los Angeles County from the 1980 Census or the 
1987 Bureau of Labor Statistics figure of 29% for the larger market area -- 
KCET says it is making substantial improvement. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, with 259 employees, KCET said Latinos represented 12% of the 
total work force and 9% of the managerial, professional and technical 
positions. Last month, with 281 employees, KCET counted 18% in the general work 
force and 13% in the top three categories -- although only one among senior 
management: Ed Moreno, vice president for community services. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made a tremendous effort in terms of our attempt to find people, to 
find qualified people for jobs for which we do have very high standards," said 
KCET president William H. Kobin, "and very great efforts in terms of the 
subject matter of our programming." 
</P>
<P>
Station-originated programming is as much an issue as employment. Twenty years 
ago, and into the 1970s, critics note, there were a number of programs geared 
towards Los Angeles' Latino community. Among them: "Cancion de la Raza," (Song 
of the People), in 1968, a 65-part serial drama that told of conditions in the 
Mexican-American community from police brutality to the grape boycott; "Ahora" 
(Now), in 1969, the 175-episode nightly half-hour series, a mix of history, 
community dialogue, documentaries, politics, even puppets, which was broadcast 
from East Los Angeles; "La Cultura," in the early '70s, on which Los Lobos 
played for the first time on TV, and in 1979, "Presente!" a KCET-Latino 
Consortium series on the concerns and achievements of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Independent film maker Jesus Trevino, who got his early TV training at the 
"Ahora" studio and went on to co-produce "Seguin," KCET's first offering under 
"American Playhouse" in 1982, said that in those days management "reached out 
to communities (and) was willing to take a risk on programming. Without strong 
employment of Hispanics in key positions, it's difficult to program in the best 
way for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Among the two dozen or so programs KCET is now showing as part of Hispanic 
Heritage Month are Trevino's "Yo Soy Chicano" from 1972 and the 1985 follow-up, 
"Yo Soy." While it's "fine for us to see retrospectives," Trevino says, "why 
are we not seeing films done last month?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think asking for a six-part series or a regular weekly series is that 
much," says Mark Carreno, former chairman of the Latino Consortium, a 
quasi-independent group that is housed at KCET. "They're going to be run out of 
business because cable is targeting (specific audiences). Not out of unselfish 
reasons, but they're doing it. Galavision, Univision, Telemundo -- they're 
aggressively marketing to Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KCET has issued a 23-page list of programs that it aired in 1988 
dealing with Latino issues, had Latino participants or were major productions, 
including "SIDA Is AIDS," a documentary made by KCET's educational division on 
the spread of the disease among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Kobin, who back in 1968 at National Educational Television created 
"Black Journal," now argues against targeted programming. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do believe that in the long run we can do a more effective job," he 
said, "by trying to weave blacks and browns and Asians into a (programming 
fabric) than by trying to isolate. I like Jesse Jackson's 'rainbow coalition' 
term." 
</P>
<P>
As for the suggestion from one Latino activist that KCET might better be called 
"BBC West" -- actually, British programming currently averages 11% of the 
schedule, KCET notes -- Kobin pounds the table. "There are a lot of people in 
various minority communities who think it isn't, who communicate with us. . . . 
There is no single black community. There is no single Hispanic community. 
There is no single Asian community. . . . The community are a helluva lot of 
different voices. And some are louder than others." JUDITH MICHAELSON

2ND TIME'S THE CHARM FOR CHANNEL SWIMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A determined Canadian marathon swimmer Saturday succeeded in her second attempt 
to swim from Santa Catalina Island to the mainland for charity, arriving five 
hours earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Keith was greeted by about 25 people when she waded ashore at Cabrillo 
Beach about 4:30 p.m., spokeswoman Lori Pyne said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just doing great," Pyne said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under 15 Hours 
</P>
<P>
She made the swim in just under 15 hours. She had hoped to make it in less than 
20 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Keith cracked jokes about sharks and dodged ship traffic Saturday during her 
marathon swim from the resort island to the mainland, using only the butterfly 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just watching the ships go by, actually," Keith shouted from the water 
nine hours and 11 miles into her 22-mile swim. 
</P>
<P>
Skies were overcast and the seas calm as Keith sought to become the first 
person ever to make the crossing using the butterfly stroke. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charity Events 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's attempt was the last in a series of marathon swims to raise money 
for Variety Children's Charities. Those swims included a 31-hour trek across 
Lake Ontario on Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot saltier and not as long," Keith quipped as she compared the channel 
swim to her Lake Ontario crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Keith left Santa Catalina Island at 1:33 a.m. and established a brisk pace of 
29 strokes per minute. By 11 a.m., she was averaging 27 strokes, stopping every 
two hours or so to take in food. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing. She treads water long enough to drink some chocolate milk and 
water and fruit cups, then shouts, 'Let's Go! Let's Go!' and the boat has to 
catch up with her," said Bill Petrasich, a director of Variety Children's 
Charities of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Petrasich and the crew of the support vessel, "The Cold Spaghetti," expected 
Keith to reach Cabrillo Beach under her original 20-hour estimate. 
</P>
<P>
It was Keith's second attempt at the channel crossing. 
</P>
<P>
On July 28, she called it quits about six miles from Cabrillo Beach after 
gaining less than half a mile in eight hours in a powerful current. Keith, who 
spent 19 hours in the water, had begun hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks later, she became the first person to swim the frigid waters of 
the Juan de Fuca Strait in 33 years, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swam Great Lakes 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Canadian mastered all five of the Great Lakes to raise more than 
$550,000 for a Toronto sports training and fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
This summer she crossed the 42-mile-wide English Channel and swam 14 miles 
across Australia's Sidney Harbor in marathons promoting children's charities. 
</P>
<P>
Keith hoped to raise up to $30,000 with Saturday's swim to support the 
pediatric AIDS Clinic at County-USC Medical Center and the UCLA Children's 
Artificial Limb Bank, Petrasich said. 
</P>
<P>
The Variety Children's Charities sponsors fund-raising events for children's 
philanthropic programs in the Los Angeles area.

VOYAGER 2: IT'LL SPEND ETERNITY CRUISING SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE SIEGEL, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a billion years, when drifting continents have reshaped Earth's face and 
humans are extinct or changed by evolution, Voyager 2 will still be cruising 
the stars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling. We're actually going out to the stars," said Bruce Brymer, 
Voyager's lead mission controller at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. "This spacecraft is going to outlive us. It's going to be out there 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
In August, Voyager 2 swept past Neptune and its icy volcanic moon Triton -- the 
last planetary exploration in an incredible 12-year journey that also took the 
spacecraft past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and more than 50 moons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interstellar Mission 
</P>
<P>
Now, Voyager 2 is speeding into the loneliest part of its trek: the Voyager 
Interstellar Mission. With Voyager 1, it will study the sun's magnetic field, 
solar wind and ultraviolet light from distant stars and galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
Like Pioneers 10 and 11 and Voyager 1, which explored Jupiter and Saturn, 
Voyager 2 also will search for the edge of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
The Voyagers are expected to return information to Earth until about 2015 or 
2020. Contact eventually will be cut off by some malfunction, by exhaustion of 
the probes' plutonium power generators, or when their thruster fuel runs out, 
leaving them unable to point antennas at Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the robot explorers will pass among the stars, each carrying a 12-inch 
copper record of sounds and sights from Earth in case they are found by a 
spacefaring civilization. "Hopefully they will understand our peaceful and 
humble attempt at knowing and exploring the great unknown," Brymer said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Voyager 2's work is more mundane. 
</P>
<P>
"The interstellar mission is sort of anticlimactic. There's no real drama 
expected. We're suffering from the blues a little bit," he said. "It's almost 
like postpartum depression. We've gone through such highs with the spacecraft. 
There's a great sense of melancholy now. It's like none I've sensed before." 
</P>
<P>
Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune officially ends Oct. 2, when it will be 34.7 
million miles past the planet, going 37,337 m.p.h. It will be 2.83 billion 
miles from Earth, and will have traveled 4.46 billion miles since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Until December, Voyager 2 occasionally will glance at Neptune and dark space to 
improve the accuracy of observations its cameras and instruments made during 
the Neptune flyby, said Voyager project manager Norm Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of empty space let engineers measure how much sunlight reflects off 
Voyager into its cameras. A computer can subtract the light from Voyager's 
Neptune and Triton photographs, producing clearer prints, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, most of the planets will be positioned for one of the Voyagers to 
take photographs for assembly into a single picture of the solar system. "The 
planets are small and there's lots of dark space out there," he said. "Maybe it 
will give people a better impression of the vastness of things." 
</P>
<P>
Then engineers will turn off Voyager 2's TV cameras and its infrared and 
visible light sensors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensors Already at Work 
</P>
<P>
Voyager's Interstellar Mission officially starts Jan. 1, but the spacecraft 
already is using its remaining sensors to make the kind of measurements it will 
continue to collect for years. Ultraviolet light and cosmic ray sensors study 
distant galaxies and stars, and also black holes and pulsars -- remnants of 
stars that died in fiery supernova explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Both Voyagers also will keep measuring magnetic fields, electrically charged 
particles that make up solar wind, and waves in that wind. 
</P>
<P>
If the Voyagers and Pioneers survive, one or more of them may detect the 
"heliopause," where solar wind yields to interstellar wind 5 billion to 14 
billion miles from the sun. Many scientists consider it the edge of the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
By about 2020, the Voyagers will lose contact with Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"My electrical energy is fading, and I am feeling old and useless," says 
Voyager 2's imaginary voice in "The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide," a National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration publication. "The planet which gave me 
life said goodby. I will no longer hear its voice, nor it my heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Voyager will approach the stars, passing them like distant beacons in an 
incredible void. 
</P>
<P>
In the year 20391, Voyager will pass within 3.21 light years, 18.9 trillion 
miles, of Proxima Centauri, the nearest star. About 24,000 years from now, it 
should pass through the Oort Cloud, a vast spherical cloud of comets that other 
scientists consider the true edge of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Voyager makes for the open sea of interstellar space, free of the sun's 
gravity and wandering forever in the Milky Way galaxy, going around the center 
of the galaxy once every quarter-billion years," said Cornell University 
astronomer Carl Sagan. 
</P>
<P>
NASA estimates that in the year 40176, Voyager 2 will fly 1.65 light years from 
Ross 248 -- the first time it will be closer to another star than to the sun, 
which will be 1.99 light years from Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near Sirius in Year 296036 
</P>
<P>
In the year 296036, Voyager 2 will make its closest approach to Sirius, the 
brightest star visible from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Deep space is benign, so dust and cosmic rays will erode Voyager 2 
extraordinarily slowly. 
</P>
<P>
In a billion or more years, Sagan said, "there will be no more humans because 
we'll be extinct or we'll be somebody else. There will be no human artifacts 
left on Earth. Continental drift will completely change what the continents 
look like. 
</P>
<P>
"But this brave spacecraft will be there, a surviving artifact of our species 
and our times." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one day, aliens in a starship may find one of the Voyagers, then play 
the copper record. 
</P>
<P>
They will hear greetings in 60 languages from Chinese to Welsh to Urdu, 
including a 7-year-old boy offering salutations from Earth's children. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the music of many cultures, from Chuck Berry's rock 'n' roll to 
Mozart, Bach and Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
The aliens will listen to the sounds of surf, wind, rain and thunder; croaking 
frogs and laughing hyenas; a train, a truck, a jet and a rocket; a baby crying 
and lovers kissing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs, Diagrams 
</P>
<P>
The record also holds 115 electronically encoded photographs or diagrams 
showing humans, the Earth and other planets, human chromosomes, a fetus, the 
Golden Gate, the Grand Tetons and the Great Wall of China. 
</P>
<P>
And the extraterrestrials will read a message written July 16, 1977, by Jimmy 
Carter, then President of a nation on a little planet that, two months later, 
dared to send a bit of itself to the stars: 
</P>
<P>
"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our 
science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope 
someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic 
civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our 
good will in a vast and awesome universe."

UTILITIES PAYING PREMIUM TO STAY AT FULL CAPACITY LEVEL

<P>
Right now, the utilities are paying too much for electricity from third-party 
generators like windmill owners. 
</P>
<P>
But capacity counts too, offsetting much of that cost. 
</P>
<P>
Capacity is what a utility needs to supply all customers when all of them turn 
on all their appliances at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't plan our system for only one appliance at a time. We need to plan for 
everyone turning on everything at once," said Alison Silverstein of the Pacific 
Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities like PG&amp;E have difficulty building large traditional plants to 
increase their own capacity because of politics, permits and protests. 
</P>
<P>
But third-party generators are not as strictly regulated. So PG &amp; E pays 
many of them for their capacity, as well as for the electricity that goes into 
the grid. 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein said payments for "firm" capacity can range from $60 to $160 per 
kilowatt per year, depending mostly on availability during PG&amp;E's peak 
periods. Wind turbine operators, because of the vagaries of the winds, usually 
qualify only for "non-firm" capacity, which pays much, much less. 
</P>
<P>
Third-party generators, called qualifying facilities or QFs in the trade, 
include small producers who use solar, geothermal and many other sources of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payments Vary 
</P>
<P>
Payments for electricity delivered to the grid vary with type and age of 
contract. Many contracts offer 10 years at a high fixed price -- 7 or 8 cents 
per kilowatt hour -- based on early 1980s petroleum prices and production 
efficiency and an additional 10 or 20 years at "avoided cost," or what the 
utility would otherwise have to pay elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Were those contracts to be written today, the price would be around 3 cents. 
Said William J. Steeley, senior projects engineer at PG&amp;E: "At the time, it 
was right. It might well have gone up to 10 cents." PG&amp;E is still honoring 
those contracts, "but we really don't need energy at that price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Avoided cost," once around 8 cents per kilowatt hour, is now less than 3 
cents, making it "real tough" to make money, in the words of Jerry Fuchs, 
manager of project planning for the Fayette wind-power company of Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, required the 
utilities to contract with all viable third-party producers. The purpose was to 
promote efficient energy production, encourage the development of alternative 
sources of energy and reduce the reliance on foreign oil. The law also called 
for price incentives, which were translated by the California Public Utilities 
Commission into the fixed-price contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The result for PG&amp;E in 1988 was that in August, at its all-time peak load, 
it needed 18,000 megawatts. Its own capacity was 15,030 megawatts, and it had 
5,963 megawatts of third-party capacity under contract. The total is more than 
enough until the late 1990s or early 2000s. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, PG&amp;E is caught in a short-term dilemma of obeying the law that is 
aimed at keeping third parties on line and holding down prices. 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein said it can buy power from the federal Bonneville Dam on the 
Columbia River for 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour. But the average it pays all 
third-party producers is 5.7 cents per kilowatt hour -- compared to a 
systemwide average cost of about 2.8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are required to pay 2.9 cents from a QF (third-party producer), this 
precludes us from buying less-expensive power elsewhere. It's not good for the 
customers," Silverstein said. 
</P>
<P>
When the demand curve starts climbing again, Silverstein foresees an auction 
system in which third parties would bid to fill holes in needs.

ARCHEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION IN IRAQ SURGES AFTER CEASE-FIRE WITH IRAN

<P>
Archeological exploration in Iraq has picked up since the cease-fire in the 
Iran-Iraq war, yielding rich finds from the era 2,000 years ago when the 
powerful Assyrian empire dominated the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The upsurge comes as President Saddam Hussein's government seeks to bolster 
Iraq's self-image through excavation and rebuilding at sites such as Babylon 
that symbolize the nation's historical greatness. 
</P>
<P>
"By appealing to history, Saddam encourages Iraqis to view themselves as the 
heirs of a great civilization that flowered in ancient Iraq while the 
surrounding world was lingering in prehistory," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq includes much of the "fertile crescent" of ancient Mesopotamia, where 
early rulers developed efficient armies and sophisticated city administrations 
that rivaled the Pharaohs' Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance Illustrated 
</P>
<P>
Ruined temples and palaces adorned with colossal stone sculptures, archives of 
inscribed clay tablets, delicate gold work and ivory carvings illustrate the 
importance of early Iraqi civilization. 
</P>
<P>
To help build morale during the recent eight-year war with Persian Iran, the 
Iraqi government recalled Assyrian and Babylonian victories in the first 
millennium BC against the ancient Persians, portrayed as unscrupulous 
aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the war was halted last August by a United Nations-mediated 
cease-fire, history is still being promoted, underscoring Hussein's drive to 
boost Iraq's role in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Iraqi teams, archeologists from the United States, Britain, 
Poland, West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan were digging in the country 
earlier this year. Most will resume work in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spectacular' Finds 
</P>
<P>
Hussein also agreed in recent talks with American businessmen in Baghdad, 
Iraq's capital, that a selection of ancient Iraqi treasures will tour the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear there's more than scholarship involved in all this promotion of 
archeology . . . but the recent finds have been spectacular," said a Western 
archeologist, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
New excavations at three sites in the Assyrian heartland of northern Iraq have 
unearthed a gold-filled royal tomb dating from the 8th Century BC, as well as 
imposing sculpture and architectural remains. 
</P>
<P>
At Nimrud, the Assyrian military capital 250 miles north of Baghdad, Iraqi 
archeologists found a stone chamber where two women were buried along with more 
than 55 pounds of gold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Muzahem Mahmoud, the excavation director, said it was "the richest Assyrian 
burial known." 
</P>
<P>
An inscription on stone in the tomb in wedge-shaped cuneiform writing 
identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya, possibly the daughter and 
granddaughter of King Sargon, who ruled an empire that stretched from the 
Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial chamber: "If 
anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I pray to the gods of the 
netherworld that his soul should roam in the scorching sun after death. . . . 
Let the ghost of insomnia take hold of him forever and ever." 
</P>
<P>
The gold jewelry included diadems, necklaces, belts, bracelets and anklets and 
50 pairs of earrings, as well as a bronze mirror with an enamel handle 
encrusted in precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
At Nineveh, the Assyrians' administrative capital, another Iraqi team unearthed 
a stone door carved with four lions that was part of the city's fortifications 
in its last days. 
</P>
<P>
They also found arrowheads and skeletons of Assyrian warriors who may have died 
during a siege by the Babylonians and Medes. Nineveh fell in 612 BC after 
holding out for two months and was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the ruins, the archeologists found remnants of an irrigation system 
built by King Sennacherib a century earlier to increase vegetation around the 
city, as well as a stone terrace where he constructed what the tablets call "a 
palace without rival." 
</P>
<P>
Farther north near the border with Syria, British archeologists tentatively 
identified a 100-foot-high mound as the remains of ancient Tillule, another 
important military and religious center. 
</P>
<P>
The team found the base of a ziggurat, a temple shaped like a stepped pyramid, 
that may have belonged to a shrine for the Assyrian weather god, Adad. 
</P>
<P>
They also located sections of two roads believed to be part of highways linking 
Nineveh with Syria and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything here tells us that this is a major settlement," said excavation 
director Warwick Ball of the British Museum. "It's only a matter of time before 
we find the clues to tell us that Tel Al-Hawa is the modern name of Tillule." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Assyrians used Tillule as a center for massing troops before 
launching campaigns against Syria, Palestine and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
At Babylon, whose kings succeeded the Assyrians as rulers of Mesopotamia, a 
major project is under way to excavate and restore the whole nine-square-mile 
area of the ancient city. 
</P>
<P>
The multimillion-dollar restoration will include the palace of King 
Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th-Century BC king who built the legendary Hanging Gardens 
of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. 
</P>
<P>
The city quickly grew into Mesopotamia's largest population center with about 1 
million residents. But Babylonian supremacy lasted less than a century before 
the city was overrun by King Cyrus of Persia in 539 BC.

THROUGHOUT SOUTH ASIA, BROKEN STILL MEANS FIX IT UP, NOT THROW IT AWAY

<P>
The telltale thump, thump, thump was not a welcome sound. Nor was the sight of 
the tread that had separated from the tire carcass, having been recycled one 
time too many. 
</P>
<P>
The final blow came when the spare tire was put on; its wheel was the wrong 
size and, though it went onto the car, it wobbled loosely. The driver looked at 
the wheel with a pained expression for about 30 seconds and then gave the 
universal South Asian response to any situation: "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
The loose wheel made it the couple of miles to the next village, where a shop 
selling retreaded tires quickly mounted a new one on the original rim. The old 
tire went onto a pile to await yet another tread. 
</P>
<P>
That still left the problem of the spare. What to do about the wheel that 
wouldn't fit? 
</P>
<P>
Again, no problem. Another couple of miles up the road and the driver suddenly 
stopped across the street from a ramshackle shop bearing the sign, "Boring Auto 
Works." 
</P>
<P>
A quick word with the impassive shop owner and within seconds, mechanic Nimal 
Sinegaratne had pulled an old iron rod from a pile and was eyeballing the 
ill-fitting lugs. Out came some old calipers and the rod went into a hulking 
lathe in the dark recesses of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, four shiny big washers filled the gap between lug head and 
wheel and the car was on its way, ready for the next emergency. Cost: 90 rupees 
-- slightly less than $5.60 
</P>
<P>
It was recycling and repair, South Asia style. 
</P>
<P>
In much of the mechanized and modernized West, "broke" means "throw it out and 
find a new one" -- whatever it is, from tire rims to refrigerators. Mechanics 
don't fix things anymore, they replace them. Diagnostic centers use 
sophisticated beeping machines to find out what part isn't working, and a new 
part, fresh out of a plastic wrapper, is plugged in. 
</P>
<P>
If a motor on a washing machine or a refrigerator doesn't work, the whole motor 
is replaced. The art of keeping things running by using just what is on hand is 
rapidly being lost. 
</P>
<P>
But in South Asia, where the average annual income may be only a few hundred 
dollars, it's a different story. Nothing goes to waste. For the poor, an old 
bottle, some waste paper or a piece of tin can become a valued addition to the 
household's meager possessions. Why spend good money on something new when the 
old can be fixed easily at much less cost? 
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, Afghanistan, big freight containers line the streets, providing homes 
and shops for people who otherwise might not have a roof over their heads. Old 
wine bottles are on the shelves of mechanics' shops, full of oil drawn from 
large barrels. No throwaway cans there. 
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan's rough-and-tumble Northwest Frontier province, a Soviet-made AK-47 
assault rifle can cost a thousand dollars. A homemade one from a local gunsmith 
will go for $300 or $400. Only the practiced eye of a Pathan tribesman can tell 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In the back alleys of New Delhi, the throaty cry of the kabari wallah announces 
the start of a new day. The kabari wallah -- rubbish man -- is making his 
rounds, offering to buy the cans, bottles and old newspapers of the city's 
better-off neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
He gives five rupees (31 cents) for two pounds of newspapers, and a good wine 
or whiskey bottle will bring one or two rupees. They are used as water bottles 
in the poor neighborhoods. Small medicine bottles he buys by weight, maybe a 
rupee a pound, one New Delhi homemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate technology" -- a fancy phrase used by the planners and 
developmental economists -- takes on real meaning in the bazaars of South Asia. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that India's venerable Ambassador cars -- essentially a 
1950s-vintage British Morris Major with a simple engine -- can be fixed by a 
blind man in the middle of the Rajasthan desert. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, an ancient General Electric refrigerator in a New Delhi house 
went on the blink. The local repairman rode up on his bicycle, poked around for 
a few minutes and announced that the starter motor had burned out. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the Westerner who owned the refrigerator was typical: How can a 
starter motor for a 20-year-old GE refrigerator ever be found in New Delhi? 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," came the answer. "Give me a couple of hours. We will rewind the 
motor." Two hours and 200 rupees ($12.40) later, the refrigerator was chugging 
away. 
</P>
<P>
When the tale was told to the naval attache of a Western embassy, he laughed 
and said, "I was just down at the Bombay naval yards, and they were rewinding 
motors for destroyers." 
</P>
<P>
Back at the Boring Auto Works, Nimal Sinegaratne, having finished the tire job, 
explained how he started to work at the shop eight years earlier when he was 
15. "First, I just watched and learned to operate the machine. Now I fix pots 
and pans, farm machinery, anything. Engine parts are the most difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Shopowner T. Mepaga said his lathes keep 25-year-old cars and tractors running 
in tiptop shape. 
</P>
<P>
Doing much of the work is a well-oiled swing lathe made by T. S. Harrison &amp; 
Sons of Heckmondwick, Yorkshire, in England, bought several years ago 
secondhand. 
</P>
<P>
Told this, a British journalist quipped cynically: "I bet they make widgets for 
computers now, if they are still in business at all." 
</P>
<P>
But a call to Heckmondwick found that T. S. Harrison &amp; Sons is alive and 
well, making lathes -- as they have for the last 90 years -- that may someday 
find their way to a part of the world where broken things are still fixed, not 
thrown away.

TINY ISLAND OF MALTA CELEBRATES 25 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE, CONFIDENT OF ITS 
FUTURE

VALLETTA, Malta 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago many people doubted that a small Mediterranean island 
with no raw materials could survive on its own after 160 years as a British 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
But Malta this month celebrates the Sept. 21, 1964, anniversary of its 
independence, confident of its economic future and determined never again to 
serve as a base for a foreign power. 
</P>
<P>
The 122-square mile island that was once Britain's main fortress in the 
Mediterranean is today constitutionally committed never to join NATO or the 
Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Doubts over Malta's economic viability have faded. Tourism and textiles are 
thriving industries and the accent is now on developing electronics and light 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Malta is striving to establish itself as an off-shore financial center and is 
developing a container depot and free port to meet the challenge of the single 
European market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In a delicate political balancing act, nonaligned Malta is cultivating closer 
ties with the West and the European Community while maintaining good relations 
with the Soviet Union and Libya, its nearest neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Maltese Labor Party, which says real freedom only came when the 
last British servicemen left the island on March 31, 1979, is boycotting the 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
It maintains the independence Malta was given in 1964 was a sham because key 
areas such as the ports, the only airport, telecommunications and broadcasting 
remained in British hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party's Dom Mintoff, in fact, prolonged the British presence in Malta 
by seven years by agreeing to lease the base facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But since then both the ruling Nationalist Party of Prime Minister Eddie Fenech 
Adami and the Labor Party, in a rare show of agreement, have vowed that Malta 
will never again serve as a foreign military base. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationalists have promised to take Malta into the EC when conditions are 
right, and Fenech Adami has been to the United States and Britain in search of 
closer ties and economic help. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship with the United States has not so far delivered the results 
that many had hoped for, possibly because the Americans are not convinced that 
things have changed all that much since the days under the Labor Party when 
Malta had an extremely close relationship with Libya. 
</P>
<P>
While declaring that Malta will never allow itself to be dominated by any one 
country or bloc, Fenech Adami has neither broken nor scaled down relations 
established by the Labor government with Libya, 200 miles to the south, other 
Arab countries and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Relations with Libya, a good trading partner for Malta and a high investor on 
the island, remain excellent. But gone are the days when ties with Libya were 
so close that Arabic was a necessary requirement for university entry and many 
a Libyan might have felt Malta was an offshore post of his own country. 
</P>
<P>
Malta faced an uphill task when the British left. It had to find new jobs for 
the thousands of people who worked for the British forces. It chose the textile 
industry and tourism and had to start from scratch in both. 
</P>
<P>
Textiles absorbed surplus unskilled labor, and joint ventures with foreign 
firms later provided management expertise and ready export markets for Maltese 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Industry Minister John Dalli has traveled extensively in an effort to 
attract industrial investment, particularly from Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A free port and container depot under construction at Marsaxlokk, southwest of 
Valletta, is designed to re-export third-country goods to Europe, particularly 
after the 1992 EC single market. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism remains one of the main sources of foreign revenue. Earnings in 1988 
totaled more than $290 million and Malta hopes to host a record 800,000 
visitors -- nearly three times its population -- by the end of the year.

A 9-year-old boy died early Saturday from wounds suffered when he was shot in 
the head by his father, who was testing a gun for a friend in another room and 
apparently did not know it was loaded. The bullet from a .357 magnum crashed 
through a wall, ricocheted off some furniture and hit the boy Thursday night.

An investigation into the crash of USAir Flight 5050 focused Saturday on the 
possibility of mechanical failure, although officials said the rookie co-pilot 
had punched the wrong cockpit button just before the craft plunged into the 
East River. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators continued removing pieces of the plane's fuselage from the water 
off a runway at La Guardia Airport, National Transportation Safety Board 
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said. The parts will be examined to determine if 
there were any mechanical problems in addition to the reported pilot error, he 
said.

Speaking of the co-pilot's mistake, Lopatkiewicz said: "It may turn out that 
was unrelated to what happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strongly Criticized 
</P>
<P>
The flight's pilot and co-pilot had their flight licenses suspended for leaving 
the accident scene and were strongly criticized Friday by federal officials for 
failing to immediately submit to drug and alcohol testing. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when drug abuse has become a major national problem, we believe the 
American public has a right to know that its transportation system is alcohol 
and drug free," said acting NTSB Chairman James Kolstad. 
</P>
<P>
"The failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug testing following a 
major accident is inexcusable," he said, echoing an angry statement by Federal 
Aviation Administration head James B. Busey. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn., the union that issued a statement defending the 
pilots Friday, offered no response Saturday to the comments about testing or 
the suspensions. The pilots are not required by law to submit to testing after 
a crash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioned by Investigators 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Michael Martin, 36, and co-pilot Constantine Kleissas, 29, submitted to 
urinalysis Friday after five hours of questioning by federal investigators. The 
results of the tests were not available Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 5050 crashed into the East River late Wednesday when its takeoff was 
aborted. Two people died and 59 others were rescued. The flight had been headed 
to Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference late Friday, Kolstad revealed that Kleissas -- attempting 
his first operational takeoff of a Boeing 737-400 -- inadvertently pressed a 
button that caused the plane to decelerate. 
</P>
<P>
Martin then accelerated the plane, but decided to abort the takeoff because the 
craft began drifting to the left and "the pilot felt and heard a vibration 
which concerned him," Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Runs Out of Room 
</P>
<P>
Martin believed he had enough room on the runway to stop the plane, but it 
instead skidded off the runway and into the water, cracking the fuselage into 
three sections. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad also said that, as the plane accelerated down the runway, the captain, 
acting as co-pilot, did not call out the jet's speed as required. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit," 
Kolstad said. Lopatkiewicz said investigators were trying to find out what made 
the plane drift to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Kolstad also said reports that Martin appeared incoherent in the cockpit before 
the crash were not true, and Kleissas apologized for making those remarks.

RISKY FAMILY BUSINESS BEATS LIFE AS LANDLUBBER;

YOUNG MAN AND THE SEA: A STRONG LURE

GIG HARBOR, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His father was a commercial fisherman. So was his father's father. It follows, 
then, that Randy Babich was expected to become . . . a dentist? 
</P>
<P>
"Every fisherman tried to coax his son into something other than fishing. They 
thought a steady job on land, with a steady paycheck, was less risky," Babich 
said recently, sitting on the family dock and thinking how lucky he was to have 
rejected that advice. 
</P>
<P>
Like his forebears, Randy Babich has chosen the sea. In doing so, he helps to 
preserve a maritime heritage that has distinguished Washington's development 
since the first white settlers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Sea traders plied the coast starting in the 1700s, looking for furs. Even after 
the railroad arrived in 1883, most settlers who rode the rails westward passed 
up Washington's arid eastern plains, preferring tidewater towns such as Seattle 
and Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protected Coastline 
</P>
<P>
Unlike much of the Pacific coast, where great ocean swells pounded the shore, 
Washington's island-studded Puget Sound offered miles of protected coastline. 
Salmon and other fish were abundant, and the waterways became highways for 
ships hauling timber cut from tall forests. 
</P>
<P>
Randy's grandfather, Spiro Babich, came from Yugoslavia in 1910, about 40 years 
after the first whites settled in Gig Harbor. Two of the town's founders were 
Yugoslav fishermen, and they started a Slavic connection still obvious in the 
local phone book, where Jerisich, Markovich and Stanich are well represented. 
</P>
<P>
Spiro Babich was a typical immigrant: He had no money and spoke no English, but 
he learned fast. He soon had his own boat and used it to pursue salmon 
zealously. It is said that he used to pray for bad weather so the timid would 
go ashore and leave more fish for him. When he died at 67, he was planning to 
fish the next summer. 
</P>
<P>
One of his two boats went to son Peter, who fished until retiring last year at 
65. "Talk about a duck out of water," Randy Babich said of his father. "He's 
going to be leasing a boat for the fall, just so he can go out and fish once a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Randy, 39, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, could 
have avoided the dangerous fisherman's life. But his exposure to the workaday 
world of landlubbers gave him an appreciation of fishing that his grandfather's 
generation couldn't match. 
</P>
<P>
"If they knew about commuting to work every day on the freeway, fighting 
traffic, they'd have come home and kissed their deck winch," Babich said. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing today is easier in many ways. Whereas his grandfather pulled up heavy, 
tarred-cotton nets by hand, Babich uses a power winch to haul nylon nets aboard 
the Paragon, his 56-foot seiner. 
</P>
<P>
But hazards remain. The weather is as unpredictable as ever, and Babich, like 
most Washington fishermen, now must motor up to the distant waters of Alaska to 
make a living. He complains about strict regulations, foreign competition and 
outrageous insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Lately his son, Stefan, 19, has been helping on the boat. But just to work his 
way through school, you understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I encourage him not to follow fishing," Babich said.

'MERMAIDS' ASKED TO TAKE A DIVE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mermaids of legend glided effortlessly through the seas, tempting mortal 
sailors with their beauty and grace. It's not so easy in real life. 
</P>
<P>
At Weeki Wachee Spring, hundreds of young women seek work as mermaids each 
year, but few have the athletic skills, confidence in the water and good looks 
required to perform in the depths at one of Florida's oldest attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, there is no doubt about that," said Genie Young, mermaid 
supervisor. "We have some strict requirements, and only a few of the 'girls' 
actually go on to become mermaids." 
</P>
<P>
The enormous freshwater spring, with startlingly clear water more than 100 feet 
deep, was developed for tourists 42 years ago. "Mermaids" wearing skin-tight 
suits that taper to dolphin-like tail fins use air hoses while performing 
choreographed routines that are viewed from a subterranean amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soggy Sandwiches 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a lot of different things," Young said. "We've eaten bananas and 
drank Coke under water. We've recreated scenes from movies. One of the hardest 
things was eating a sandwich. It gets soggy pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
For beginners, "the toughest part is learning to only take in only about half a 
lung full of air," said Young, who performed as a mermaid from 1961 into the 
early 1970s. "Otherwise, you will float to the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Weeki Wachee also features an exhibit of photos of living mermaids and a shrine 
to athlete-actress Esther Williams, who filmed a movie at the spring and made 
numerous guest appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the specter of discrimination suits, Weeki Wachee remains extremely 
selective about its mermaids, who now number 26. 
</P>
<P>
A mermaid must have an attractive figure and shoulder-length or longer hair, 
said Young. And most women who have the right look get shipped back to land 
following the swimming test. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we look for is if you're afraid of the water," said Young. "If 
you're nervous being under water, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must swim for 30 minutes and perform simple underwater ballet and 
acrobatic moves, such as back flips and deep dives. Applicants who pass the 
aquatic test go on to begin serious training and instruction in how to use the 
air hoses and swim in various costumes. 
</P>
<P>
They start at $4 an hour and it may take up to a year to pass the 
apprenticeship, said Young. 
</P>
<P>
Marti Worsham, the veteran mermaid of the staff with 16 years of swimming 
behind her, recalls watching the mermaids swim around large flowers when she 
was a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
"From then on, I always wanted to be a mermaid," said Worsham. "I never 
expected I would one day be the one here the longest." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of a show, after the theater was empty, a mermaid scrubbed algae 
from the windows with a steel-wool pad. A turtle swam nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the job the tourists don't see," said Young. "Cleaning up 
isn't part of the myth of the mermaid."

MONTANAN PIONEERS EFFORT TO SAVE FARMS FOR PROGENY

CIRCLE, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like her Scandinavian forebears who led the way across a trackless prairie to a 
new life, Helen Quick Waller is breaking a trail for those who will come after 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Waller has lived in Circle, Mont., for most of her life. But these days you 
will hardly ever find her at the ranch. More likely she is in Washington, D.C., 
or Switzerland, or at somebody's farm in Kentucky or Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, 59, is a founder of the National Save the Family Farm Coalition. It is 
a grass-roots rural network in 35 states that aims to tilt government 
agriculture policy away from corporate farming and make it more favorable to 
the small producer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Married Sweetheart 
</P>
<P>
Waller was raised on a farm outside Circle "and grew up poor, except I didn't 
know it, because everybody else was like us." Both she and her husband, Gordon, 
who was her teen-age sweetheart, attended one-room schools, and they married 
after he came home from military service. 
</P>
<P>
She became a farm wife who raised five children, an active civic leader, and a 
hands-on ranching partner. Then, in the late 1970s, multinational energy 
companies targeted eastern Montana for giant coal mines and power plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Who were they to come into our communities and tell us 15,000 construction 
workers were about to descend on us?" Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Lessons learned in that fight paid off in the family farm crisis. Waller 
recalled thinking: "What good will it do us to save our farms from draglines 
(mining apparatus), only to lose them to the bankers?" 
</P>
<P>
Much of the 1984-85 family farm bill was written at Helen Waller's kitchen 
table by dedicated coalition members who then passed it on to Sen. Tom Harkin 
(D-Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
"When the Family Farm Act was being written, Helen was right there," said 
Harkin, who called her an "ally in the fight to ensure that our farmers receive 
a fair profit for their products." 
</P>
<P>
The Harkin bill failed in Congress, but some of its provisions made their way 
into law, and each year the coalition tries to get more of its goals passed. 
</P>
<P>
Waller was an unsuccessful Democratic primary candidate for lieutenant governor 
last year. She is keeping mum on any future political plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I put in a lot of 15-hour days, and when I get home I go immediately to the 
field. When I'm on the tractor I never run the radio because that's when I do 
my best thinking. That's where I construct my congressional testimony." 
</P>
<P>
Waller said women have become active in revising agriculture policy because "we 
see the agony our husbands are in because they are made to feel that what they 
do has no value anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The Waller ranch is an endless horizon of rolling prairie dotted with sleek 
cattle and enriched by well-tended crops. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I put myself through what I do," Waller said, "is because I 
have kids and grandkids, and I want to be able to turn this farm over to them 
and know that it will go on. 
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are too high in this one to see myself wearing out before we win."

YOUNG ROD SERLING GAVE HOMETOWN NO CLUE TO HIS SINISTER BENT

Witness a transformation: A witty boy growing up in an idyllic New York town in 
the 1930s becomes the master of macabre in television's Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
He delivers packages for his father's butcher shop, captains the debating team, 
stars in plays, writes patriotic newspaper editorials. 
</P>
<P>
Graduation, 1942. He joins the paratroopers, is wounded in the Philippines. 
After college, he trades in his smile for a tight-lipped, somber look and 
becomes the spokesman for a bizarre dimension beyond imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Young Roddy Serling is about to become the creator of "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tales of Hysteria 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew him growing up in Binghamton, 60 miles south of Syracuse, say 
that their Rod Serling was not the sinister narrator who introduced such tales 
of hysteria as "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" or "Will the Real Martian 
Please Stand Up?" 
</P>
<P>
"He was always gregarious and wasn't a bit Edgar Allan Poe-ish," said Helen 
Foley, Serling's junior high drama teacher. "He was very funny and witty and 
charming." 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years after Serling died following heart surgery in Rochester, a group 
of friends has formed the Rod Serling Foundation in Binghamton to keep his 
memory alive. 
</P>
<P>
Serling was born on Dec. 25, 1924, to Samuel and Esther Serling. The family 
later moved to Binghamton, the city Serling disguised in "The Twilight Zone" as 
the perfect towns of Homewood and Willoughby. 
</P>
<P>
His friends in Binghamton remember Serling not as a star but as the grinning 
boy who always showed up at the center of every group picture. 
</P>
<P>
Former Binghamton High School classmate Jim Haley recalls how Serling would 
come to his house on his green bike to visit Haley's sister, Pat. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd always let me ride it to get me out of the way," Haley recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has about 150 members nationwide, but it's not a fan club, 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be called fans," said Foley, who attended the ceremonies last 
October when Serling was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "Fans 
sounds as though we're a bunch of clucks like those 'Star Trek' people." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was seven years older than Rod, Serling's brother, Robert, 
remembers staging plays with the future TV whiz-kid in their back yard. They 
later collaborated on an early version of the script for Robert Serling's 
novel, "The President's Plane Is Missing." 
</P>
<P>
Other anthology shows in television's infancy are long forgotten, but mention 
"The Twilight Zone" and everyone will rattle off a favorite episode, Robert 
Serling said in a telephone interview from his home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring out why the show captivated viewers "would be like describing the 
color red," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it was Rod's voice and appearance, the way he set the mood," his 
brother said. "Part of it was the O. Henry aspect, the unexpected twist, the 
surprise ending. And part of it was that Rod masqueraded a sermon in his 
scripts. He sent messages to people without them realizing they were being 
preached to." 
</P>
<P>
That was part of Serling's appeal in television's early years, when good 
writing with a point behind it was rare. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great observer of humanity," classmate Bill Behan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We often wonder what he'd be writing today," said another classmate, Robert 
Keller. "If he were alive, I'm sure he'd have something in the running for the 
Oscars." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief stint as a radio copywriter, Serling began writing TV scripts in 
1951. He sold more than 70 scripts before his drama "Patterns" was aired in 
1955, winning him the first of six Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
For the next four years, Serling could pick and choose what shows to write for. 
He did many scripts for "Playhouse 90," which aired Serling's second Emmy 
winner, "Requiem for a Heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1959, he surprised the industry with plans for a science-fiction 
anthology series. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod always tried to do more than entertain," his wife, Carolyn Serling, said 
in a telephone interview from her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. "He was a 
humanitarian and critic, and he found outer space and fantasy a good vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Serling wrote 92 of the 156 "Twilight Zone" episodes and became its host after 
the producers' first choice, Orson Welles, proved too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
That brooding host was not the Rod Serling that classmate Sybil Goldenburg 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
"He enjoyed the pretense of that persona, but it wasn't him," she said. "If his 
talent overtook his behavior, it was an affectation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voice Attributed to Nerves 
</P>
<P>
Nerves caused Serling's hushed tones at first, his wife said. As he grew more 
comfortable before the cameras, he stuck with the menacing voice because it fit 
the show, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Serling's Binghamton friends lament that his other writing accomplishments are 
largely forgotten: a 1960s Western series starring Lloyd Bridges, an early 
draft of the script for "Planet of the Apes," the 1970s series "Night Gallery." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot for "Night Gallery" gave Steven Spielberg his first directing job in 
1969 in a vignette starring Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when Spielberg and company premiered "Twilight Zone -- The Movie" in 
Binghamton, Serling's old friends formed the foundation to honor the writer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides sponsoring annual Serling film festivals, the foundation last Christmas 
laid a bronze plaque in a bandstand in a Binghamton park where Serling set the 
"Twilight Zone" episode "Walking Distance." That episode starred Gig Young as a 
man transported back to his childhood in the idyllic town of Homewood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serling Stamp Urged 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has a Serling exhibit in a local theater, sells Serling buttons 
and postcards and is lobbying the U.S. Postal Service to issue a Serling stamp. 
</P>
<P>
Serling's ties with his hometown included featuring Binghamton High School 
graduate Richard Deacon in "Twilight Zone" episodes. Deacon was best known as 
bald Mel Cooley on "The Dick Van Dyke Show." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Serling became disenchanted as producers altered his "Night 
Gallery" scripts. After the show was canceled, he spent his last years teaching 
at Ithaca College, 30 miles northwest of Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
He often returned to his hometown to talk to students. When Serling spoke at 
Binghamton High School once, "a kid told him, 'You must have awful nightmares. 
You've got an awfully creepy mind,' " Foley said. "But he didn't."

CAR-POOLING'S POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eileen Rose-Busby's commentary on opening car-pool lanes to all traffic ("Why 
Car-Pool Lanes Should Be Opened to All Vehicles and Not Just a Select Few," 
Sept. 17) ignores the operating principle behind car-pool lanes and the 
fundamental problem of planning for growing traffic in Southern California. 
Freeways, and car-pool lanes especially, are designed to move people, not cars. 
Car-pool lanes are particularly efficient at this as they allow more people to 
travel an equal-width freeway segment at peak hour than a congested freeway 
without such a lane. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring car-pooling and other measures to manage our traffic demand places 
excess reliance upon building new freeways. Traffic is simply growing too fast 
to build our way out of the problem. There are simply not enough dollars nor is 
there a popular will to raise enough of them for such an approach to work. San 
Diego needs more car-pool lanes and more incentives to use them, not retrograde 
actions generating more trips and air pollution, which only guarantee that our 
freeways mimic our congested cousin to the north.

NO CHEERS FOR CHARGER POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ballgames are about winning. Ask any fan, and he or she will have an opinion on 
what's needed. And the most ardent fans are often passionately vocal. 
</P>
<P>
Would the game be much fun without that passion? Imagine a football game where 
fans cheered a touchdown with symphony-audience applause. 
</P>
<P>
Approval and disapproval are instantaneous and boisterous. Some teams even hire 
cheerleaders to keep the crowd stirred up. It's not an arena for the faint of 
spirit, and hardly a place where you would expect to find censorship. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems the San Diego Chargers have a policy that prohibits banners with 
disparaging comments -- comments like "Fire Ortmayer" (the team's director of 
football operations) or "Welcome to Ortmayer's House of Shame." The Chargers 
insist that disparaging comments about anyone are taken down, even those about 
Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis. Sports are fun, they say, and there 
shouldn't be personal attacks, anymore than there should be profanity. 
</P>
<P>
Disparaging banners also can provoke fights, they argue. In fact, the Padres 
allow no banners for that reason. The Padres' policy is not much of a vote for 
free speech, either, but at least they don't put themselves in the role of 
censor. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that the Chargers have had a rough couple of weeks. They are 0-2 
(after a 6-10 season last year), and attendance at their home opener was the 
lowest since 1977. This might partly explain management's heightened bunker 
mentality. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't excuse such a policy, especially in a publicly owned sports 
arena. Criticism of coaches, managers and players is just fair comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers aren't likely to win any points with their fans, either, something 
they ought to care about even if they don't see the banners as a free-speech 
issue.

SDG&amp;E-SCE MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a San Diego County taxpayer, I have reviewed the public record concerning 
the SDG&amp;E/SCE merger. 
</P>
<P>
I can only conclude that the merger will benefit my family on the basis of 
lower rates for the near term. Further, as the marketplace for electric power 
undergoes changes into the next century, my family will continue to benefit 
from the larger, more financially secure, and more diverse utility the two 
companies will form. 
</P>
<P>
These conclusions are based on an understanding of the profit motive of the 
utilities. Since electric rates are subject to public approval, and since 
utility spending is similarly subject to public review, there is no danger to 
me from a utility's size alone. In fact, in order to turn a profit, utility 
management must provide for long-range planning, must achieve a diverse 
generation mix, and must serve the customer reliably under normal and 
catastrophic conditions. Utility size is a distinct advantage in these 
pursuits, and the advantage will be passed along to customers and taxpayers, 
the Public Utilities Commission will see to that. 
</P>
<P>
All these considerations are fairly easy for an open-minded individual to 
discover. I find the City Council's closed-mindedness and regional parochialism 
in the matter of the SDG&amp;E/SCE merger disturbing. I find its willingness to 
spend tax money on opposing the merger of two private companies appalling. 
Finally, I find attempts to condemn and take over operation of SDG&amp;E 
criminal, from the point of view of governmental interference with private 
activities and from the point of view of eroding an established tax base.

ASSESSING COMPETITORS FOR BALBOA PARK SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balboa Park, under its recently approved Master Plan, will not be able to 
accept many more cultural immigrants. There will be room for a few new 
institutions as buildings are renovated and the gymnasium complex is moved out 
of the park. But most will have to find homes elsewhere -- so that the park can 
remain a park. 
</P>
<P>
That's why competition has been so intense for the House of Charm, a 
dilapidated building on the Prado that the city will be reconstructing in a few 
years. Seven cultural institutions are vying for the space. 
</P>
<P>
The most compelling cases were presented by the Children's Museum, now in a La 
Jolla shopping center and badly in need of space; the Mingei International 
Museum of World Folk Art, also in a shopping center, and the Old Globe, which 
needs rehearsal space and wants to expand. The San Diego Art Institute, which 
exhibits works by local artists and is the current tenant of the House of 
Charm, also deserves to be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee that studied the seven proposals unanimously recommended 
that the Mingei and the Art Institute share the space. The city manager 
concurred with the recommendation, but the Park and Recreation Board voted in 
favor of the Children's Museum. The matter now goes to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager concluded that the Children's Museum should be in the park, 
but that the Prado area -- with the San Diego Museum of Art, the Timken Art 
Gallery and the Museum of Man -- was not the right place. There would be too 
much traffic for children's safety, even after parking lots are closed and the 
Laurel Street entrance is made one-way, the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager recommended instead that the council promise that the 
Children's Museum move into the Federal Building, part of the gymnasium 
complex, when it becomes available in several years. The exuberance of children 
would be better accommodated by the more spacious open areas there, the 
committee concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendation makes excellent sense. The Mingei's collections 
of folk art would add cultural diversity to the park, and the Mingei's 
willingness to share the building with the Art Institute is important. After 
more than 35 years in the House of Charm, it would be unfair to push the Art 
Institute out. 
</P>
<P>
We also agree with the committee that, in a perfect world, the Federal Building 
is the more compatible location for the Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
But, under the Master Plan, the Federal Building won't be available until a new 
site is found for the gymnasium complex, which isn't planned until phase two of 
the plan, 1994-1998. The House of Charm is expected to be available by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal solution would be for the city to find a way to push that date 
forward. If the city can find a way to assure that the new gymnasium will be 
available in the early part of phase two, it would be wise to follow the 
committee's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
But, if that's not possible, the Children's Museum should be given the House of 
Charm, if, and it's a big if, adequate space can be found for the Art 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Although both museums are hard-pressed for space in their shopping center 
locations, the Children's Museum has the more compelling need to be in the 
park. And San Diego children have a compelling need for a larger, more 
centrally located Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic problems should be surmountable. And, although the patrons of the 
Children's Museum will be more boisterous than those of the Mingei, the minor 
disruption they might cause should not override the opportunity to add an 
important cultural element for such an important part of San Diego's 
population.

COUNTY DROPOUT FIGURES CALL FOR A FEW LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Education figures released last week show the average 
dropout rate for all Orange County students is 16.9%, nearly 6% lower than the 
state average of 22.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Averages can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
The more significant statistic in the state report is that 33% of the Latino 
students in the county drop out, usually before their junior year of high 
school. That is about 2 1/2 times greater than the 13% dropout rate for Anglo 
students. In some school districts, as many as four or five of every 10 Latino 
students do not stay long enough to get a high school diploma. The frustrating 
thing about the three-year statewide survey is that although the state has been 
able to determine the most realistic dropout figures possible, it still cannot 
pinpoint exactly why students drop out, why the gap is so great between Anglo 
and Latino students, and why the dropout rates for Latinos vary so much between 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing that is certain is that it is not just the students who left 
school that failed. The schools did too. And so has the community. 
</P>
<P>
Some students quit because they cannot keep up with the work or lack basic 
skills. Others become bored or get involved in gang activity. Some students 
from poor families must leave to take jobs to help out at home. Girls also quit 
to get married or because they became pregnant. Whatever the reason, dropout 
rates for all minority students exceed those of Anglo students, and past 
studies have shown that 80% of the Latino and black students in the state have 
fallen behind by the third grade. And fewer blacks and Latinos who do graduate 
go on to colleges or universities. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of ethnic background, the result affects not only the individual 
student, but also the entire community. Dropouts lacking education or 
marketable skills are stuck with lower-paying jobs -- or no job at all. The 
community bears the economic and social costs of less productive residents, 
reduced tax income, more costly social service programs and fewer qualified 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that educators and residents learned a few lessons in how to keep 
more students in school. Potential dropouts must be recognized early, and 
enthusiastic programs that increase their confidence, keep them interested in 
learning and that involve the parents as well as students should be part of 
every grade school. Without them, the gap between Anglo and minority dropout 
rates -- and productive, successful lives -- will remain so seriously out of 
proportion.

POLICE ROLE IN SHOOTING OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great interest the story of Jody Olmos and her infant daughter, and 
the attempted abduction of them at gunpoint by a convicted felon. 
Unfortunately, little Michelle was injured as the police tried to capture the 
gunman and prevent him from driving away with his victims. 
</P>
<P>
An officer following the man fired at him to prevent either murder or a 
kidnapping. The man was apprehended. Mother and child were safe, although the 
child was wounded. Instead of thanking the officer profusely for saving their 
lives, the Olmoses have criticized the officer who wounded their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
I can't believe it! No mention of thanks for the officer who saved both mother 
and daughter from an uncertain fate, only criticism because the child was 
wounded. Sadly, this happens too often. We call on our police every day to help 
us in a hundred different ways. In those situations where shots are fired, and 
someone is hurt or killed, there is invariably anger and hostility directed at 
the police by relatives or bystanders. The police are blamed, rather than 
praised for their actions -- somehow it becomes their fault that things went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to say to the officer involved in this shooting: "Thank you for 
possibly saving the lives of an innocent mother and child. Thank you, and 
please know that there are many of us who are grateful to you and your fellow 
officers for your courage and your willingness to put your lives on the line 
every single day."

CHURCH'S SPIRE AND MEANING OF RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the Crystal Cathedral's plans to add a $5.5-million stainless steel spire 
because the Rev. Robert Schuller "always felt that all great cathedrals have 
spires": 
</P>
<P>
First, I'd like to refer him to Matthew 6: "And when thou prayest, thou shalt 
not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray in the corners of the 
streets, that they may be seen of men. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon 
earth . . . but in heaven . . . for there will be your heart." 
</P>
<P>
Next, I'd like to refer him to my banker. He's good for 9% on deposits of this 
size. That works out to a modest $495,000 per year in interest -- tax free for 
Schuller -- and no small beginning for any number of projects that could 
benefit Orange County's needy. 
</P>
<P>
Come back to earth, reverend. God knows, we could use the help.

LIGHT-PLANE TRAFFIC OVER ORANGE AND L.A. COUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government agencies must face the fact that there are too many aircraft in the 
sky over Southern California. Are we to wait for another midair collision such 
as the one over Cerritos before this problem is addressed? 
</P>
<P>
According to reports in The Times, we have more than 39,000 licensed pilots in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties, a number doubtless increasing pressure to add 
more commercial flights. And we have a level of affluence that supports flying 
as a recreational pastime. The central issue: to what extent can we continue to 
permit unlimited recreational use of our skies? On a typical Saturday or 
Sunday, the sound of light planes can be heard over my neighborhood almost 
incessantly. I have more than once looked up to see two converging planes veer 
off from each other at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
General aviation proponents argue that the proportion of recreational flights 
is not that high, that limiting light-plane traffic would create hardships on 
business activity. I don't buy that argument. The dramatic increase in flights 
over my area on weekends and holidays compared to that on weekdays is surely 
not due to business travel. And if one follows the stories in the press about 
light-plane crashes and near-misses, it becomes apparent that the private 
pilots involved are usually flying for reasons unrelated to business. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come to find a way to limit the number of unnecessary flights over 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. Already the computers controlling our air 
traffic are overloaded. Adding more computers will still not solve the problem 
of all the light planes lacking radar transponders. For the sake of the public 
safety, the Federal Aviation Administration must start acting like a 
responsible regulatory agency rather than merely a facilitator of general 
aviation and recreational flying.

SPENDING TAX MONEY ON COUNTY'S SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Letters section on Sept. 17 carried a letter from Cindy Suman titled "A Tax 
Increase for Orange County's Schools" that I would like to respond to. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest "outstanding instruction" should be in place with no-cut, no-trade, 
no-fire positions with salaries of $27,000 to $57,000 for classroom teachers. 
Students are allowed to graduate with the functionally illiterate label without 
protest from the educational community. 
</P>
<P>
The high-powered teachers' unions have done a great job to channel up to 90% of 
school funds into salaries and fringe costs without accepting any 
responsibility for the product, the students' achievements. Every failure 
reported by the teacher's associations or other studies requires only more 
money to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Top-heavy, non-teaching personnel may be a part of the lack of resources to the 
classroom, however, you will never see the California Teachers Assn. or the 
local teachers unions accepting any of the responsibility for the dropout rates 
or failures of educational content. 
</P>
<P>
No. They won't even suggest the family has a large responsibility in the 
failure of education. The unions are too busy lobbying for more money, a 
majority of which ends up in their pockets. That's a union "fox" dressed in a 
sheep's educational clothing and most of the public buys it. Shame on a 
gullible public.

Re "Small Planes Catch Flak in Orange County" (Sept. 17): 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Perlman's article provided clear, comprehensive and objective insight 
into the dilemma of general aviation access to John Wayne Airport. Perhaps the 
only way to relieve the general aviation contribution to overcrowding at John 
Wayne Airport is to provide a realistic, attractive alternative for the more 
than 700 small planes based there. 
</P>
<P>
There is an alternative. It is convenient, large, mostly unused, and in 
excellent condition: The Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos could draw aircraft from John Wayne, Long Beach and Fullerton. It 
is a very large facility with excellent parallel runways and virtually 
uninhabited departure paths over the Seal Beach U.S. Naval Weapons Station. The 
more than $2 million in annual revenue generated by general aviation at John 
Wayne should provide something for Los Alamitos city planners to think about. 
</P>
<P>
There are many joint-use facilities now operating in the western U.S. Klamath 
Falls, Ore; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Albuquerque, N.M., and Yuma, Ariz., are 
just a few examples of successful joint-use facilities.

SEYMOUR'S DECISION TO TURN PRO-CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial (Sept. 17) supporting Sen. John Seymour's reversal of his 
position on abortion, you stated that Seymour recognizes that despite the 
authority his public office provides, he does not have the power to impose his 
personal and religious beliefs on everyone. Isn't this true of any issue in our 
society? 
</P>
<P>
No politician has the power to impose his or her personal or religious beliefs 
on everyone, but to believe as you say in one thing and to support something 
else is extremely difficult for me to understand. 
</P>
<P>
If Sen. Seymour is personally opposed to abortion, I think he and the rest of 
our society should stop blaming poor women for making our personal opinions one 
thing and our public opinion something else.

SEYMOUR'S DECISION TO TURN PRO-CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re state Sen. John Seymour's (R-Anaheim) pro-choice position: 
</P>
<P>
The senator's new position on abortion is particularly laudable because it 
helps to clarify what it really means to be pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
Every individual's right to judge abortion as right or wrong and to act 
personally according to his own convictions is to be respected. That is the 
cornerstone of pro-choice philosophy. But as the senator points out, to impose 
one's personal belief on others would not be "appropriate," especially through 
the "privileged power" he has as a state legislator. Using the power of the 
government to impose personally held beliefs is just as unacceptable as using 
tactics of intimidation and coercion. 
</P>
<P>
Especially profound is the senator's realization that the government should not 
discriminate against the poor in funding medical services. Politically it 
certainly wasn't necessary or even expedient to reach that conclusion. But it 
is decent and fair-minded.

SEYMOUR'S DECISION TO TURN PRO-CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has reported that state Sen. John Seymour is "taking a new look at 
the abortion issue" and that he has, "after soul-searching," done a complete 
turnaround on that issue. It is just like Seymour to equivocate on issues 
because it is politically expedient. He did it while on the Anaheim City 
Council and now he does it as a state senator. 
</P>
<P>
His magical turnaround reminds me of the crystal-clear promises he made to the 
Mexican-American community while an Anaheim councilman. He promised that a 
blue-ribbon committee would investigate the "Little People's Park" incident 
and, when it came time to fess up to his promise, Seymour equivocated. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour is an expert in straddling any two-sided issue and coming up on both 
sides. No question about it, Seymour is the best person to be a running mate to 
(U.S. Sen.) Pete Wilson, who is a master of doing the same thing.

LIGHT-PLANE TRAFFIC OVER ORANGE AND L.A. COUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was encouraged and somewhat chagrined in reading recent stories of the verbal 
clash between Buena Park civic officials and the Fullerton Municipal Airport. I 
believe that what is needed is a series of public hearings at which arguments 
on both sides could be raised and modified by information that doesn't reach 
the press because it doesn't make news. 
</P>
<P>
While three plane crashes in 1989 are nothing to sneer at, the possibility of a 
much greater crash rate is strengthened by what actually goes on in the air 
lanes above Buena Park. You have to live near the airport to recognize the 
scope of the air traffic problem. It's not only a matter of planes flying at 
low altitudes before landing or taking off. What complicates the situation is 
the simple fact that just about everyone is using the air lanes above Buena 
Park and the airport. 
</P>
<P>
I take regular walks in my neighborhood. At such times it is easy for me to see 
a whole squadron of military helicopters fly over the airport from El Toro, at 
the same time that a few police helicopters might be doing the same thing. It 
would seem to me that any private pilot seeking to land at Fullerton Municipal 
at such a time would have to seek a lower approach to do so to avoid striking 
one of the many helicopters. Occasionally, on my evening strolls I can see this 
actually happen. The planes have to come down low to avoid the air congestion. 
</P>
<P>
I have, on occasion, seen large military transports and bombers fly over my 
house at startlingly low altitudes -- as if their pilots really didn't know 
where they were going to land.

<P>
Your story (Sept. 16) of the Fullerton Airport air crash was shoddy, 
irresponsible reporting on an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter's only interest seemed to be in defiling the Fullerton Airport and 
quoting the hysterical mayor of Buena Park. If you had done a reputable job, 
you would have at least called the airport manager to get the facts, such as 
there are no touch-and-go landings allowed at the Fullerton Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that if anything should be done, the airport should be enlarged. 
Some of the housing at the west end should be condemned and the runway 
lengthened. It should also be noted that the airport is used by police 
departments and other emergency services, such as medical evacuation and 
paramedics. It is also used for mail and small cargo. I'm sure the mayor of 
Buena Park would be first to scream if there were no emergency services 
available for her town during a county emergency, such as a large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The impression was also given that all these students and pilots are out flying 
around just for a lark. There are many students training at Fullerton (and 
other small airports) that have career goals in mind. Everyone wants to use the 
airlines but nobody wants the pilots to get any training. Not everyone gets 
trained in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Let's be realistic. There are many tragic accidents on the streets and 
freeways, and cars even run into houses and businesses with numerous people 
injured and killed. But nobody says "close the streets and freeways, no more 
driving of cars and trucks." (It might be noted that Los Angeles County has 
approximately nine civilian airports, Orange County has two).

ANGELS FAIL TO HANDLE PRESSURE OR INDIANS; 
</P>
<P>
INSTEAD OF GAINING ON A'S, THEY LOSE DOUBLEHEADER TO FALL 4 1/2 BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was crunch time, and the Angels cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's loss to Minnesota was in the books and on the Cleveland Stadium 
scoreboard Saturday when the Angels had a 3-1 lead in the seventh inning of the 
first game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
But a couple of innings later, after a dropped fly ball, some horrible relief 
pitching and poor clutch hitting by the Angels, the Indians had a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Angels choke? 
</P>
<P>
Well, consider that before this game, the Angels were 73-5 when leading after 
seven innings and the Indians were 3-67 when trailing after seven. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics failed to beat the Twins Saturday, but thanks to the Angels -- 
and some help from the Indians -- they had their magic number trimmed to four. 
</P>
<P>
Even reliable skid-stopper Bert Blyleven couldn't right the Angel ship on this 
day, and Cleveland won the second game, 6-2, before 8,453 fans. Tom Candiotti 
went the distance, holding the Angels to seven hits, and left fielder Joey 
Belle hit a bases-loaded triple in the seventh inning of the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels had been all but mathematically eliminated in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Browne, the first Indian batter in the opener, walked, stole second and 
scored on Joe Carter's single. But the Angels went ahead, 3-1, after scoring 
solo runs in the third, fourth and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pete O'Brien led off the bottom of the seventh with a single to right field, 
but Angel starter Mike Witt, who allowed eight hits in 7 1/3 innings, retired 
the next two batters and then got Cory Snyder to hit a fly ball. Right 
fielderTony Armas settled under it, then frantically backpedaled a couple of 
steps, and the ball tipped off his glove. O'Brien scored, and the Angels' lead 
was cut to one. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the Cleveland jokes, as far as Angel fans are concerned, Armas' miscue 
will be remembered as the Mistake by the Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Witt yielded three singles -- and the tying run -- in the eighth before Manager 
Doug Rader summoned Bob McClure to pitch to O'Brien. McClure walked the Indian 
first baseman on five pitches to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Then Rader called on Greg Minton, who walked Brook Jacoby on four pitches to 
force in the winning run, and a lot of Angels probably saw the season flash 
before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the ground ball and I went out there thinking keep it down," Minton 
said. "I threw the first one about halfway to home plate. The only one that was 
even close was the fourth one." 
</P>
<P>
Minton got Dave Clark to hit into an inning-ending double play, but by then the 
Angels were already sinking not-so-slowly in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
Their hopes were momentarily buoyed in the ninth, however, when Wally Joyner 
hit a one-out double and pinch-hitter Claudell Washington reached first on 
shortstop Felix Fermin's fielding error. Pinch-hitter Jim Eppard lined to left, 
then reliever Doug Jones stepped up on the rubber and dropped the ball for a 
balk that moved the runners to second and third. 
</P>
<P>
But pinch-hitter Max Venable watched a third strike flutter across the plate 
and the Angels went down without even a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing, but we played as hard as we could," Joyner said. "We put 
two guys in scoring position in the ninth. What more can you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
How about a key hit. . . or some decent relief pitching. . . or a routine 
catch? 
</P>
<P>
Armas retired to the privacy of the training room after both games, but Joyner 
was quick to come to Armas' defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty tough out there, the wind was really swirling around," Joyner 
said. "Tony is a great outfielder. These things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Especially to the Angels, who just can't seem to get over the hump. They were 
in first place for 50 days this season, but at this point, about all they can 
say is that it was nice while it lasted. If the Angels win their last seven 
games, the A's can still win the division title by splitting their final eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many things in this world that are truly frustrating to consider 
this frustrating," Rader said after his team had lost the second game, making 
its record in doubleheaders 1-9 this season. "But it certainly is 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have busted their butts for 155 games and I for one won't let these 
last three games dilute the effort and success they've had this year." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound a bit like an epitaph, but left fielder Chili Davis says the 
Angels still have a reason to come to the park and put on their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seven games left and anything can happen," he said. "I wish I had a 
time machine. I'd go back and change a lot of things in my life. But that's 
fantasy. This is reality and all we have to be concerned with now are the games 
in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a 'Z' in front of our name yet," he said, referring to the 
letter sometimes used in the standings to notate teams that have been 
eliminated. "And as long as we don't have that 'Z,' we've got a hell of a lot 
to play for. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what the 'Z' means? It means time to go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels aren't asleep yet, but they're beginning to nod off. A couple of 
more games like the two they played Saturday in Cleveland and they'll be 
snoring like a bear who's ready for a nice winter's hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette's prodigious homer to left-center in the fourth inning of the 
first game Saturday was the longest Angel homer of the year and one of the 
longest in the history of Cleveland Stadium. Bichette's drive landed 456 feet 
from home plate in the bleachers in left-center. The longest home run hit here 
was a 477-foot blast by Indian first baseman Luke Easter on June 23, 1950. The 
longest homer by an Angel this year before Bichette's shot was hit by catcher 
Bill Schroeder, who slugged a 442-foot grand slam against Milwaukee at Anaheim 
Stadium on May 21. Cleveland pitcher Bud Black had not allowed a homer in 65 
1/3 innings before Bichette went deep against him. "It was a changeup out over 
the plate, but I didn't get all of it," Bichette said, smiling. "I hit it 
pretty good, though." Bichette said it wasn't the longest homer he's ever hit. 
"I hit a few farther, at least 500 feet, in college," he said. "Of course, that 
was with an aluminum bat." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had a team party after Saturday's games, where they exchanged gag 
gifts. Would it be too cruel a shot to say that gag is the operative word here? 
"I think there are going to be a lot of no shows tonight," designated hitter 
Brian Downing said after the doubleheader. . . Glenn Hoffman, a veteran of 
eight major-league seasons, made his first appearance ever at first base in the 
first game Saturday. He said he had never played first before, even in Little 
League or American Legion ball. Hoffman started in place of Wally Joyner, who 
was hitless in 17 career at-bats against Black. Joyner ended that slump with a 
double against Black in the ninth inning. . . . Schroeder, who had arthroscopic 
surgery on his right elbow Sept. 11, rejoined the team Saturday to add moral 
support. "I've got no soreness, no swelling and total range of motion," said 
Schroeder, who had been home in Milwaukee. "I don't think I've lost any 
strength, either. I think I could be ready for the World Series." Schroeder's 
cheerleading may not have helped much Saturday, but no one can doubt his 
optimism.

MARINOVICH, RETURNING AFTER WRIST INJURY, LIFTS TROJANS TO 42-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The USC Trojans had to endure the nightmare of the Illinois game. 
</P>
<P>
They just smiled at the dream game against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday at the Coliseum, they had to wonder if they were ever going to 
wake up against Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Here they were, facing another big challenge of the season and failing 
miserably. 
</P>
<P>
Their defense had given up more rushing yards (61) on the first six plays than 
they had given up all season (59). 
</P>
<P>
Their offense was again sputtering and their redshirt freshman quarterback had 
already thrown an interception and was hunched over on the Coliseum grass 
gripping an injured wrist. 
</P>
<P>
And then it happened -- suddenly, quickly and decisively. 
</P>
<P>
In just under four minutes, all the questions seemed to be answered. A team 
found a quarterback, an identity and the confidence it has been seeking since 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve quarterback Shane Foley came on to throw a touchdown pass, Todd 
Marinovich came back to throw four, including the longest in school history, 
and the Trojans came back from a 3-0 deficit to score six consecutive 
touchdowns in a 42-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most one-sided loss in Buckeye history since a 58-6 defeat by 
Michigan in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time this year we feel we've accomplished something with the 
football team we feel we can be," Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Ricky Ervins, the USC tailback who carried 21 times for 120 yards: "We 
knew it was only a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
That's the one thing Marinovich hasn't had. Thrown into the fury of big-time 
college football in the last scrimmage of the preseason when projected starter 
Pat O'Hara went down with a season-ending knee injury, Marinovich struggled 
against Illinois, failing to go deep until the final two plays of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But armed with a wide-open game plan against the Buckeyes, he put on an aerial 
show, hitting 14 of 22 for 246 yards and the four scores. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were capable of busting loose," Marinovich said, "and I wanted to be 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't. Not at first. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich went out early in the second quarter after handing the ball off to 
Ervins. Ohio State defender Tom Lease, arriving at the instant of the handoff, 
hit Marinovich and fell on top of the quarterback as he went to the ground, 
landing on the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
In came Foley, a junior who was elevated to the backup spot when O'Hara went 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, the Trojans had their first touchdown of the season aside 
from the Utah State massacre. Foley faked a handoff into the line, sprinted 
right on a third-and-three from the Ohio State three-yard line, spotted tight 
end Scott Galbraith ahead of defenders Vinnie Clark and Bryan Cook, and softly 
laid the ball in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State, ahead at the time, 3-0, on Pat O'Morrow's 45-yard field goal in the 
first quarter, would not see the lead again. 
</P>
<P>
But with the crowd of 69,876 cheering wildly for Foley, Marinovich shook off 
the pain of a sprained wrist, showed Larry Smith on the sidelines that he could 
throw just fine and waited for the signal to go back in. 
</P>
<P>
He got it. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it," Smith said when asked if he considered staying with 
Foley. "But Todd took some snaps and said he felt good. We figured if he can't 
go, we'll go back to Shane." 
</P>
<P>
No way. Marinovich, who dreamed of this job since childhood, wasn't about to 
lose it so easily. 
</P>
<P>
Following an Ohio State punt, Marinovich handed off for two short gains, then 
faced a third-and-two at his own 13-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Given excellent protection, he waited and waited before finally throwing a bomb 
that John Jackson caught at the Ohio State 48-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was looking inside, then turned outside when the ball sailed toward the 
sideline. Trying to adjust with him, Buckeye defensive back Clark slipped to 
one knee, then quickly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to adjust," he said softly in the quiet of the losing locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
It was too late. Although the ball seemed to come down a bit short, Jackson was 
there, a step ahead of Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"Those bombs always seem to take forever," Jackson said. "But I felt I could 
outrun (Clark). I knew if it was a foot race, I would win. I wanted to get to 
the outside to get to my top speed." 
</P>
<P>
Once he got there, Jackson was gone, all the way to the end zone, an 87-yard 
pass play, the longest touchdown pass in USC history. 
</P>
<P>
The record, 80 yards, was reached twice, by Jim Powers to Al Cantor against 
Washington in 1949, and by Jim Contratto to Lindon Crow against Washington 
State in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was done, Marinovich also threw scoring passes to Gary Wellman for 19 
and 17 yards, and an 11-yarder to Galbraith, his second touchdown catch of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Foley came back in in the fourth quarter and put together one last drive, Mazio 
Royster going over from the one. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan domination was total. They gained 491 yards to Ohio State's 223, 
outrushing them 233 to 88 and outpassing them 258-135. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a false sense of confidence (against Utah State)," USC defensive 
lineman Tim Ryan said. "Nothing against them, but they were out of our league. 
Now we have the confidence that we have the potential to be a damn good 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
"What Todd did today means a lot to the year in terms of confidence. But the 
most important thing is, now he has confidence in himself." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and his fellow members of the defensive unit didn't offer a lot to be 
confident about in the first quarter when the Buckeyes, bolstered by a 
defensive line that averages 6-5 1/2 and 295 pounds, blew open holes and 
running back Carlos Snow blew right through them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were overruning them," Ryan said. "It was not that we were knocked off the 
ball. We were just too aggressive. We just slowed down. (Linebacker) Scott Ross 
told me, 'Dude, I'm not going to attack. I'm going to wait until they make 
their move, then attack. ' " 
</P>
<P>
The difference was startling. 
</P>
<P>
After collecting those 61 yards in the first drive, Ohio State wound up with a 
net gain of only 88 yards for the entire game against a USC rushing defense 
that entered the game second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Snow led the Buckeyes with 83 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing was to use our quickness," said linebacker Junior Seau, who had half 
his team's four sacks, "and not just put our heads down and hope we'd be in 
their backfield. We just had to attack the angles. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Snow is that he is a stocky player with big legs. He's strong 
enough to overpower arm tackles. You have to make sure you get the whole Snow 
or you're not going to get any at all." 
</P>
<P>
After the first quarter Saturday, Snow fell often. 
</P>
<P>
As did the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, after coaching the Trojans to losses in all six of his previous 
meetings with Midwestern teams, Smith had a winner. 
</P>
<P>
How did it feel? 
</P>
<P>
"Damn good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There will be other questions before this season is done, but for now, Larry 
Smith seems to have all the right answers. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC (2-1) began play ranked 12th, Ohio State (1-1) 25th. . . . The cumulative 
scores of the last two Trojan games: 108-13. . . . The last time these two 
teams met in the regular season, Ohio State won, 17-0, in Columbus, in 1964. . 
. . Five of the seven times these two teams met in the Rose Bowl, a national 
championship was on the line. USC won the national title in the 1972 and '74 
seasons after beating Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. The Buckeyes won in '54 and 
'68 after beating the Trojans on New Year's Day. In 1979, a USC Rose Bowl win 
cost Ohio State the national championship. . . . Between the two of them, these 
teams have won a dozen national championships, USC accounting for eight.

Former University of Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese died of cancer Saturday 
night, a week after being admitted to University Hospital. He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese died shortly before 9 p.m., MDT, hospital spokesman Brad Bawmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gersoff, the attending physician, told a news conference called less than 
two hours after Aunese's death: "He was a tremendous warrior and put up one of 
the greatest fights anyone could imagine. Unfortunately, the fight had to come 
to an end." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese's mother and several brothers and sisters were at his bedside shortly 
before death. Colorado football Coach Bill McCartney had visited Aunese earlier 
in the evening but was not there at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Aunese, who was from Oceanside, was awake and aware of what was 
happening, Gersoff said: 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, yes." 
</P>
<P>
Gersoff said Aunese's condition worsened dramatically Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a day-to-day thing," Gersoff said. "At any time he could have 
taken a turn for the worse." 
</P>
<P>
Gersoff said Aunese had progressive respiratory difficulty during the day and a 
buildup of lung fluids. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of his body was giving out," Gersoff said. "It was a struggle to breathe. 
After a time it became too much of a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, first diagnosed as having inoperable stomach and lung cancer in March, 
was brought to the hospital last Sunday after he began having trouble 
breathing. He had been an outpatient. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Aunese led the Buffaloes to an 8-3 season and set a school record 
by throwing 92 passes without an interception. He passed for 1,004 yards and 
two touchdowns, and rushed for 397 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services are scheduled on the university's Boulder campus at 1 p.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado President Gordon Gee and Chancellor Jim Corbridge praised Aunese's 
courage and extended sympathy to his family. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal Aunese was an inspiration to his teammates and indeed to all of us during 
his courageous fight against the toughest of his opponents," Gee said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal Aunese was a special young man who fought a brave battle. We are all very 
proud that he was one of our students," Corbridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado players had been wearing bands on each arm -- one armband bears 
Aunese's name, the other "No. 8," Aunese's jersey number.

JIM MURRAY: THEIR COACH ISN'T THE SAME, AND NEITHER ARE THE BUCKEYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Well,I'm certainly glad Woody Hayes wasn't around to see that! Woody would have 
been in the bunker demanding to know if Paris was burning. 
</P>
<P>
Well, no, but I sure would have hated to be the one to go down to the locker 
room and say brightly, "Well, Woody, how did it go?!" 
</P>
<P>
It went USC 42, Ohio State 3. You heard me. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we know what a Buckeye is. A land animal most often found on its own 
20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
If there's anything Woody Hayes hated worse than getting beat, it was getting 
beat by the forward pass. Woody thought the forward pass was responsible for 
most of the troubles of mankind, beginning with the Johnstown Flood, was worse 
for you than cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, in the Coliseum, Woody's team lost to USC by a mere 17-0. That 
was bad enough. But a USC tackle, the mastodonic Dan Ficca, whom Woody had 
tried to recruit, stood out in the hallway, jeering at Woody. Ficca was out of 
reach. So, Woody turned and slammed two sportswriters to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen on a coaching sideline, Wayne Woodrow Hayes was busy socking a 
Clemson football player who had the temerity to intercept an OSU pass. That was 
the way Woody came to terms with defeat. And that was by two points, 17-15, not 
39. 
</P>
<P>
It was some kind of ultimate irony that the forward pass should have terminated 
his career abruptly. Woody considered it a sissy tactic, anyway. Real men 
didn't throw passes. 
</P>
<P>
So, I went down to the Ohio State dressing room to see how the new coach was 
taking defeat by the forward pass (four touchdown throws by USC's Todd 
Marinovich). 
</P>
<P>
I listened at the wall, didn't hear any sounds of glass breaking, furniture 
splintering or helmets being battered by a fist. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, the coach, John Cooper, appeared. He looked around. "I'm relaxed," 
he confided. He even smiled. Smiled! The only time I ever saw Woody Hayes smile 
after a game was just after he beat SC in the Rose Bowl, 42-20. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out playing good football. Then, they took our confidence away with 
that big play. I mean, we had them third down-and-five almost on their own goal 
line and they complete an 87-yard touchdown pass." 
</P>
<P>
It was scarcely a Hayes-ian interview. Woody's losing-game interviews were 
shorter than Hollywood marriages. Cooper stayed as long as anyone still had a 
microphone to thrust in his face. He was generous. "We didn't have the ball 
much and when we did their defensive linemen were too fast for us." When 
someone wanted to know why, when his running attack started out so well, he 
went to the forward pass, Cooper cocked an eyebrow. "Did you happen to notice 
the score at the time?" he inquired. "21-3, as I recall it." 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly a Hayes-ian game. Ohio State, out of 59 plays, threw 30 passes. 
That would be a season for Woody Hayes. Maybe, two. 
</P>
<P>
The game started out with an overnight prediction the on-field temperatures 
might reach 100 but SC took the field expecting Snow, a lot of Snow. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Snow fell. Carlos Snow started the game like the second coming of 
Hopalong Cassady or Archie Griffin. The first three times he carried the ball, 
he went for seven, four and 25 yards. He made 70 yards in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Snow melted. The blizzard was over. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the game was the return of USC as the citadel of tailback, the 
student-body-right. 
</P>
<P>
He had a hard job convincing anybody he should be the successor to the guys who 
made SC Tailback U. but apparently Ricky Ervins has made it. 
</P>
<P>
The job that once belonged to the Mike Garretts, Ricky Bells, Marcus Allens, 
Anthony Davises and Charlie Whites and O.J. Simpson now belongs to a guy who 
spent three years trying to catch the coach's eye. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy for Ricky Ervins to get the football -- and you can see why. 
Unlike those other guys, Ricky doesn't look like something that fell off a 
trophy. Ricky weighs 200 pounds but it's so configurated, he looks like a 
bowling ball with arms. Defensive linemen have a terrible time with him because 
first they have to find him. You have a mental picture of these exasperated 
6-6, 280-pounders rummaging frantically around in the line of scrimmage saying 
"Wait a minute! He's in here some place! I just saw him!" 
</P>
<P>
Ricky is listed on the program at 5-8 but the consensus is, that's a 
prediction. Ricky may get there when he's full grown. Ricky's running style is 
based on a pinball he says. He just keeps bouncing off bumpers till he finds a 
hole. Then, he's gone. He doesn't need much of a one. He accelerates quicker 
than a guy who just heard a tombstone talk, or the cops coming. He tends to 
disappear in pileups -- and come out the other side running like a guy who just 
stole a pie. 
</P>
<P>
But he's had a terrible time persuading football coaches to give him the 
football. They tend to think he just wandered over from the Glee Club. They 
prefer guys with a bigger strike zone for some unfathomable reason. Ricky 
rolled up 2,209 total yards and 25 touchdowns in high school but college 
football coaches looked at him and wondered, "Have you ever thought of 
defensive back, kid?" 
</P>
<P>
Ricky thought of it but wondered privately why someone who could run 4.3 in the 
40 should have to spend his career running backwards. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he got to SC, they kept giving the ball to people like Ryan Knight, 
Steven Webster, Scott Lockwood and Aaron Emmanuel. Ervins was their caddy, the 
guy who went in when they got hurt or needed a breather. 
</P>
<P>
The caddy took over the tee Saturday. Ricky Ervins got the ball 21 times and 
ran up 120 yards through, around and under the Ohio State defense. The game was 
won by the four touchdown bombs thrown by Marinovich but it was saved by the 
fact the ball was kept out of enemy hands by a little round man who may not 
look like an SC tailback. Until you remember Mike Garrett and Anthony Davis did 
not exactly put anybody in mind of John Wayne either. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story is, you don't have to be big to be SC tailback. Just 
good. They don't measure your height, just your length -- and Saturday's 120 
yards made Ricky stand mighty tall. Big enough so Woody might have wanted to 
hit him.

DENVER IS COMING OFF A BIG VICTORY OVER TOUGH BILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you were sure the American Football Conference West (Worst? Wurst?) 
was worse still, when 8-8 seemed certain to win the division title going away, 
a powerhouse has emerged and it's the . . . 
</P>
<P>
Denver Broncos? 
</P>
<P>
The team that hadn't won a non-strike game on artificial turf since 1986? That 
was humiliated in seven straight national TV games, including Super Bowl XXII's 
42-10 rout by the Washington Redskins? 
</P>
<P>
Not the namby-pambies who used to play that cute, bend-but-don't-break defense 
and got bent over double last season, finishing No. 25 against the run? 
</P>
<P>
Who had that little toy offensive line, who ran the ball just enough to let 
John Elway catch his breath and were No. 19 in rushing yardage? 
</P>
<P>
Who needed 17 points off turnovers to get past the Kansas City Chiefs in their 
home opener? 
</P>
<P>
Who didn't have more than six players who would be able to start if they played 
for the Buffalo Bills, according to ABC's Dan Dierdorf? 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not exactly that team. It's the new Broncos, the team that arose last 
Monday night in Buffalo, on artificial turf, and smote their hosts, 28-14, 
out-rushing the Bills (Remember them? Great defense? Rock-ribbed running 
game?), 201 yards to 94. 
</P>
<P>
Several explanations are possible: 
</P>
<P>
It was a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were too busy yawning and watching Bruce Smith's airplane imitations 
to crank it up. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are vastly improved. 
</P>
<P>
If it's the last, then the rest of the division is in trouble, starting with 
the Raiders, who are already in trouble and are here today too. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos fired their old genius, defensive coordinator Joe Collier and 
brought in Wade Phillips, Bum's son and Buddy Ryan's top lieutenant in 
Philadelphia, where he studied the art of the human-wave assault as applied to 
football. They also found a top line coach -- former Raider Earl Leggett, the 
father of the Howie Long-Sean Jones-Bill Pickel-Greg Townsend nucleus, who 
finally tired of having directions phoned down from you-know-whom. 
</P>
<P>
They drafted a 6-foot-3, 217-pound free safety, Steve Atwater, to go with 
all-pro Dennis Smith and set both of them near the line. They stopped stunting 
every which way and just told everyone to go play. Surprise, it's working. 
</P>
<P>
They phased in bigger offensive linemen, like 305-pound Gerald Perry, and added 
two backs: 232-pound Jeff Alexander and Bobby Humphrey, the almost-Heisman 
Trophy candidate from Alabama, whose foot fractures looked enough like Keith 
Byars' to persuade 16 teams to pass on him in the supplemental draft. Alexander 
is an ace blocker and a respectable runner and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey? He just appears to be the best runner the franchise has had since 
Otis Armstrong. At Buffalo, he had 76 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, two games do not a powerhouse make, so here come the Raiders and 
Week 3. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not a good time for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Their promising offense will likely be without center Don Mosebar and right 
guard Steve Wisniewski. Fullback Steve Smith has sore ribs and Marcus Allen 
already has a sprained ankle serious enough to get him on the injury report, 
although, as always, he will play. 
</P>
<P>
Given a running game, the Raiders have been something, even without Tim Brown. 
Steve Beuerlein and Jay Schroeder currently have quarterback rankings of 128.2 
and 126.9, respectively, which would put them 1-2 in all of football if they'd 
thrown enough passes to be listed. 
</P>
<P>
But then there's that defense. 
</P>
<P>
It got smoked for 178 yards rushing per exhibition and then, to prove that was 
no fluke, mirage or bad dream, gave up 161.5 in two real games. Last week, the 
Raiders fell to a shaky Chief team with few attributes other than big linemen, 
a 255-pound running back and a desire to run straight ahead and mash people. 
</P>
<P>
That inspired last week's open call for linebackers, wherein many were tried 
and 34-year-old Linden King, last year's starter who was waived in the first 
cut, was un-retired and re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
A Raider official privately 
</P>
<P>
acknowledges some miscalculations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cutting Matt Millen. They didn't figure on Jerry Robinson's groin pull 
lasting six weeks, but it has and Robinson says it's as bad now as it was in 
the beginning. Jackie Shipp has been tried, found wanting, and behind him, the 
cupboard is bare. Twice-waived Rickey Hunley was auditioned last week but told 
to keep traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finding an outside linebacker. They hoped it would be Otis Wilson, but his 
knee wasn't ready. They hoped it would be Emanuel King, but Linden King's 
resurrection suggests their hopes are fading there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever the linebackers are, it will make no difference if the line can't push 
back. Nose tackle Bob Golic is said to be doing fine and Bill Pickel to be 
holding his own, but Greg Townsend's switch to rushing linebacker is going 
badly. Scott Davis returns today but Howie Long limps to the bench in his 
place. The Raiders need both their ends, but will have to make do and hope for 
more upsets. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are six-point favorites. . . . John Elway's great scramble at 
Buffalo obscures the fact that he's off to another slow start -- two scoring 
passes, four interceptions, the second-worst quarterback rating in the AFC. The 
short passing game is off and there are problems with the receivers running the 
right routes, and Elway, still throws bullets when softer passes would be 
better. Last week, Vance Johnson bemoaned his declining relationship with 
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
On the Raiders' last appearance in Denver, they came from 24-0 behind on a 
Monday night and won, 27-24, a rally that ties for third biggest in league 
history. The Broncos haven't gotten over it. "Everybody who was on the team 
remembers that game," Elway said. . . . New cornerback Tyrone Braxton has two 
interceptions and a touchdown, but is considered a gambler who can be burned. 
Steve Atwater is a better tackler than pass defender, so with two new 
cornerbacks and a rookie safety, the Bronco secondary could have problems. . . 
. The Broncos placed wide receiver Ricky Nattiel on injured reserve because of 
a broken kneecap, sidelining him for at least six weeks.

SCHIRALDI IS SORE, BUT DODGERS ARE ONES LEFT ACHING, 7-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The game's start was only 45 minutes away. The Dodgers were in the clubhouse. 
The Padres were taking their last cuts in batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
But scheduled Padre starter Calvin Schiraldi was lying on the trainer's table 
with a pained expression, and Padre trainer Dick Dent working furiously on his 
right forearm, which was strained. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow starter Dennis Rasmussen was stationed in the bullpen. Middle relievers 
Greg Harris and Mark Grant were told not to stray far from the bullpen phone. 
Mark Davis was forewarned that he could be called upon for one of the longest 
save situations of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I felt," said Schiraldi, who lasted two innings in his last start 
because of a strained forearm, "they had to be ready for anything. I mean, I 
was hurting." 
</P>
<P>
It was no secret to the Dodgers, who lost anyway, 7-1, before 24,338 at Dodger 
Stadium Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They saw how Schiraldi had to abandon his windup, pitching from the stretch. 
They watched Schiraldi's fastball float across the plate. They even observed 
Schiraldi receiving rubdowns with anti-inflammatory cream on his aching forearm 
during each half-inning. 
</P>
<P>
If it was not an indignity enough to get only two hits in five innings off 
Schiraldi, the Dodgers also suffered the embarrassment of giving up Schiraldi's 
first home run since 1980, when he played for Westlake High School in Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we wanted to get Schiraldi out of there earlier but we wanted to leave 
him in there to hit," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, it's just incredible to what's happening to this team. We're tickled 
to death by everything we're seeing out there." 
</P>
<P>
Well, everything except the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants won again Saturday against Houston, retaining their 
five-game lead over the Padres with seven to play. 
</P>
<P>
Winning 25 of their past 32 games might be their finest streak in the 21-year 
history of the franchise, and the Padres' 85-70 record guarantees them of their 
second-best record in history. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality of the situation is that the Giants' magic number is only 
three. The Padres must win their remaining games, and hope that the Giants lose 
twice before they come into San Diego Friday for a three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight straight for an extra date," Davis kept saying over and over in the 
Padre clubhouse before the game. 
</P>
<P>
And now that there are seven games left? 
</P>
<P>
"Give me time, I've got to think of something that rhymes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the chore should have been left to Schiraldi. He practically did 
everything else Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was just awesome," said Harris, who gave up only one hit in the final 
four innings after inheriting a 7-1 lead from Schiraldi. "I mean, I didn't even 
know he'd be able to pitch today. We were told to be ready for anything, and 
then he comes in and does that." 
</P>
<P>
Schiraldi, who is 3-0 in four starts since being traded Aug. 30 from the 
Chicago Cubs to the Padres, appeared to be in for a brief outing based on his 
first-inning performance. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the game by striking out Alfredo Griffin and Lenny Harris, but then 
walked Mike Davis, Eddie Murray and Jeff Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson strolled to the mound, and asked if Schiraldi's 
arm was bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I actually feel all right," Schiraldi said. "I'm just pitching lousy." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson told him to keep the ball on the outside part of the plate then, and 
prevent one swing from producing four runs. He threw one pitch. Mike Scioscia 
hit a lazy fly to center. And after 30 grueling pitches, Schiraldi's first 
inning was over. 
</P>
<P>
The rest was a breeze. The Dodgers couldn't touch him. The only problem was 
that the Padres weren't doing anything against Fernando Valenzuela either. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, catcher Benito Santiago got only the second Padre hit of 
the game. Carmelo Martinez, who had gotten the first hit -- his first since 
Aug. 23 -- walked. But after Darrin Jackson struck out, the Padres had two outs 
and Schiraldi striding toward the plate. 
</P>
<P>
This is a guy who had not hit safely all season. He had a lifetime batting 
average of .081, and none of his seven hits were homers. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who walked six, fell behind, 2-and-1, to Schiraldi. He said he then 
told himself, "Hey, it's Schiraldi. Don't try to be cute." 
</P>
<P>
His next pitch was a fastball over the heart of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
It landed about six rows into the left-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in the words of Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda, "the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Schiraldi shut down the Dodgers in their half of the fourth, watched his 
teammates score four more runs in the fifth, as he contributed a walk, and with 
a 7-0 lead, made his only mistake of the game in the fifth by yielding rookie 
Darrin Fletcher's first home run. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very special day for me," Schiraldi said. "Not so much that I pitched 
and I won. Or that I pitched with the injury. What made it special was the 
homer." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Tony Gwynn: "I don't know who was surprised more. The Dodgers or 
us. When he hit that homer, we were going absolutely crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst, who surrendered his first home run in 64 innings 
Friday to Jose Gonzalez in the fifth inning of the Dodgers' 2-1 victory, 
happened to be walking by a TV Saturday when it was shown again on highlights. 
Hurst kneeled in front of the TV, watched his delivery, and screamed out: 
"Don't do it. Don't do it. Gosh, he threw it again." . . . The Padres and 
Dodgers are scheduled to open the 1990 season Monday, April 2, with a four-game 
series at Dodger Stadium. It will be the first time since 1986 that the Dodgers 
have played their season-opener against the Padres. . . . Dodger outfielder 
Mike Marshall's back is out again, and his status is questionable for the final 
10 games. He has missed three consecutive games, and 50 this season. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Today is Fan Appreciation Day at Dodgers Stadium, and the game is sold 
out. Orel Hershiser (14-14) and Andy Benes (5-2) are the scheduled pitchers for 
the 1:05 p.m. start. . . . Dodger right fielder Mike Davis, who underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his knees, started Saturday for the first time since 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago, when given the chance to throw, has thrown out 
each of the five Dodger baserunners who have attempted to steal off him this 
season. . . . The Giants have shuffled their pitching rotation for the 
three-game series beginning Monday at Dodger Stadium. Don Robinson (12-10), who

NATIONAL LEAGUE EAST ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ONE THING YOU CAN COUNT ON: CUBS WILL ACCEPT VICTORY IN ANY FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs will take a victory any way they can get it. If the umpires 
make a mistake, they will take it. 
</P>
<P>
They would like to clinch the National League East before they finish the 
season with three games in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
A throwing error by Pittsburgh second baseman Jose Lind gave the Cubs an 
opportunity to break a tie in the ninth inning Saturday at Chicago, and they 
made the most of it for a 3-2 win that reduced their magic number to four. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jim Leyland of the Pirates protested the game because of a 
controversial call in the sixth inning. The lapse did not result in a Cub run. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Smith opened the inning with a walk. Smith stole second base on a low 
pitch that Mark Grace appeared to swing at. Plate umpire Eric Gregg called it a 
ball, putting the count at 2 and 1. Grace walked, but Randy Kramer retired the 
next three batters. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me my appeal was too late since another pitch had been made," 
Leyland said. "I told them to get it right and not penalize me." 
</P>
<P>
Grace acknowledged that he swung at the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth against Doug Bair, Curtis Wilkerson reached first base on Lind's 
error and was sacrificed to second by Domingo Ramos. Mitch Webster grounded a 
single to right field, and it wasn't even close at the plate as Wilkerson 
scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs have a four-game lead over the Cardinals with seven remaining. If they 
beat the Pirates today and sweep three games next week in Montreal, they would 
have the title wrapped up before they get to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Webster has not played much since going into a slump, and Zimmer started 
platooning Smith and Lloyd McLendon in left field. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you feel like the forgotten man when you go without playing," 
Webster said. "It's natural to feel that way. There are times you get low, but 
I never felt I couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to use the guys who are doing well. If I were the manager, I'd do the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
The game at Wrigley Field was played in a brisk wind. The temperature at game 
time was 50 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The wind helped the Pirates take a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Jay Bell 
singled and Jeff King doubled for one run. With two out, Gary Redus hit a long 
drive to center. Marvell Wynne went back on the ball, but a sudden gust held 
the ball up and it fell in front of Wynne, bouncing away for a triple. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 5 -- The Cardinals seem intent on forcing the Cubs 
to win the East on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Former Cub Frank DiPino came to the rescue of Cris Carpenter with two on and 
two out in the fifth inning at St. Louis and improved to 9-0 with 2 1/3 
scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals wrapped up their second consecutive victory over the last-place 
Phillies with seven hits in the third inning, scoring seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who began the string, fell one out short of getting the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Thompson hit a three-run double to cap the inning, and Pedro Guerrero, who 
singled in a run in the second, doubled in two more in the sixth. Guerrero has 
driven in 114 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dead, but we're still in intensive care," Cardinal Manager Whitey 
Herzog said. Guerrero has made a believer out of Phillie Manager Nick Leyva. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get Guerrero (out)," he said. "He's adjusted his game to this park 
and he's a smart hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero had the explanation. "I always said I wanted to play for Whitey and 
now that I am, I have to produce." 
</P>
<P>
Dickie Thon hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning for the Phillies. His 
14 home runs are the most in the league for a shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
New York 13, Montreal 6 -- While the Mets, with catcher Gary Carter driving in 
five runs in New York, kept their slim hopes alive, the Expos were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, heavy preseason favorites to win the division title, are 5 1/2 games 
behind the Cubs. They have eight games left, but none with the two teams ahead 
of them, the Cubs and the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who had to come back from a 4-1 deficit after Hubie Brooks hit a 
grand slam in the third inning, got 15 hits. Carter had three of them, 
including two doubles. He hit a two-run single in the fourth, when the Mets 
scored six unearned runs to chase Mark Langston (12-8). Frank Viola (4-5) was 
the winner despite giving up eight hits and six runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really disappointed about being eliminated, because I expected it," 
Manager Bob Rodgers of the Expos said. "Today, I was more like a ringmaster. It 
was a circus." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' chances aren't too good, either. They will be eliminated by any 
combination of New York defeats and Cub victories totaling three. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest day of the season for Carter, who spent much of the season 
on the disabled list. Since becoming healthy, he has complained about playing 
time. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BEHIND REUSCHEL, GIANTS PUT DAMPER ON HOPES OF SCOTT AND ASTROS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This was the game in which Mike Scott was supposed to clinch the Cy Young Award 
and keep the Houston Astros' slim pennant hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott (20-10) was outpitched by 40-year-old Rick Reuschel (17-7) Saturday 
in San Francisco, and the Giants moved a step closer to the title in the 
National League West with a 3-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The win kept the Giants five games in front of the San Diego Padres and reduced 
their magic number to three. Houston fell seven games back. Another defeat or a 
Giant victory eliminates the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 1-1 in the sixth when Matt Williams, who went into the game in a 
with a 10-for-72 slump, followed a single by Ken Oberkfell with his 17th home 
run of the season. Oberkfell was playing first base in place of Will Clark, 
still recovering from his recent collision with Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia. 
Oberkfell drove in the first Giant run with a sacrifice fly in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had played in 391 consecutive games, might be available to pinch-hit 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, who had not won since Sept. 2, gave up seven hits and lost his 
shutout when Scott hit a home run, his second -- and first since July 31, 1985. 
It was Reuschel's second complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In his three previous starts, Reuschel had two no-decisions and a loss. 
</P>
<P>
But in this game, except for the pitch to Scott, he was in complete charge. He 
walked only two and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
In six innings, Scott gave up six hits, walked three and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
"It would definitely be tough to beat the Giants now," Manager Art Howe of the 
Astros said. "I should tip my hat to them. It shows a lot of character to win 
games like they have lately." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Roger Craig of the Giants said that he nearly benched Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt has a chance to run into one every time," Craig said. "And he ran into 
that one real good. I almost didn't start him against a tough right-hander, but 
then I decided I wanted my best defense out there." 
</P>
<P>
Usually when Scott faces the Giants, Craig points out the scuffed baseballs. 
But after this game, Scott praised the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants have really hung in there," he said. "The Padres can't play much 
better than they have, but the Giants have held everyone off. They don't have 
to do much to win it now." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 41,221 increased the Giants' home attendance to 2,008,958, the 
first time the club has drawn 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 11, Atlanta 5 -- The Reds battled back at Atlanta after the Braves 
rocked Tom Browning for five runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Paul O'Neill drove in four runs, and pinch-hitter Barry Larkin singled home the 
tiebreaking run in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Although he pitched only one inning of relief, Norm Charlton (7-3) was the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Lemke hit a home run in the second for Atlanta, and Ron Gant's homer in 
the third put the Braves in front. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds announced that Rob Dibble, their hard-throwing relief pitcher who 
seems to thrive on controversy, has been suspended indefinitely for 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Dibble was suspended earlier by the league for throwing a bat against a 
backstop screen. DAN HAFNER

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
IOWA WINS WITH NEW QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sophomore Matt Rodgers, son of Boston Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers, passed for 
276 yards and three touchdowns in his first game as the Hawkeye starter 
Saturday, leading Iowa to a 31-21 victory over Iowa State in Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 21-14, at halftime, Iowa tied the score when freshman defensive 
end Larry Blue recovered an Iowa State fumble in the end zone in the third 
quarter and got the go-ahead touchdown on Rodgers' 10-yard pass to John Palmer 
on the second play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers also threw touchdown passes of 37 yards to Danan Hughes and 40 yards to 
Travis Watkins in the first half as Iowa (1-1) beat Iowa State (1-2) for the 
seventh consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
The holder for placekicks last year, Rodgers completed 20 of 33 passes and was 
intercepted once. He started in place of senior Tom Poholsky, who lost the job 
after Iowa's 44-6 loss to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' dad was in the stands for the game. But that didn't bother the young 
quarterback. "I didn't feel any pressure at all. I'm used to him watching," 
Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 41, Utah State 2 -- Apparently recovered from the embarrassment 
suffered last week at Colorado, the Illini made the most of their home-field 
advantage and beat the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff George threw two touchdown passes, and the Illini defense held Utah State 
to 24 offensive yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
George hit Dan Donovan with a two-yard touchdown pass early in the second 
quarter, and two minutes later lofted a 27-yard scoring pass to Mike Bellamy. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois led, 31-0, at halftime and coasted to victory before 61,553. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois' leading rusher this season, Howard Griffith, suffered a knee injury 
late in the first half and did not play in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
George completed 12 of 18 passes for 180 yards. Ken Thomas was the leading 
rusher with seven carries for 77 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers 38, Northwestern 27 -- Scott Erney completed scoring passes of 90 and 
83 yards to Randy Jackson and ran for another touchdown at Evanston, Ill., to 
give the Scarlet Knights a victory in their 1,000th intercollegiate football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Erney's two scoring passes made him Rutgers' all-time leader with 30 touchdown 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats (0-3) had taken a 27-26 lead on Bob Christian's second touchdown, 
a two-yard run in the third quarter. Christian had a career-high 161 yards 
rushing.

BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP;

<P>
NEBRASKA BURIES MINNESOTA, 48-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Clark ran 18 times for 100 yards and two touchdowns Saturday night as No. 3 
Nebraska avoided a slow start for the first time this season and beat 
Minnesota, 48-0, at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has rushed for 398 yards in three games and has 2,239 career yards, 
moving him from 11th to seventh on the Nebraska list. No. 6 is Jeff Kinney with 
2,244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Thompson, Minnesota's all-time rusher with 3,530 yards, was held to 45 
yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Although Minnesota (1-1) leads the series 29-19-2, the Cornhuskers (3-0) have 
won the last 13 contests since 1960, including an 84-13 victory in 1983 in 
their only other visit to the Metrodome. In their last nine meetings, the 
Cornhuskers have outscored Minnesota, 433-58. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Gophers' worst loss since Oklahoma beat them, 63-0, in the second 
game of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers were tied, 17-17, at halftime in their opener before beating 
Northern Illinois, 48-17, and they trailed Utah, 13-7, before winning, 42-30, 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gophers had no such success, gaining just 52 yards in the first half, 
including minus-two passing. 
</P>
<P>
After Brent Herbel's 33-yard punt in the second quarter, Nebraska took over at 
the Minnesota 37 and scored five plays later on a 26-yard pass from Gerry 
Gdowski to Richard Bell with 3:50 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Gdowski completed 10 of 15 passes for 180 yards. Bell caught five passes for 
121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Drennan made a 42-yard field goal and Leodis Flowers scored on a one-yard 
dive to give Nebraska a 34-0 lead after three quarters. Flowers added a 37-yard 
touchdown run in the fourth and Mark Dowse added a seven-yard scoring run in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech 31, Oklahoma St. 15 -- Quarterback Jamie Gill came off the bench to 
direct three second-half scoring drives, and backup tailback Anthony Lynn 
rushed for 97 yards and two touchdowns as the Red Raiders won at Stillwater, 
Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Second-string quarterback Jason Rattan started in place of Gill and led the Red 
Raiders (3-0) to a 10-9 halftime lead. But Gill, who had injured his hip last 
week, led three drives that buried the Cowboys. Gill wound up completing six of 
seven passes for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State (0-3) forced four Red Raider turnovers but couldn't take 
advantage, settling for two of Cary Blanchard's three field goals. Quarterback 
Mike Gundy also scored on a one-yard run when the game was out of reach.

Quarterback Dee Dowis rushed for 82 yards and two touchdowns in the first half 
as Air Force raced to a 26-point lead and coasted to a 43-26 Western Athletic 
Conference victory over Texas El Paso Saturday at the Air Force Academy in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force, 4-0 overall and 3-0 in the conference, proved vulnerable to the pass 
in the second half. UTEP's Howard Gasser threw for three scores, but he also 
was sacked nine times. 
</P>
<P>
The Miners, dropping to 1-3 overall and 0-1 in the WAC, went almost exclusively 
to the air during the second half, running the ball only three times in a 
desperation bid that fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Gasser's 47-yard heave to Ricki Lopez drew the Miners within 36-26 with 4:55 
left, but Dowis then directed a time-consuming drive that culminated in Greg 
Johnson's six-yard score with 27 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis, who went into the game as the nation's second-leading rusher with a 
per-game average of 163 yards, finished with 92 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State 35, Eastern Michigan 35 -- Hector Murillo scored on a one-yard 
run and Tim Henneghan's conversion kick was good as the Hurons fought back for 
a tie at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurons thought they won the game on a touchback after a fumbled 
interception in the end zone in the last three seconds, but referees ruled that 
the Rams did not attempt to advance the ball and the touchback was denied. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams went ahead in the fourth quarter on a touchdown by Tony Alford, 35-28, 
but Murillo's run tied it. 
</P>
<P>
A 41-yard field goal attempt by the Rams' Mike Brown failed. The Hurons took 
possession, and a pass by the Hurons was intercepted in the end zone by Kevin 
Nettles, who dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State is 1-2-1; Eastern Michigan is 3-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa 35, New Mexico 33 -- Fullback Brett Adams rushed for 128 yards and three 
touchdowns to lead the Golden Hurricane to victory at Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos had a chance to win the game with five seconds left, but David 
Margolis' 44-yard field goal attempt with a 20-m.p.h. wind behind him hit the 
left upright and bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa is 3-1. New Mexico is 1-3.

FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES RENEW MARINOVICH'S CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, his emotions seemed as tightly wrapped as his sprained left wrist. 
No way USC quarterback Todd Marinovich would show even a trace of vulnerability 
in such a stressful situation, even if it was perhaps the biggest test of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
No, after spraining his wrist early in the second quarter and watching 
replacement Shane Foley immediately lead the Trojans to their first touchdown 
against Ohio State Saturday, Marinovich strode confidently onto the field a few 
minutes later for the next possession. Who knows, it could have been his last 
as the starter if the redshirt freshman failed to impress. To that point, it 
had not been a good day for Marinovich. Before Buckeye linebacker Tom Lease's 
hit temporarily knocked him out with a sprain to his left (throwing) wrist, 
Marinovich had completed only two of six passes for 11 yards and thrown an 
interception. The Coliseum crowd of 69,876 cheered Foley, before and after his 
three-yard touchdown pass to Scott Galbraith, and was conspicuously quiet upon 
Marinovich's return. 
</P>
<P>
But on his third play back, from the Trojans' 13, Marinovich unleashed a pass 
that wide receiver John Jackson caught near midfield. Jackson then sprinted for 
an 87-yard touchdown and a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was it the longest pass play in USC history, but it propelled the 
Trojans to an eventual 42-3 victory. Not only that, but it also may have 
established Marinovich as the Trojans' primary offensive threat, augmented by 
tailback Ricky Ervins' running. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Foley replaced Marinovich a second time late in the fourth quarter, 
it was Ohio State that was hurting. Marinovich exploited the Buckeyes' young 
defense, completing 14 of 22 passes for 246 yards and four touchdowns. In 
addition to Jackson's long-distance connection, Marinovich threw an 11-yard 
scoring pass to tight end Galbraith and touchdown passes of 19 and 17 yards to 
flanker Gary Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich said he never doubted he was capable of such a performance and never 
feared that Foley might take his spot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think about it that way," Marinovich said. "I just wanted to get back 
in the game. I wanted to get it taped up and get back in because I knew we were 
capable of making big plays. The wrist feels pretty good, but I think it'll 
hurt in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
An injury to his throwing wrist was the last thing Marinovich needed in his 
second nationally televised game since replacing injured Pat O'Hara a week 
before the season opener against Illinois. In last week's lopsided victory over 
Utah State, Marinovich threw for 92 yards and two touchdowns. It was not until 
this week, however, that Marinovich faced his second real challenge, against 
another Big Ten team on national television. 
</P>
<P>
The results this time were much different. Whereas Marinovich seemed hesitant 
to throw long and take chances, he liberated his left arm in the second and 
third quarters against the Buckeyes (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Marinovich allowed himself a few moments of satisfaction before 
considering next week's Pacific 10 Conference opener at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to have a good game passing the ball," Marinovich said. "Now, the 
pressure is off. I thought I made some right decisions (against Illinois), that 
I threw the ball well that game. It was just a matter of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
He did it against the Buckeyes. Not without help, of course. Ervins' running, 
especially taking pitches on the option, helped loosen Ohio State's defense for 
the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to throw a lot and dominate the passing game," Marinovich said. "The 
run opened things up and made that easy. It's easy to feel relaxed and 
confident when your offensive line gives you so much time. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of times, I just had to decide who to throw the ball to, because we 
had a couple of guys open. That's a good problem to have." 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith stopped short of saying Marinovich's apprenticeship is 
over. But he liked what he saw Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Todd was executing," Smith siad. "He wasn't just dunking and dinking. 
He was going for the jugular. He's come a long way since a month ago." 
</P>
<P>
That was obvious from his touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
The 87-yarder to Jackson was not a perfect pass -- Jackson had to put it in 
neutral near midfield and await the ball's arrival -- but Marinovich made the 
big play. 
</P>
<P>
If he appeared calm before making the pass, Marinovich was ecstatic afterward. 
After releasing the ball, Marinovich found himself face down on the turf. By 
the time he reached his feet, Jackson had scored. That was all Marinovich 
needed to see. Arms outstretched, he jumped in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"That (pass) got me going," Marinovich said. "When you make big plays, it 
relaxes you." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich's most impressive sequence came midway through the third quarter, 
when he completed a third-down pass to Jackson for 21 yards. Two plays later, 
he hit Wellman on the right sideline for 38 yards and capped it with a 19-yard 
touchdown pass to Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, the senior split end who moved into third place on the Trojans' 
all-time reception list on Saturday, said Marinovich simply is starting to show 
the ability that his teammates have known all along he has. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a different quarterback (from three weeks ago), it's just that his 
confidence level is rising," Jackson said. "He's becoming a complete 
quarterback. I was happy with his performance in the first game. But I was real 
happy today."

Andre Ware threw for a school-record 497 yards and two touchdowns while Chuck 
Weatherspoon scored on a 32-yard run and a 58-yard punt return as No. 17 
Houston overcame a rash of miscues to beat Arizona State, 36-7, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (2-0), idle since beating Nevada Las Vegas, 69-0, in their 
season-opener Sept. 2, overcame seven turnovers, a school-record 23 penalties 
and 236 yards in penalties to defeat the Sun Devils (2-1) for the first time 
here since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, with its run-and-shoot offense, rolled up 414 of its 744 yards in 
total offense by halftime and led, 19-7, as it ended a five-game losing streak 
against Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
The total yardage by the Cougars set a Southwest Conference record and was the 
most allowed by Arizona State in its 91-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
Ware, a junior, completed 24 of 41 passes for 310 yards in the first half and 
finished 40 of 68 with four interceptions. His attempts and completions also 
set school records. 
</P>
<P>
Houston lost three fumbles, had a punt blocked and missed both an extra point 
and a 31-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ware had a two-point conversion pass batted away and was intercepted at the 
Arizona five-yard line, one-yard line and twice in the Sun Devil end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State had five turnovers -- all on interceptions -- and was held to 
just 145 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon, who rushed for 122 yards in 10 carries, also scored on a punt 
return with 12:07 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Lasher, a redshirt freshman making his first start, completed only seven 
of 20 passes for 90 yards with three interceptions. He was forced into the 
lineup because junior starter Paul Justin missed the game with a sprained left 
shoulder.

Fullback Darin Brightmon rushed for 183 yards and two touchdowns, including the 
longest run in Nevada Las Vegas history, to lead the Rebels to a 26-14 victory 
over New Mexico State Saturday in the Big West Conference opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Brightmon, who had 11 carries, gave UNLV a 20-7 lead on a school-record 89-yard 
run with 12:42 to play. His 22-yard touchdown run and catch of a conversion 
pass from Derek Stott had given the Rebels a 14-7 lead at the end of the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (2-1) lost starting running back Tommy Jackson with a sprained knee 
ligament in the first quarter and starting quarterback Charles Price with a 
sprained finger on his right hand late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State (0-4) has lost 21 consecutive conference games dating back to 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Eastman, subbing for Jackson, scored on a six-yard run with 2:13 left in 
the first half to give UNLV a 6-0 lead. Luis Solario missed the extra-point 
attempt. Eastman finished with 125 yards in 23 carries.

Trainer Charlie Whittingham leads Sunday Silence back to the races today in the 
$1-million Super Derby, intent on ending Easy Goer's unopposed dash to the 
horse-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
"The only chance we have to get horse of the year would be win this race and 
the Breeders' Cup," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who lost two straight after beating Easy Goer in the Kentucky 
Derby and Preakness, is expected to be an odds-on favorite in the field of 
eight for the Super Derby over 1 1/4 miles at Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, 
La. 
</P>
<P>
The second favorite is expected to be another Phipps colt, Awe Inspiring. Also 
in the field will be Le Voyageur, Big Earl, Dale's Shotgun, Bruho and Harmony 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, winner of 10 consecutive stakes for 3-year-olds, will race against 
older horses for the first time in the Ruffian Handicap over 1 1/8 miles today 
at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The field of six will include two 5-year-old mares, Bayakoa and Miss Brio. 
Bayakoa has won four Grade I stakes this year; Miss Brio won the Maskette on 
Sept. 9 at Belmont and has beaten Bayakoa twice. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Yankee Affair swung wide to gain the lead after entering the stretch 
and won the $470,400 Man O'War Stakes for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont. Yankee 
Affair returned $8.20, $4.60 and $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
One Drink came from far back and then drew away to win the $53,300 Derby Trial 
Stakes for 3-olds by 3 3/4 lengths at Fairplex Park in Pomona. One Drink 
covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:43. 
</P>

CLASH OVER SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL DIVIDES SAN DIEGO EDUCATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A philosophical clash over how best to prepare students for the Soviet arts 
festival -- a clash deepened by personal friction between two educators -- has 
resulted in competing "official" curriculum guides for San Diego County 
teachers as part of the ballyhooed event beginning in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
The county Office of Education, which helps plan curriculum for area school 
districts, has issued the 109-page Soviet Arts Curriculum Guide, which its 
fine-arts administrator calls the "official" pamphlet because her office has 
responsibility for such education countywide. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairwoman of the education committee of the city-sponsored "San Diego 
Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet Union," the group planning the 
exhibitions, says her two guides are the "official" documents because they have 
the imprimatur of the mayor and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although some people caught in the middle of the spat say teachers will not 
find the guides all that different in substance, the main editors of each 
firmly defend their own approaches as the correct way of tying schools to the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multicultural Ties 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ugly dispute," lamented Ann Heidt, the education office's arts 
coordinator. Nevertheless, she defended her work as "best" because it attempts 
to teach art from Soviet cultures, using general concepts taught by teachers in 
math, literature, art and history, and to emphasize multicultural ties. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Flemion, a history professor at San Diego State University and 
chairwoman of the city's festival education committee, retorted: "All I can 
tell you is that the 
</P>
<P>
materials the county produced were too narrowly focused and she (Heidt) 
wouldn't change, so (the city committee) went ahead to implement our concept of 
having a balanced presentation in literature and social sciences as well as 
arts." 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, teachers and students will get the enrichment intended no matter 
which one is used," said Kay Wagner, arts coordinator for San Diego city 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said her office "is caught in the middle," even though her staff 
produced much of the material for both guides. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the two sides are even holding separate workshops to promote 
their guides to teachers who want to prepare their students for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
The flap has its origins in events almost nine months ago, when Flemion's 
committee began planning a specialized curriculum for the county's 350,000 
students in kindergarten through 12th grade, using the funds donated to it for 
education-related purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee opted to tap the resources of Wagner's office at the San Diego 
Unified School District. Wagner, a member of Flemion's committee, made 
available one, and then a second, resource teacher to help develop materials, 
which include the guides as well as books, maps and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a real demand on the time of my people," said Wagner, whose small 
staff must also cope with an increased workload this year given the expanded 
"Arts in Education" program, which this year places an artist in every one of 
the city's 109 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Heidt -- a bit miffed that she had not been asked to serve on 
the festival education committee -- began writing her own curriculum, using 
contributions and research from many art and cultural experts. 
</P>
<P>
In late spring, Wagner decided that the best results would come from merging 
the efforts, and she arranged for Heidt to sit down with the city curriculum 
specialists to produce a single guide. Flemion was in the Soviet Union at the 
time, obtaining materials for 20 "treasure chests," traveling collections of 
Soviet arts and crafts that will move from school to school. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Flemion returned and saw the guide results, she objected. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that the materials were presenting only one area, the arts, and did not 
include literature and social sciences," Flemion said. So she rewrote parts of 
the guide to reflect her own concepts and to focus more closely on the festival 
itself. In addition, she wanted two guides -- one for elementary students and 
one for secondary students -- to make it easier for teachers to apply the 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a shock to me that the city wanted to spend more money and 
write something separate," Heidt said. "Our guide does focus on arts, but this 
is an arts festival, not a social sciences festival. . . . But we use the arts 
to go into all other curriculum areas and to show that Soviet arts can be used 
to teach about our area's own ethnic and cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"Their concept has nothing about (state) curriculum frameworks and nothing 
about multicultural approaches." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, of the city schools district, said the competing guides actually will 
have many similarities because her staff did much of the writing for both. 
Flemion conceded that "some of their things are incorporated into ours and some 
of ours into theirs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Wasn't Resolvable' 
</P>
<P>
Heidt is upset that Flemion borrowed some of the county material by promising 
it would not be copyrighted but that the festival committee now plans to 
copyright its guides. Flemion said the guides are being copyrighted, but Wagner 
said she doubts a copyright has any meaning because so many people contributed 
material to the guides and have not been asked permission to grant copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm caught in the middle of a dispute that just wasn't 
resolvable," said Wagner, adding that she does not care what guide her teachers 
use as long as they find the materials useful and enriching for their students. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, these are enrichment guides, not guides to teach curriculum 
per se in art or social science or anything else, and therefore, as long as 
they put the arts festival into context from a cultural and artistic 
perspective, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
"But both feel very strongly about what they have done. . . . I work with Ann 
on a regular basis, but I also know Jessie as a member of the arts commission, 
and I am grateful to the mayor for having 1989 as the 'Year of the Child.' 
</P>
<P>
"Just let me say that the way things have been done would not be my style."

REDONDO SHOOT-OUT'S 1ST VICTIM: A MYSTERY MAN WITH A RAP SHEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Neighbors say the strains of a piano were often heard floating down from the 
hillside home in Rolling Hills Estates. "Someone who lives there plays 
beautifully," a smiling middle-aged woman said, gesturing to the home next 
door. "Classical and jazz." 
</P>
<P>
But what people on Harbor Sight Drive didn't know was that the sweet sounds 
were mechanical. Their neighbor owned a player piano. 
</P>
<P>
Said one guest who is in on the secret: "You can sit down there and fake it 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Taylor owned that piano. 
</P>
<P>
And, like the piano, much in Taylor's life was not what it first appeared to 
be, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 52, was shot to death last Tuesday afternoon, apparently by his best 
friend since high school, Roger Bollinger. Just moments after the killing, 
police stormed Bollinger's Redondo Beach condominium and shot him to death in a 
short, point-blank gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
An officer injured in the shoot-out, Leonard Knott, was moved from Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center to Torrance Memorial Medical Center, where he was listed in 
serious condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach police said they still cannot find a motive for the killing. 
Although the 52-year-old Bollinger had reportedly been severely depressed, his 
ex-wife, Margaret, said he had no disagreements with Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, initially described by police as a successful businessman, owned a home 
on "the hill," as locals call the affluent Palos Verdes Peninsula. Gardeners 
kept the grounds immaculate. A pool glistened at one side of the home, and 
several cars filled the driveway on the other. Taylor, who stood 5-foot-11 and 
weighed 200 pounds, carried a stack of credit cards and a membership in the 
swank Los Angeles Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
But police and court records revealed last week that Taylor had a criminal 
record and multiple aliases. 
</P>
<P>
It took a routine traffic stop in Palos Verdes Estates a little more than a 
year ago to reveal that Taylor had another side. 
</P>
<P>
When Palos Verdes Estates patrolman Mike Mitchell pulled Taylor over for an 
illegal U-turn, he produced a driver's license from Florida, a police report on 
the incident says. Taylor "acted very excited and refused to show any 
additional identification," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell reported that he took Taylor to jail for the illegal turn and that a 
search there revealed that he was carrying a total of six driver's licenses. 
Each was under a different name, but each pictured the same smiling, corpulent 
face. The names on his credit cards also varied. And Taylor's identifications 
showed three different Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor told police he was an unemployed accountant. 
</P>
<P>
On his wrist he wore a Rolex watch. In his wallet he carried $8,300 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police report, he told officers that all the names were his. 
"When I asked him what his birth/legal name was, he stated that he did not 
remember," Officer Mitchell wrote in his report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, in January, Taylor pleaded guilty in South Bay Municipal 
Court to a charge of possessing a fictitious driver's license. He was placed on 
two years' probation and ordered to pay a total of $1,310 in fines and court 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up police report shows that detectives used the identifications to 
determine that Taylor had an FBI rap sheet, showing an arrest for transporting 
stolen vehicles. The report did not indicate if Taylor was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they knew little about Taylor, except that he would keep as many 
as a dozen cars at his home. One neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous, said 
that young men drove the cars to the home, where some were refurbished and 
detailed. 
</P>
<P>
People would come to the winding street, with its sweeping view of the South 
Bay and the ocean, to buy Taylor's cars. "They would be selling, negotiating 
right in the driveway there," said the neighbor. "He gave the impression to 
people that he was selling his own cars or relatives'." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Her a Lemon 
</P>
<P>
One day when Taylor was away from home, a woman called on one of his neighbors 
and said that Taylor had sold her a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew something funky was going on," another neighbor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger's neighbors had reported earlier in the week that he, too, had been 
selling used cars off the street in front of his Redondo Beach condominium. 
Police said the two men appeared to be in business together. 
</P>
<P>
In the same month that he pleaded guilty to the license charge, Taylor was in 
trouble with the law again, according to South Bay Municipal Court records. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern California Edison investigator came to Taylor's home and found that 
the electric meter had been tampered with, according to a sheriff's report 
filed with the court. Someone had drilled a hole in the glass meter and 
inserted a paper clip, causing the meter to give unusually low readings, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor stole nearly $4,000 in electricity from 1985 until this year, the report 
says. A misdemeanor charge of theft of utility services was pending when he was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airline Identification Cards 
</P>
<P>
During the stolen-electricity investigation, deputies searched Taylor's home 
and found two USAir employee identification cards. Taylor's girlfriend, Angela 
Brighton, claimed that the couple had the cards because Taylor's daughter 
worked for the airline, according to a police report. But an airline security 
representative said the cards were forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Brighton could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
There is one final irony in the court files on Taylor: A report from the 
electric company shows that he used an alias, Al Brighton, when the utility 
turned on the power at his home. The Southern California Edison records show 
that Taylor had said that he previously received electric service at several 
addresses. One of those was 312 Francisca Ave., Roger Bollinger's Redondo Beach 
condominium, where Gary Taylor died.

TRACING THE BITTER ROOTS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT'S DISCONTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS and GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The telephone answering machine at the Rancho Palos Verdes home of Bob and Dawn 
Henry greets callers with the chorus of the 1961 hit song, "Hit the Road Jack." 
</P>
<P>
"What a catchy tune," Bob Henry chimes in after the chorus. "We know it's No. 1 
in your hearts. On Nov. 7, let's make it No. 1 on the charts." 
</P>
<P>
The message is aimed at Jack Price, 58, superintendent of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District for the last seven years and, for the last 
two, nemesis of the East Peninsula Educational Council, a parents' group that 
wants him fired. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which includes the Henrys, has fought desperately to keep Miraleste 
High School open, despite the school board's decision that the east side school 
should be closed because of declining enrollment. Three candidates seeking 
Price's ouster -- Peter Gardner, Barry Hildebrand and Maryanne Kipper -- 
resigned from the group to run for the school board this November. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Price and school board members have been been forced to 
defend themselves against a lawsuit that alleges they cost the district more 
than $1.5 million by failing to get top dollar for surplus school property and 
by selectively forgiving developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see public officials held accountable," said Janet McAuley, who 
lives in Palos Verdes Estates and who filed the lawsuit last year with Rancho 
Palos Verdes resident Richard Smith, a Lynwood High School teacher. "I really 
believe once the public is informed they won't tolerate this." 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jeffrey Younggren, Price and other school district 
officials view the actions by the parents' group and the lawsuit as a 
coordinated attempt to discredit them in the eyes of the community. Younggren 
calls the lawsuit a "witch hunt." Price said he believes the lawsuit, as well 
as the east side parents' actions, are an attempt "to bring the district to its 
knees." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic case study in fanaticism," Price said. "It's been a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
McAuley denies that her legal action is related to the district's decision to 
close Miraleste, although she and the parents' group say they are united in 
their belief that the district is not managed properly. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing all sides agree on is that although district students 
consistently achieve lofty scores on California achievement tests, their 
parents and some school officials have sometimes taken the low road in their 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides point to slashed tires, mutilated pets, mailboxes knocked over and 
acts of minor vandalism. Neither side has any proof of the identity of the 
perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
"This is . . . a highly competitive, very aggressive, very wealthy community of 
individuals who in many ways made their success by not buckling under, but 
going for the jugular," said Younggren, a psychologist who drives a fire 
engine-red Ferrari. "And we see that here." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Ted Gibbs, spokesman for the parents' group, says his phone rings 
three times every morning at 5 a.m.; there is never anyone on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
Price says he also used to get early morning phone calls, as well as obscene 
letters and poems urging him to leave the district. Twice, he said, urine was 
splattered over his office door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sequence of Loans 
</P>
<P>
The personal attacks against Price have included allegations by some critics 
that he has used district time to write some of the six textbooks he has 
co-authored. Price denies that and says he is irate that McAuley and Dawn Henry 
have publicized his personal finances, including a sequence of loans totaling 
$2 million that he took out in the last four years to finance a home and pay 
off bills. 
</P>
<P>
Price said it drives his detractors crazy wondering how he can make the 
payments on the loans. In addition to his $82,150 annual salary as 
superintendent, he says he also earns more than $100,000 a year in textbook 
royalties, and his wife is paid about $70,000 as an administrator for the 
Pomona Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Capelouto (assistant superintendent in charge of finance) and I are 
supposed to be two crooks," Price says, adding that he has never profited 
personally from any of the district's real estate or other business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no question that Price has tried to get in a few licks against his 
opponents himself. 
</P>
<P>
After Bob Henry made inquiries about Price in Vista, the San Diego County city 
where Price was school superintendent before resigning to take the Palos Verdes 
position, Price wrote a letter to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Price questions whether Henry, who is director of management 
services for the Harbor Department, had been sleuthing for the parents' group 
during the workday. Explaining that his own inquiries to the Harbor Department 
had been rebuffed, Price asked Flores in his March 15, 1988, letter to find out 
if Henry took vacation time to conduct his detective work. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that you can find out," Price wrote. "You do not need to tell me. 
It is enough to know that you will be certain that public funds are not 
expended on private business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Vacation Time 
</P>
<P>
Bill Stein, director of port administration, wrote the councilwoman that Henry 
had used vacation time for his research, with Stein's prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
The critics' feelings against Price became particularly inflamed after he 
appeared before the Rolling Hill Estates City Council in April and argued in 
favor of expansion plans by the private Peninsula Heritage School. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked, saddened and sickened me to hear this man speak in support of 
expansion plans of a private school system, at a time when we are fighting 
tooth and nail to keep our present school system from closing down one school 
after another on the hill," Glenda Urmacha wrote in a letter to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . With friends like this, the Palos Verdes school system needs no 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Price says that in nearly four decades as an educator, he has never been 
subject to the character assassination or charges of mismanagement now leveled 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lance Vollmer, a Vista school board member, says he ran for election 
in 1983 on a platform to fire Price. Vollmer had criticized Price, who left the 
district before the election, for his handling of some land trades that Vollmer 
said led to an FBI investigation. No indictments were issued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Investigation 
</P>
<P>
In a 1983 interview with The Times, Price acknowledged that there had been an 
an FBI investigation but said he did not know "what they were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Public displays of animosity have lessened somewhat since the State Board of 
Education ruled Sept. 8 that peninsula voters should not be allowed to decide 
whether a separate school district should be formed on the east side. The 
parents' group had petitioned the state panel for the election after the local 
school board decided to close Miraleste, the only high school on the east side. 
</P>
<P>
The district, faced with a legal challenge by the parents' group, is preparing 
a court-ordered environmental impact report on the Miraleste closing and other 
closures throughout the district. The report is scheduled to be complete in 
early October. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute between the school district and the parents' group 
is the issue of declining enrollment throughout the district. In the early 
'70s, the district had nearly 18,000 students, a number that has since declined 
to 8,800. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the district in recent years has closed five elementary and two 
intermediate schools and has sold six parcels of land that had been earmarked 
for future school construction. Although the district's own demographer 
projects a slight increase in students to between 11,000 and 12,000 by 1993, 
Price believes the district will never be as large as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
"The property up here is too expensive (for young families)," Price said. 
"Secondly, we are almost all built out. . . . There isn't much space for new 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projections Disputed 
</P>
<P>
The parents' group disagrees with the district's demographic projections and 
with its earlier decisions to sell surplus property outright instead of 
retaining ownership in case it is needed in the future. Nancy Bolton, a 
demographer who has been active in the group, contends that, by closing 
schools, the district is making "permanent solutions to a temporary problem." 
She contends that more families with children will move onto the peninsula in 
coming years as its present population grows gray. 
</P>
<P>
"I know housing is expensive here," Bolton said, "but it is expensive in a lot 
of places. . . . It is not at all unrealistic to think in seven or eight years 
we could have 14,000 or 15,000 (students) because this is an area of mostly 
single-family homes." 
</P>
<P>
The $6.65-million sale of the Peninsula High site in Rolling Hills Estates in 
January, 1987, has become the chief exhibit for McAuley and Smith, who contend 
that the school board and administration fell short in their stewardship of 
public property. School officials say they did well in selling the site, which 
had been earmarked for a high school but had never been developed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when the school district faced a budget shortfall, it disposed of the 
36-acre site, giving 10 acres to the city of Rolling Hills Estates for 
recreation, and selling the remainder, which was zoned for 72 home sites, many 
with views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanse of Dirt 
</P>
<P>
The site today is a cleared expanse of dirt. Plans call for a first phase of 44 
homes ranging in price from almost $700,000 to about $850,000, with completion 
in 1990. A second phase of 28 larger homes, tentatively priced at $2 million 
each, is scheduled for completion in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
McAuley says she has obtained internal documents, prepared by the developer who 
bought the site, that show each home site was worth $250,000 after streets and 
utilities were put in. By her calculations, the school system should have made 
as much as $15 million on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I am at a loss why the school system would forgo a profit of that magnitude in 
a rapidly rising real estate market," she said. 
</P>
<P>
School board candidate Barry Hildebrand, citing a school site sale in Manhattan 
Beach, said other school systems did better with similar sales. In that sale, 
the Manhattan Beach school district obtained a tract map for the 4.2-acre 
Manhattan Beach Heights Elementary School site and sold it in October, 1988, 
for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hildebrand said the school board and administration mishandled the Peninsula 
High sale by using an outdated appraisal that was too low to start with and by 
giving the developer concessions worth $500,000. McAuley and Smith make the 
same allegations in their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they handled that sale says to me that the school board and the 
administration are not concerned about the kids of the peninsula," Hildebrand 
said. "It says to me they are more concerned about their friends in real 
estate. They gave it away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defended Sale 
</P>
<P>
Younggren, speaking for school board members, defended all aspects of the sale. 
The critics of the school board are "looking for a commie under every bed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the bidding was competitive and we marketed the property the best we 
could," Younggren said. 
</P>
<P>
Price emphasized that the school system got about 20% more than the 
$5.4-million appraised value of the land. He said the district got what the 
market was willing to pay and added that he and other school officials are 
educators, not developers. 
</P>
<P>
A development group composed of Goldrich &amp; Kest Industries and California 
Coast Development Group Inc. was awarded the bid for the site on Nov. 17, 1986, 
and on June 7, 1988, paid $6.65 million for the property. 
</P>
<P>
One of the losing bidders, developer Ron Florance, a former councilman in Palos 
Verdes Estates, said the school system would have made much more money if it 
had accepted his offer to form a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant's memo to the board that evaluated Florance's bid labeled it 
"speculative with inherent risks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50% of Profits 
</P>
<P>
Florance was willing to pay the $5.4 million appraised value within two years 
and cut in the school system for 50% of the profits from the development, 
according to district documents. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have got double for the property," Florance said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a rising market. You had to be deaf, dumb and blind not to 
recognize that." 
</P>
<P>
Price said neither Florance nor another developer who proposed a similar 
development supplied the district with sufficient details. 
</P>
<P>
The second main accusation made by McAuley and Smith about the school board's 
handling of financial matters concerns developer fees. They allege that Price 
and Capelouto cost the district more than $500,000 by needlessly granting 
exemptions to developers, even though the granting of the exemptions violated a 
school board resolution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the board voted to impose a fee of $1.50 per square foot on 
residential construction and 25 cents per square foot for commercial 
development beginning June 27 of that year. Under state law, school districts 
are entitled to adopt such fees under the theory that new development will draw 
more children into a community. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting on April 24, 1987, where the resolution imposing fees was 
passed, the board discussed exemptions for people who had begun development 
plans but decided not to grant any. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began Granting Exemptions 
</P>
<P>
Three days before the fees took effect, however, the district began granting 
exemptions. The practice continues under a board policy adopted in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Capelouto later told state auditors that he granted exemptions to local 
developers who could show that they had submitted a building permit application 
to a peninsula city before March 1, 1987, but had encountered problems that 
prevented issuance of the permit until after June 27. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro), prompted by requests from 
constituents, asked the state auditor general in the spring of 1988 to 
investigate the district's management practices. Auditors criticized school 
officials for failing to adopt written criteria for granting exemptions, and 
for not letting the public know that exemptions could be obtained until the 
district issued a press release in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, auditors said that between June, 1987, and March, 1988, the 
district collected $297,000 in developer fees, and exempted $532,000 worth of 
fees. Auditors found that the district could not demonstrate that 13 exemptions 
met Capelouto's unwritten criteria. The district later provided documentation 
for the 13 exemptions, according to Philip Jelicich, who conducted the audit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consistent Criteria 
</P>
<P>
Younggren said board members initially did not know that the exemptions were 
being granted. However, Younggren said, after administrators assured them 
several months later that consistent criteria were being applied, board members 
allowed them to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Younggren acknowledged that the school board did not issue a formal policy 
statement outlining criteria used for granting exemptions until after the 
auditors finished their report and recommended that it do so. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no favoritism shown" in granting exemptions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board discussed exemptions, the resolution did not address that 
issue. Afterward, Price said, "The feeling was it was OK for us to go ahead" 
and grant them. In retrospect, he said, he and Capelouto should have informed 
the board that they were making exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither Dave (Capelouto) nor I ever thought of that," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Price himself was not left unscathed by the auditors. They criticized the 
district for accepting a $6,727 developer fee check from Price in January, 
1988, and then failing to deposit it until March. The payment receipt issued to 
Price allowed him to obtain his building permit for his home from the city of 
Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Price initially asked school officials not to deposit his check, according to 
the auditor's report. Charlene Pavlick, an accountant for the district, told 
investigators that "the superintendent indicated that he did not have the money 
to cover the check on Jan. 7, 1988. Charlene said that she was unhappy with 
this request to hold his check, but she complied because Dr. Price was the 
superintendent and, therefore, her boss." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poor Judgment' 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with The Times, Price would not elaborate on the matter, 
except to say that he exercised poor judgment. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of acrimony, district officials and their critics say they are 
eager for a resolution of the issues that divide them. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, as the State Board of Education debated the parents' 
request for an election, Price declared, "All we want to do is to get the kids 
off the hangman's noose." 
</P>
<P>
But further delay on some issues is inevitable as the lawsuit winds its way 
through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The next milestone in the district's travails comes Nov. 7, when three seats 
will be filled on the school board. Each side hopes to gain a three-member 
majority -- and vindication. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the antagonists cling tenaciously to their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no deception or conspiracy or incredible ineptness here," Younggren

SUBWAY-BUS LINK EMERGES AS FAVORED RAIL PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
INITIAL FUNDING UNDER ROBBINS-BRAUDE PLAN MAY ONLY PAY TO BUILD ROUTE TO 
SEPULVEDA BASIN 
</P>

<P>
After three years of fighting over what kind of San Fernando Valley rail line 
to build and where to build it, one plan appears to have emerged from the smoke 
and debris -- extending the Metro Rail subway partly underground from North 
Hollywood to Encino, then busing passengers to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail-express bus plan, which requires both homeowner and business 
leaders to give up some of their demands, for the moment appears to have 
squeezed out all other schemes touted in recent years, including several 
different configurations of ground-level or elevated light rail. 
</P>
<P>
Even if, as is considered likely, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoes a bill aimed at 
forcing construction of the seven-mile Metro Rail extension, the proposal has 
been endorsed by so many elected officials, homeowner leaders and business 
groups that it seems likely to prevail, local officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a late convert to the plan, said 
last week that support was "virtually wall to wall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Support 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the Valley has finally gotten behind a single plan, as we have 
been asking them to do," said Richard Stanger, rail development director for 
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a 
countywide network of rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
And Commissioner Jacki Bacharach, who heads the commission's Rail Construction 
Committee, added: "If the Valley is finally speaking with one voice, as appears 
to be the case, then we will probably do what the Valley asks or not build 
anything there for now." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, both Stanger and Bacharach said the Metro Rail extension may 
prove too costly to build, no matter how much support it enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
Since proposed four months ago by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, the plan to extend the downtown-to-North 
Hollywood Metro Rail across the eastern Valley has steadily muscled aside all 
rival proposals, several of which had strong support. 
</P>
<P>
These include a controversial plan to build a 15-mile rail system from North 
Hollywood to Warner Center along a Southern Pacific railroad right of way that 
follows Chandler and Victory boulevards, and Oxnard and Topham streets from 
Metro Rail's northern terminus at Chandler and Lankershim boulevards to Warner 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
That plan had strong backing from business leaders because it would bring rail 
all the way to fast-growing Warner Center and apparently can be built with the 
uncommitted funds that the commission expects to have during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Another rival proposal is construction of an elevated line on the Ventura 
Freeway's south shoulder from Universal City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is studying both routes, either as Metro Rail extensions or for 
light-rail trolleys, which are slower and have less capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The commission study, expected to be completed in November, will provide cost 
and ridership estimates for each combination of route and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner leaders along both routes vigorously opposed any plan, whether light 
rail or Metro Rail extension, that was not a subway in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Noise, traffic congestion and ground vibrations from trains running as often as 
every three minutes during rush hour would make single-family neighborhoods 
unlivable, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
They saw little relief in two other schemes under study by the commission -- 
placing trains in shallow trenches lined with earthen berms or placing trains 
fully underground but with trenches open to the air or covered with grates. 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins-Braude plan differs from others in that it acknowledges that there 
will be only enough money initially to build as far as the Sepulveda Basin, and 
that homeowner opposition is so strong that a ground-level system is not 
politically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Endorsing a plan that does not provide rail service all the way to Warner 
Center was a difficult decision, said Roger Stanard, a Warner Center business 
leader and co-chairman of a light-rail support group. 
</P>
<P>
"But it appears to be what we can get, and the Valley needs something 
desperately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25-Foot Depth 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Robbins-Braude plan, which follows the route of the 
Southern Pacific right of way, gives homeowner groups the 25-foot-deep subway 
they demanded only in a brief segment, between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and 
Woodman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Between the Hollywood Freeway and Laurel Canyon and between Woodman and 
Hazeltine Avenue -- both solidly residential areas -- the trains must be below 
ground but there is no depth requirement and the line could be open to the air. 
From Hazeltine to Balboa Boulevard, the presumed point of transfer to express 
buses, the line would not pass through any residential areas and could be 
ground-level. 
</P>
<P>
The differing depth requirements initially led to grumbling by homeowner 
activists about "first- and second-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But in recent weeks, homeowner leaders from Studio City, Sherman Oaks and North 
Hollywood have endorsed the plan, partly through realization that to get to the 
25-foot depth, the trains would have to start descending some distance away, 
leaving only a small area with an open trench. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Paterson, president of Valley Village Homeowners Assn. in North Hollywood, 
at first denounced the Robbins-Braude plan as a "divide-and-conquer strategy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Settle for It' 
</P>
<P>
But last week, Paterson, who represents a neighborhood bisected by the proposed 
line, said: "It's all the mitigation we are going to get, and we might as well 
settle for it." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to endorse the plan are two large coalitions formed in recent years 
along the Southern Pacific route -- the Eastern Sector Transit Coalition and 
the Western Sector Transit Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Herman, president of the eastern group, said the plan "just doesn't go far 
enough" in protecting residents from noise. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Fine, chairwoman of the western group, based in Reseda and Woodland 
Hills, was more vehement: "For us, this is the worst possible situation. It 
brings the rail line right to our doorsteps but gives us no protection 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
A political activist who asked not to be identified said Robbins and Braude, in 
putting together their consensus, theorized that single-issue groups such as 
the two transit coalitions were "less of a threat than long-established groups 
of homeowners, who you don't want to get on the wrong side of if possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bipartisan Backing 
</P>
<P>
A bill introduced by Robbins in the Legislature includes key elements of the 
Metro Rail extension plan. It quickly drew bipartisan support among Valley 
legislators in Sacramento, was passed by the Senate and Assembly and is 
awaiting action by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The county Transportation Commission has mounted a formidable lobbying effort, 
arguing that since the Valley rail line would be built solely with local sales 
tax funds, the legislation would be an improper intrusion by the state into a 
local issue. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who has frequently vetoed bills that he determined were attempts to 
settle local issues in the Legislature, has until Oct. 2 to act. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would not force the commission to build a Valley line but, through 
tunneling requirements, would leave it with only two options -- build no Valley 
line or build according to the Robbins-Braude plan. 
</P>
<P>
Even while fighting the Robbins bill, Bacharach predicted that the commission 
would be strongly influenced by the widespread support the plan has gathered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affordability Issue 
</P>
<P>
"It's our policy not to buck communities," she said. "If a halfway system is 
truly what the Valley wants and we can afford it, we'll probably build it." 
</P>
<P>
But the question of affordability looms large with the commission, which is 
building the Long Beach-Los Angeles and Century Freeway light-rail lines and 
contributing to Metro Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
Rough estimates of Valley rail plans are $900 million for a 15-mile light-rail 
system and $2.4 billion for a 15-mile all-subway system. No estimates for a 
part-subway system of only seven miles -- the Robbins-Braude plan -- are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Commission planners say they hope to have $800 million to start another rail 
line during the 1990s, but they admit that with cost overruns on projects under 
way, it could be only half that much. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the extra half-cent sales tax that county voters approved in 
1980 produces about $110 million in rail construction money each year, and the 
three projects under way are expected to be completed and paid for by the turn 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Stanger, the commission's rail development director, said that by dragging out 
the Valley project, "it's possible that it could be done, but we just won't 
know until our study is done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparing Valley Rail Plans 
</P>
<P>
Metro Rail Extension 
</P>
<P>
Advantages 
</P>
<P>
No disruption of residential area where trains are underground, minimal where 
trains are in deep trench. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No need to transfer to downtown-bound Metro Rail 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top speed of 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra capacity should ridership exceed estimates 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages 
</P>
<P>
Higher construction cost (about $180 million a mile) means enough money to 
build only to Balboa Boulevard, about seven miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer to buses might prove unpopular with riders traveling to and from West 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might be difficult to justify per-mile cost based on ridership estimates, which 
are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capacity of 19,000 riders per hour likely to exceed need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LIGHT RAIL 
</P>
<P>
Advantages 
</P>
<P>
Less costly (about $45 million per mile). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Although revenue estimates are not available, there is potentially enough to 
build 15 miles from North Hollywood Metro Rail terminus to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction cost more likely to be justified by ridership projections, which 
are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of tunneling results in less disruption during construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages 
</P>
<P>
Disrupts residents where trains operate at ground level or in shallow trenches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All suggested routes contain numerous residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Usually combined with unsightly overhead power lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riders must switch to Metro Rail in North Hollywood to go downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires its own storage and repair yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited to about 6,000 riders per hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top speed is only 55 m.p.h.

BALLOON SHOW IS HARBINGER OF RESIDENTS' REDUCED VIEWS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION BY HYPERION ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT OF THE PLANT'S PROPOSED 
EXPANSION IN EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was balloon day Saturday at the Hyperion Treatment Plant, but few homeowners 
in the hills in nearby El Segundo found any cause to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the sewage treatment plant near Imperial Highway and Vista Del Mar 
Boulevard raised 50 large weather balloons about 100 feet into the air to 
demonstrate to residents how much of their ocean view would be obstructed by 
the proposed construction of 12 sewage processing tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it when when I saw the balloons this morning," said Elroy 
Tatge as he stood on his patio looking at a row of balloons that partially 
blocked his view of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Tatge, 57, and his wife, Ana, moved into the house in July. Before buying the 
house, he said, he asked officials at El Segundo City Hall whether Hyperion had 
proposed any construction plans that would hamper his view. He said they told 
him no such plan existed. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly," he said, "if I had known the view would have been blocked, it would 
have been a deciding factor in buying the house." 
</P>
<P>
He called the plan "not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and the city of Los Angeles, 
the dozen tanks, known as digesters, would each stand 105 feet above ground 
level and 85 feet in diameter, according to Walt Naydo, division engineer for 
Hyperion. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo said the proposed tanks would be lowered about 30 feet into the ground 
but could not be lowered further because they would encounter ground water. 
Hyperion currently uses smaller digesters, but Naydo said larger units are 
needed to provide the necessary capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the balloons raised Saturday represented the height of an additional 
dozen tanks that Hyperion officials are considering building at the facility 
later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The digester tanks -- resembling large eggs -- would each hold about 2.5 
million gallons of solid sewage, which would be partially consumed in a process 
using artificial bacteria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18 Tanks Operating 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion, which treats sewage for most of the city of Los Angeles, has 18 
digester tanks in operation, but Naydo said the facility needs to expand its 
capacity to meet the city's growing needs. Hyperion processes about 440 million 
gallons of raw sewage a day, and by the year 2010, the plant is expected to 
process about 570 million gallons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If everything goes as scheduled, Naydo said, construction of the digesters 
would begin in mid-1991 and be completed by late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo said Hyperion officials have held three public hearings on the matter and 
have sent several letters to residents to inform them about the planned 
expansion. But he said few residents attended the meetings or responded to the 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying to get the people to be responsive to what we see as a 
potential impact," he said. "But we've had very little luck." 
</P>
<P>
He said the balloons were raised in hopes of prompting residents to respond. 
The plan worked. The balloons were raised at about 8 a.m., and by 9:30 the 
telephones in the Hyperion administrative offices were ringing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standing in Yards 
</P>
<P>
By 10:30 that morning, several residents in the middle-class, single-family 
neighborhoods above the plant were standing in their front yards discussing the 
proposed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's upsetting to us because we bought the house partly for the view," said 
Hilary Murphy, a teacher's aide in El Segundo who moved into a house on 
Hillcrest Street in April. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said she and her husband, Michael, spend a great deal of time watching 
the sunsets on the ocean from their patio. Now, she said, the view will be 
ruined by the large tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awful what progress does," she said. 
</P>
<P>
John Teleso, who has lived for 10 years with his wife, Sandi, and two daughters 
in a house down the street, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Teleso, an aerospace worker, said the tanks would obstruct his view and lower 
the value of his house. He said he has talked to his neighbors and has 
contacted an attorney to see what legal recourse he has. 
</P>
<P>
Teleso, like several of his neighbors, said homeowners in the area are planning 
to join to fight the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bring Everyone Together' 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one thing that is going to bring everyone together to fight it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson and Councilman Scot Dannen joined some residents 
on Hillcrest Street to discuss the matter. Jacobson said the city of El Segundo 
does not have the power to reject the project because the Hyperion plant is 
located just outside the city's border and within the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that city officials have been meeting with Hyperion officials 
to discuss alternative methods to increase the plant's capacity, such as 
building underground tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dannen: "The more noise the residents make, the more mitigating measures 
they may add."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: GROWERS EAGER TO SELL THEIR BOUNTY FIND CITY FOLKS 
WANTING TO STOCK UP AT SAN PEDRO FARMER'S MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sheryl Stolberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each Thursday morning, Carletta Thorsell and Doris Shipman meet in downtown San 
Pedro, where they share casual conversation and conduct business across a table 
that is blanketed with the bounty of California's fertile soil. 
</P>
<P>
"It's marvelous," declares Shipman, who buys Italian parsley from Thorsell. 
"The fruit and vegetables are fresher here. They're right from the farm." 
</P>
<P>
And so they are, at the San Pedro Farmer's Market. 
</P>
<P>
A weekly affair on 3rd Street, the market is a wash of colors, smells and 
sounds -- the shouting of questions ("How much for that cauliflower?"), the 
clinking of coins as they change hands from city slicker to rural farmer, the 
rustle of plastic bags filled with plump red tomatoes or sweet yellow corn. 
</P>
<P>
It is a place an artist might relish. The crinkles etched into the farmers' 
faces, the smooth and rough textures of the fruit and vegetables, the slant of 
the sunlight as it hits the metal scales -- all might serve as fine material 
for a painting or a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic enlightenment, however, is not the goal of the San Pedro Farmer's 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, says manager Dale Whitney, is far more plain and practical: to bring 
good, healthy produce at reasonable prices to residents of San Pedro, 
particularly its low-income and elderly population, while providing small 
family farmers with a place to make enough profit to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
The market, which has been operating in San Pedro since 1985, is associated 
with two others, both in Long Beach. The three do business under the umbrella 
name of Harbor Area Farmers Markets, and are sponsored jointly by the First 
Congregational Church in Long Beach and the South Coast Ecumenical Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these (farmers) are (from) very small-time farms," says Nan Nutt, 
administrator at the First Congregational Church. "They're not your big 
agribusiness and they need this sort of outlet in order to keep going. They 
don't have enough to furnish Von's supermarket, and so they're willing to drive 
all night to be here to sell their produce." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, farmers come from as far north as Visalia and as far south as the 
Mexican border to sell their goods in San Pedro. "It's a lot of driving," says 
Visalia farmer Danny Pritchett, who sells plums, nectarines, apples, apricots, 
lemons and anything else, he says, that grows on a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchett says he sells between $400 and $600 of produce each Thursday at the 
San Pedro market. Like many small farmers who find it more lucrative to sell 
directly to consumers than to packing houses or supermarkets, Pritchett makes 
the rounds of Southern California's farmer's markets; San Pedro is one of five 
markets he frequents each week. 
</P>
<P>
Produce at the San Pedro market ranges from the standard to the exotic. It is 
as easy to find guava, persimmon and pink lentils as it is to find apples, 
grapefruit and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
For instance Thorsell, who works for Top Veg Farms in nearby Carson, offers 
Chinese long beans, Japanese cucumbers and bitter melon -- which doesn't look 
like melon at all, but more closely resembles a pale green zucchini with warts. 
(Bitter melon, Thorsell volunteers, is usually stir-fried with tomatoes or 
onions and is believed to have medicinal properties.) 
</P>
<P>
Whitney, a Presbyterian minister who recently gave up his full-time post at a 
Long Beach church to manage the harbor area markets, says the key to a 
successful farmer's market is location: The market ought to be on the border 
between an affluent community, where residents might spend more for unusual 
fruits and vegetables like those Thorsell sells, and a poor one, where 
residents need the staples at affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
In San Pedro, the 3rd Street location fits that bill. The market is near the 
commercial core and around the corner from the headquarters of the Los Angeles 
Harbor Department, but across the street from Rancho San Pedro, a public 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
It attracts residents like Leslie Sharp, who says she comes "when my car 
happens to be working or when I can get a ride" and non-residents like Marla 
Silverman, who works as a real estate officer at the Harbor Department and 
lives in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to taste a little bit fresher, so I do try to buy all my fruits and 
vegetables there," said Silverman, who favors Japanese plums and the vast 
selection of sprouts sold by a vendor who runs a greenhouse in Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alfred Fischer, a San Pedro resident who teaches geology at the University 
of Southern California: "I would much rather shop in a market like this than a 
supermarket. . . . You're closer to the soil this way." Sheryl Stolberg

FIRE CAUSES $500,000 DAMAGE TO GLENDALE STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Fire Department officials were investigating the cause of a fire that 
caused $500,000 in damage to a furniture store early Saturday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the blaze, which broke out about 7:20 a.m. at Swanson's 
Furniture Store on the 2600 block of Honolulu Avenue, spokesman Tom Magallanes 
said. The blaze continued for 15 minutes before firefighters extinguished it, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
About $300,000 in damage was done to the building and about $200,000 to 
contents, he said.

LAWNDALE COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON FATE OF COMMUNITY GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has delayed a decision on whether to retain a 
community garden at 160th Street and Sombra Avenue or develop the site for a 
park or a senior citizen housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Council members delayed the decision Thursday to give City Atty. David J. 
Aleshire time to study the property deed to determine if there are any 
restrictions on changing the use. The matter should be brought before the 
council again during its meeting Oct. 5, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Park and Recreation Commission unanimously recommended that a 
park be built at the site of the 22,000-square-foot garden, which includes rows 
of corn stalks, squash, tomatoes, onions, pumpkins, cucumbers and other 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's council meeting, about 10 residents spoke on the issue. Most 
said they support a park on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly feel that the area called the Lawndale Community Garden would make 
a far better park than a senior housing center," said Judy Oldziewsky, a 
resident on 162nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Larry Rudolph and Councilman Harold E. Hofmann said they support 
a park on the site. Councilwoman Carol Norman said she would like a senior 
citizens housing project there. Councilman Dan McKenzie and Mayor Sarann Kruse 
said they would like to retain the garden. 
</P>
<P>
There are 45 parcels at the garden, nine of which are not being used, according 
to Larry Corrington, the director of recreation and community services. For 
$10, residents can rent a 20-foot-by-20-foot parcel for six months. The city 
pays for water and garbage disposal.

SALE OF SCHOOL SITE IS A KEY BONE OF CONTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN and TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the issues dividing peninsula school officials and their critics is the 
district's handling of the sale of the 36-acre Peninsula High site in Rolling 
Hills Estates for $6.65 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The argument centers on the site's value and marketing and on details of the 
contract with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
The critics of the school district have pored over appraisals, school committee 
reports, sales of vacant land, state laws, the bid award and the contract with 
the developer, and have come up with a barrage of objections. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that the district ignored the recommendation of its own financial 
advisory committee on how to market the property and paid no heed to a state 
appraisal saying the property was worth about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
They also say that the district's own appraisal of $5.4 million undervalued the 
property to start with and that it was 15 months out of date when the district 
began to market the site in September, 1986. They also assert that, in contract 
negotiations after the bidding, the district made a concession to the buyer, 
effectively nullifying an inflation factor that would have generated an 
additional $500,000 for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The school board and the administration counter by saying that every allegation 
is off-base. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing 
</P>
<P>
School district critic Janet McAuley is suing the school board, alleging waste 
in connection with the sale of the Peninsula High site and other financial 
activities. She says that the district could have gotten more for the land if 
it had followed the 1982 advice of its own financial advisory committee to get 
either a tract map or a development plan, which would have boosted the value of 
the land. Instead, the school site was sold as raw land. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Jack Price said in a recent interview that the district could have 
gotten a tract map -- which divides large properties into buildable lots -- but 
said the buyer might not have liked the school system's property layout and 
that the effort would then have been a waste of time and money. 
</P>
<P>
State Appraisal 
</P>
<P>
McAuley and Barry Hildebrand, who is running for a school board seat in 
November, also say that the $5.4-million appraisal the school system relied on 
when seeking bids was far too low, citing a 1986 state appraisal that said the 
land was worth more than $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have gotten at least that much for it," Hildebrand said. 
</P>
<P>
During a school board meeting in November, 1988, Dawn Henry cited the state 
appraisal in challenging the school system's valuation of the site. 
</P>
<P>
David Capelouto, assistant superintendent for business, responded then by 
saying that the district did not use the state appraisal because it was not 
based on a close reading of comparable land sales. The state appraisal for 
surplus school property is based on an annually updated statewide inflation 
factor applied to the assessed value when a school system acquired the land. In 
1965, when the school district obtained the Peninsula High site, the tract was 
valued at $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Capelouto said at the time that state officials acknowledged the appraisal 
might be off considerably and should not be used to prepare an actual sale. 
Henry subsequently obtained a letter from the state official in charge of 
making the appraisal that said, "Generally, this (the state) method values 
property below actual value." 
</P>
<P>
School District Appraisal 
</P>
<P>
Delving into the details of the school system's appraisal, McAuley and 
Hildebrand have attacked the appraiser's choice of land sales to establish 
comparable values, saying that he only used comparable sales from 1983, 
although the appraisal was completed in July, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Frauenthal, who was one of the appraisers who worked on the report, 
said in an interview that no sales past 1983 were used because later sales were 
not truly comparable to the land on the Peninsula High site. He said the market 
for undeveloped land on the peninsula was stagnant between 1981 and 1985, which 
he said permitted the use of earlier sales for comparable values. 
</P>
<P>
But Frauenthal agreed with McAuley and Hildebrand that the school system should 
have gotten an updated appraisal in 1986, when the site was sold, rather than 
rely on one completed in July, 1985. Land values on the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
had risen sharply in the interval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials counter that they got about 20% more than the appraisal price, 
which they said reflected the state of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation Factor 
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the dispute centers on the application of an inflation factor 
to the land price. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 17, 1986, the school board accepted a bid of $6.65 million from a 
development group composed of Goldrich &amp; Kest Industries and California 
Coast Development Group Inc. The purchase was to take place within 24 months 
after an agreement was signed with the school board. 
</P>
<P>
In the bid, the Consumer Price Index, which reflects inflation, was coupled to 
the price. According to the written redraft of oral bids, the $6.65-million 
price was subject to a "yearly base price adjustment -- CPI." The bid specified 
that the adjustment was to be no more than 8% and no less than 3%. 
</P>
<P>
However, no inflation factor was applied when the property changed hands 18 
months after the bid award. 
</P>
<P>
Price said that is because the final sales contract, which Capelouto signed for 
the school district on Jan. 14, 1987, specified that the inflation clock did 
not start ticking until six months later -- July 14, 1987 -- and the CPI factor 
would apply only if a full 12 months had passed between July 14, 1987 and the 
date of the sale. The sale took place on June 7, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Price said the inflation clock was started six months after the final sales 
contract was signed to give the developer time to obtain governmental permits 
and an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
But McAuley and Hildebrand say that the district should have started the 
inflation clock ticking Nov. 17, 1986, when the bid was awarded, or, at the 
latest, when the final sales agreement was signed in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
McAuley said she came to her conclusion after reading a separate summary of the 
winning bid that was part of the agenda material presented to the board when it 
awarded the bid. The bid does not specify when the inflation clock was to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
The summary cited by McAuley presents three scenarios to illustrate how the 
inflation factor was to be applied. In the first scenario, the price was to be 
$6.65 million if the land was purchased immediately. In the second scenario, 
which assumed a CPI of 5.5% and a wait of one year, the purchase price was 
$7,015,750. The third scenario assumed a wait of two years and an inflation 
rate of 5.5%, which computed to a purchase price of $7,401,616. 
</P>
<P>
The district's critics allege that failure to apply an inflation factor cost 
the district about $500,000. "What's the purpose of having (the inflation 
factor)?" Hildebrand asked. "It sounds like a gift of public funds. They stole 
some money from the kids. I fault the board for letting Capelouto and Price 
handle too many important details." 
</P>
<P>
But Price defends the district's actions. "I think we did the very best we 
could with that piece of property," he said, "and I don't have any second 
guesses on it."

BUSH INFUSES NEW LIFE INTO FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH INSPIRES COMPANIES, RESIDENTS TO EXPAND THEIR EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last October, it took three weeks for officials of Orange County's Drug Use Is 
Life Abuse campaign to raise enough money to buy 700,000 ribbons for the 
county's schoolchildren as part of a drug-awareness week. 
</P>
<P>
This year, after President Bush's Sept. 5 television address calling for a 
national effort to combat drug abuse, it took the campaign only two days to 
raise the $30,000 needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a phenomenal indication of the people's awareness of the drug problem" 
as a result of the President's speech, said Tom Thomson, a Santa Ana commercial 
real-estate broker who sits on the board of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, a support 
group for the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County has had an active drug prevention campaign, officials 
say the President's speech infused the local effort with new vigor, bringing 
more people off the sidelines and into the drug fight. 
</P>
<P>
One company, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance of Newport Beach, announced it had 
launched a drug education and awareness program for its employees as a result 
of the President's speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Draws 800 Responses 
</P>
<P>
A company call for its 1,400 Orange County employees to sign pledge cards 
signifying their commitment against all drug abuse drew more than 800 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, school, church and business leaders say the drug 
problem has become the dominant topic of conversation in the wake of both the 
Sept. 5 speech and a subsequent address Bush aimed at the nation's 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made a tremendous impact," said Vera Palomino, president of Manos 
Unidas, a Latino organization in Westminster that works with youth. "The kids, 
by listening to the President, have discussed what he had to say." 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight Bush provided came at an opportune time for the Orange County 
drug prevention effort. 
</P>
<P>
Besides greatly facilitating the red-ribbon fund-raising drive, local officials 
said, it has broadened interest in recent events such as a "drug-free" 
community fair that was held in Dana Point and a drug-crisis forum at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day fair, jointly sponsored by the city of Dana Point, the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department and Drug Use Is Life Abuse, was held at Salt Creek 
Beach Park and featured live entertainment, a spaghetti-eating contest and a 
volleyball clinic. Between 700 and 1,000 people turned out for the fair, said 
Dan Martini, a sheriff's deputy who is head of police services for Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug-Crisis Forum 
</P>
<P>
Bush's appeal to the nation weighed heavily on the minds of about 60 local 
scholars who attended a recent drug-crisis forum, sponsored by the National 
Issues Forum of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Participants, who included some local law enforcement officials, debated the 
pros and cons of the nation's crackdown against drug dealers and explored such 
alternatives as legalizing drugs altogether. The two-hour session concluded 
with no consensus. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us 25 years to get here -- we're not going to fix this overnight," 
said Ted Hunter, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was 
among five panelists invited to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, forum organizers called it a success. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the response tonight and the President's proposal were both motivated 
by the same thing -- a great public awareness of and concern with the drug 
crisis," said Harriett Walther, executive director of the National Issues Forum 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Chief James Cook, a board member of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, 
said that while President Bush really didn't say anything new about the drug 
problem, the speech boosted local anti-drug campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"What the President did was look at what was out there and put words behind a 
problem we were all aware of," Cook said. "The President is turning up the 
heat, and he is focusing the drug problem into a sharp, national perspective. 
People are now saying, 'My God, we have a community problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intensive Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Before the President jumped into the drug fray, Orange County's drug prevention 
effort had been under way for several years. The effort picked up steam last 
December with formation of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, a nonprofit organization 
made up of leaders from law enforcement, business, churches and schools. The 
organization uses anti-drug patches, decals and bumper stickers as part of an 
intensive drug education campaign for both adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the group had distributed patches to hundreds of area soccer 
teams, and patches also have been circulated throughout the county's junior 
high and high schools, said Sheriff's Lt. Bill Miller, manager of Drug Use Is 
Life Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been assisting adults by advising companies on how to set up 
workplace drug treatment and prevention programs, Miller said. About 40 to 50 
companies in the county have developed drug programs with the help of Drug Use 
Is Life Abuse, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the President called upon the private sector to play a larger role in the 
drug war, Miller said, additional companies have asked his organization for 
assistance in setting up their drug programs. One was Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Mutual and its employees intend to be active participants in fighting 
this battle," said Pacific Mutual Chairman Harry G. Bubb. "To win, we will need 
the commitment and vigilance of the entire community, including students, 
parents, schools, civic and religious organizations. Our goal is to provide our 
employees with the facts about drug abuse so that they can protect themselves 
and their families from its effects." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counseling Services 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Mutual program includes various educational and counseling 
services, as well as the signing of pledge cards provided by Drug Use Is Life 
Abuse. The cards declare, "YES, I want to join the army in the war against drug 
abuse." And they give Drug Use Is Life Abuse permission to "use my name as one 
of many Orange County residents who has taken a personal stand." Pledge cards 
signed by the company's employees were presented by Bubb to Fountain Valley 
Mayor Laurann Cook in a recent anti-drug ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Pledge cards have also been circulated among area schoolchildren for the past 
two years. Drug education is part of the curriculum at many schools. 
</P>
<P>
Even with these preventive steps, John Ikerd, superintendent of the Orange 
Unified School District and another board member of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, 
said the real answer to the overall problem lies in a joint effort with a 
national program, such as what President Bush is advocating.

THIS WON'T PUT MORE ATHLETES IN CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Give Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., the Rhodes Scholar, a gold star. He is 
sponsoring a bill that would force colleges to make public their graduation 
rates for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Now the best basketball players and football players in the land will perhaps 
get a list of those colleges that demand the least effort in the classroom. 
"Don't bother me with with no sociology papers. I have to work on my jump 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
America's athletes have needed full-disclosure information before signing a 
letter of intent. That's what they really want, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's bill is a nice, elitist idea -- but meaningless. "It's a nice idea; 
it's as good as outlawing drugs," said Wil Klein, who has seen both sides of 
the question. "They will have a hard time making it work. Kids care more about 
the coach's winning record and how many times they'll be on national TV." 
</P>
<P>
Better Bradley should work to get freshman eligibility stopped. Better the high 
school coach who cares should get more help from Bradley's good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
The coach, the parents and their community can make a difference. The coach who 
wants to help his kids already has that kind of information. If kids already 
are focused and get guidance from parents, they don't need it. A few in the 
middle would be helped. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who recently retired as principal of Evander Childs High School in New 
York , previously coached basketball at Columbus High School in the city and is 
a partner in Five-Star Basketball Camp, where the elite come to showcase their 
games. Klein said, "The really good players will say: 'What's more interesting 
to me, is will you give me a car? Forget the graduation rate."' 
</P>
<P>
That's exaggerated for most prospects, but it is realistic. There is some 
exploitation and some larceny in the hearts on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
At the Nike Betterment and Career Development Basketball Camp at Princeton, 124 
players were tested, and 45 were at or below fifth-grade reading level and 75 
at or below the eighth-grade level. These were the top college prospects, 
passed along before colleges laid an eye on them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 30 of the 800 NCAA schools had graduation rates of 5 percent or less 
for basketball players. The NCAA says the 48-percent graduation rate for 
athletes is actually a fraction of a point better than for student bodies as a 
whole, but that rate includes soccer and gymnastics in addition to the major 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
The graduation rate for college seniors is more than 90 percent. The NBA and 
NFL show that fewer than a third of their players earned a degree, and almost 
all of them played out their four years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
A General Accounting Office study recently showed that of 97 schools at the 
highest level in college basketball, not more than one in five basketball 
players ever graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe having the schools identified would embarrass boards of trustees into 
pressuring chancellors to watch more closely. It is a dim picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I know certain colleges will take a football player, give him a tutor to go to 
class with him for each subject," said Shelly Spiegelman, assistant principal 
and athletic director at Boys and Girls High School in New York. "They've no 
more made that player college material than taking a stone out of the street 
and teaching it to swim." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, two young men used up their eligibility at a California school 
and then sued the school for not giving them an education. One of them 
willingly had accepted credit for courses given in Los Angeles while he was 
spending the summer in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids don't care about certain things; they just want to play ball," said Hank 
Williams, Malverne athletic director and a former basketball coach. "We as 
educators have to take a hand." 
</P>
<P>
But there's big money for the schools and for the kids -- those few who don't 
have their hearts broken. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent basketball meeting at Boys and Girls, coach Paul Brown recited some 
odds: 400,000 high school players, 40,000 college players, 326 in the NBA. The 
rest have to show they can do something in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The recruiter always can rationalize low graduation figures, saying "That was 
why we got rid of the previous coach," or, "We have this new counseling 
program." 
</P>
<P>
"The recruiter always paints a rosy picture," Brown said. "A lot of these kids 
have one parent at home; maybe they're supporting themselves. Parents are not 
up on recruiting; you have to be a little sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson recently accepted an honorary degree from Rust College in 
Mississippi, telling incoming students: "I don't want you to be the next Magic 
Johnson. I want you to be the next lawyer, doctor, teacher. We don't need more 
athletes. We need more black professionals. They make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that when the black kid turns on the TV, what he sees is 
Magic," Williams said. "Magic can say that, but unless it's reinforced by the 
parents and maybe the coach, it becomes: 'Yeah, Magic, right. But we're going 
to be like you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams plays his part. "We didn't have a school eligibility rule," he said. 
"We do now. Pass or don't play. All of your subjects." 
</P>
<P>
He won two state championships and sent James Solters and Andre Hawkins on to 
college ball and college degrees. Solters went to Penn. Maybe he could have 
played at a higher level, but the coach urged him to go to the Ivy League 
before Solters even knew what the Ivy League was. Solters is coming back as 
varsity coach for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"The Malverne kid is no different in the sense that he wants to play," Williams 
said. "Andre Hawkins said, 'Coach, I want to play.' " They checked on 
Villanova's high graduation rate and Hawkins was told he could start in time. 
Hawkins told Williams: "Coach, I want to play." Jim Boeheim said Hawkins could 
play as a freshman at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no problem with Syracuse," Williams said. "Andre's mother, Mrs. Durham, 
asked, 'Hank, is he going to get a degree?' She lived to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"Andre, he still wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams did his job. Like the iceberg, the greatest part was unseen. That 
kind of guidance doesn't come from a Bill in Congress.

SACKS ON THE DECLINE AS OFFENSES ADJUST TO BIG NFL LINEBACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GARBER, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quarterback deftly drops back in the pocket, sees the strong safety 
cheating toward the line of scrimmage and automatically scans the right side 
for his tight end. Just as the arm is cocked to throw, the powerful outside 
linebacker breaks into the clear, closes quickly and ... 
</P>
<P>
... The quarterback flips the ball easily to the tight end, who has only one 
defender to beat. It's a 14-yard gain and the outside linebacker, two steps 
from gory glory, can only tap the quarterback on the shoulder pads in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
The sack of the quarterback, perhaps the single most exciting play in football 
that doesn't involve the end zone, is becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon. 
It isn't in danger of becoming extinct, but if the recent trend continues, the 
sack may be headed for the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days," says New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, referring 
to the early 1980s, "I could do anything I wanted. Now, they've got a million 
things that get in the way. They're blocking with bigger guys and getting rid 
of the ball quicker. Now, it's (difficult) getting to the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
And it's not just because Taylor has turned 30. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks have dropped steadily since 1985. In the Year of the Bears, quarterbacks 
were decked 1,306 times. In 1986, the total was 1,198 and it dropped to 1,106 
in 1987; even if the one game lost to the strike had been played, there would 
have been a substantial decline in sacks. Last season, quarterbacks were sacked 
1,035 times. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the total is 112 through two games, which projects to 896 sacks, 
or 32 per team. For comparison purposes, the Giants recorded 59 sacks in their 
championship season. The great sack artists, like Taylor, Buffalo's Bruce Smith 
and Philadelphia's Reggie White, will continue to reach the quarterback. Less 
talented athletes will encounter more resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The common misconception, even among some of the league's coaches, is that 
defenses aren't blitzing as much. This doesn't seem to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're blitzing any less," says Fritz Shurmur, in his eighth 
season as the Los Angeles Rams' defensive coordinator. "Actually, we've been in 
a more aggressive mode than in the last five years. We're coming after people, 
but the sacks aren't there. I think you have to look at the other side. 
Offenses are better prepared to handle the blitz." 
</P>
<P>
Let us count the ways: 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor, an unprecedented 6-foot-3, 245-pound combination of size and 
speed, arrived in 1981, offenses didn't know how to block him. Running backs, 
long the accepted solution to blitzing linebackers, weren't enough. Tight ends 
didn't work, either. Teams gradually learned to slide their offensive tackles 
toward Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"LT, Otis Wilson, Andre Tippett ... those guys were murdering the running backs 
who were trying to block them," Giants defensive coordinator Bill Belichick 
says. "For a while there, quarterbacks were getting hit and coughing up the 
ball all the time. Now everybody's got a big outside linebacker and everybody 
has bigger people to block them." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, most quarterbacks took a conventional seven-step drop. 
That placed them a comfortable distance from the line of scrimmage and gave 
them time to read defenses and wait for receivers to come open. Today's game is 
much faster. 
</P>
<P>
"The quarterback can't afford to sit back there any more," says Floyd Peters, 
the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator. "They take that dinky three-step 
drop. Plus, the quarterback is throwing to a spot, even before the receiver 
breaks for the ball. That's hard to defense." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for declining sacks is the shotgun formation that most teams 
employ in long-yardage situations. "That was a big change," Peters says. "If 
the guy is under center, you'll go after him a lot more. When he's back in the 
shotgun, you show blitz, then back off." 
</P>
<P>
Offenses also use the four-wide receiver set to reduce defenses' tendency to 
blitz. Peters doesn't like the increasingly wide-open game and calls it 
basketball on grass. Shurmur explains: 
</P>
<P>
"Offenses are spreading it out. They go with four wide receivers and force you 
into a (man-to-man coverage) matchup you don't like. When that happens, you're 
a little leery. You keep guys in and back up with your free safety or strong 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Now when you blitz, you know you're going to get a hit on the quarterback, but 
you also know he's probably going to get the ball there, too." 
</P>
<P>
Miami quarterback Dan Marino is the model when it comes to avoiding sacks. He 
has a lightning release, shrewd judgment and talented receivers. Against the 
New England Patriots last Sunday he went unsacked in his 14th consecutive game, 
an NFL record. That amounts to 563 pass attempts without a sack. 
</P>
<P>
These factors, plus last year's rule change that gave defenders more latitude 
when it came to incidental contact with receivers, has led to fewer pass 
rushers and more aggressive secondaries. "They're attacking us in the secondary 
now," says Ted Plumb, the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Pass coverage has come full circle in the NFL, in a 
back-to-the-future kind of way. 
</P>
<P>
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the NFC title in 1979 with a three-man pass rush 
and eight men in coverage. The defense allowed the fewest points, yards and 
passing yards that season, supporting an offense that scored only 17 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Offenses learned how to pick holes in zones with the extra time a limited rush 
allowed. Defenses were forced to adjust. By 1985, the Chicago Bears were 
sending seven and eight men after the quarterback. That was when sacks peaked. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as offenses have reacted by adding larger blockers and more of them, 
defenses are going for a more subtle approach. They are willing to sacrifice a 
running back as a blocker if they can find one matchup they like against a 
man-to-man defense. As Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said, "You can get a big play 
if you block everybody and beat one guy." 
</P>
<P>
Defenses, in turn, spend more time trying to fool the quarterback than squash 
him. "There are different coverages, coverages I haven't seen since I've been 
in the league," Giants quarterback Phil Simms says. "Coverages that go back to 
the day of George Allen." 
</P>
<P>
As Peters says, "Everybody wants to buy that one mistake. The game still comes 
down to third down and you want to make the quarterback make the wrong choice, 
if you can. By disguising coverages you can do that. It's the only real choice 
we have now."

TURNAROUND IS THEME FOR SHULA AND HIS ONCE-MIGHTY DOLPHINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who were there say Don Shula appeared close to tears after Buffalo Bills 
quarterback Jim Kelly scored on the last play of the season opener to hand the 
Miami Dolphins' coach his 10th straight loss in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
Think of it -- a Don Shula-coached team losing 10 consecutive games with Dan 
Marino at quarterback in a division it dominated for what seemed like forever. 
It's simply incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
Coming on the heels of the first winless preseason in Shula's 27 years as an 
NFL head coach, it was beginning to look as though that granite profile of his 
was vulnerable as never before. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking his head when asked about the success the Washington Redskins had 
running the ball against a weak Dolphins defense in a nationally televised 
preseason game, New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells said, "That was a mercy 
killing." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe, but Shula's defensive teams haven't earned much respect 
since a 38-16 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XIX after the 1984 
season. Shula's 278 career victories are second only to the 325 compiled by 
George Halas in 40 seasons with the Bears, but Shula's last three teams have 
failed to make the playoffs. The Dolphins' 6-10 record last year was the worst 
of his career and only the second losing season overall. 
</P>
<P>
The level of frustration and defensiveness becomes obvious when he is asked 
directly the cause of that 10-game divisional losing streak. The famous jaw 
grimaces, as Shula summarizes it this way: "We lost to New England, 6-3, and to 
Buffalo, 9-6. One of the weirdest was a 15-13 loss to the Colts. We didn't give 
up any touchdowns, and we scored two touchdowns and still lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult, but I also know there have been good times. I have faith there 
will be more good times." 
</P>
<P>
It was Monday, the day after Shula's faith was rewarded with a 24-10 victory at 
New England for the Dolphins' first AFC East win since a 37-28 victory over the 
Jets on Dec. 7, 1987, in Miami. Shula maintains an even keel in victory and 
defeat, but he sounded hopeful that the first two games are an indication the 
Dolphins are ready to begin measuring up to his standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Turnaround" is the word Shula has chosen as his theme for the season, and the 
Dolphins will be looking for more signs they are headed in the right direction 
when they meet the New York Jets (0-2) Sunday at Joe Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good after the Buffalo game, even though it was a heartbreaking 
defeat," Shula said. "We played a heck of a football game. I think the players 
felt confident going to New England." 
</P>
<P>
The return of holdout wide receiver Mark Clayton provided a lift, and Shula 
pulled a surprise by starting No. 1 draft pick Sammie Smith at running back in 
the first game after his holdout ended. Smith hinted at what he could do for 
the Dolphins by carrying seven times for 40 yards before twisting an ankle. But 
the biggest shock was that Miami recorded seven sacks for the first time in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of things to be happy about," Shula said. "The defense fought 
and scratched in the second half, particularly in getting the sacks. That's 
something we haven't done a lot of around here." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins still have problems with injuries and holdouts. Veteran inside 
linebackers John Offerdahl and Mark Brown are holding out, which severely 
weakens the interior defense, and defensive end John Bosa, the No. 1 pick in 
1987, is recovering from reconstructive surgery on his left knee but is 
expected back in another week or two. 
</P>
<P>
As for a defense described as "soft" by one NFL veteran starting quarterback 
who watched the Redskins preseason game, Shula said with some irritation, "We 
might've appeared to be playing soft, but Gerald Riggs ran for 221 yards 
against Philadelphia (Sunday), and no one has ever accused them of playing 
soft." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of injuries, Shula's offensive line, in particular, has been ill-fated 
in recent years. The worst loss was the knee injury in that Dec. 7, 1987, game 
against the Jets that ended the career of perennial Pro Bowl center Dwight 
Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year at this time, our offensive line was devastated," Shula said. "It 
was halfway through the season before we started to put things together. We're 
still having major problems." 
</P>
<P>
Against the Patriots, Shula chose to start rookie fifth-round draft pick Jeff 
Uhlenhake at center. A byproduct was a 103-yard rushing game for the Dolphins, 
who ranked 28th in the NFL in rushing last season. While Marino is one of the 
greatest passers in history, the Dolphins' run-pass ratio of 335-631 a year ago 
made them too one-dimensional, and Shula has admitted as much. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to run for the last two or three years," he said. "We've 
gone to camp with the idea each year of improving the running game. Last year 
was the worst that it's been."

WINLESS CHARGERS SEARCH FOR ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
CHIEFS WORRIED THEY'LL BECOME THE FIRST VICTIM 
</P>

<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Charger director of football operations, was asked last 
week if he had anything to say about his team's 0-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
"Not particularly," Ortmayer said. "Not that I want to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Positively chatty compared to what Ortmayer will say if the Chargers lose to 
Kansas City (1-1) at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium today. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Chargers lost their first three games was 1975. They finished 
2-12 that year. The last time Charger quarterback Jim McMahon lost three 
consecutive regular-season starts was never. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about playing the Chargers at 0-2," said first-year Chief Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer. "The thing about our business is that when people get 
backed into a corner, they tend to reach for new heights. And frankly, I'm 
concerned about the Chargers." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers reached dizzying heights last week against the Oilers, who ran and 
shot their way to a 34-27 victory. Dizzying, as in lost balance. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, the Charger defense allowed 40 points against the Raiders and 
lost by 26. That's the same Raider team Kansas City beat, 24-19, last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs feature a 35-year-old quarterback named Steve DeBerg, whom former 
49er Coach Bill Walsh once described as being "just good enough to get you 
beat." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's remark was not meant as a compliment. But Charger Coach Dan Henning 
insists there's more to DeBerg than met Walsh's discerning eye. When DeBerg was 
playing for Tampa Bay, Henning tried to bring him to Atlanta, where he was 
coaching at the time. DeBerg also has played for San Francisco and Denver. His 
backup, former Eagle Ron Jaworski, is 38. Between them they have 27 years of 
NFL experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few things between them they haven't seen," Schottenheimer 
says. "Maybe nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City has allowed fewer yards than every team but Cleveland and 
Minnesota. And the Chiefs' best player might be their youngest -- rookie 
Derrick Thomas, the fourth player selected in last spring's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a younger version of Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor, at 6-3 and 234 
pounds single-handedly stopped the Raiders in the fourth period last week, 
sacking quarterback Jay Schroeder on their last two plays. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas will take on running backs, tight ends and offensive linemen. It doesn't 
seem to matter. Typically, he lines up on the right outside. But, like Taylor, 
an offense can never be sure from where he will come. Henning says he hopes to 
control Thomas' starting point by motion or formation. But he says there are no 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
If Kansas City sends Thomas from the left side, he could be matched against 
James FitzPatrick. FitzPatrick will probably start in place of regular right 
tackle Brett Miller, who had a surgical screw removed from his knee Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
FitzPatrick, a first-round draft choice in 1986, hasn't started since 1987 and 
hasn't played a down in the Chargers' two losses. 
</P>
<P>
Nervous? 
</P>
<P>
"I've never played in a game where I wasn't nervous," FitzPatrick says. "If 
some guy's lined up across from you and he's trying to tear the quarterback's 
head off, you better be nervous and have some sense of urgency about what 
you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
But urgency is hard to define in the stalled negotiations between the Chargers 
and running back Gary Anderson. Anderson was the Charger most valuable player 
in 1988 and averaged 174 yards rushing in two victories over the Chiefs last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Henning still hasn't settled on a replacement for Anderson. His leading rusher 
last week was former tight end Rod Bernstine, with 24 yards. His three running 
backs -- Victor Floyd, Marion Butts and Tim Spencer -- combined for 24 yards on 
13 carries. Rookie Butts, at least, is tied for the NFL lead with four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Henning has settled, for now, on a punter. He is Hank Ilesic, who punted in the 
Canadian Football League this year. Ilesic replaces Lewis Colbert, who ranked 
last in the AFC with a woeful 27.9 net average. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Chief rushing game, ranked 22d in the league last year, has 
revived itself. Led by 260-pound fullback Christian Okoye, the Chiefs rushed 
for 152 yards against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to get a lot of guys to the ball against a big back 
like Okoye," says Jim Collins, the Charger right inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense, exploited last week by Houston's four-wide receiver 
offense, might have less trouble with the Chiefs' attack. Kansas City's basic 
long-yardage package calls for three wide receivers, a tight end and a running 
back. "Though they may line up in similar formations to what Houston did," says 
Charger outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense failed to sack Houston quarterback Warren Moon. That 
prompted Charger owner Alex Spanos to criticize the "three-man prevent" defense 
employed by defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. Lynn said Spanos was probably 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder Ortmayer has little to say right now. 
</P>
<P>
Charger notes 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than three weeks since rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver 
broke his left collarbone against Phoenix in the final exhibition game. 
Tolliver, eligible to come off injured reserve after the Oct. 15 game against 
Seattle, said he hopes to start throwing by the middle of next week. "I'd like 
to have started this past week," Tolliver said. But Charger officials have 
limited his exercise to riding a stationary bicycle. . . . Charger Coach Dan 
Henning says the onside kick call that went against his team late last Sunday 
wasn't the only bad decision made by officials. According to Henning, his team 
benefited from a separate horrible call. "When they (Houston) got that punt 
blocked, that should have been a safety," he said. "That's ridiculous, that 
call. It shouldn't have been out on the one-yard line. It wasn't even close." 
But the officials gave the ball to the Chargers on the Oiler one after Elvis 
Patterson blocked a Greg Montgomery punt. And Charger rookie Marion Butts 
scored one play later.

YOUNG HEAVYWEIGHT MORRISON IS PROMISING

Tommy Morrison can hit. Hard. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old heavyweight has won all 16 of his bouts since he turned 
professional in November, 1988 -- half of them by first-round knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy happens to be a hell of a puncher," says Al Braverman, boxing 
director of Don King Productions. "If he hits you, you're going to go down." 
</P>
<P>
Just over a year ago, the blond-haired boxer was practicing on the front porch 
of his family home in Jay, Okla., by slugging a duffel bag stuffed with old 
clothes and sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
These days, many of his fights are carried nationwide by ESPN, the cable sports 
network. He is on the undercard of the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran fight 
Dec. 7 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison's power punching has stunned opponents and boxing enthusiasts alike, 
but his managers know it alone won't make him a champion. Morrison's pro boxing 
career has taken off so fast that he has yet to master some basic techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, whose brother, father and grandfather boxed as professionals or 
amateurs, ditched plans to take a football scholarship at a small Kansas 
college when his mother urged him to compete for the 1988 Kansas City, Mo., 
Golden Gloves championship. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who had never had any formal boxing training, won the title. 
</P>
<P>
He fought his way into the Olympic boxing trials, but lost a match by decision 
to Ray Mercer, who went on to win the gold in Seoul. After beating Morrison, 
Mercer said of the Oklahoma native: "The kid's going places." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison's raw talent attracted the admiration of John Brown, the owner of a 
boxing products manufacturing and distributing company in suburban Kansas City, 
who became Morrison's co-manager and trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy previously never had any type of skilled professional training until we 
got ahold of him in July 1988," said Brown, who is himself new in the 
professional boxing circuit. He had trained amateur boxers before but never a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
Brown wants to let Morrison get more seasoning by gradually pitting him against 
more experienced fighters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly not going to rush him," Brown said. "He's got a lot of 
untapped skill we want to tap. That takes a lot of hard training, and that 
takes time." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 215-pound Morrison, who last year moved to the Kansas City suburb of 
Shawnee, won't be facing the likes of heavyweight champion Mike Tyson for a 
couple of years yet. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a two-year timetable," Morrison said in an interview at a high school 
track where he runs laps. "Time's on my side. I'm a young guy." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said he still wants to learn how to bob his head, slip punches and 
develop a stance that would make him a more elusive target. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing sunglasses, a black tank top and shorts covered with drawings of the 
cartoon character Garfield, Morrison looked like someone headed for a beachside 
fraternity bash. His youthful looks and unassuming manner, however, belie a 
fighter who moves in quickly for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't like to see a sloppy fight, to see heavyweights wallow around," 
he said. "They like to see exciting fighters." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison's concussive left-hook has created some excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Just 15 seconds into the first round of a fight on Sept. 5, Morrison felled Ric 
Ennis with a left to the head. Morrison won later in the round after delivering 
a few more lefts. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cayton, who managed Tyson until last year, has said Morrison's left hook 
is as good as Joe Frazier's. Cayton is now Morrison's other co-manager. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Morrison's opponents have barely had time to lay a glove on him 
before being knocked out, critics say it is unclear whether Morrison himself 
can withstand a hard punch. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison contends he has taken many punches, in brawls while growing up in Jay 
-- where he said fights were sparked by racial tension between whites and 
Indians -- and while fighting as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also say Morrison has faced inferior boxers. 
</P>
<P>
Peyton Sher, a matchmaker who has organized fights for Tyson and who was 
temporarily with Morrison's camp this year, said Morrison "hasn't progressed 
with his opponents."

"What you try to do in developing a fighter is put him in with fighters with 
different styles and experience," Sher said. "They're putting Tommy in with 
experienced fighters, but experienced losing fighters." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown insisted that Morrison was learning from his opponents, and that the 
young boxer would face tougher competition as he got more experience. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison is eager to get the seasoning behind him and speaks about his lust for 
the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
He said Tyson, accompanied by an entourage of aides, fans and reporters, 
recently saw one of his bouts from a ringside seat. 
</P>
<P>
"After the fight, I was watching Tyson get up at ringside, watching people 
swarming around him, with flashbulbs popping, and that made me jealous," 
Morrison said. "I was thinking, 'That could be me -- if I bust my butt the next 
two years, that could be me."' 
</P>
<P>
Braverman, who has been watching Morrison's progress, said that may well 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy is a very brilliant, bright young prospect," he said. "If he gets a 
little polish on him and they bring him along as they've been bringing him 
along, he could step into the ring with Tyson."

COWBOYS' NEW ERA STARTS OFF SLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DENLINGER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Tex Schramm received a phone call from Don Shula in the early morning last 
Feb. 24, he knew a run of football like none other was about to end. His team, 
America's Team to many, soon would belong to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm, Tom Landry and Gil Brandt never owned the Dallas Cowboys. All they did 
was nurture them, from expansion birth in 1960, into as consistently fine a 
team as anything in sport. 
</P>
<P>
Under Schramm, the investment of the original owner, Clint Murchison Jr., grew 
from $550,000 to $83 million. Under Schramm, the investment of the second 
owner, Bum Bright, grew in five years from $83 million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm surely sensed from his conversation with Shula that the third owner, 
Jerry Jones, would be running the shop himself. The call was to inform Schramm 
that Jimmy Johnson was making hush-hush inquiries about hiring Shula's son 
David as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
So the deal was done after all. Without Schramm's knowledge, Jones had bought 
the Cowboys and hired his own man, Johnson, as coach. A day later, Landry 
officially was gone. Then Schramm. Finally, after he'd helped with the draft, 
Brandt was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Jones admitted to a huge public-relations fumble in not telling Landry his fate 
until everybody else knew it. (Schramm actually broke the news, calling Landry 
off the golf course. True to character, Landry continued the round. Whether his 
score went up or down was not reported.) 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," Jones said, "I'll always be thought of as the Darth Vader in this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly in such football changes of command, matters quickly fade, if not 
totally pass away. New management assumes control. Locks are changed, if 
necessary, and the old guard slinks into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Not with the Cowboys. Not with Schramm, who has been such a forceful -- and 
public -- figure in the National Football League for more than four decades. 
Not with Landry, who in the mid-'50s devised a defense (the 4-3) still popular 
and who eventually may be regarded as the league's premier coach of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the swift and scathing reaction to Jones and Johnson that a book ("The 
Landry Legend: Grace Under Pressure") reveals the relevant details of their 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
To opponents, the on-the-field read so far this season seems pleasant enough. 
What Redskins fans ought to enjoy watching today in Texas Stadium, besides 
victory for their guys, is at quarterback and in the owners box. Troy Aikman is 
as gifted as advertised, accurate on long and short passes. And tough. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers in exhibition season tried to scramble Aikman's mind and tarnish his 
first-in-the-draft reputation, with three blitzes from the strong safety and 
one from a cornerback. Down four times, the rookie bounced up unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
Two regular-season games have seemed enough for football sophisticates in 
Dallas to sense that Aikman is for real and lots of those around him are not. 
Possibly to direct attention elsewhere when the Cowboys defense is summoned to 
duty, Jones has arranged for Elizabeth Taylor to be among his guests. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Schramm, Landry and Brandt did not leave much more than Herschel 
Walker and a reputation even Johnson probably cannot negotiate into more than a 
a couple of victories this season. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, the Cowboys had been in serious decline, suffering their first 
losing season in 22 years in 1986 and earning the rights to Aikman with a 
worst-in-the-league 3-13 in '88. It took a little longer, but The Cycle also 
had nailed the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
The other wondrous teams of the 1970s, the Raiders, Dolphins and Steelers, also 
had suffered from the combination of poor position in the draft, harder 
schedules and less-obvious factors that erode success in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas had avoided that, with players-for-high-draft-choices trades that 
brought Too Tall Jones, Randy White and Tony Dorsett. Partly because of 
injuries, Dorsett in 1977 was the last spectacular high-round draftee. 
</P>
<P>
If the Cowboys under Landry in 1989 had been no more successful than the 
Cowboys under Landry in 1988, Schramm would have been faced with a decision 
Jones allowed him to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it all was the best thing that could have happened to Tom and myself," 
Schramm told author Bob St. John. "It might have happened a little too quickly, 
but as it turned out Tom had an opportunity to go out with a lot of class and 
with people showing a lot of feeling for him. He became a hero again to 
everybody, even to those who had been so critical of him. . . . And with both 
of us gone, it closed out an era." 
</P>
<P>
Many who earlier thought Johnson drafted well are not so sure. The coach said: 
"I don't want to deal in maybes." Yet of all the rookies on a bad team, only 
Aikman has been able to crack the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien will be pleased to know that the Saints' Bobby 
Hebert (16 for 19) and the Falcons' Chris Miller (21 for 29) were close to 
unerring against the Dallas defense. At 38, Too Tall Jones is a reminder of how 
Doomsday can turn to Gloomsday. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman has been intercepted four times in two games. But three of those were 
up-for-grabs throws near halftime or the end of games and another occurred when 
the receiver on a timing pattern slipped. Johnson having discovered Walker in 
the second game will be helpful, surely a reason the sloppy-tackling Redskins 
are only favored by less than a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After a 3-1 exhibition season, most Cowboys fans and many Cowboys officials and 
players were hopeful. Still, a conversation in the clubhouse indicated optimism 
was not rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," said one player, "we get to play Green Bay twice this season." 
</P>
<P>
"In Green Bay," said another, "they're saying: 'We get to play Dallas twice.' "

REDSKIN RECOVERY LIES IN SENSE OF INSECURITY

The way to keep Gerald Riggs fumble-free this week is as simple as a Dexter 
Manley introduction. Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
During warm-ups before the best 0-2 teams in football collide Sunday in Texas 
Stadium, Manley grabs Riggs and walks him over to meet only the second coach 
the Dallas Cowboys have ever known, Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"My college coach at Oklahoma State," Manley tells Riggs as handshakes are 
being exchanged. As the chitchat ends, Riggs places his right hand atop 
Johnson's head and gets it gooed up with industrial-strength hair spray. He 
could palm a wrecking ball for two weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
Just a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the Redskins can bounce back and the Cowboys can bounce up, the 
answers are: yes and yes. 
</P>
<P>
Washingtonians, Terry Bradshaw and other deep football thinkers are concerned 
about how the Redskins will react to Stupefacient Sunday. Popular wisdom says 
the depression from such a sudden and crushing defeat will cling for quite some 
time, perhaps through the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
It had better not. 
</P>
<P>
The down period from losing so late and so bizarrely to the Eagles should last 
about as long as did the down period from losing so late and so bizarrely six 
days earlier to the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
All the Redskins did Sunday was run up a 13-0 lead before the Eagles ran their 
fifth play from scrimmage. So much for lingering gloom. And that early binge 
begs the question: Has a team ever scored touchdowns on its first two plays and 
lost fumbles on its last two plays? 
</P>
<P>
Most players and coaches are smarter than most fans. And the Redskins know 
three truths: that an eighth of their livelihood for the year already is over, 
that they can be replaced more quickly than most manual laborers and that the 
billionaire who pays them is nearly as impatient as he is rich. 
</P>
<P>
That sense-of-urgency reality tends to inspire. And in a hurry. Which means 
that the Redskins are more likely to play harder after losing to the Giants and 
Eagles than if they'd beaten them. 
</P>
<P>
"So much good gets lost in a loss," Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs said. Such as the 
fact that the winless Redskins have scored more points than the lossless 
Giants, Cardinals and 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone not obsessed with sport's bottom line has to be enthralled with the 
Redskins so far. Who possibly could offer more -- and such a variety of -- 
entertainment? Treason proceedings can begin immediately, but I would rather 
watch the Redskins lose as they did against the Giants and Eagles than win by 
the likes of 6-3 and 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
How anyone can gain 949 yards in two games and fail to win is compelling. 
</P>
<P>
How one of the steadiest and most productive runners for so long can fumble his 
reputation so quickly is staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Also, how one of the superior passing performances in NFL history, by Randall 
Cunningham, could go largely unappreciated is embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stay around long enough," said Gibbs, who has, "some things like (the 
amazing unraveling of the Eagles game) are going to happen. That was the first 
time for me." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs says he is "not a destiny guy." For him, there is a reason -- and blame 
-- for what at times defies belief. The rest of us are bedazzled by style; the 
coach is angry over those nine turnovers in two games (six lost fumbles and 
three interceptions). 
</P>
<P>
The coach also must wonder if now and then defense for the Redskins is a 
misnomer. Phil Simms, Mark Bavaro and Odessa Turner of the Giants and 
Cunningham, Cris Carter, Mike Quick and Keith Jackson of the Eagles are 
big-time players. Still, shouldn't a big-time defense surrender less than 864 
yards in two games? 
</P>
<P>
It can't be too brain-draining to coach in the NFL, because the Eagles' Buddy 
Ryan sees the same problems with the Redskins that lots of Washington fans do: 
the safeties and the interior defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
The cheery news for the Redskins was that the Eagles gained only 65 yards 
rushing on 28 carries; the sobering news was that a couple of Keiths, tight end 
Jackson and running back Byars, caught a total of 20 passes, most of them after 
running very free fairly close to the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
If a short pass guarantees eight to 12 yards, who cares about runs routinely 
stuffed? 
</P>
<P>
When wide receiver Ricky Sanders pushed Wes Hopkins out of bounds with 57 
seconds left, it put him one tackle ahead of Manley for the game, in-the-grasp 
sack excluded. But Manley often was split way outside a linebacker against the 
Eagles, the better to get his sack sights trained on Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully," said middle linebacker Neal Olkewicz, "we've used up our freak 
play allotment (against the Giants and Eagles). The worst possible thing you 
can think can happen Sunday actually does. But freak plays aside, we had lots 
of chances to put it away." 
</P>
<P>
For different reasons, the Cowboys are even more mysterious. Veterans such as 
Olkewicz and Manley will not have time in Dallas to think much about a familiar 
opponent who looks so strange. 
</P>
<P>
New ownership. New front office. New coaches. New arrogance. But Johnson in his 
first season only has to win once to improve on Tom Landry's opening act. That 
expansion team in 1960 was 0-11-1, the tie coming against the Giants in the 
next-to-last game. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs surely will try to portray Johnson's young and talent-thin Cowboys as 
being as awesome as some of Landry's experienced and superbly stocked Cowboys. 
The porous offensive line to Gibbs will seem Hog mean, those phantom 
linebackers as mobile and nasty as Butkus and Bell in their prime. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, even veterans weary of such Gibbs sermons will pay attention this 
time. Like Riggs, they need to get a better grip on things.

DICKERSON GLAD THAT 'REUNION' IS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ANAHEIM, Calif.

<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Dickerson has a remarkable ability to raise the hackles of people out 
here. Maybe because he's a confident kind of guy, or because he's good looking, 
or because he's rich, or because he thought he was worth more than $682,000 a 
year and said so, constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Take the fans at Sunday's Rams-Indianapolis Colts game, Dickerson's first 
appearance here since he was traded to the Colts in October 1987. First they 
booed. Then they threw play money at him -- lots of it -- as he left the field 
at Anaheim Stadium. In between they serenaded him with derisive "Ehhhriiiic, 
Ehhhriiiic" chants. 
</P>
<P>
At first Dickerson was glib, saying, "If it was real money we would have 
stopped and picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
But later he had more to say. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really a joke," he said of the play money. "This is a game and you get 
paid for it. You can take all those fans in the stands and you can line them 
up. If they think it's fun let them come out and try and play the game of 
football. If they don't want to get paid ... this is not a game where you're 
just thankful to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a guy with a lot of talent. We have a lot of guys in the NFL with a lot of 
talent. Talent. If they want the talent they have to pay for it. Just as simple 
as that. It's a job. Just like you have a job. People want to look at it as ... 
I guess we should come out and play for what they offer. But that's just 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson knows about market value. He's known about it for years, which is one 
reason he gets in so much trouble when he talks. That's why he can, in one 
breath, declare Jim Everett deserves the $2 million per year he's getting, 
after sharply criticizing the quarterback at the time of Dickerson's trade to 
the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
But Dickerson knows football too, which is why intelligent people can still 
argue almost two years later that the Colts got the better of the blockbuster 
trade. This while the Rams wound up with seven players, including three running 
backs: Cleveland Gary, Greg Bell and Gaston Green. And while the Bills got a 
linebacker in Cornelius Bennett who could be an all-pro for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Including Sunday's 116-yard performance, Dickerson has rushed for 10,137 yards 
in a little less than five seasons. His critics would point to the footballs, 
bushels of them, Dickerson has given up through fumbles in important and 
semi-important games. They would say the Colts have underachieved despite his 
presence and are stumbling again at 0-2 this season. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the 0-2 goes, Colts offensive lineman Chris Hinton said, "Come on. 
Who's doing our schedule? The 49ers (a 30-24 loss) and the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
And the other? 
</P>
<P>
"When I played (for the Rams) I played hard," Dickerson said. "If they forget 
they forget. No. 29, he's gone. That's what'll happen when I retire. They'll 
forget. Some people will remember. But when I played I did play hard. No matter 
if I griped, if I complained. ... I still played hard, no matter what I said." 
</P>
<P>
So it was that in defeat, in a game in which he really wasn't much of a factor, 
Dickerson still was the center of attention. After the Rams finished beating 
Indianapolis, 31-17, Dickerson was engulfed by former teammates and members of 
the local media. Players such as linemen Jackie Slater and Irv Pankey and 
defensive tackle Doug Reed, who put his ex-teammate down oh-so-gently on the 
first Colts offensive play for a three-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know whether to slam him or kiss him," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to see all the guys," Dickerson said. "I have a lot of friends on 
the team, even though a lot of you guys make me out to be such a villain, a bad 
guy. But those guys really know that I'm a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson's problems with the Rams, you see, had very little to do with his 
teammates. Before Sunday's game he asked Rams wide receiver Henry Ellard, who 
has had imbroglios with team management but is less outspoken about them, how 
he was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has always maintained that his beef with the team specifically was 
with Vice President John Shaw and Coach John Robinson. He clashed with Shaw 
because Shaw wouldn't see things Dickerson's way and ultimately made the 
three-team trade involving the Colts and Buffalo Bills. He was upset with 
Robinson because the coach wouldn't back him in his demands. 
</P>
<P>
So he lashed out, choosing his words less than carefully, whether taken out of 
context or not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much less (disturbing) than you might think," Robinson said on his 
television show this week. "Eric and a lot of the players are friends. That all 
happened two years ago and the trade was good for (all three) teams." 
</P>
<P>
All week, Dickerson was even-tempered. He had said he wasn't going to play 
against Rams management, but against his old friends and teammates. He tried to 
fall back on "this is just another game" rhetoric. That's not Dickerson. That's 
for coaches, who talk about distractions and other such evil things. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed a little more excited" before the game, Hinton said. "I guess that's 
about as excited as I've seen him before a game. It was pretty obvious. I'm 
sure he would be willing to give up the 100 yards or whatever he got for a 
victory. Which we all would." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was watching me to see what kind of reaction I had," Dickerson said. 
"I wanted to win, sure. I want to win any football game, this one more so. I 
don't think I was really nervous. I'm always a little nervous before every 
game. Maybe I was a little bit more nervous before this one." 
</P>
<P>
He played well, averaging 5.5 yards a carry and tying Lydell Mitchell for the 
most 100-yard games (16) in the franchise's history. He had a touchdown. He 
didn't fumble. But he didn't dominate, as the game became a shootout between 
Everett and Colts quarterback Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard played the game of his life, catching 12 passes for 230 yards and three 
touchdowns. Everett set a team record with 14 straight completions. That 
performance overshadowed Dickerson's effort and made his running useless in the 
fourth quarter, when the Colts fell behind. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson wasn't in tears afterward. Neither were any of the other Colts. After 
all there are 14 games left, and Indianapolis has a history of poor 
performances out of the gate but furious kicks at the end. 
</P>
<P>
And the jointly jilted lovers, having used up all their invective, can get on 
with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over," Dickerson said. "I'm glad. Man you don't even know. It's like now 
the season should be over for me."

GETTING JIMMIED INTO A FULL GIANTS STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, The Washington Post

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen years on the Jimmy Hoffa Watch, and I can finally rest easy thanks to 
Playboy magazine. In "Hoffa Goes Deep," federally protected witness Donald 
"Tony The Greek" Frankos claims Hoffa's dismembered body was mixed into cement 
and buried under the end zone -- the old coffin corner -- near Section 107 of 
Giants Stadium. Case closed. Geraldo will be there with bulldozers and a film 
crew in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
So congratulations to the winners in the "Where's Jimmy?" pool. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't have Section 107. My entries were: 1) Off ramp, Jersey Turnpike, 
Rahway exit; 2) MX missile silo, shuttling on the underground railroad tracks 
between Utah and Wyoming; 3) Trump Plaza; 4) coaxial cable, Weather Channel; 5) 
trunk, red 1974 Mercury Cougar, satellite parking, O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
Before the winner claims his prize, though, I have some questions: I'm not 
convinced of the exact coordinates of Jimmy's remnants. (Leaving aside for the 
moment what bad seats they are, end zone for Jimmy Hoffa? One of the all-time 
greats stuck for eternity down low in a corner? I thought Hoffa would get a 
better seat than that -- after all, he got to the stadium so early. Hoffa won't 
stand for these seats much longer. By now he's surely got his name on the Dead 
Celebrity Waiting List.) The story says Jimmy was fileted, wrapped in plastic 
bags -- shameful neglect of the environment, not using a biodegradeable product 
-- and buried in cement. But the Giants insist there isn't any cement under the 
end zone. I'm satisfied Hoffa's inside Giants Stadium, but doesn't it seem more 
logical a Teamsters man like Jimmy would be part of the concession stands? 
</P>
<P>
FBI: Any late word on Hoffa? 
</P>
<P>
NFL: Yeah, he's doubtful this Sunday against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffa is hardly the only famous dead guy in the Meadowlands swamp. Anywhere 
they built Giants Stadium they'd have landed on someone. (Nor is Hoffa the only 
guy to get buried in Giants Stadium. It often happened to Jay Schroeder.) But 
the moral question is: Should Hoffa, shall we say, remain there? 
</P>
<P>
Hoffa's a Detroit guy. (Well, okay, now he's a Jersey guy.) I figure him for a 
Lions fan. It's got to be disturbing Hoffa's family that he's all wrapped up, 
so to speak, with the Giants. Out of fairness, the Giants could send him to the 
Silverdome for proper interment. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, so long as Hoffa's there, the Giants ought to make use of him. 
There will surely be banners draped over Section 107 renaming it "Jimmy's 
Joint" or "Hoffa's Heaven." The organist will play songs in Hoffa's honor: "Go 
Jimmy Go," "Shake, Rattle and Roll" and "Look For The Union Label." Instead of 
calling for his wide receiver to run a "fade pattern" into the end zone, Phil 
Simms should bark, "Blue right, Z-68, Hoffa! On two. Break." When one of Sean 
Landetta's punts mistakenly lands in the end zone, Bill Parcells could scream, 
"I told you to pooch it, not give me a Hoffa!" 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post has already compiled a list of Hoffa jokes that include: The 
Jimmy Hoffa movie will be called "Turf Guys Don't Dance"; the Giants will be 
penalized for putting 12 men on the field; At last, the Giants have a deep 
threat; Hoffa gets penalized for intentional grounding. I'm assuming CBS will 
take due note of the story on the telecast Sunday. John Madden can use his 
Telestrater to diagram the precise route Hoffa took to the end zone. " ... And 
then, BAM, they dumped him in the oil drum, and, BOOM BOOM, they drove him 
through the Lincoln Tunnel. ... " 
</P>
<P>
Do you think this could become a trend, burying celebrities in stadiums? Is it 
possible we will hear radio bulletins like: "Vanna White announced today she 
wants to be buried in the Rose Bowl. She said she knows all the letters, she'll 
be comfortable there." 
</P>
<P>
What would this do to the price of tickets? Would you spend more for a seat 
directly above a dead celebrity? Years ago, before I worked here, I came to 
Washington on assignment, and stayed at the ritzy Mayflower. On the door to my 
room was a plaque proclaiming Ethel Merman had slept there. THERE'S NO BUSINESS 
LIKE SHOW. ... Pipe down, Ethel, you're waking up the whole floor. I was 
impressed. I'd have coughed up another five bucks for La Merm. A lot of people 
might go for an extra deuce to sit on top of a revered dead person. (It 
suggests a new stadium bus tour: Graves of the Stars.) A seat on the 40-yard 
line might go for $50 with Babe Ruth buried underneath. On the other hand, the 
same seat might only fetch $23.95 if the bones you offered were Forrest 
Tucker's. (Of course we go higher for Paul Lynde, because it's a center seat.) 
What would you pay for Jim Nabors? For D.B. Cooper? Rory Calhoun? Zsa Zsa 
Gabor? Jerry Lewis? (I know they're not all dead yet; it's hypothetical.) Let's 
say you could get two over Orson Welles? Or a skybox right over The Osmonds? 
</P>
<P>
The marketing details would have to be worked out, but you can see how the 
shrine aspect could boost an owner's profit. I suspect they'll try to determine 
how viable the dead celebrity concept is by taking some body on tour. And who 
better than Elvis? (who's either dead or bored.) You book him before NBA games: 
Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden, The Spectrum, Capital Centre -- the 
places he played while he was alive. (People lined up in the rain to see King 
Tut, a 14-year-old whose voice hadn't even changed. You don't think they'd wait 
10 deep for Elvis?) You bring the coffin to the jump ball circle, play the 
opening of "One Night With You," you kill the lights, set off a smoke bomb and 
tell the people just what you told them last time, "Elvis has left the arena."

FREEDOM BOWL'S STARR CALLS NEW SCOUTING RULE UNWORKABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press boxes at college football games across the country will be minus a few 
orange and turquoise and Chartreuse sports jackets for at least another month. 
The jackets belong to postseason bowl scouts, who earlier this year agreed to 
stay away from games until Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Many welcomed the move. Others went along with it a bit more grudgingly; for 
instance, Tom Starr, executive director of the Dec. 30 Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's not a workable rule," Starr said this week from the game's 
headquarters in Anaheim. "There are too many loopholes in it. It was done more 
for the New Year's Day bowls than the non-New Year's Day games." 
</P>
<P>
Among the loopholes Starr is alluding to is that bowls with conference 
affiliations can send scouts to see games at conference sites, such as when 
Penn State visits Texas on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Or that bowls can visit the schools which participated in last year's game, 
giving the Fiesta Bowl clearance to play host to a party at Notre Dame this 
weekend. Or that any bowl can send scouts and have them sit in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the College Bowl Assn. meeting in San Diego last 
April, presumably to cut down on the speculation that begins every September 
and goes on until the invitations are sent out in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
It was also done to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not very cost-efficient for us," Starr said. "Take this weekend, for 
example. Normally, I could go to see Ohio State at USC and Michigan at UCLA. 
That's not to say we're going to get any of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, if Michigan and Ohio State drop out of the picture for some other 
games, we're going to have to scout them somewhere down the road." 
</P>
<P>
To the major bowls, the new rule will have little effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The word 'scouting' has been a misnomer," said Bruce Skinner, the Fiesta 
Bowl's executive director. "We're really on a sales mission. The only reason 
you went out in September is because the other guy was going out." 
</P>
<P>
"If this hadn't been done, you would have seen eight to 10 scouts at the 
Michigan-Notre Dame game last week," Cotton Bowl executive director Jim Brock 
said earlier this week from Dallas. "But in the long run, it doesn't change 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not for the major postseason games such as the Rose Bowl, which is 
committed to taking the Big 10 and Pac-10 champions. Or the Cotton, which takes 
the Southwest Conference winner and a highly ranked opponent. Or the Orange 
(Big Eight vs. independent) and Sugar (Southeastern vs. independent). 
</P>
<P>
But for the have-nots, it could turn into a big-time problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to scramble," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Starr was reported to be scrambling last weekend. He was spotted at, and later 
quoted about, the Oregon State-Washington State game. Oops. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the Ohio State game at the Coliseum Saturday, USC Coach Larry Smith 
has an 0-4 record against Big 10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
This after Trojan coaches had combined to win 17 straight against the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
One team that needn't worry about the bowl picture is SMU, which came back from 
the so-called "death penalty" to win its first game since Nov. 15, 1986. The 
Mustangs beat Connecticut last Saturday in Dallas, 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been saying all year that 'You can't . . . you can't . . . you 
can't, but we did," SMU Coach Forrest Gregg said after his team of mostly 
first-year players overcame a 30-14 deficit going into the fourth quarter to 
beat the Division I-AA Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
The victory must have been even more gratifying for the one player who stayed 
around while the program was shut down. Fifth-year receiver Mitchell Glieber, 
the son of the late CBS sportscaster Frank Glieber, caught eight passes for 117 
yards, including a 43-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bowen, who transferred to Georgia and later returned, caught the 
game-winner, a four-yard pass with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M tailback Darren Lewis was a dark horse candidate for the Heisman 
Trophy this year, having been the nation's second-leading rusher last year 
(1,692 yards) behind Heisman winner Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State. But Lewis 
hasn't made it out of the gate, with only 150 yards in the Aggies' first three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
This week's game between unbeaten Arkansas (1-0) and undefeated Mississippi 
(3-0) marks the first time since the series was renewed in 1981 that both 
schools are unbeaten going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Though second-ranked Miami has suddenly become the hottest football ticket in 
town, selling more season's tickets (52,000) than the Dolphins for the first 
time, Hurricanes fans can still be a tough sell. Junior quarterback Craig 
Erickson heard some boos during last week's 31-3 victory over the California 
Bears. Erickson threw four interceptions and three touchdown passes against the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear them, and I hope that's not true," first-year Miami Coach Dennis 
Erickson (no relation) said when asked about the boos. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing for 281 yards in his debut against Wisconsin two weeks ago, 
Erickson was being touted as having a more successful first outing than any of 
his four famous predecessors. But consider this: Jim Kelly had 280 yards 
against Penn State, while Bernie Kosar (223), Vinny Testaverde (278) and Steve 
Walsh (234) all opened up against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Erickson's yardage stat) looks good on TV," one Hurricane cynic said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one member of the Cal coaching staff wasn't impressed with the 
Hurricanes. "There are five teams in the Pac-10 better than Miami," linebacker 
coach Denny Creehan said. "Print that." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears didn't make any fans with a pizza shop near campus. After ordering 42 
large pies from a chain called "Fatboys" on Friday night before the team left 
for Miami, the shop's manager received a call after the pies had been made. The 
message: "Hold the pepperoni, and everything else". 
</P>
<P>
Did you see the feeble onside-kick attempt by Michigan with 4:08 remaining in 
last Saturday's 24-19 loss to Notre Dame in Ann Arbor? It went three yards, hit 
a Michigan player in the back of the leg, and the ball was awarded to the 
Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Many second-guessed the move, not the least of whom was Michigan Coach Bo 
Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler justified his decision to try it so early by saying that the 
Fighting Irish hadn't been passing (only two the entire game) and once they got 
possession "they'd . . . kill too much time." Also, the Wolverines only had one 
timeout left. But after what happened if I had to do it all over again, I 
promise I'd kick it deep." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of second-guessing some moves on that play, how about Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz using starting quarterback Tony Rice on the front line of the return 
team. Holtz kiddingly calls that front line his "Allstate" team, because "we're 
in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
But don't you think the nation's top college football program can find anyone 
else with good hands besides Rice? 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Week: From Iowa Coach Hayden Fry after the Hawkeyes lost at home 
to Oregon, 44-6: "I can imagine every other team on our schedule licking their 
chops after this score. We've done a number on a lot of foes over the years, 
and this will be payback time for them."

CSUN PULLS OUT A 31-28 VICTORY OVER CENTRAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chalk up another statistic for the circular file. 
</P>
<P>
Up until two weeks ago, Central (Okla.) State had a 59-7-1 record over a 
12-season span when leading at the half. 
</P>
<P>
That record is now 59-9-1. And 0-1 in the past day during games in which it led 
in the final 1:20. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge drove 59 yards for the game-winning touchdown in the final 
minute Saturday for a 31-28 victory over Central State before a crowd of 3,050 
at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sherdrick Bonner, CSUN's quarterback who spent much of the game either on his 
back or scrambling for his life, hit Anthony Harris with a 17-yard scoring pass 
with 15 seconds left to pull out the win for the Matadors (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Just following directions, he said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"(Harris) signaled to me to run a fade route and I caught his signal," Bonner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the final drive was a minute-long Bonner-at-the-Improv. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's winning march started at its own 41 with only 80 seconds remaining. 
Bonner passed to Albert Fann for six yards, then scrambled for six more and a 
first down at the Central State 47. 
</P>
<P>
But after a nine-yard loss on a sack and an imcomplete pass, the Matadors were 
facing third and 19 at their own 44. 
</P>
<P>
No problem for Bonner, as the cool junior found Tony Young over the middle for 
a 29-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
After another incomplete pass, Bonner scrambled for three yards, then hit Young 
for five more on the Central State 19. 
</P>
<P>
That set up a fourth and two and Bonner again called his own number, diving for 
a first down. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, he found Harris in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Abo Velasco, who made three field goals and was perfect after touchdowns, added 
the extra point for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a helluva team," said Fann, CSUN's tailback who emerged battered and 
bruised after rushing for a game-high 137 yards in 25 carries. "They're the 
fastest team we've played against." 
</P>
<P>
The Bronchos led at the half, 21-10, but lost that advantage in the third 
quarter when CSUN rallied to tie. They fell behind with less than four minutes 
remaining, then went ahead on a 40-yard pass from Ben Morrison to Glen Braxton 
with 1:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
Fann's second touchdown of the game, a three-yard run, tied the score, 21-21, 
with 3:24 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was set up by a spectacular interception by Preston Hayslette, who pulled in 
a pass that was deflected by Clayton Bamberg, CSUN's safety, at the Central 
State 38. 
</P>
<P>
Terry West, the Bronchos' tight end, sustained what later was diagnosed as a 
broken neck on the play. He and teammate James Caldwell both went for 
Morrison's pass, along with Bamberg, causing a collision. 
</P>
<P>
West was taken off the field by ambulance and driven to Northridge Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The interception was one of five Central State turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's play was also sloppy. The Matadors fumbled three times -- all in the 
first half -- and were penalized 11 times for 85 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Central State converted two fumbles into touchdowns in a span of 1:16 during 
the second quarter.

HARPER WINS IMPROBABLE SAUGUS SPORTSMAN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Harper of Tarzana capped the celebrated 50th season of Saugus Speedway 
with a spectacular rally before 3,844 spectators Saturday night to claim his 
first Sportsman division title. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, 34, finished sixth in the 40-lap main event, the final points race of 
the season. More importantly, however, Harper finished two positions ahead of 
pre-race points leader Keith Spangler of Northridge -- a value of four points 
-- to edge Spangler by a single point to claim an unofficial track 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler entered the evening as the division's points leader, three points 
ahead of Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Scheidecker of San Bernardino, not among the top 15 in the points 
standings, took the checkered flag for his first main-event win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening clearly belonged to Harper, who started 20th and apparently had 
been eliminated early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
After seven laps, Harper was out of the race, forced to the pits because of a 
broken fuel cell after a Turn 2 tangle with Dennis Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
During a lengthy yellow flag, Harper made the necessary repairs to his car and 
returned to the track in 22nd place. Yet his shot at a first track title 
seemed, well, shot. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly climbed to 12th on Lap 23, three positions behind Spangler. By Lap 
26, Harper was 11th. On Lap 33, Harper made a nifty outside pass around 
Spangler in heavy traffic to move into eighth position. 
</P>
<P>
For good measure, Harper climbed to sixth and waited out a lengthy red flag 
while track officials tended to an ailing spectator in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Martinez of Long Beach won the 12-lap Sportsman semi-main event to lead 
four drivers who advanced to the main event. Glen Mullins of Valencia, Larry 
Krieger of Reseda and Chris Peedan of Palmdale also advanced to the main. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12-lap Street Stock oval main event, Leonard McDonald of Simi Valley 
claimed the checkered flag to advance to the main event. Bruce Tarpey of North 
Hollywood, Tony Watson of Los Angeles and Kenny Wilson of Lancaster also 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Frank White of Los Angeles won the eight-lap qualifying race to 
advance to the Sportsman division's "Clash for Cash" exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Foster of North Hollywood and Jim Marlewski of Simi Valley both won 
eight-lap Street Stock figure 8 heat races. Scott Wade of Burbank won the 
eight-lap Hobby Stock figure 8 heat race. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy-dash winners included Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill (Sportsman), Ken 
Maler of Castaic (Street Stock oval), Gerrit Cromsigt of Palmdale (Street Stock 
figure 8), Jim Gunnarson of Reseda (Hobby Stock oval), Thad Friday of Reseda 
(Hobby Stock figure 8) and Scott Harmon of Reseda (Jalopy).

WEST TORRANCE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF TORRANCE MISTAKES TO WIN, 14-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To say that West Torrance High's football team had to fight for everything it 
got Friday night against visiting Torrance would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors even had to fight to run out the clock in their 14-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Protecting the lead with 44 seconds left, quarterback John Walsh went down on 
one knee at his team's 15-yard line. The whistle blew. The play was dead. 
</P>
<P>
But an overzealous Torrance defender, trying to create a turnover, slammed into 
Walsh and touched off an intense brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, both coaching staffs did a good job of keeping the players who 
were not in the game from joining the fracas. Order was restored after about a 
minute, and officials wisely let the clock expire without another play. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Coach Rich Busia wasn't happy about the way the game ended, but he 
understood his team's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some mistakes," he said. "When you make mistakes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Busia's voice trailed off, but his point was clear. On a night it dominated the 
statistics, Torrance simply was its own worst enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars outgained West in total yards (246 to 90) and first downs (10 to 
four) and controlled the game in the second half, when a conservative West 
offense managed only two net yards and one first down. 
</P>
<P>
But mistakes continually kept Torrance off the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars lost a fumble at midfield in the first quarter, they failed on a 
fourth-and-five play at the West 37 midway through the second quarter, they 
fumbled the ball away at the West 29 later in the second quarter and they let 
the first-half clock run out without scoring from the West 5. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half we made some mental mistakes," Busia said. "I thought we'd 
get the momentum in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the momentum against a well-coached team like West is easier said than 
done, however. The Warriors used two big plays -- a 44-yard pass from Walsh to 
wide receiver Ryan Berry and a 57-yard punt return by Josh Moore -- to set up 
two short touchdown runs by Moore and build a 14-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, West was content to sit back and let its defense take 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Torrance is so physical, we knew they were going to get some yards," West 
Co-Coach Mark Knox said. "Our game plan was to bend with them, but not to give 
up the big play." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' bend-but-don't-break defensive philosophy worked until Moore 
fumbled a punt and Torrance recovered at the West 32. On the next play, Tartar 
quarterback Rich Camou, who gave West fits with his scrambling, rolled to his 
right and hit receiver Brent Nunez with a touchdown pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Camou's two-point conversion run cut Torrance's deficit to 14-8 with 5:54 left 
to play and drastically changed the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore, who was beaten on the touchdown pass moments after he fumbled the 
punt, wasn't through for the night. 
</P>
<P>
After forcing West to punt, Torrance drove from midfield to the West 21, 
bringing up third-and-one with 1:39 remaining. Camou gave a play-action fake 
into the line and dropped back to pass, but the ball slipped out of his hand 
and he was sacked for an eight-yard loss by linebacker Matt Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance's final play gave Moore a chance to redeem himself. Camou tried 
another pass to Nunez in the right side of the end zone, but this time Moore 
jumped in front of the receiver and intercepted with 44 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional, tough game," Knox said. "It's nice to come away with a 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will bring 2-1 records into league openers at home Thursday night. 
West faces fast-improving Mira Costa in an Ocean League game while Torrance 
meets always-tough Santa Monica in a Bay League opener. 
</P>
<P>
How important is transfer Robert Coulter to Rolling Hills' football team? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for the third straight week the junior from Texas led the Titans in 
rushing. He had 182 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries Friday in a 36-6 win 
over North Torrance at Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"He's given us that big-play potential," said Titans Coach Gary Kimbrell, whose 
team piled up 320 yards rushing and improved to 3-0 heading into its Bay League 
opener Thursday afternoon at Beverly Hills. "He has a lot of natural, 
instinctive ability. I'm not sure how fast he is, but he has the ability to cut 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Coulter demonstrated that ability almost at will against North, which fell to 
0-3 and has now been outscored 93-13. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 178-pound tailback scored on runs of 12 and 5 yards, and he 
helped set up touchdowns on runs covering 28, 47 and 31 yards as Rolling Hills 
built a 30-0 halftime lead. Coulter did not carry the ball after the Titans' 
first series of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
While Rolling Hills looked sharp, North suffered through another lackluster 
performance. The Saxons missed many tackles and did not score until 4:39 left, 
when Rolling Hills was playing its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not very good right now," said Coach Don Bohannon, who pointed out that 
North was without two starters -- a two-way lineman and a linebacker -- because 
of injuries. "If things don't get better, it's going to be a long year." 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle moved preseason All-American Nkosi Littleton from 
outside linebacker to middle linebacker in Friday night's game against Lynwood 
with successful results. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 220-pound senior responded to the move by leading the Colts (1-1) with 
16 tackles, a fumble recovery and a deflected pass in their 16-6 triumph at 
Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton replaced Harry Fuamatu, who played middle linebacker last week in 
Carson's 24-23 loss to Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (Littleton) reacts to the ball better," Vollnogle said. "Nkosi can 
run. He can outright fly. And he'll be able to read the trap better." 
</P>
<P>
Junior outside linebacker Edgar Ta'ase also turned in an impressive effort, 
finishing with 14 tackles, a forced fumble and a sack. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, which could not find an opponent, is idle this week. The Colts will 
open Southern-Pacific Conference play Oct. 6 against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible to be 0-3 and still be considered a favorite to capture the 
Ocean League title? In the case of the Morningside Monarchs, the answer would 
have to be a resounding Yes. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs took highly regarded Leuzinger down the wire Friday night but 
suffered their third consecutive loss, 28-27, when they failed on a two-point 
conversion try with 2:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, which rallied from a 28-13 deficit in the last six minutes behind 
reserve quarterback John Cotton, has lost three games by a total of eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Look for the Monarchs to finally break into the win column Thursday night when 
they visit winless North Torrance in an Ocean League opener. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa, under first-year Coach Larry Petrill, eclipsed its win total of 
1988 by rallying for a 28-21 win over Beverly Hills. The Mustangs (2-1) were 
1-9 last year. . . . Led by linebacker Sione Mahe, who had 10 tackles and two 
sacks, Hawthorne recorded its second consecutive shutout with a 19-0 win over 
Saugus. The Cougars (3-0) have outscored the opposition 55-7. . . . Running 
back Walter Grissam scored three touchdowns as Westchester (1-1) handed 
Narbonne (0-2) its 23rd straight loss in a 28-0 shutout. . . . Morningside 
isn't the only team that will open Ocean League play after three close losses. 
South Torrance dropped its third game by a touchdown to Bishop Montgomery, 
14-7. . . . With a 36-13 win over Gardena, Serra (3-0) has outscored opponents 
122-20. . . . Despite having only 19 able-bodied players because of injuries, 
Mary Star (2-1) thumped St. Bernard, 32-0, behind four touchdowns by running 
back Matt Redlew.

EL CAMINO PASSES ORANGE COAST 'TEST,' WINS EASILY, 36-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So much for John Featherstone's prediction. The El Camino College football 
coach said his team would be tested in its Mission Conference opener Saturday 
night against visiting Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
But after overpowering Antelope Valley in their opener two weeks ago, the 
Warriors could have used a better test. El Camino, which has been idle since 
Sept. 9, kept a nine-game winning streak alive by defeating Orange Coast, 
36-17, in what turned out to be more of a scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, ranked No. 10 in the nation by the JC Grid-Wire and No. 4 in the 
state by the JC Athletic Bureau, improved their record to 2-0, while unranked 
Orange Coast fell to 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino was extremely productive against the Pirates' defense. Sophomore 
quarterback Frank Dolce completed 20 of 28 passes for 277 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With nine minutes left in the third quarter, Dolce completed a 48-yard bomb to 
sophomore David Blakes. A minute later, he found Al Savea open in the end zone 
on a three-yard pass that gave El Camino a 30-3 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast scored its first touchdown four minutes later when quarterback 
Greg Angelovic connected with Tim Parker on a 25-yard pass that made the score 
30-9. Angelovic completed 6 of 17 passes for 90 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With 8:51 left to play in the game the Pirates scored again on a 13-yard run by 
Jason McGehee. Mike Vaez ran for the two-point conversion to make it 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors answered with their last touchdown, a 4-yard run by sophomore 
running back Alfred Lowe with 6:19 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized we got a little sloppy in the third quarter," Featherstone said, 
"but when you're up like we were, that happens. I was really pleased with our 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
It was evident from the start that El Camino was anxious to get the show 
started. The Warriors had lengthy drives in the first half, and Dolce completed 
12 of 18 passes for 170 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Louis Perez kicked a 46-yard field goal on El Camino's first 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino also scored on its next possession, a 66-yard drive capped by Dolce's 
3-yard pass to freshman wide receiver Shannon Thompson, and led 23-3 at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino plays top-ranked Fullerton on the road next Saturday. The Warriors' 
last loss was against Fullerton on Oct.1 of last year.

OXNARD DEFENSE PAVES WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard High went into Saturday night's nonleague game with an offense as 
powerful as Hurricane Hugo, but it was a stingy defense that swept Channel 
Islands off its feet. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard (3-0) limited Channel Islands, which had averaged more than 350 yards in 
its first two games, to 168 rushing yards during its 26-12 win at Hueneme High. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands (2-1) didn't score until the fourth quarter and hurt itself 
with six fumbles and personal fouls that ended two drives deep in Oxnard 
territory. Running back Renard Carn had a successful evening, rushing for 142 
yards in 16 carries, but fullback Pharoh Milner -- who, like Carn, was 
averaging more than 100 yards rushing a game -- was held to 26 in seven 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard scored two touchdowns in a four-minute span in the first quarter. 
Quarterback Johnel Turner gave Oxnard a 6-0 lead with a four-yard run at the 
5:34 mark. After Channel Islands fumbled on its next drive, Turner found Mitch 
Watkins in the end zone with a pass on a third-and-30 play from the 50. 
</P>
<P>
The main gun was Turner, though. The quick senior scored from four yards out 
with 1:26 left in the third quarter to give Oxnard a 20-0 lead and added a 
two-yard score with 2:33 left.

SANTA MONICA SCORES FAST, ROLLS OVER HARBOR, 40-13

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica College jumped on top of visiting Harbor College early Saturday 
night and cruised to an easy 40-13 non-conference win. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs scored on their first three possessions. The first came on a 
nine-yard pass from Jeff Barrett to Phillip Frazier, culminating an 85-yard 
drive. The second, a two-yard run by Charles McKinzie, capped a 78-yard drive. 
The point-after attempt failed, but Santa Monica took a 20-0 lead several 
minutes later when McKinzie's nine-yard run ended another 85-yard march. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor (1-1) got on the scoreboard just before the first half ended when 
running back Bill Harris reversed his field, turing a potential loss into a 
56-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive Harbor turnovers enabled Santa Monica to blow the game wide open in 
the second half. The Corsairs recovered a fumble at the Harbor 13-yard line, 
then got a one-yard run by Frazier to increase their lead to 27-6. Then Adonias 
Lucero's interception set up a 10-yard pass from Jeff Barrett to Travis Moore 
to make it 33-6. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's Corey Henry scored on a one-yard run to make the score 33-13 after 
three quarters. Santa Monica quarterback Ernie Soto capped the scoring with a 
27-yard touchdown pass to Byron Jackson.

Sophomore Pathon Rucker's 15-yard scoring run with 1:22 remaining propelled 
Glendale High to a 28-21 nonleague win over Bell-Jeff on Saturday night at 
Burroughs High. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a tailback playing in his second varsity game, rushed for 237 yards and 
two touchdowns in 17 carries. Rucker also had an 88-yard kickoff return to set 
up a score. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff knotted the score, 21-21, in the third quarter on a 34-yard touchdown 
pass from Rod Chapman to Steve Szekely. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (1-2) opened the scoring on a seven-yard run by Rucker, which capped a 
96-yard drive. The Guards came back to tie on a 32-yard run by Earl Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker returned the ensuing kickoff 88 yards to the eight-yard line and junior 
Kyiamo-Waki Jones scored from four yards. Bell-Jeff again tied the score on an 
11-yard scoring run by Alfred Silva after a 73-yard drive.

POMONA-PITZER STUMBLES OVER THE FEAT OF OCCIDENTAL'S LITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of feet proved to be the difference Saturday in Occidental College's 
24-14 victory over Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
First there was Pomona's failure to cash in one foot from the goal line in the 
fourth quarter, which would have given the Sagehens the lead and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Pomona kicker Robert Perez's failure to convert two fourth-quarter 
field-goal attempts that were well within his range. And, in the end, there 
were the ultra-quick feet of Occidental running back Gary Little, who rushed 
for 215 yards in 24 carries in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference opener at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The win, Occidental's first after season-opening defeats to Menlo and Azusa 
Pacific, gave the Tigers their 10th consecutive victory over Pomona, which had 
been looking to avenge last season's 70-16 wipeout. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had lost, there would have been some real, real concern in Eagle Rock," 
Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said. "I still don't think we're playing well . . 
. but it's nice to get this first win." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 14-10, at halftime, Occidental scored the winning touchdown on a 
40-yard pass from Tony Werbelow to Rob Leinbach with 6:36 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That touchdown set the stage for the game's turning point, which occurred after 
Pomona took the ensuing kickoff and drove 80 yards to the Occidental one-foot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
On first and goal, Pomona quarterback Gregg Silver fumbled while attempting a 
sneak into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"They were going in for the score," said Occidental defensive lineman Brady 
Dargan, who recovered the fumble at the one-yard line. "That really changed the 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona had two more chances to at least tie the score, but Perez missed 
field-goal tries from 36 and 21 yards on the Sagehens' next possessions. In 
last week's 13-0 opening victory over Colorado College, Perez made kicks from 
almost the same distances. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would come right down to the special teams and that's what 
happened," Pomona Coach Clarence Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Little, a 5-foot-9, 171-pound freshman from San Francisco, went a long way 
toward sealing the victory with a 49-yard touchdown run with 2:17 left. Little 
also scored the first touchdown on a 28-yard run in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Little's performance overshadowed that of Pomona running back Chris Smith, a 
freshman who followed last week's 142-yard effort with 191 yards in 29 carries 
against Occidental. Smith's touchdown at the end of the first half came on a 
spectacular 68-yard run during which he traversed from sideline to sideline.

Bo Williams blew a 4-up lead Saturday, but won the U.S. Amateur Golf 
Championship in sudden death when San Diego's Joe Simpson missed a six-foot 
putt on the first extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
Williams chipped from off the green to within three inches for a conceded four. 
Simpson then missed a six-foot putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Williams, 60, of Ocala, Fla., to become the eighth multiple 
winner of the championship. Williams won in 1986 at Edina, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson was attempting to complete the first father-son combination to win a 
national championship of the United States Golf Assn. His son, Scott, won the 
1987 U.S. Open Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The final began as a rout as Williams rode a sizzling short game to a 4-up lead 
after eight holes. He chipped in from off the green to halve the par-4 sixth 
hole, then holed a 25-foot bunker shot at No. 8. Williams also won the first 
two holes after bogeys by Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
The match then took a dramatic turn on the back nine as Simpson won four 
consecutive holes to even the score. He holed a 30-foot putt for a birdie at 
the 12th hole and followed that with a near hole-in-one at the par-3 13th. His 
ball rolled completely around the hole and stopped six inches away for an easy 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Williams bogeyed the next two holes. He hit his third shot at the par-5 15th 
into the water, then missed a 3-foot par putt at No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
He advanced to the final by defeating Bob Lowry of Huntsville, Ala., 2 and 1, 
in the first of Saturday morning's semifinals. Simpson eliminated Amos Jones of 
Atlanta in his semifinal match, 3 and 2.

ALL-AMERICAN CANDIDATES PROVIDE PUNCH IN VICTORY

<P>
Todd Jackson and Dave Dunn are being billed this year as All-America candidates 
in the NCAA's Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Their team, the University of San Diego, is making an early bid for the 
Division III playoffs, something it has not attained since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon at Claremont, Jackson, Dunn and teammates played as if being 
witnessed by a committee member for All-American and playoff selections. 
</P>
<P>
It was. John Zinda, Claremont's coach, is a member of such committees. 
</P>
<P>
And he probably saw enough to sway his vote as USD scored 20 fourth quarter 
points to defeat Claremont, 30-13. Coach Brian Fogarty's Toreros, an 
independent, are 3-0 for the first time since 1983, his first year at USD. 
Claremont is 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a senior fullback, rushed for 156 yards on 21 carries, including a 
63-yard touchdown run with 5:32 left to give USD its first comfortable lead, 
23-13. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Brendan Murphy added 98 yards rushing, including a 28-yard score on 
an option keeper to close the scoring with just over a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
USD's offense is averaging 24.3 points and 348 yards. Saturday's season-high 
382 included 300 rushing yards on 50 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, a senior nose tackle, had four sacks, including three in four plays late 
when Claremont tried to rally, and he will probably need at least that many 
stitches once he visits a hospital. A kick to the chin on the first play of the 
second half left a lengthy gash and a bloodied jersey, but Dunn's inspired play 
helped spark a defense that is allowing just 6.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing well up to that point," said Dunn, with a bloodied gauze 
bandage covering the wound. "We just needed a boost and that was it. I don't 
know if we fell asleep or what, but we woke up." 
</P>
<P>
USD, which led 10-7 at the half, fell behind, 13-10, heading into the fourth 
quarter. After a one-yard touchdown run by Charles Taumoepeau with 10:41 left 
gave USD a 17-10 lead, Claremont drove 43 yards to the USD 22. Pressure on 
quarterback Mike Pembroke (16 of 36, 210 yards) and good coverage in the 
secondary (primarily by cornerback Scott Bradley, who had an interception 
earlier) resulted in four consecutive incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Jackson was plunging through the left side of the line and 
into open field where he outran Tony Ferrentino for the longest touchdown of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the offense was picking up and we were about to break something 
open," Jackson said. "I got some good blocks and once I got through, I just saw 
the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
With Claremont again attempting a rally, three Dunn sacks and an incompletion 
negated the Stags' drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a defense like that, it's really reassuring," Jackson said. "We rely on 
them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros rely on Jackson a lot, too. Said Fogarty, "I've been saying it all 
along. Todd Jackson is one of the best backs in Division III."

MORSE HOLDS OFF VISTA IN FINAL MINUTE TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vista High had the ball in Morse territory with a minute to go, but couldn't 
convert on fourth and one and Morse held on for a 22-20 nonleague victory 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Morse took a 22-13 lead into halftime on two touchdowns from quarterback Teddy 
Lawrence, one a 20-yard run and the other an eight-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
Ututofo Faime also scored for Morse, on a two-yard run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Vista then shut down Morse in the second half, but the Tigers had done their 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Vista's only touchdown in the first half came on a 20-yard pass from Choo Choo 
Walker to Jose Castaneda. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda scored on a three-yard run in the third quarter and fullback Ken 
Williams closed out the scoring with a fourth-quarter one-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine 33, Marian 0 -- The Saints (3-0) have outscored their opponents, 
110-12. 
</P>
<P>
Marian dropped to 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter Buckner opened the scoring with his sixth touchdown of the season, a 
three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The big story, however, was junior quarterback Chad Tomaskasoski, who was six 
of 14 for 106 yards with one touchdown pass and two touchdown runs.

"THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY II" -- In a story in last Sunday's Business section 
about entertainment executive Jerry Weintraub, "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" was 
included in lists of Weintraub-distributed films that have not generated

SCHOOLS FIGHT OWN WAR -- AGAINST GANG ATTIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County educators, once concerned about short-shorts, halter tops and 
bare feet disrupting classrooms, are now clamping down on gang-style fashions 
in the hope of stopping neighborhood violence from infecting their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"No gang identification is allowed. They just can't wear it to school. Period," 
said Duane Clizbe, principal of La Vista High School, a continuation school in 
Fullerton. "We've got some local gangs here, and we don't want that spilling 
over" into the school. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Newport-Mesa Unified School District updated its dress code 
to ban "materials, symbols or dress" that could disrupt school operations, 
joining a growing list of districts that are trying to keep gang attire out of 
their schools. In addition, the district pledged to assure its students that 
schools would be free from "fear, intimidation, or physical harm caused by . . 
. groups and individuals." 
</P>
<P>
"We're simply being overcautious," said Bob Francy, director of student 
services for Newport-Mesa Unified School District. "Schools in this area 
haven't been hit hard with gang activity, (but) there may be a problem 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Get Worse 
</P>
<P>
Many students, however, believe that toughening the dress policy will do little 
to curtail the increasing problems neighborhood gangs pose and that it may even 
bolster the fashionable image of gang-style dress. 
</P>
<P>
"Making a dress code would make people rebel more," said Clyde Perezcasteneda, 
a senior at Santiago High School in Garden Grove, where baseball-type hats have 
been banned. 
</P>
<P>
"A hat (alone) is not going to get you shot," said Perezcasteneda, a football 
player and student government member. "It's the clothes you wear, the people 
you hang around with and the way you act." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Alvarez, 14, a Santa Ana High School freshman, is also critical of strict 
dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America," she said. "It's a free country and you can wear what you 
want." 
</P>
<P>
Most districts in the county avoid the word gang in dress codes and instead set 
broad guidelines for schools. They hope to prevent gang attire by forbidding 
students to wear certain baseball-type hats, jackets with gang logos, bandannas 
and red or blue-dominated outfits. Blue and red are the preferred colors of the 
Crips and Bloods gangs, which are based in Los Angeles but have made inroads in 
Orange County in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to Principals 
</P>
<P>
The final decision on exactly which hats, jackets and other items are banned is 
usually left up to school principals. 
</P>
<P>
"These are judgment calls," said John Nicoll, superintendent of the 
Newport-Mesa school district. "And we tend to support the people making them." 
</P>
<P>
But making those calls can be tough. 
</P>
<P>
Bob O'Higgins, principal at Santiago High School, said it is difficult to keep 
up with students' changing tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"You generally go with the change in style, the change in symbols," he said. 
The current rage at Santiago -- and O'Higgins' latest targets -- are colored 
shoelaces, bandannas, hats worn backward and gang jackets. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean that somewhere down the line they'll get ahead of us," 
O'Higgins said. "It's hard. You have to be alert. It's just a constant 
vigilance." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Valdivia, a freshman at Santa Ana High School with three brothers in 
gangs, knows the garb well. "Gangs? They wear khakis, Levi's, Hush Puppies, 
Nike, (polo-style) shirts buttoned all the way up, dickies and Levi cords," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are very creative dressers, and I don't mind that," La Vista Principal 
Clizbe said, citing in particular the various dyed, spiked and shaved hair 
styles of the day. 
</P>
<P>
But gang-type clothing, he said, goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't bother me, if it didn't (hurt) the school," Clizbe said. "But it 
does. It frightens kids."

MOST WANTED FRENCH CRIMINAL KILLS HIMSELF

<P>
Philippe Delaire, France's most wanted criminal, killed himself early Saturday 
after he and two accomplices, cornered by police on the roof of an apartment 
building, tossed part of $720,000 in ransom money to onlookers on the street 
below. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor said Delaire, 28, appeared to have 
committed suicide just as police burst into a building in Droixhe, near Liege, 
where he had taken refuge with his two accomplices. She did not say how he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Police said earlier that Delaire, known in the underworld as Beau Mec (Pretty 
Boy) because of his good looks, had died of head wounds in a hail of bullets 
after being cornered on the staircase of an apartment block. 
</P>
<P>
Delaire, who had broken out of at least four jails in France and Belgium 
including one jailbreak in Nice by helicopter, had held a woman and her two 
daughters in a suburban villa for six days. 
</P>
<P>
His two accomplices were arrested. one of them was shot and wounded by police 
when he threatened them with a hand grenade, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The three gunmen earlier released their hostages, Marie-Madeleine Bolland and 
daughters Francoise, 12, and Gaelle, 10, in exchange for the ransom and a 
getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
After zig-zagging around the Liege area and switching cars several times to 
throw off police, the gang headed for Delaire's hideout in Droixhe. But police 
already had it staked out.

BETWEEN ROCKS AND A HARD PLACE;

FOR HOMELESS AT BRIDGE REFUGES, LIFE WILL SOON GET ROUGHER

<P>
The aroma of spaghetti sauce warming over a campfire rose above the murky Santa 
Ana River under the McFadden Avenue overpass in Santa Ana on Saturday, lending 
a homey atmosphere to an otherwise bleak landscape littered with abandoned 
couches and shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
The space underneath this and two other overpasses nearby have been home to 
about 40 transient men and women. 
</P>
<P>
But at 7 a.m. Monday, the Orange County Environmental Management Agency will 
have about 25 workers begin placing rocks beneath the overpasses at McFadden 
and Edinger avenues and 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
The agency decided to take the action after repeated complaints that the 
homeless have frightened nearby residents, as well as joggers and cyclists who 
use the trail on the east side of the river, across from the makeshift 
campsites. There have also been complaints about transients urinating and 
defecating in public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transients a 'Nuisance' 
</P>
<P>
"They are a nuisance to the users (of the trail) and the adjacent homeowners," 
said Bill Reiter, a public works operations manager for the Environmental 
Management Agency. "More and more people have been going under there . . . and 
it's only going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to do this in the most humane way possible," he said, 
adding that residents' personal belongings will not be damaged or taken away 
Monday morning, but simply set outside near the overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
As a group of people at the McFadden overpass sat around a pot of spaghetti 
cooking over an open flame Saturday, some said they have no idea where they 
will go when rousted from the spot. 
</P>
<P>
One man, who has been living with his wife there for six months, said that the 
homeless don't bother people on the trail. No one camps on the east side of the 
river because there is too much foot traffic nearby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, who did not want to give their names, had no specific plans 
about where they would move, but were certain they would remain in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Santa Ana, and I don't travel," said another man, 35. "I just want to 
know, is this the war on poverty, or is this the war on drugs?" he said of the 
imminent eviction. "What war is this part of?" 
</P>
<P>
The project, approved by the city of Santa Ana, will take about two weeks to 
complete, Reiter said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents and trail users said Saturday that they approved of the action. 
</P>
<P>
John Covington, who lives on Susan Street, on the west side of the McFadden 
Avenue bridge, said he has encountered a few of the people living under the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"One comes here and asks for water. We don't mind," he said. "We told him as 
long as he asks, it's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "this is a quiet area, and it's starting to get rowdy. We'd 
rather keep it quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana resident Jesus Benunuri, who has jogged on the trail regularly for 
the past six years, said the people under the bridge scare him. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they look, they way they smell," Benunuri said, "they scare me." 
</P>
<P>
Scotty and Bud Maddox, 22-year residents of Quiet Village Mobile Home Park, 
which is next to the 1st Street bridge, said the number of people appearing to 
live under the bridge has increased in recent years. But, they say, those 
people tend to keep to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any trouble," Bud Maddox said. "We feel sorry for them living 
there, but they have to live somewhere."

CALM HOME SAVINGS ROBBER HANDS TELLER NOTE, WALKS OUT WITH CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are searching for a man who calmly handed a teller a note demanding 
money, then casually walked out of Home Savings of America in Fullerton with an 
undetermined amount of money Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The apparently unarmed robber demanded the money about 11:20 a.m. at the branch 
at 1107 S. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton Police Sgt. Ron Gillett said. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of customers in the savings and loan at the time did not know a 
robbery had taken place, Gillett said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees said they did not see whether the man fled by foot or by car.

Rosie Jones had the magic in her fingers and Nancy Lopez had the look in her 
eye. But rookie Pamela Wright had the moxie to birdie three of the final four 
holes and take a one-shot lead over Jones and Lopez after the third round of 
the Nippon Travel-MSB golf tournament at Los Coyotes Country Club in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's 5-under-par 67 puts her at 10 under. Lopez and Jones shot 65s and are 
at 9-under for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Rarick, one of three leaders after the second round, is two shots off the 
lead after a 70. Colleen Walker made a strong move with a 69 and is three shots 
away. Beth Daniel shot 69 and trails by four. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley and Amy Alcott, the other two leaders when the Saturday round 
began, both shot 73 and fell five shots back. Myra Blackwelder also lost a shot 
to par and is at 4-under. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 25, grew up in Scotland but attended Arizona State, where she was twice 
Pac-10 champion.

Her best LPGA tournament was in Corning, N.Y., where she finished tied for 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Wright isn't concerned about her lack of experience approaching the final 
round. "I won't be intimidated," she said. "We're all just golfers. We all know 
how to play." 
</P>
<P>
At the Nashville tournament in April, Wright was in her best position of the 
year entering a final round, trailing leader Kathy Postlewait by four shots. 
Wright was paired with Lopez for the final round, as she will be today. Lopez 
shot a final-round 70 to finish tied for third. Wright shot 75 to finish tied 
for 28th. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, began the day two shots off the lead, parred the first eight holes. On 
No. 9, a 475-yard par five with a pond guarding the front of the green, Lopez 
made a birdie from eight feet. She left the green with a look that caused one 
member of her gallery to say, "She's going to take off now." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Lopez birdied the next two holes, making putts of five and eight feet. 
She eagled the par-five 12th after hitting a three-wood to within three feet of 
the hole. She parred the 13th, then birdied the next two from short range. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy has been hitting the ball real well for two days now," said husband Ray 
Knight. "It was just a matter of time before the putts started going in." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said, "I played well yesterday, but missed five putts under five feet." 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Jones, in her eighth year on tour, has been a consistent contender since 
the 1987 season, when she won the Rail tournament in Springfield, Ill. She won 
three times in 1988, but her best finish this year has been a tie for fifth at 
the first tournament of the year in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Jones shot nine birdies in her seven-under round of 65, her best round of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A little fatherly advice came Jones' way before the start of the third round. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of relatives around here and they were saying, 'Go out and shoot 
a 69, or go out and shoot a 67.' My dad said, 'Go out and shoot a 65.' " 
</P>
<P>
The shot of the day: Kris Tschetter, out of the rough 171 yards from the hole 
and hitting over a sand trap, cut a four-iron to within 18 inches of the hole. 
Tschetter made the putt for a birdie 3 on the most difficult par-4 on the 
course, yielding a 4.4 stroke average to the field. Tschetter's was only the 
20th birdie on No. 15.

Andres Gomez of Ecuador, ranked 30th in the world, upset Ivan Lendl, 1-6, 7-6 
(7-5), 9-7, Saturday in the semifinals of a $500,000 tennis tournament at 
Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, ranked No. 1, made several unforced errors in key games in the second 
and third sets. He was favored to win the clay-court tournament, which he won 
in 1981 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez will face Horst Skoff of Austria in today's final. Skoff advanced by 
beating Argentin's Alberto Mancini, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Skoff reached the semifinals earlier Saturday by beating countryman Thomas 
Munster, 6-4, 6-3, in a match that had been delayed by rain Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl started strongly, breaking Gomez three times in the first set. But after 
losing his service early in the second set, Gomez broke back to pull even at 
4-4 and hung on to force a tiebreaker. Lendl squandered three break points that 
would have had him serving for the match. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez won the tiebreaker, 7-5. In the final set, Lendl lost three service 
games, the last of which gave Gomez an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for the match, Gomez quickly led, 40-0. Lendl saved two match points 
before Gomez hit a cross-court winner. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Navratilova advanced to the final of a $250,000 tournament 
in Dallas, easily defeating third-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-2, 6-3. 
Navratilova had beaten Maleeva, 6-0, 6-0, in the U.S. Open two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it wouldn't be love and love again; she was stepping into the ball and 
taking it on the rise," Navratilova said. "And she served very well. My 
first-serve percentage was quite high. She has a very good return of serve, and 
I was able to keep her off balance, so that felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova will meet Monica Seles of Yugoslavia for the first time tonight in 
the final. Seles, 15, beat unseeded Anne Smith of Dallas in the other 
semifinal, 6-1, 6-2.

HE'S A SPEED DEMON; 
</P>
<P>
MCNAIR'S METHOD TO HELP ATHLETES RUN FASTER LEADS TO RAPIDLY GROWING BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin McNair is sitting and talking about how successful his training methods 
have been, about the nearly unbelievable results they've produced and about the 
teams and individuals who are knocking down his Irvine office door in search of 
his expertise. And the man is being tortured. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for his torment is a four-legged creature that bends McNair's knees, 
restricts the sweeps of his arms and impedes his ability to punctuate nearly 
every statement with a little body English. 
</P>
<P>
A chair has Kevin McNair. 
</P>
<P>
A chair around McNair might as well be a noose. He wiggles, he squirms, he 
leans forward then presses back, at the slightest opening he bounds to his feet 
to demonstrate any principle of what has become known as the McNair Method. 
</P>
<P>
What does the McNair Method do? Make just about anyone run faster, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
McNair has it down to a science, one he developed and has shown and sold across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, Raiders, Angels, Philadelphia Eagles and San Diego Chargers have used 
him. So have Stanford, Notre Dame, USC, Iowa and Georgia and a host of Orange 
County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The man and his method are hot. Five years ago, he resigned as UC Irvine's 
track and field coach to pursue his speed theories, with only one university 
marking his appointment book. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the list stretches across 17 states, across football fields, tennis 
courts and baseball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to slow even a fit man, but McNair's frantic personality seems to 
feed on it. It's a lucky man who finds his niche in the cosmos, and McNair 
appears to have staked his. 
</P>
<P>
Who better to teach speed than someone whose entire makeup seems to be about 
violent explosions of movement? When he talks, his face reddens, his eyes bulge 
as he punches out inflections. As he coaches, he yells encouragement and offers 
a ready handshake in the same manner one would thrust forth a sword. His steps 
are quick, heavy and measured. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's coaching he looks like he's about to have a stroke," said Bill 
Bavasi, Director of Minor League Operations for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, Bavasi and the Angels love McNair. So do the Eagles, who once 
passed the hat so McNair would come back for an early training session. 
</P>
<P>
So does Eagles' kick and punt returner Henry (Gizmo) Williams, who ran an 
already scorching 4.39 in the 40 before McNair. After working with McNair, 
Williams ran a near unbelievable 4.25. The story goes that Gizmo already was 
aware that he had done something special by the time he crossed the finish line 
and started jumping and shouting, "Tell the man his (method) works." 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt of that. The last time McNair counted, 505 of 533 athletes 
who worked with him improved their time in the 40. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, he's the best," said Ronnie Jones, Eagles' linebacker and 
strength coach. 
</P>
<P>
McNair's story begins twice, both times at Stanford University. He was 
recruited to the school to play football from Bishop Amat High in La Puente. 
But an illness meant one of his kidneys had to be removed and football was 
forbidden to him. He did run track at Stanford under two-time Olympic coach 
Payton Jordan. It was under Jordan that McNair not only wanted to run fast but 
wanted to know why. 
</P>
<P>
He studied kinesiology and formulated ideas about speed as he coached track and 
football at Cubberly High in Palo Alto and then Piedmont High. His 1976 
Piedmont football team, the last football team he would coach, went 11-0 and 
won the Northern California championship. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 he was hired at Occidental College to be the head men's and women's 
track and field and cross-country coach. In his first season, the men's team 
won the NCAA Division III championship in both track and cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
By 1979 McNair had moved on to UC Irvine; in 1980 he was named coach of the 
year in the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. He helped produce 20 All-Americans at 
Occidental and UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Though his surroundings changed with regularity, McNair did not. He remained 
the high school football coach. Exuberant, loud, pacing, yelling, attempting to 
be everywhere at once. 
</P>
<P>
"His intensity took a little getting used to," said Larry Knuth, an assistant 
of McNair's at UCI and now men's and women's track coach at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Williams, head coach of the UCI women's track team, was a triple jumper 
when McNair was at Occidental and an assistant under McNair at UCI. He 
remembers McNair's voice rustling the leaves a bit during meets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a situation where people are real laid back or complacent and then 
you have a real go-getter like Kevin show up yelling, it's going to be scary 
for some people," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
McNair said: "I know I can be loud, but if anyone listens to what I say it's 
always directed at my team and always very positive. Maybe people just didn't 
like the sound of my voice." 
</P>
<P>
McNair isn't positive, he is a torrent of praise. "Very good," is a relative 
put down for McNair, who throws around perfects as if his students really were. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, McNair was asked by then Stanford football coach Jack Elway to come up 
and work with the team. Elway told McNair if he could significantly lower the 
times of the Stanford players, he would be made a consultant to all Stanford 
athletics. Sixty-nine of the 74 players dropped their times. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack (Elway) had told the local papers that speed could not be taught," McNair 
said. "But after I got those results, he retracted his statement." 
</P>
<P>
Quicker than McNair can introduce himself, shake your hand and give you a brief 
history of his career, he had resigned at UCI and started on a new career. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time it was like jumping off a cliff," he said. "There wasn't much 
there. Just Stanford. Luckily the thing has really grown." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, luck had little to do with it. Results made for fertile business. 
And results spring forth from the method. 
</P>
<P>
McNair is at once enthusiastic and cautious when it comes to talking about his 
theories. He'll tell you one of the main facets of it is something he calls 
'The Hammer,' a series of body motions that produce a faster human. But break 
down The Hammer's parts for a curious observer? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say it works," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
McNair's method go against many theories firmly ingrained in the athletic mind. 
For one, he doesn't believe that high knees make for faster athletes. His 
method is the opposite: apply maximum force to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the athletes to apply force downward and backward on the ground," he 
said. "All body parts are implements of that force. If you know how to direct 
them down and back in a proper way you will have an action that will result in 
an equal but opposite reaction to where you're heading." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: the harder the athlete pushes off the ground, the faster he moves 
forward. High knees mean nothing, it's the push. And McNair teaches the athlete 
how to coordinate the many body movements that go into a proper push, step 
after step. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial to his instruction is an 18-word vocabulary of terms he shouts to 
athletes as they run. 
</P>
<P>
"I can be someone's eyes as they run and make adjustments for them when they 
need to make adjustments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he says "arch" the athlete knows to arch his back. "Crack," tells the runner 
to snap down with his wrists. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few times you hear it, you wonder what language he's speaking," said 
Ryan Darke, the Mission Viejo High fullback, who, along with brother Phil, have 
worked with McNair for a year. "Then it gets in you so that he'll just say a 
word and your body reacts. You don't even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
McNair continues to think about speed, constantly refining his process. And as 
he does, he is constantly finding new ways to spread his knowledge and client 
base. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there are some athletes who have worked with McNair who have 
never actually met him. Through the use of videotapes, McNair critiques the 
runner, then does voice-overs on the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a book planned for this year and perhaps a general instructional 
video. 
</P>
<P>
He's built up a nice business, one that he used to run out of a converted 
bedroom in his home. But these days, McNair goes about his business in an 
attractive office with a great view of the UCI campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are really excellent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And they got that way so fast. Of course, for McNair, could there be any other 
way?

SERVITE TUMBLES TO TAFT, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it beginner's luck if you wish, but Taft football Coach Tom Stevenson will 
savor his team's season-opening 7-6 upset victory over Servite just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Taft wasted no time in scoring as Gregory Bernard scored on the Toreadors first 
possession of the season. And the Taft defense did its part by making that 
score stand up before a crowd estimated at 2,000 at Glover Field. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, a 220-pound senior running back, scored on an 11-yard run with six 
minutes and 55 seconds to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, the City does beat the (Southern Section) once in a while," Stevenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Servite was unable to recover any of Taft's eight fumbles, yet lost possession 
of its only fumble of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-0, Servite drove 80 yards on seven plays in the third quarter. 
Billy Ray capped the drive with a two-yard run. But Servite failed to tie when 
kicker Adam Thomas' point-after attempt sailed wide to the right. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the only time Servite's kicking game let the team down. With 3:08 
remaining Servite's Shawn Kane missed a 34-yard field-goal attempt. That kick 
went wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
"Both our kickers were hurt," Servite Coach Larry Toner said. "Thomas has a 
thigh injury and Kane's is personal. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought about going for a touchdown, but Kane told us he thought he could 
do it and we went with him." 
</P>
<P>
Servite gained possession one final time, taking over at its own 42 with 42 
seconds to play. But Rob Walker's pass down the sideline was intercepted by 
Steve Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Walker completed 13 of 16 passes for 179 yards and running back Kent Weiss had 
130 rushing yards on 18 carries. BRYAN RODGERS

TRABUCO HILLS TAKES TO AIR TO WIN, 17-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trabuco Hills High School went back to basics in the second half to earn a 17-0 
victory over Long Beach Wilson on Saturday in nonleague game at Mission Viejo 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Trabuco Hills' first over a Division I opponent in the school's 
five-year history, and was a significant turnaround from last week's loss to 
underdog Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills' 14-7 loss to Dana Hills was only the third in two seasons for 
the defending Division VIII champion, and it also was costly. The Mustangs lost 
their best running back, Ben Rooker, to a knee injury that required 
arthroscopic surgery last week. Rooker will be out at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Barnett, Trabuco Hills coach, elected to try a grind-it-out, ball-control 
offense in the first half, but scrapped the plan when the Mustangs gained only 
32 yards and failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Tim Manning, who was sporadic throughout the first half, passed for 
128 yards and a touchdown in the second half to spark the comeback. He 
completed 14 of 28 passes for 161 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried the new offense in the first half and couldn't get anything going," 
Manning said. "With Rooker going down, we were missing a big weapon, so we 
decided to go back to our basic passing offense. I felt a lot more comfortable 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (2-1) opened a 3-0 lead when Brent Roper kicked a 21-yard field 
goal in the third quarter, then clinched the victory by scoring twice in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Manning connected with wide receiver Greg Hughes on a 10-yard touchdown pass 
about a minute into the fourth quarter, but Hughes paid the price for the 
score, suffering a separated shoulder when making the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Julian Ford, filling in for Rooker, scored Trabuco Hills' second 
touchdown on a 17-yard run with 6:32 remaining. Trabuco Hills had 109 yards 
rushing, with tailback Peter Burke gaining 83 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Wilson (1-2) managed only 70 yards rushing and completed only two 
passes against a strong Trabuco Hills defense that had Barnett smiling 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense did a great job today shutting out a Division I team," Barnett 
said. "Our offense struggled, but they confused us with a lot of different 
formations, so we decided to go back to the basic stuff. Ball control isn't my 
style, anyway."
