PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNING

I can see no compelling reason why taxpayers should be expected to foot the 
bill to deploy Air Force One, Secret Service personnel and all the other costs 
associated with a presidential trip so that George Bush can raise campaign 
funds for Sen. Pete Wilson ("Wilson Fund-Raiser Headlined by Bush," Part B, 
Sept. 19). 
</P>
<P>
Dragging the President around, at taxpayers expense no less, to shill for the 
Republican Party is particularly odious considering the various crisis the U.S. 
is now facing, not the least of which is an economic one.

Like most Americans, I had never heard of Judge David Souter before his 
nomination and, like most, I am concerned about issues which are likely to come 
before the Supreme Court. But as I read of spokespersons from all sides of 
those issues imploring the Judiciary Committee to reject the nominee for the 
express reasons that he claims to have an open mind rather than a bias, I'm 
concerned with the Senate's spending time listening to people who don't know 
what a judge does for a living.

I was distressed to find that you buried the story about women's and civil 
rights groups' opposition to Judge Souter. 
</P>
<P>
I thought surely that the impassioned and well-stated fears from such people as 
Faye Wattleton of Planned Parenthood and those from other prominent civil 
rights groups would merit front-page news coverage. Instead, it is buried 
inside ("Reject Souter, Backers of Abortion Rights Say," Part A, Sept. 19). 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, I read an uninspired "endorsement" of him (editorial, "The Price 
of Independence") with a plea to not see him as a "single-issue" person. Would 
you feel the same if the issue were the First Amendment?

IF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CONTINUES THROUGH 1991, I WOULD . . . . . . PUSH

<P>
Economically, California's future can be bright. But we cannot sit on our hands 
and expect to provide jobs for our people if we cannot compete in the new world 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Education is the golden key to the future of our people and our economy. 
</P>
<P>
California must produce a skilled work force, because our economy is becoming 
more specialized and requires skills to produce. I do not fear recession as I 
do the failure of our students, schools and parents. We must recognize the 
value of education, with a leader to point the way. 
</P>
<P>
My way is early childhood education, performance standards for promotion and 
graduation, full implementation of Proposition 98, more classrooms and 
teachers, and pride in teaching and learning. 
</P>
<P>
My first educational priority will be to begin a "California Jump Start" 
program to provide an outstanding preschool education for every four-year-old 
who needs it. The Safe Streets Act on the November ballot, which I am 
supporting, provides some of the funding needed for this program. Additional 
money would come from increasing education's share of proceeds from the 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
We know that early childhood education makes a real difference in students' 
lives. Studies have shown that children who attend preschool programs are 40% 
less likely to drop out of school and 60% more likely to find a job once they 
leave school. 
</P>
<P>
If we are serious about reducing our high dropout rate and educating our future 
work force, early childhood education is an important first step. 
</P>
<P>
With the fall of the Iron Curtain, vast opportunities for world trade are 
opening. In addition, California's location on the rim of the Pacific and its 
30-million-person consumer market offer robust opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, I will actively work to promote the sale of California's products, 
both nationally and internationally. We can place a new emphasis on action by 
consolidating the state's international trade programs, currently divided among 
five different agencies, into a single agency reporting directly to the 
governor. We also must expand our overseas trade offices into aggressive sales 
representatives for California. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor, I led several trade and cultural missions to Pacific Rim nations, 
which increased port, airport and general business opportunities in San 
Francisco. As governor, I would actively sell this state as a place of 
tremendous opportunity for business and a source for quality products to be 
sold abroad. Agricultural products, including the huge California wine 
industry, need new markets, and I intend to go after them. I believe in free 
trade and will do all I can to discourage restrictions, no matter how subtle, 
on California's products. 
</P>
<P>
In order for our business community to thrive and to continue to create new 
jobs for California's workers, we must see that taxes on businesses are as low 
as possible. I will veto any frivolous programs that would unfairly affect 
California's business communities. 
</P>
<P>
California needs a coordinated economic plan, so that government can be a 
better partner for business. To this end, I intend to create a joint venture 
for government, academia and business. This "California in the 21st Century" 
effort will both plan and implement. It will provide the ongoing public-private 
link to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ease the impact of defense cuts on our economy by aggressively seeking new 
non-defense-related contracts for California. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expand worker retraining and job referral services; consolidation of the 22 
separate job training programs into a single agency could be cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recommend infrastructure packages that can ease siting of new manufacturing 
ventures. I am also exploring the possible benefits that would flow by 
increasing the responsibility of Caltrans for the coordination of land, sea and 
rail transport to ensure speedy movement of goods, and to see that our ports 
compete with ports outside of California rather than each other. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do more to take advantage of innovative research and undertake new efforts 
to encourage the transfer of new technology from the laboratory into the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seek out and link up American and foreign companies similar to the New 
United Motor joint venture between Toyota and General Motors. I want foreign 
investment that provides jobs for Californians and new management know-how 
rather than real estate speculation that buys up California. 
</P>
<P>
Because of California's diversified economy, we can weather any potential 
recession, as we have in the past. The main job of the governor is to ensure 
the economic and social well-being and safety of the people of this state. I 
intend to do my utmost to keep our economy pumping vigorously so that our 
people can be employed. I intend to lead a campaign to make education and the 
development of a skilled work force a statewide priority. And I will personally 
promote California as a good place to do business, and see that we back that 
promise up with action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

AN OP-ED DEBATE 
</P>
<P>
 Recently The Times invited gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete 
Wilson to participate in a number of issue discussions on this page. Today's 
question is: If the economic downturn continues through 1991, what are the 
three specific things a new governor could do about it? Subsequent topics, to 
appear in the coming weeks, will be the budget, drugs, the environment and 
education.

AMERICANS WISE UP TO BUSH SELLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: PRESIDENT'S BROKEN PROMISE WILL DROP A BIPARTISAN WHAMMY ONTO JOE 
SIX-PACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts is the William E. Simon professor of 
political economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With each passing day, the Bush Administration acts more and more like the 
beleaguered Ryzhkov government in the Soviet Union. Nikolai Ryzhkov is Mikhail 
Gorbachev's prime minister whose economic plan has come under fire for 
proposing "business as usual" while the Soviet economy sinks into depression 
and famine. Russians, burned by this callousness, are calling for the 
government's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's budget negotiators are showing the same insensitivity. As the U.S. 
economy sinks into recession, President Bush, his budget director Richard A. 
Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, together with Republican 
congressional leaders Bob Dole and Bob Michel, are engaged in a bidding game 
with Democrats to see who can pile the most onerous new taxes on the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The budget deal that Bush is cutting with Congress is an agreement that lets 
political incumbents of both parties spend more money in an effort to buy their 
reelection. Recently, Bush allowed Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and others who 
oppose the bipartisan sellout of the taxpayers to be excluded from the 
negotiations. The group now includes only those who are determined to raise 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are no less fed up with government than Russians. Washington insiders 
should take note of John Silber's primary victory over the Massachusetts 
political Establishment and of the limited terms Oklahoma voters placed on 
state officeholders last week. Our politicians should also note the polls that 
show a jump in the number of low- and middle-incomeAmericans who believe that 
hard work no longer guarantees success because local, state and federal taxes 
steal most of the income gains that people achieve. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has a budget of $1.3 trillion, a sum that exceeds the gross 
national products of both France and Great Britain. If the U.S. budget were a 
country, it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world. Yet the greedy 
politicians want still more. Appealing to class warfare, they claim to be 
taxing the rich, but the rich are too few to produce much money. That's why 
taxes always hit Joe Six-Pack. President Bush and Senate leader George Mitchell 
want to tax his beer, his cigarettes and his gasoline. Not content with this, 
budget negotiators want to undermine his job with massive surtaxes on 
entrepreneurial income. Everyone whose success creates jobs for others is to be 
hit with a 20% surtax. 
</P>
<P>
This is no way to invigorate a declining economy. The last time taxes were 
raised in a recession, the result was a lengthy depression that created a 
market for more government. 
</P>
<P>
The income surtax proposal is a conscious attempt to overturn the Reagan 
tax-rate reductions. The politicians know that sooner or later big money will 
result from inflation pushing Joe Six-Pack into surtax brackets. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to take away the federal deduction for state and local taxes is 
aimed at homeowners. It would further weaken a declining real estate market and 
raise the cost to taxpayers of the S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Not satisfied with wrecking the private economy, the budget negotiators want to 
destroy the nonprofit sector by taking away the charitable deduction. This 
proposal is aimed at the only institutions in our society that still work -- 
private schools, hospitals and museums, charities that feed and house the 
homeless, and nonprofit research organizations. The proposal would not raise 
any revenues -- but that is not its purpose. The budget negotiators intend to 
greatly expand the education and welfare bureaucracies by eliminating the 
efficient private competition. If there are no alternatives to government 
programs, incumbents can spend still more money. 
</P>
<P>
By violating his "no new taxes" pledge, the President is putting himself and 
his government in the same league with fraudulent S&amp;L operators. The 
American people bought his candidacy in an election based on his financial 
promise, just as investors bought S&amp;L bonds based on the representations of 
S&amp;L managements. How can Charles Keating be tried for S&amp;L fraud when 
our political leaders behave the same way? A financial lie told in politics is 
no less damning than one told in business. 
</P>
<P>
When President Richard Nixon lied to the American people, he was forced to 
resign. President Bush should be held to the same standard. If Russians can 
demand the resignation of a government that puts its interest before those of 
the people, so can Americans.

<P>
SCAPEGOATING: CHARGES IN CONGRESS ABOUT STATE DEPARTMENT SIGNALS TO IRAQ SHOW 
NOTHING BUT 20-20 HINDSIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
At slamming barn doors behind escaped horses -- and imputing blame for the 
escape to the wrong parties -- the Congress of the United States knows few 
peers, now as in years long past. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the emergence of the "Who lost Kuwait?" inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
A week or so ago, the Iraqi government mischievously leaked a bugged transcript 
of Saddam Hussein's parting interview of July 25 with April Glaspie, U.S. 
ambassador to Baghdad. The obvious intent is to complain, perversely, that 
Hussein was given no clear signal that his invasion of Kuwait some days later 
would be resisted by an enormous deployment of U.S. forces. Hussein whines, by 
implication, "Why didn't you stop me before I raped another country?" 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the language of threat was there in what Hussein had to say on July 
25, just before the American ambassador left for consultations in Washington. 
Yet Ambassador Glaspie -- a highly respected Foreign Service professional -- 
was explicitly assured that no invasion was planned. 
</P>
<P>
Reading the transcript today, with 20-20 hindsight, the congressional 
detractors of Ambassador Glaspie and of her State Department superior, John 
Kelly, make the easy and gratuitous point that the State Department should have 
read the Iraqi dictator's mind more clearly, and should have left less doubt 
that the United States would resist the rape of Kuwait. At some point during 
the crucial period between July 25 and the Aug. 2 invasion, it is said that the 
CIA reached a conclusion that Saddam Hussein planned to invade. That assessment 
is invoked as further backing for the proposition that the State Department 
should have been more lucid. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing Sept. 18, House foreign affairs subcommittee Chairman Lee Hamilton 
(D-Ind.) berated Kelly for leaving "the impression that it was the policy of 
the United States not to come to the defense of Kuwait." On a previous 
occasion, Hamilton recalled, he had "asked (Kelly) if there was a U.S. 
commitment to come to Kuwait's defense if it was attacked," and Kelly had 
replied -- as truth and policy warranted at the time -- that "we have no 
defense treaty relationship with any gulf country." 
</P>
<P>
This innocent exchange, before the invasion of Kuwait, turned on simple matters 
of fact -- the United States indeed had no "commitment" to or treaty with the 
emirate. Congress would have been the first to howl if either had been 
proclaimed. Now it is transformed in hindsight into a culpable act of omission. 
This ex post facto judgment is no more than retrospective scapegoating of an 
unfair and odious variety. 
</P>
<P>
This is a familiar congressional habit with an infamous history. The most 
extreme precedent was the vengeful treatment of an entire generation of 
foreign-service professionals whose field of expertise was China. In the 
McCarthy period of the late 1940s and early '50s, these professionals, whose 
records were for the most part entirely honorable, were held accountable for 
the "loss" of China to Mao Tse-tung. Their reputations were savaged by 
congressional inquisitions amounting to treason trials. 
</P>
<P>
No one this time is charging "treason," as the kingpin congressional 
inquisitors did then. And "Who lost Kuwait?" is of a distinctly lower voltage 
than "Who lost China?" But if you listen to what the Monday-morning 
quarterbacks of Capitol Hill are saying, you can hear the first sounds of the 
new inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no allowance is made for the deviousness and bad faith of Saddam 
Hussein. As President Bush has observed, the Iraqi dictator himself is the 
unmistakable villain of the piece, and the true miscalculation his own. Blaming 
American diplomatic professionals for Hussein's misdeeds is shameful. And it 
is, of course, a recipe for a timid Foreign Service as well.

IF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CONTINUES THROUGH 1991, I WOULD . . . . . . MAKE OUR 
CHILDREN, OUR SMALL-BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND OUR GOODS COMPETITIVE WORLDWIDE.

<P>
Whether California experiences a recession depends on macroeconomic factors 
that are national and international in scope. But California can very much 
affect its own economic destiny and must do so. 
</P>
<P>
California is projected to become the fourth-largest economy in the world 
before the end of this decade. We can achieve that goal if California meets 
critical tests: 
</P>
<P>
 -- California schools must educate our children to compete and win in an 
increasingly competitive and technologically demanding global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Our kids must prepare to compete with those not just in other states but also 
with foreign workers. But far too many do not even finish high school. And too 
many who do cannot read, write or speak English well enough to communicate 
effectively. Too many do not have a sufficient grasp of basic math and science 
to satisfy even the minimum demands of today's job market. 
</P>
<P>
Through a program to integrate delivery of social and child-development 
services with public education, we must ensure that children enter the 
classroom healthy enough to concentrate and motivated enough to stay. We must 
reward extraordinary teaching achievement with merit pay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We must not sacrifice the competitiveness of California small business -- 
the great job generator of the 1980s -- by over-regulating and over-taxing it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade of the '80s, California's population grew by 23%. It is 
imperative that California implement plans to ensure the kind of continued 
economic development that means expanding payrolls, not swelling welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
A significant part of farsighted management of our growth requires making 
timely investment in needed physical infrastructure. The voters gave us in June 
the resources for the kind of rail and road transportation network we must have 
to avoid congestion and move goods and people. We must exercise similar 
foresight in providing greatly increased off-stream water storage capacity that 
will allow us to save water we are now wasting, without sacrificing water 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, once the '79-'82 recession was over, in just five years California 
jobs increased by a percentage comparable to our population growth for the 
decade. Large companies played some role in this. But small businesses were the 
ones that put Californians to work -- many in their first jobs. The growth in 
companies employing nine or fewer employees was 39%; the increase in those 
employing three or fewer was 54%. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that small business continues to hold the promise of creating 
more and more jobs. The bad news is that this small-business base is very 
vulnerable to wrong decisions by state government. Over-regulation and 
over-taxation can mean costs that wipe out the profits and close the doors of 
these promising small enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if California decided to extend health-care coverage to those who 
do not have it, should we dump the entire cost on employers, as some in the 
Legislature have urged? Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Escalating state taxes have driven jobs out of New York and Massachusetts to 
neighboring states where costs of doing business -- including taxes -- are much 
lower. Massachusetts' high taxes have provided a job bonanza for New Hampshire. 
Nevada and Arizona could be our New Hampshire. Our cost of living, especially 
the shortage of affordable housing, aggravates the situation. 
</P>
<P>
I will create an office of small business within the governor's office that 
will have as its explicit mission trouble-shooting both executive and 
legislative proposals for taxation and regulation to safeguard the continued 
job-producing capability of small business. Nor can well-intended but poorly 
conceived initiatives escape the same critical scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 -- California must aggressively market its goods and services, at home and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 One acre in every three under cultivation in California is for export. 
California agriculture and high-tech exports have not been accorded fair market 
access or fair treatment from our foreign trading partners. If trading partners 
fail to accord fair access and treatment to our exports, we must respond. 
</P>
<P>
I will use California's political and economic clout to apply pressure on both 
U.S. and foreign trade officials to ensure that California receives equity. We 
are positioned to be the premier player in the next decade in an explosion of 
Pacific Rim trade. I will relish the role, as I did as mayor of San Diego, of 
California's chief salesman and trade advocate. 
</P>
<P>
No other state can boast California's tourism attractions or capabilities. 
Tourism offers enormous gains in employment and is the prime employer of young 
and entry-level workers. The state should engage in a vigorous collaboration 
with local convention/visitor bureaus and the industry to aggressively market 
California. In the same fashion, the governor and state government should be an 
advocate for California's high-technology, biomedical research and 
instrumentation, telecommunications and motion picture and television 
production industries. 
</P>
<P>
The California I envision for 2000 is a competitive and prosperous one, with a 
diverse and thriving economy producing good jobs and high job satisfaction, and 
profits to support sound public services and generous private philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AN OP-ED DEBATE 
</P>
<P>
 Recently The Times invited gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete 
Wilson to participate in a number of issue discussions on this page. Today's 
question is: If the economic downturn continues through 1991, what are the 
three specific things a new governor could do about it? Subsequent topics, to 
appear in the coming weeks, will be the budget, drugs, the environment and 
education.

MORNING BRIEFING: IOC DECISION WAS ALL GREEK TO ATHENIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melina Mercouri, the actress-turned-politician who helped lead Athens' bid for 
the 1996 Olympics, might not have been on the losing side, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Mercouri, a candidate in the city's mayoral election in October, was quoted in 
Greek newspapers Saturday as saying: "If elected, I will seek Athens' candidacy 
to host the Olympics in the year 2000. I have the feeling that the whole of 
Europe will support us." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Atlanta won the right to hold the XXVI Olympiad, 100 years after 
the modern games began in the Greek capital, Mercouri rationalized that in the 
year 2000, the Olympics would be entering their third millennium. (The ancient 
Games began in Greece in 776 B.C.) 
</P>
<P>
Said Mercouri: "In a moment of great outrage, I said (in Tokyo) that Coca-Cola 
has won over the Parthenon. There were omissions and minor errors, but Athens' 
presentation was worthy." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the major league single-season record for home runs by a 
pitcher? 
</P>
<P>
Tools of impertinence: When San Francisco Giant catcher Steve Decker stopped a 
ball in the dirt Friday night, Dodger announcer Vin Scully couldn't resist 
saying: "That's a case of block and Decker." 
</P>
<P>
Icy relations: Memo to hockey fans who dreamed that the Montreal Canadiens' 
two-week trip to Scandinavia and the Soviet Union would promote peace and 
understanding: Dream on. 
</P>
<P>
Ten players, seven of them Canadiens, were ejected from last Tuesday's game in 
Moscow against Central Red Army. Fans pelted the visitors with litter, 
including one vodka bottle. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, Serge Savard, Canadien managing director, told The Gazette in 
Montreal: "I wouldn't advise any team to go. . . . Going there didn't do much 
to prepare us for the regular season. The traveling did nothing for us. It hurt 
us. The frustration and the accommodations left us mentally tired." 
</P>
<P>
Add hockey: Savard said that the Soviets gave the Canadiens' traveling party 
only 50 tickets per game, instead of the 100 promised. Worse, the group was 
delayed at customs Wednesday, and officials confiscated jars of caviar from 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
Said Canadien center Denis Savard: "They put us through hell. The 15 days were 
a waste." 
</P>
<P>
Now you know: From Associated Press: "A famous 19th-Century canoe racer, 
Nathaniel Bishop, once cruised from Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico in a paper 
canoe." 
</P>
<P>
Up to here: Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun now dreads each approaching 
Sunday. On Friday, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's in a quandary, wondering what aspect of the life and times of 
Atlanta Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville will the battling network pregame shows 
dabble in this week. How about something on what young Jer and his fellow 
hellions did for excitement on Halloween?" 
</P>
<P>
Add Glanville glut: The October issue of Esquire offers an eight-page ramble, 
"Jerry Glanville's Unbuckled Ego," by Mark Kram. 
</P>
<P>
Of Glanville's tenure as Houston Oiler coach, Kram wrote: "Big Harvey Salem 
used to think Glanville was too inhumane, too cruel. He took to calling the 
coach Billy Jack." 
</P>
<P>
Said Glanville: "I went to the movie. No resemblance. I'd never take off my 
boots to kick somebody in the mouth."

<P>
Now aren't you glad that the Raiders decided to stay? Without them, Los Angeles 
wouldn't have an unbeaten football team, college or pro. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It would make no sense for the Raiders to deal a high draft choice to New 
Orleans for quarterback Bobby Hebert. Jay Schroeder is doing OK. Besides, 
Hebert is a finesse kind of passer who probably wouldn't fit in a long-ball 
offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's defense that is mostly responsible for the Raiders being 3-0. 
Shades of the 11 Angry Men of 1967. The only touchdown they've allowed in three 
games this season was John L. Williams' two-yard run in the third quarter in 
Seattle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I hope Pittsburghers aren't abstaining until the Steeler offense scores a 
touchdown for new offensive coordinator Joe Walton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At 11:20 a.m. Sunday, a couple of hundred people dressed in silver and black 
chanted "Raiders, Raiders," as Al Davis emerged from a limousine outside the 
Coliseum press box. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 50,657 wasn't all that terrific for the first home game since 
Davis announced that the Raiders were staying in L.A., but ticket brokers are 
asking big numbers for the clash of unbeatens between the Raiders and Chicago 
Bears Sunday at the Coliseum. . . . Schroeder made so few mistakes that he 
didn't get booed until midway in the third quarter when he overthrew Tim Brown. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have to find a way to get Brown more involved in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that loud Anaheim Stadium crowd threw the Rams off their normal game. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Think Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham, the former Santa Barbara 
High star, was psyched up about his return to Southern California? . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the possibility that the San Francisco 49ers would help the 
injury-plagued Rams by getting off to a slow start. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I don't think the Denver Broncos are going to have to worry about being 
slaughtered in the Super Bowl again this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Parcells will never hear the end of it if Lawrence Taylor's hamstring 
injury turns out to be serious. He was hurt on the final play of the game after 
being re-inserted with the New York Giants winning over Miami, 20-3. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The last thing you expect from a Larry Smith-coached team is for it to lose its 
composure, but that's what USC did Saturday in Seattle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among the most telling statistics were the 13 penalties for 111 yards handed 
the Trojans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And whatever happened to USC's rushing game? Washington leads the nation in 
rush defense, but the Trojans couldn't open holes for Ricky Ervins against 
Syracuse or Penn State, either. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Charge Washington Coach Don James with inciting a crowd. Early in the week, he 
said it wouldn't bother him a bit if Todd Marinovich's signals couldn't be 
heard all day Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was so hot in Husky Stadium that fans were installed behind the Washington 
bench to cool off the players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, who were on a crusade against USC, can't be expected to play 
near-perfect football again this season. However, the Pac-10 schedule is kind 
to them. They play Oregon, California, Arizona 
</P>
<P>
and UCLA at home and Arizona State, Stanford and Washington State on the road. 
</P>
<P>
New Michigan Coach Gary Moeller has one thing Bo Schembechler lacked -- an 
imagination. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That was a funny game in Ann Arbor. Michigan dominated early, closed fast, and 
prevailed, 38-15, but you believe UCLA Coach Terry Donahue when he says he kept 
thinking that the Bruins were going to win the game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
More imaginative play-calling on those occasions when the Bruins got deep into 
Wolverine territory would have helped. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Luck of the Irish? You must have plenty of skill and poise, too, to win as many 
close, come-from-behind games as Notre Dame does. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only an injury would keep BYU quarterback Ty Detmer from winning the Heisman 
Trophy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Howard Griffith hadn't scored eight touchdowns, Southern Illinois might have 
beaten Illinois. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only NCAA 1-A team in the Southland to win Saturday was George Allen's Cal 
State Long Beach 49ers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Longshot Home At Last's victory in the Louisiana Super Derby confirmed the 
suspicion that this year's 3-year-old crop is weak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a terrific sports town Toronto is. All those years of Maple Leaf hockey 
sellouts and now the Blue Jays break the baseball attendance record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly sure looks different without his mustache. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres rarely have been kind to the Dodgers. They usually give 
them fits in head-to-head competition. And when the Dodgers needed help from 
San Diego over the weekend against Cincinnati, they got none. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But, really, who can complain about the kind of season the Dodgers have had 
without Orel Hershiser?

BUTLER KEEPS BEARS ALIVE AND KICKING; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: CHICAGO STAYS UNBEATEN. MARGIN IS 52-YARD FIELD GOAL WITH FOUR SECONDS 
LEFT AGAINST VIKINGS, WHO ARE 1-2 AND MAY HAVE LOST QUARTERBACK WILSON.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By virtue of Kevin Butler's 52-yard field goal with four seconds remaining, 
which defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 19-16, Sunday at Soldier Field, the 
Chicago Bears will be bringing an unbeaten team to next Sunday's game with the 
Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are unbeaten, too. 
</P>
<P>
And the Vikings? 
</P>
<P>
Just beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Beaten-up and broken-spirited. Their record is a distressing 1-2. Worse yet, 
their quarterback, Wade Wilson, left the field in the final minute with a 
sprained thumb on his passing hand that looks serious enough to keep him out of 
next week's game with Tampa Bay, and might even require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I can grip a ball," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Viking punter Harry Newsome, who was near tears as he discussed 
the snap he dropped with 25 seconds to play that put Chicago in position to win 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I let down 47 guys and all the coaches," Newsome said, choking back sobs. "All 
I had to do is catch the ball and get it off and the game goes into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain this. This will stick in my mind the rest of my life. This is 
about the worst thing that can happen to a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Viking linebacker Scott Studwell could have covered for Newsome's mistake with 
15 seconds remaining by catching a tipped Jim Harbaugh pass that floated right 
to him. Studwell, too, let this game slip through his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Studwell had nothing to say about anything, but tackle Keith Millard said: 
"It's a pretty big downer. We just gave it away. We're 1-2 and we're 
depressed." 
</P>
<P>
Dominated by a Bear ball-control offense that completed only five passes all 
day, the Vikings were behind from beginning to near-end until Wilson found 
Hassan Jones with a 17-yard touchdown pass with 1:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute later, Minnesota got the ball back. It advanced to the 
Chicago 48. 
</P>
<P>
But when Wilson suffered two incompletions and then a sack during which he 
jammed his thumb on a Bear's face mask, the Vikings were forced to punt. In 
came Newsome, who has been in this line of work for six NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Schreiber's snap was wobbly, but catchable. Newsome didn't catch it. He 
fumbled it and fell on it at the Viking 39, where the Bears took possession. 
</P>
<P>
"The punting game drives you nuts," said Viking Coach Jerry Burns, who endured 
a Newsome 14-yarder earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a block, a bad snap, a guy returning the ball -- a million problems 
involving the punting game. All day long our punting wasn't big-league. 
Finally, it spelled our doom." 
</P>
<P>
Butler did so with his 52-yard field goal, tying a Soldier Field record he 
shares with two others. He also kicked one 51 yards, after not having been 
successful from 50 or more since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Butler had four field goals in all. The rest of Chicago's offense belonged to 
Neal Anderson, who rushed for 91 yards that included an eight-yard touchdown, 
and Brad Muster, with a career-high 90. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears rarely passed, trying none in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson played with a painful rib injury that concerns Coach Mike Ditka with 
regard to next week's game -- especially so because Anderson's backup at 
tailback, Mark Green from Riverside, injured his left knee Sunday and might be 
out for a month. 
</P>
<P>
In giving Chicago a record of 3-0, Butler found himself looking forward to 
playing "a pretty tough L.A. Raider team that pretty much manhandled us when 
they were here." The Raiders beat the Bears, 20-3, in a preseason game Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Butler also made reference to football fans possibly being "in for a treat" 
because, should a thigh injury keep nagging him during kickoffs, he might 
temporarily relinquish that responsibility to 315-pound Refrigerator Perry. 
</P>
<P>
As if California didn't have enough tremors already. 
</P>
<P>
Butler doesn't feel as much pain during field goals as on kickoffs because of 
the leg extension involved, but he was hurting plenty with 8:29 to play after 
Ken Johnson blocked his 36-yard field-goal try, keeping Minnesota in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Igwebuike's three field goals and Herschel Walker's 72 rushing yards 
accounted for most of the Viking offense. Wilson's passing was unimpressive. Of 
his first seven passes, four were incomplete, two were intercepted and the 
seventh went to Walker for minus-two yards. 
</P>
<P>
An 80-yard drive capped by the scoring pass to Jones late in the game overcame 
Wilson's poor start, at least until the butterfingered Vikings handed back the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Ditka cared how his Bears won. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place on that scoreboard that says: 'Description,' " Ditka said.

<P>
The San Diego Chargers earned their first victory of the season, beating the 
Cleveland Browns, 24-14, Sunday, and Coach Dan Henning gave credit to Dennis 
Conner, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
Henning used the yachtman's 1978 book, "No Excuse to Lose," for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dennis Conner should take a bow for this win," Henning said. "I met 
him on a flight back from New York in July and asked him to send me his book. 
We got to talking about some of the things he goes through to put a crew and 
challenge together, and I thought they were very poignant in relation to our 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The media and fans give you all kinds of reasons and excuses, like you're too 
young, you haven't been together long enough, your quarterback is not 
experienced enough. All those things are true, but it's probably true for 20 
other teams, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with the team about it," Henning said. "I told them I wasn't going to 
give them any excuses, and they shouldn't give themselves any. And I got that 
commitment from them." 
</P>
<P>
He also got: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Touchdown passes of 19 and 23 yards from Billy Joe Tolliver to Anthony 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A game-turning 67-yard interception return from linebacker Henry Rolling to 
set up a one-yard scoring run by Rod Bernstine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A doggone good pass rush on the Dawg Pound's kennel master, 
quarterbackBernie Kosar, who threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 42-yard job-saving field goal to open the game's scoring from Fuad 
Reveiz. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kickoff coverage that buried the Browns' Eric Metcalf, who was averaging 34 
yards a return, to 12.8 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Individual outstanding performances from Marion Butts, Craig McEwen and 
Ronnie Harmon on offense, and Lee Williams, Martin Bayless and Sam Seale on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"No excuses, that's what Coach Henning stressed to us the night before the 
game, and then again in the morning," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "He said it 
was just time to win." 
</P>
<P>
Down 14-10 at halftime, the Chargers posted their first second-half points of 
the season against a defense that had not allowed a score in either the third 
or fourth quarters this season. 
</P>
<P>
And they did it by sticking with an erratic Tolliver at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been asked, when Billy's struggling, do you change the quarterback?" 
Henning said. "Well, Billy wasn't the only one struggling out there. We had 
some young people make some errors in movement, and we had some young people 
make some errors in routes, and even a veteran quarterback is going to look 
shaky under those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver finished 12 of 29 for 139 yards with a pair of interceptions. At 
halftime he was eight of 22 for 86 yards with those two interceptions, and no, 
Henning said, he never gave a thought to warming up Mark Vlasic. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's first two passes Sunday were incomplete and his third was 
intercepted by linebacker Mike Johnson and returned 64 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But things got better, particularly in the second half after Tolliver's 23-yard 
strike to Miller put the Chargers ahead to stay.

Quarterback Warren Moon produced a record-setting performance and finally got 
the Houston Oilers' run-and-shoot offense operating efficiently Sunday against 
the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
After two games filled with mistakes, Moon threw for three touchdowns and 
became the Oilers' all-time leading passer during a 24-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 29 of 39 passes for 308 yards and connected on touchdown pass 
plays of 13 and seven yards to Lorenzo White and six yards to Ernest Givins. He 
threw one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we needed a win more than I needed to set any kind of records," said 
Moon, a seven-year veteran who now has 19,289 career passing yards, erasing the 
record of 19,149 set by former Oiler quarterback George Blanda. "All this means 
is I've had good receivers and I've been here a long time." 
</P>
<P>
After both teams spent the first quarter victimizing themselves with mistakes, 
Moon went to White for his touchdowns and a 14-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We got things going in the second quarter, and that's what we needed," Oiler 
Coach Jack Pardee said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (1-2) took advantage of four first-half turnovers by the Colts 
(0-3), including fumbles by Jack Trudeau and Clarence Verdin and interceptions 
of passes thrown by Jeff George and Trudeau. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances, and we constantly stopped ourselves," Colt Coach Ron Meyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau replaced George in the second quarter when George was bothered by a 
stomach ailment. 
</P>
<P>
But Meyer had to send George back into the game in the final minutes after 
Trudeau and Mark Herrmann were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS-TV affiliate in Indianapolis reported Meyer and offensive coordinator 
Larry Kennan might be fired, but Colt General Manager Jim Irsay called the 
report erroneous.

BREECH KICK-STARTS BENGAL OFFENSE, 41-7; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: CINCINNATI KICKER SCORES IN NFL-RECORD 152ND CONSECUTIVE GAME AS BENGALS 
BURY SUDDENLY MISTAKE-PRONE PATRIOTS.

<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals' offense had struggled in its first two games this 
season, but it broke out in a big way Sunday against the suddenly mistake-prone 
New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Breech kick-started the Bengals with a 46-yard field goal that set a 
consecutive-game scoring record and started a 31-point spree that carried the 
unbeaten Bengals to a 41-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' fourth 3-0 start in franchise history is a good omen. The last 
time they started 3-0 was 1988, when they went to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Breech's kick gave him points in an NFL-record 152 consecutive games, topping 
the mark set by Minnesota's Fred Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to get it out of the way early," said Breech, who is in his 13th 
season. "When I saw it fly through, I said, 'Yeah!' It got that over, and it 
got us off to a quick start. That gave us three points early and set the tone. 
We played the best game we have all year." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New England played its worst. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a lot of mistakes -- an ample number to last us the season," New 
England Coach Rod Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (1-2) came into the game with the best turnover ratio in the NFL, 
but self-destructed with four fumbles, two interceptions, two blown coverages 
on defense, a botched punt and an end-zone interception nullified by a holding 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that could happen to us did today," said Patriot quarterback Marc 
Wilson, who started in place of the injured Steve Grogan and completed 23 of 42 
passes for 267 yards. "Maybe that's good -- we got out everything that could go 
wrong. Maybe we can learn from our mistakes and go on from here." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots' problems began when Bengal cornerback Lewis Billups intercepted 
Wilson's first pass at the Patriots' 39. Four plays later, Breech's field goal 
got the offense rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason completed 15 of 25 passes for 271 yards and 
two touchdowns -- to Eddie Brown for 42 yards and Rodney Holman for 3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals were leading 10-0 when they took command by tricking the Patriots 
on fourth and goal from the four-yard line late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Holman lined up at the right end of the line for an apparent 21-yard field-goal 
attempt by Breech. 
</P>
<P>
But Holman slid behind the line to take a shovel pass from holder Lee Johnson 
and ran uncontested into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Green scored the Bengals' first rushing touchdown of the season on a 
three-yard run in the second quarter.

LIONS FALL AGAIN TO THE BUCS;

NFC: TESTAVERDE LEADS TAMPA BAY TO VICTORY OVER DETROIT FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 
THREE WEEKS, 23-20.

<TEXT>
<P>
It took Vinny Testaverde more than three quarters, but he finally found a way 
to beat Detroit's restructured secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay's quarterback broke up a battle of field goals with two 
fourth-quarter touchdown drives that carried the Buccaneers to a 23-20 victory 
over the Lions Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Anderson scored on an 11-yard run that gave the Bucs a short-lived 16-13 
lead early in the final quarter and John Harvey's three-yard touchdown 
reception provided the winning points with 4:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Tampa Bay's second in three weeks over Detroit (1-2) and gave 
the Bucaneers (2-1) sole possession of second-place in the NFC Central behind 
the unbeaten Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay dominated Detroit in the opening week of the season, winning 38-21, 
forcing six turnovers and sacking Rodney Peete and Bob Gagliano six times. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the difference on the scoreboard was a 42-yard field goal that Eddie 
Murray made on the first play of the fourth quarter but was nullified because 
of a tripping penalty on Eric Andolsek. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Christie kicked first-half field goals of 55 and 28 yards for Tampa Bay, 
then added a 21-yarder to trim a seven-point deficit to 13-9 with 3:21 left in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, unable to spot an open receiver on a halfback pass, tucked the ball 
under his arm, cut back to his left and ran seven yards before diving four more 
for the touchdown that gave the Bucaneers their 16-13 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions regained the lead, 20-16, only 2:25 later when Peete, who scored on a 
quarterback sneak in the third quarter, scrambled 22 yards to set up a 
five-yard touchdown pass to Robert Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Peete frustrated the Bucs with his running all night long, gaining 97 yards in 
eight carries. He also completed 17 of 26 passes for 169 yards and made several 
crucial third-down plays to set up Murray's field goals of 25 and 33 yards in 
the first half.

TEAM CUP GIVES PLAYERS, CROWD A TASTE OF EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For all intents and purposes, the professional beach volleyball season is over. 
</P>
<P>
And the international European leagues will not begin until October. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to fill the vacuum for the sport's aficionados is Team Cup 
Volleyball, which ended after six days of competition Sunday night at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
This weeklong competition of spikes and sets was a melding of the United 
States' 32 best indoor and beach volleyball players divided into four teams. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated Team Redsand, led by Olympians Steve Timmons and Craig Buck, 
dominated play throughout the week and won Sunday's final by defeating Team 
Toyota, 30-27, 30-19, before 5,627. 
</P>
<P>
A competition of this sort is necessary to promote the sport, the athletes say. 
Volleyball is enjoying success as a two-person beach game. 
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. men winning the 1984 and '88 Olympic gold medals, the sport also 
has gained popularity indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're going through serious growing pains," said Timmons, one of America's 
marquee players. "Our early goal was to sell the sport to the public. In a way, 
we are still doing that." 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, they have a way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still not getting the numbers to come out and watch the indoor game," 
said Jon Root, a member of the 1988 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
These players know where the money is -- Italy. Timmons and Karch Kiraly, the 
leaders of the U.S. Olympic movement in the last decade, have signed 
half-million dollar contracts for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
Root does not command as high a salary in Italy, but he also is leaving next 
week. So are several other U.S. stars. Most of the country's elite players live 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"This (competition) is a warm-up for us," Root said. 
</P>
<P>
The players hope volleyball eventually will support a U.S. professional league. 
Such enterprises have failed in the past, yet a twinge of hope remains. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we could take this on the road," Timmons said. "L.A. is a tough 
market. We could get a lot more fans in other American cities."

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
B.C. OPEN IS INITIAL WIN FOR HENKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tour sophomore Nolan Henke shot a three-under-par 68 Sunday to outlast Barry 
Jaeckel and hold off Mark Wiebe and earn his first PGA victory in the $700,000 
B.C. Open at Endicott, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Henke, who never trailed in the tournament after sharing the first-round lead 
with Jim Hallet, finished 72 holes at En-Joie Golf Course in 268, 16 under par, 
and three strokes better than Wiebe, who overtook Jaeckel for second when he 
birdied No. 18 for a final-round 64. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to stay calm," said Henke. "I knew I could screw up. I just 
didn't want to screw up too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Jaeckel, who started the day three strokes behind Henke, pulled within a stroke 
of the lead on the 10th hole, but lost any chance of overtaking Henke when he 
suffered bogeys on 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Tied with Jaeckel at 272 were Doug Tewell with a 67, Brian Tennyson, 66, and 
Jim Benepe, 68. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dent, six shots off the lead when the final round began, shot a 
seven-under-par 65 and won the Senior Tour event at Richmond, Va., by a stroke 
over Lee Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Dent's 14-under-par 202 total tied the 54-hole tournament record set two years 
ago by Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
Dent's fourth victory of the year earned him $52,000 and pushed him into second 
place on the earnings list with $583,377. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino set a single-season money record with the $28,000 he earned for second 
place after a final-round 67 over the 6,444-yard Hermitage Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
He now has won $740,212, eclipsing Bob Charles' mark of $725,157 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Second-round leader Gary Player was still in front at 15 under until he bogeyed 
three of the last six holes for a 73 that left him in third place at 204. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Woosnam of Wales beat Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, 4 and 2, at Virginia Water, 
England, to win his second World Match Play title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The runner-up to England's Nick Faldo last year and a winner in 1987, Woosnam 
had McNulty chasing him all day. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam missed a short putt on the 29th hole that would have given him a 
two-hole lead. At the 30th, McNulty had to concede a Woosnam birdie and the 
Welshman stood two up with six to play.

TRANS-MISS GOLF: RICHARDSON AND MYERS, TWO-TIME RUNNERS-UP, DON'T HAVE MUCH IN 
COMMON. BUT EACH SAYS HE LIKES THE COMPANY.

<P>
As they squinted toward the seventh fairway at The Farms Golf Club Friday 
afternoon, Kemp Richardson and Jim Myers seemed to have captured the moment of 
every amateur golfer's dream. 
</P>
<P>
On a brilliant afternoon on the last day of summer, traversing the beautiful 
but treacherous landscape of a championship course, Richardson and Myers were 
relaxed, kidding around as longtime buddies do and shooting under par. 
</P>
<P>
If either had a concern at that moment, it was not about how they would play 
their next tee shots but that neither could recall exactly where and when they 
first met. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a beer, probably," said Richardson as he smashed a three-wood into the 
sun and out of sight until a tiny white dot appeared 30 feet to the right of 
the pin, about five feet closer than the white dot that belonged to Myers. 
</P>
<P>
All they could say for sure was that they had seen each at other amateur 
tournaments off and on during the past decade and finally decided to play as a 
team in the Trans-Mississippi Assn. Four-Ball Championship tournament two years 
ago. Richardson, 44, of Laguna Niguel, and Myers, 45, of Oceanside, who play 
together maybe six times a year, were getting a jump on the competition for the 
1990 event, which opens with a practice round at the Farms today. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Myers have never won the Trans-Miss, a tournament that draws 
some of the best 25-and-older twosomes in the country and serves as the 
association's primary fund raiser. Winning, they say, is not the reason they've 
put up the $600 fee to play this event. They just enjoy the competition and 
each other's company. 
</P>
<P>
But Richardson and Myers twice have finished second. This year they enter the 
three-round, 54-hole event Tuesday as the strongest bid for a local champion in 
a 10-year-old tournament that's making its first stop in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not life or death, and we're not trying to earn our living at it," said 
Richardson, an investment broker. "But we like the competition, and that's 
really how you find out if you're good at anything." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two years ago, Richardson considered joining the PGA tour until he 
realized he didn't like living out of a suitcase. In 1968, he was an 
All-American at USC. He proved last February that he hadn't lost his touch when 
he shot a 68 during qualifying and beat out 138 other amateurs for a spot in 
the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
In competition, Richardson and Myers make an unlikely team. Myers is an 
Oceanside fire chief who only played golf competitively in at Oceanside High 
School. Richardson, whose father was a national senior amateur champion in 
1987, the year before his death, played his first round of golf at age 6, but 
Myers didn't touch clubs until he was 14. But the two seem to share a chemistry 
on the course that makes for success. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember Jim in college, I can say that," Richardson said. "But he's a 
very good player. We play well together." 
</P>
<P>
"As Kemp goes we go, pretty much," Myers said. "He's the dominant player." 
</P>
<P>
Myers gives all the credit to Richardson for the twosome's opening-round 61 at 
Barton Creek Country Club in Austin, Tex., a year ago. They shot 11-under par 
to lead by eight strokes after 18 holes, then collapsed. They finished the 
tournament three shots back. In 1988, they were one stoke off the pace the 
entire tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We really should have won it last year," Richardson conceded. "That was awful. 
You just have to play each hole the best you can. If your partner gets in deep 
doo-doo, you don't want to get in deep doo-doo with him."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: LILLEY GIVEN TIME TO PROVE HE CAN CUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it "uncut," or "decut?" Whichever, it applies to Bob Lilley, the only 
defender with professional indoor experience brought into training camp by the 
defender-depleted Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
After being told he was cut by Coach Ron Newman Thursday, Lilley pleaded his 
case to assistant coaches Brian Quinn and Erich Geyer, who then told him to 
stick around one more week. 
</P>
<P>
All this is unknown to Newman, who put Quinn and Geyer in charge when he left 
for St. Louis on Friday to tend to the Major Soccer League select team, which 
is preparing for matches with the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
But Geyer thinks Newman would approve. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was cut, what it did was tell him he's got to be more aggressive," 
Geyer said. "And maybe that has happened. He kind of counter-attacked and said, 
'Wait a minute, I will show you what I can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Lilley, "I just want a chance to practice with the regulars. I don't want 
to quit yet." 
</P>
<P>
Lilley played for the Hershey Impact of the National Professional Soccer League 
the past two years and was considered one of the top defenders in that league. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, Geyer and President Ron Cady said they still have not heard 
from Branko Segota, the perennially late-arriving forward who spends his 
summers in Yugoslavia. It was thought Segota might show up on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers will play their annual exhibition against San Diego State at 7 
tonight at Aztec Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Button and Leo Ronces each had a goal and an assist as USD beat Cal 
State Fullerton, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Tom Tate recorded his sixth shutout and reduced his goals-against 
average to 0.81. 
</P>
<P>
Also scoring for USD (6-0-4) were Tom Crane and Vince Bianchi. Fullerton fell 
to 1-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego and Claremont, in a rematch of last year's Division III West 
Regional final, played two extra 15-minute periods, 120 minutes in all, and 
ended in a 0-0 tie. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's final, UCSD (7-2-1) beat Claremont (1-1-4), 2-1, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 UC San Diego dropped four matches in the USC Invitational, all to 
higher-ranked schools, and fell to 2-12. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Vance scored seven goals and Sean Kinghorn six during the losses to: No. 
3 USC (12-6), No. 9 Fresno (12-11), No. 19 Long Beach (10-3) and to No. 6 
Pepperdine (15-11).

PIGG, HANSEN GET WELL SOON IN USTS VICTORIES

ENCINITAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Mike Pigg and Joy Hansen, the festering clouds of borderline depression and 
anemic health broke up about the same time the less-threatening rain clouds did 
Sunday morning at Moonlight Beach in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
A capacity crowd of 2,200 gathered to churn out a .9-mile ocean swim, crank on 
a 24.8-mile bike ride, then face the final test -- a 6.2-mile run -- in the San 
Diego Bud Light Triathlon, the 10th of 11 stops on the United States Triathlon 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Arcata's Pigg, a two-time USTS national champion and winner here in 1988, was 
coming off disappointing finishes of sixth and 11th in New Orleans and at the 
World Championships in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, of Newtown Square, Pa., fatigued from her eighth race in as many weeks 
and bothered by an ear infection, curtailed her training regimen to running 10 
miles and 40 on the bike the week before the competition, and she didn't 
venture near water. 
</P>
<P>
But both won their pro divisions in the USTS' 99th event -- the first race was 
here in 1982 -- proving why they are two of the best in their business. 
</P>
<P>
Pigg, winning in a time of 1 hour 45 minutes 32 seconds, out-kicked Harold 
Robinson (1:45:38) and Jim Riccitello (1:45:53) in the final 400 yards of the 
men's race, and Hansen pumped up the volume halfway into the run to finish in 
1:56:49, ahead of Colleen Cannon (1:57:30). 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was fourth out of the water and fifth after the bike leg, where Jan 
Ripple was the leader. But something clicked for her as she began the run. 
</P>
<P>
"A mile into the run, I had a good rhythm," she said. "It felt natural for me. 
I haven't felt like that in a while. It wasn't forced." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, a Del Mar resident before moving east in 1985, caught Cannon and 
third-place finisher Karen Smyers at the one-mile mark, then caught up with 
Ripple with three miles to go. 
</P>
<P>
She is a 222-point leader in the Coke Grand Prix series and would have to 
finish worse than sixth in Las Vegas next month not to win her first overall 
Coke Grand Prix point title, which carries a bonus of $27,000 for both men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win there," she said. "Las Vegas is important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Pigg, three-time winner of the Coke title and currently in third, said he was 
looking for a good race. 
</P>
<P>
"I had lost a lot of confidence," said Pigg, who could catch points-leader 
Robinson with a top finish in Las Vegas. "I didn't care how I did, I just 
wanted to work hard here." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the water well behind the lead pack, Pigg worked hard on the bike 
-- his best event -- and pulled to second going into the run, where he and 
Robinson suspected Riccitello might fade. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson never doubted he and Pigg would overtake Riccitello. In fact, they 
talked about it as they played cat and mouse on the run. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could catch him," said Robinson, who eventually passed Pigg at 
the six-mile mark. "It was just a question of when." 
</P>
<P>
Riccitello was 12th out of the water and led Pigg and Robinson by 65 seconds 
after the bike segment. His lead slipped slowly away throughout the run. 
</P>
<P>
"You stud-muffin," Robinson shot at Riccitello shortly after the race. 
</P>
<P>
Pigg and Robinson cooked Riccitello going into the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying not to choke," Riccitello said. "I ran as fast as I could. They 
just ran faster. They're both running real well." 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the straightaway, Pigg stared at the heels of both and knew he 
must act. "I caught Jim," Pigg said. "Harold, I didn't know (if I could catch). 
I didn't know if he had one more gear left of not." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently not. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts real bad to sprint like that, or it doesn't hurt at all," Pigg said. 
"But it hurts worse if you're in second. As soon as you stop, it hits you like 
a rock." 
</P>
<P>
Triathlon Notes 
</P>
<P>
It was Mike Pigg's fourth USTS victory this season. . . . It's tough putting on 
a race with 2,200 bodies. Some comments overhead by races officials Sunday: "I 
really don't know what to do," "No one is really helping me," and our favorite, 
"This could be a disaster." . . . It was a big day for pro Renee Goldhirsh. 
After her fifth-place finish, she had a little something else planned. She was 
married.

Questionable Book Review 
</P>
<P>
There's no shortage of books on the savings and loan debacle, what with three 
major books in print and at least six more on the way. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the unique title award goes to a low-budget paperback by Jess A. 
Rodrigues, former owner of the now-defunct Saratoga Savings &amp; Loan in San 
Jose. Rodrigues' just-published book, a 204-page tirade against regulators and 
his competitors, is titled "Power Above the Law -- S&amp;L Bailout?!?!?!" 
</P>
<P>
The book did get a good review from one prominent person, attorney and former 
San Francisco Mayor Joseph L. Alioto, who on the book jacket is quoted as 
calling Rodrigues' tale "a story of a 25-year-old successful business that was 
destroyed by abusive S&amp;L regulators at the instigation of their 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
What isn't mentioned is that Alioto represents Rodrigues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nice Car, Prince 
</P>
<P>
The guest of honor wore dark gray and arrived unfashionably early with a 
menacing growl, but sat passively enough while a few dozen guests ogled. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a recent bon voyage party for the very first Vector, a 
high-priced, high-performance super car that is finally being shipped to its 
first buyer after more than a decade on the drawing board. The price of the 
car, which is built in Wilmington by Vector Aeromotive, starts at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer of Vector 1 is a Saudi Arabian prince whom Vector Aeromotive Chief 
Executive Jerry Wiegert declined to identify. Given current Middle East 
tensions -- not to mention that glaring Saudi sun -- the prince is taking 
delivery of the exotic car in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
A glance inside the Vector's trunk revealed a going-away gift that every prince 
needs: a complementary kit of Snap-on Tools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not the Best Place to Keep It 
</P>
<P>
Some Robinson's credit card holders may have received an offer this month for a 
Hot-Line 24 Card. For a $12 annual fee, the Hot-Line Credit Card Bureau will 
cancel all the credit cards you've registered with them, should those cards get 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a nifty plastic card with a 24-hour 800 number to call if your 
cards are stolen. Robinson's encourages clients to "carry the enclosed Hot-Line 
24 Card in your wallet or billfold . . . along with your credit cards." 
</P>
<P>
Probably would be a good idea to memorize that 800 number first. 
</P>

Ah, memories. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Cash once more singing "Folsom Prison Blues" -- a tale of lonely resolve 
that established the Man in Black in the '50s as an exciting new force in 
country music. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings joining together again on "Mammas Don't Let 
Your Babys Grow Up to Be Cowboys," a '70s hit that helped define the 
romanticism and independence of country music's landmark outlaw movement. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Kristofferson reprising "Me and Bobby McGee," one of the key songs by the 
former Rhodes Scholar that marked a breakthrough in country music in the '70s 
by blending traditional country sentiment with a harsher, more contemporary 
literary eye. 
</P>
<P>
With moments like that, how could Saturday's Highwaymen concert at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre be anything other than a warm, winning affair? 
</P>
<P>
But the concert offered more than nostalgia. Much more. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, this tour is the first time Cash, Jennings, Kristofferson and 
Nelson have ever toured together -- and it appears to be as much a treat for 
them as it is for the fans. 
</P>
<P>
These are singer-songwriters whose lives have crossed frequently -- 
professionally and personally. They have traveled many of the same roads, 
battled many of the same demons and dreamed many of the same dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as survivors, they are joining together in a celebration that -- even 
after more than two dozen shows -- seemed Saturday as enthusiastic as if they 
were walking on stage for the first time together. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than do separate sets and then all come out for a finale, the four 
performers were on stage together with a nine-piece band for the entire two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, they had enough respect for the material to avoid trying to find a 
place vocally for everybody in every song. On some numbers, three of them 
simply played rhythm guitar while a fourth sang. At other times, two or more 
would switch lead vocals in a single song or, when appropriate, all four would 
sing the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely dipping into the material from the two "Highwaymen" albums that gave the 
tour its name, the quartet acknowledged the historic nature of these shows and 
turned to material from throughout their respective careers. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 35 songs ranged from early Nelson ("Night Life") to late Nelson 
("Always on My Mind"), from rockabilly Cash ("Big River") to patriotic Cash 
("Ragged Old Flag"), from poet Kristofferson ("Sunday Morning Coming Down") to 
preacher Kristofferson ("Why Me Lord"), from rowdy Jennings ("Are You Sure Hank 
Done It This Way") to whimsical Jennings ("Wrong"). 
</P>
<P>
The latter Jennings number -- an appealing novelty about all the times another 
perfect love proved wrong! -- was the only song from the show that's currently 
on the country charts, but the other songs held up so well that all could carry 
1990 copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
More than merely spotlighting the imagination and heart of the music of these 
four superb talents, the concert offered some lessons for the general pop 
community. 
</P>
<P>
For all its richness over the last 60 or so years, country music continues to 
be viewed by many outsiders as something of a secondary pop style. But the best 
country music is blessed with as much insight and grace as the best rock or 
jazz or soul. 
</P>
<P>
And the outlaw movement -- which embraces Merle Haggard as well as the four 
tour principals -- is arguably the most significant strain of country since the 
post-World War II honky-tonk uprising that delivered such artists as Hank 
Williams and Lefty Frizzell. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, however, the ones who may learn the most from this tour are the 
country music insiders -- the disc jockeys and record company executives who 
seem to be under the delusion that the recycled music and array of new talent 
(the post-Nelson/Cash generation) in Nashville is better than ever today. 
Measured against the obvious artistry of the Highwaymen tour (which returns to 
the Universal Amphitheatre on Oct. 1), that thinking sounds like just another 
chorus in that latest Jennings hit. Wrong!

CONCERTGEBOUW RETURNS UNDER RICCARDO CHAILLY; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERT: AMSTERDAM ORCHESTRA MAKES ITS FIRST LOCAL APPEARANCE IN FIVE YEARS 
UNDER THE BATON OF ITS NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Friday was a festive night in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the opening of the fall season at Segerstrom Hall and, 
simultaneously, the beginning of its 37th year of concert sponsorship, the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society presented the Concertgebouw Orchestra of 
Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
The mighty ensemble hadn't appeared locally since 1985, and a few things had 
changed in the interim. The adjective Royal had been appended to the 
Concertgebouw label in recognition of the orchestral centenary in 1988. More 
important, Riccardo Chailly had succeeded Bernard Haitink as music director. 
</P>
<P>
For some strange reason, official publicity materials pretend that Chailly -- 
an Italian despite his French name -- is "the first chief conductor of 
non-Dutch origin" to hold the Amsterdam post. This myopic claim overlooks the 
distinguished tenure of Eugen Jochum, an emphatically German maestro now 
relegated to lowly guest status in the revisionist accounts provided by the 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, nationalistic matters are unimportant. Only the playing counts. 
Much of the playing for Chailly, on this occasion, proved disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its pre-Royal days, the Concertgebouw was seldom regarded as a 
high-precision instrument. One savored its rich timbre, its mellow expressive 
scale and pervasive warmth. In doing so, one gladly overlooked certain lapses 
in polish. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chailly, the lapses linger. Unfortunately, they seem more problematic now 
because the erstwhile richness, mellowness and warmth seem to have decreased. 
</P>
<P>
It is dangerous to judge an orchestra on a single occasion under trying 
conditions. For all we know, the Royal Dutch visitors may have been suffering 
communal jet lag. Chailly may have been disoriented by the quirky acoustics of 
the Orange County Hall, which he had encountered for the first time only an 
hour before the concert began. Still, other itinerants have coped more 
effectively with similar challenges. 
</P>
<P>
In Schumann's Fourth Symphony, which opened the program loudly, the 
Concertgebouw strings sounded tough, the brass rough and the winds wan. Chailly 
concentrated on speed and passion, whipping up undeniable excitement but 
slighting lyrical suavity in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Matters improved, to a degree, after intermission when he confronted the 
poignant expanses of Mahler's "Lied von der Erde." He did convey the essential 
aura of endless yearning. He did savor the piquant accents that offset the 
aching pathos. He did demonstrate a basic grasp of the over-ripe romantic 
idiom. The orchestra -- long associated with that specific idiom -- responded 
with reasonable security. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chailly painted in primary colors, even when Mahler asked for pastels. 
One missed muted delicacy and the linear tension. One missed the textural 
transparency and spacious majesty that separate a competent performance from a 
compelling one. 
</P>
<P>
Jard van Nes, the intelligent mezzo-soprano soloist, sang the Bethge texts with 
firm tone and affecting simplicity. Although she mustered little rapture in the 
high climaxes and little resonance in the crucial descending phrases, she 
impressed with communicative honesty throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor in "Das Lied von der Erde" has a virtually impossible task. He should 
summon the steely force of a Wagnerian superman one moment and the nimble 
refinement of a Mozartean poet the next. 
</P>
<P>
Gosta Winbergh is more a Tamino than a Siegfried. No matter. He is remarkably 
resourceful and amazingly sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish tenor refused to strain for impact, even when the orchestra 
threatened to blanket his slender but solid, invariably elegant tone. He never 
flinched from the high tessitura. He offered object lessons in dynamic 
flexibility, verbal point and sensual appeal. Not since Julius Patzak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic subscribers applauded enthusiastically, but only 
in the right places. Mahler's eternal benediction ("Ewig . . . ewig . . . ") 
was allowed to evaporate in magical silence. A rapt pause -- the ultimate 
tribute -- preceded the inevitable cheers. 
</P>
<P>
There may be hope.

tour its name, the quartet acknowledged the historic nature of these shows and 
turned to material from throughout their respective careers. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 35 songs ranged from early Nelson ("Night Life") to late Nelson 
("Always on My Mind"), from rockabilly Cash ("Big River") to patriotic Cash 
("Ragged Old Flag"), from poet Kristofferson ("Sunday Morning Coming Down") to 
preacher Kristofferson ("Why Me Lord"), from rowdy Jennings ("Are You Sure Hank 
Done It This Way") to whimsical Jennings ("Wrong"). 
</P>
<P>
The latter Jennings number -- an appealing novelty about all the times another 
perfect love proved wrong! -- was the only song from the show that's currently 
on the country charts, but the other songs held up so well that all could carry 
1990 copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
More than merely spotlighting the imagination and heart of the music of these 
four superb talents, the concert offered some lessons for the general pop 
community. 
</P>
<P>
For all its richness over the last 60 or so years, country music continues to 
be viewed by many outsiders as something of a secondary pop style. But the best 
country music is blessed with as much insight and grace as the best rock or 
jazz or soul. 
</P>
<P>
And the outlaw movement -- which embraces Merle Haggard as well as the four 
tour principals -- is arguably the most significant strain of country since the 
post-World War II honky-tonk uprising that delivered such artists as Hank 
Williams and Lefty Frizzell. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, however, the ones who may learn the most from this tour are the 
country music insiders -- the disc jockeys and record company executives who 
seem to be under the delusion that the recycled music and array of new talent 
(the post-Nelson/Cash generation) in Nashville is better than ever today. 
Measured against the obvious artistry of the Highwaymen tour (which returns to 
the Universal Amphitheatre on Oct. 1), that thinking sounds like just another 
chorus in that latest Jennings hit. Wrong!

Get eight women in the same room, most of them talking about men, and it could 
get ugly, right? Wrong. It got funny. And funnier. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at the Theatre in Old Town, an all-female comedy revue, "Ladies 
of the Evening," starring a wild-maned and frenetic Debbie Tate along with 
Karen Rontowski and Mary Jo Crowley entertained a sold-out and appreciative 
crowd for about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Tate showed why the producers saved the best for last. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was sacred. She skewered men, women, men, children, men, dating and 
men. 
</P>
<P>
But she did it so painlessly that half the crowd didn't seem to notice they had 
been nicked. No males became upset: Obviously she was talking about the other 
guys. No man in this crowd was ever a jerk in a relationship. No man in this 
crowd ever failed to understand his wife or girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Tate was a little bluer (and a lot more suggestive) than the comics before her, 
but her material comes across in good taste. There is substance to her jokes 
that legitimizes the, er, body language and salty vocabulary. And the crowd 
loved it. 
</P>
<P>
Tate -- who has been a guest on "Oprah" to talk about women in comedy -- relies 
on a high energy level, mannerisms and vocal imitations that help her slip in 
and out of characters to pull off the gags. Her pace and patter also keep the 
act moving as she shifts from story to story. Her half-hour on stage was a 
quick one. You have to see her to believe her. 
</P>
<P>
Also making an impression was Rontowski, a runner-up in 1990's Funniest Person 
in San Diego contest, whose humorous outlook on life is similar to Jay Leno's 
askew view. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing door-to-door evangelists to a thief, she prefers the thief. "At least 
a thief leaves." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a Yugo until I totaled it when I hit a poodle. The poodle is fine." 
</P>
<P>
Rontowski, who appears regularly at the Comedy Store in La Jolla, keeps her act 
</P>
<P>
G-rated and well-paced, constantly stalking the stage as she questions why leaf 
blowers need to wear a beeper. Are they expecting a leaf emergency somewhere, 
she wonders? 
</P>
<P>
Or why some ministers don't communicate with the choir. It seems she was at a 
service in which the minister told the flock to throw drugs into the river. And 
throw booze into the river. And throw pornography into the river. "And then the 
choir sings 'Shall We Gather by the River.' " 
</P>
<P>
Crowley, whose parents have been together so long they're on their fourth 
bottle of Tabasco sauce, has been doing stand-up comedy for eight years. Her 
act reflects it. She is smooth and her timing excellent. She told of an 
archeological dig going on in San Diego. "They found a $20,000 house." Or two 
young relatives, Search and Destroy. "Ever seen chain saws with feet?" 
</P>
<P>
The early acts got their share of laughs, too. 
</P>
<P>
Jere Evans knew it was time to lose weight when her nieces and nephews referred 
to her as Aunt Arctica. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Milner knew her husband was a sexual dyslexic when he tried to get her 
into the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
Milner and Crowley spearheaded the production -- another show was held Friday 
in Escondido -- and deserve a hand for providing a sober and smoke-free venue 
for women and fresh comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Milner wants to make this an annual event, drawing on the best local talent 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
There have been worse ideas. And who knows? By then, maybe Lorian Elbert will 
have found Mr. Right. Better yet, Dr. Right.

Mercouri Undaunted: Melina Mercouri remains undeterred in her quest to return 
the Olympics to Greece. 
</P>
<P>
The movie star-turned-politician, who's running for mayor of Athens, sounded a 
rallying cry for Greeks despondent over losing the 1996 games to Atlanta. "If I 
am mayor, I will seek Athens' candidacy to host the Olympics in the year 2000," 
she said over the weekend. "I have the feeling that the whole of Europe will 
support us." GREG BRAXTON

Groundlings Grounded?The long-running Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe 
may be forced to shut down if $30,000 cannot be raised by the end of the year 
to cover its financial difficulties. In the last 16 years, the Melrose Avenue 
group has served as a launching pad for such stars as Pee-wee Herman, Cassandra 
(Elvira) Peterson, Pat Morita and Jon Lovitz. 
</P>
<P>
But with expenses exceeding income, the group's executive director, Andrea 
Ladik, announced they are looking for a financial "miracle." Through 
advertisements and personal appeals, the Groundlings are asking for donations 
from the theater-going public. An honor roll is being installed in the theater 
lobby to salute donors, and a one-night gala event, "The Best of the 
Groundlings," will be held this fall. GREG BRAXTON

Designing Sendak: Original paintings by artist Maurice Sendak created for the 
L.A. Music Center Opera's new production of Mozart's "Idomeneo" will go on 
exhibit Tuesday at Every Picture Tells a Story . . . , the Los Angeles gallery 
devoted to original art from children's literature. Sendak, who has created and 
illustrated more than 30 books, including "Higglety Pigglety Pop," "In the 
Night Kitchen" and "Where the Wild Things Are," said he has had a lifelong 
ambition to design the Mozart opera, an epic tale of the Trojan War. 
</P>
<P>
The opera will also premiere Tuesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Sendak 
has created sets for other operas, including works based on "Where the Wild 
Things Are" and "Higglety Pigglety Pop," which also have been presented by the 
Music Center Opera. GREG BRAXTON

COUNTERPUNCH: CASTING -- EQUITY STYLE -- IN THE YEAR 1999

spans four decades.

The following is not yet reality, but a dark Orwellian dream of the future, 
though the syntax exactly matches a story in The Times detailing a suit against 
the City of Alhambra for "biased hiring." I marched with Dr. King. I saw his 
dream distorted to quotas. As Orwell put it in "Animal Farm," "All animals are 
equal, but some animals are more equal than others." I fear this is the future 
of the American theater. God help us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors' Equity filed charges today against Gordon Davidson and the Los Angeles 
Center Theatre Group for casting discrimination against minorities. The action 
was taken after Davidson declined Equity's recommendations to revamp his 
casting practices to expand casting of blacks, Latinos and Asians, particularly 
in leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
Equity's casting committee stated that, though Davidson had cast a black actor, 
Reuben Mantellan, as Othello (an Equity-designated black role) in his 
forthcoming production of the play, he had engaged an Arab actor as a standby 
for the part. "The title of the play is 'Othello, the Moor of Venice,' " 
Davidson said. "The role has often been played as an Arab. Reuben is my choice 
for the part, but I have to have someone ready in case he gets sick!" The 
casting committee also expressed regret that Davidson had included in the 
program a photograph of Laurence Olivier, a Caucasian actor who played the part 
half a century ago, in blackface. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson is not liable for criminal charges, since Equity's casting guidelines 
are not yet federal law, though Sandra Good, spokesperson for Actors' Equity's 
Casting Committee, affirmed that it was Equity's intent to include them in the 
omnibus bill now in the Congress expanding National Endowment for the Arts 
guidelines on artistic content. "Why limit legislation merely to subsidized 
art?" she said. "Minority actors deserve protected casting at every level of 
the commercial theater as well. This is top priority." 
</P>
<P>
Equity's casting committee has further mandated that one of its members sit in 
on every audition Davidson conducts in the future, and also in any private 
meetings discussing casting. "Mr. Davidson is the most important 
producer/director in Los Angeles," Good said. "He has to recognize that his 
casts must reflect the ethnic mix, not only in California, but in Equity. Quota 
casting is the new reality." Davidson was unavailable for comment.

NEWTON IN A DISNEY-DEEP ROMP

<P>
The saucer-shaped room goes black. There is a blaring fanfare, a flurry of 
motion in the darkness. Something big is coming, something Wayne Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a looming, black-garbed presence is illuminated in a stab of white. A 
shriek rises from 2,000 throats: Aaiiieeee! This man has no soul! 
</P>
<P>
 Just kidding. They were actually screams of love, as Newton brought Las Vegas 
to Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Saturday. The two-hour-plus show showcased a 
highly likable entertainer, with a still-youthful tenor voice that's 
serviceable, if not nearly on a par in character or ability with those of Vegas 
greats Sinatra, Elvis and Tom Jones. And even when Newton's act seemed to be a 
self-parody, there was no mistaking his genuine affection for his audience. 
</P>
<P>
But Newton must be a born celebrity, because it's hard to see what he ever did 
to become one. Unlike Elvis and other talents whose originality was deep-fried 
by the Vegas showrooms, Newton never was that unique an artist. That showed in 
his shtick-stuffed performance, which -- aside from his '60s potatoes "Danke 
Schoen" and "Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast" -- was a Disney-deep romp through 
the work of Presley, Sam Cooke and others. Included was a version of "Bridge 
Over Troubled Water" so smarmy, slick and disco-ized that it could have put 
Paul Simon into his grave and made him spin.JIM WASHBURN

COLOSSUS OF SONNY ROLLINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Saxophone Colossus" is what Sonny Rollins was often called in the 1950s. And 
the appellation made sense during an era in which his music overlooked the jazz 
world with the vast presence of the legendary statue of Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 60, Rollins is still arguably the finest jazz saxophonist in the 
universe -- despite the growing importance of such players as Branford Marsalis 
and Michael Brecker. But, as his one-night program at the Strand Saturday made 
clear, he is a considerably different musician, in several respects, from what 
he was 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
First, Rollins now paces himself. Backed by a five-piece ensemble (with Clifton 
Anderson on trombone, Jerome Harris on guitar, Mark Soskin on keyboards, Bob 
Cranshaw on bass and Al Foster on drums) that provided a safe and comforting 
setting, he played a series of extended solos, often interacting with the other 
players, especially Foster. 
</P>
<P>
When Rollins was hitting his high spots, the results were breathtaking -- 
sudden, brilliantly colored bursts of sound, body-moving rhythms and soaring 
melodies. 
</P>
<P>
But the high points only came in brief stretches. And, good as they were, they 
took time to emerge, rarely achieving the full-out, nonstop, high-voltage 
electricity of his earliest playing. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins also seems to have become far more concerned with reaching out to 
connect with his audience. Striding the stage restlessly, reaching down toward 
his listeners to make a particularly salient point with his horn, he was a 
virtual walking history of the saxophone. Hawkinsesque chromatics, Coltranesque 
runs and Ornette Coleman flurries were offset with bar-walking honks, New 
Orleans slap-tonguing and his own sun-drenched Caribbean rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins seems to have become a performer who has found a way to ease 
comfortably into his mature years while still retaining a strong connection 
with the white-fire creative energy of his youth. At his best, the Colossus 
that is Sonny Rollins still casts a potent shadow.

Is Rohrabacher aware that the works of Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson and 
James Joyce were not "something valued by others" at the time of their 
creation? Perhaps he would have urged these artists to stop "wasting their 
time."

EXPERIENCING L.A. FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must disagree with my friend Laura Zucker about the Los Angeles Festival. Far 
from showing us in the L.A. theater community how to reach multicultural 
audiences, the festival would teach us that only free events held in parks, 
where people already congregate, with massive free publicity from The Times, is 
how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
It would also teach us that local talent and institutions are not worthy of 
this same support, that a self-serving administrator must be imported to fill 
the media with inane sound bites on how L.A. "thinks of itself as a cow town," 
and that somehow only out-of-town and foreign arts groups can "show us who we 
really are." 
</P>
<P>
If multicultural theater, dance and art are important enough to spend millions 
of dollars for 17 days of stunt programming, think how much farther that money 
could go if spent on a permanent multicultural center showcasing these same 
groups throughout the year! 
</P>
<P>
Zucker was speaking as an individual and not as chairman of the Associated 
Theatres of Los Angeles when she wrote of her support for the festival. And 
hers is a distinctly minority opinion, based on the discussions I've had with 
local theater people -- most of whom deplore the festival in general and its 
administrator's attitude and utterances in particular. 
</P>
<P>
ATLAS' worthy goal of providing L.A. with mid-size professional theaters 
requires a long-term commitment to local arts institutions, not to triennial 
spending sprees. The real lesson of the festival is that if you give it away in 
a park, you can't sell it in a building -- a rather unfortunate "prophetic 
vision for the arts in L.A."

EXPERIENCING L.A. FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The L.A. Festival is an idea who time has come. And gone. As enjoyable as the 
last three festivals have been, the basic formula simply has too many 
shortcomings to serve a city as diverse as L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The festival attempts to cram a seemingly infinite number of events into a 
two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in attending more than one or two performances has to drop 
everything else. Events generally have runs of just a few days. By the time the 
reviews appear or the word of mouth gets around, the performers have packed 
their bags. The festival's grand scale creates a logistic nightmare that makes 
it impossible to bring the festival off more than once every few years -- not 
enough to build the sort of momentum needed to develop audiences. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not suggesting the festival be abolished. I'm questioning whether there 
isn't some way to transform it into something that presents outstanding 
international dance and theater for longer runs on an ongoing basis. Imagine a 
theater complex in which, on any given night you might choose among three or 
four theater companies from around the globe. Creating this "Los Angeles 
Festival Theater" is not as far-fetched as it sounds -- at least not if the 
same public and private backers of past festivals were willing to refocus their 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles needs a theater district. A Festival Theater would would draw the 
crowds at first; other theaters, featuring local companies would help bring 
them back. Audiences would benefit, and so would local theater companies, who 
charge that the festivals until now have hurt rather than helped their 
business.

ABUNDANT RICHES BY FLANAGAN TRIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employing the majestic lyrical sense and not-one-note-wasted fluid style of 
improvisation that has been mesmerizing audiences for years, pianist Tommy 
Flanagan stole into town over the weekend. The premier living exponent of 
be-bop piano and his sidemen -- bassist George Mraz and drummer Larance Marable 
-- made a much-too-brief three-night stand at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Riches were in abundance during Friday's opening set. Flanagan, a Balzac at the 
piano who can make anything sing, started with silence -- or the closest thing 
one could find to it in a packed nightclub -- and wove marvelous tales. Using 
line after enchanting line for his dramas, he took the audience on a journey to 
another world, prestidigitally describing a land of beauty, grace, strength and 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
The wonderful writer and arranger Tadd Dameron was represented by "Our 
Delight," Charlie Parker was heard in his lovely "Quasimodo" (also heard was 
Gershwin's "Embraceable You," on which Bird's opus was based), and Thelonious 
Monk was present in a medley of four of his memorable melodies, "Ruby, My Dear" 
and " 'Round Midnight," among them. 
</P>
<P>
Dizzy Gillespie's "Tin Tin Deo" was Flanagan with the heat turned way up. A 
series of exchanges between the leader and his bandmates led to a melody 
reading replete with energized, chordal movement, ideas that twisted and curved 
and stopped on a dime. The performance wouldn't have been what it was without 
the extraordinary Mraz, Flanagan's partner for nearly a decade and a musician 
with a gorgeous, full sound and the keenest of ears. One example of their 
teamwork was on J. J. Johnson's "Lament," where a Flanagan ascending left-hand 
line was suddenly picked by the bassist, who extended it another six tones as 
the pianist enriched the proceedings with dulcet chords. 
</P>
<P>
Marable proved to be a worthy replacement for the trio's regular drummer, Louis 
Nash, crackling throughout while not falling victim to the Drummers' Curse: 
playing too loudly.ZAN STEWART

'CASEY'S GIFT': A TIME OF GRIEF, TORMENT, HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC adds to our general malaise tonight at 9 with "Casey's Gift: For Love of a 
Child." The title suggests warm and mushy 
</P>
<P>
but the movie only works if grief, torment, suspicion, hate, vengefulness and 
general all-around misery make you warm and mushy. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of us, it's a tough go. 
</P>
<P>
It's the story of darling little 5-year-old Casey Stillwell, whom everybody 
adores -- and then he drowns in the neighbor's pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Stillwells (played by Michael Tucker and Belinda Montgomery) and the Bolens 
(Kevin Dobson and Karen Austin) and their kids had been neighbors and total 
best friends. But now Stillwell can't find any crumb of comfort after Casey's 
death, even in his religion. And he demands solace of some sort, any sort, and 
finally sets about with righteous fervor to sue the Bolens and destroy them. In 
turn, the Bolens would have to countersue. 
</P>
<P>
No amount of pleading will dissuade Stillwell, until. . . . 
</P>
<P>
While not an occasion for joy, the movie covers some fresh emotional territory 
-- neighbor against neighbor, the destruction of friendships -- and delivers 
some its rewards with poignant moments. IRV LETOFSKY

REDGRAVE RISES IN 'ORPHEUS DESCENDING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vanessa Redgrave, unemployable on Broadway after her anti-Zionist remarks on 
Oscar night 12 years ago, finally returned to Broadway last year in a revival 
of Tennessee Williams' 1957 drama, "Orpheus Descending." 
</P>
<P>
Thank God those Redgrave-baiters-and-haters dissipated their clout. The actress 
and this neglected play were meant for each other. You can see the dynamics of 
the union in Peter Hall's semi-operatic television adaptation of his Broadway 
and London production today on cable's TNT (at 5 p.m., 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
This drama, quintessential early Williams, is set in a small, bigoted Southern 
town and swirls around the relationship between a lyrical and sensual drifter 
(the Southern-fried Orpheus of the title) and the town's eccentric women of 
damnation, chiefly Redgrave's tormented, Italian immigrant storekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Like its purple plot, the play's history is full of bruises. It bombed as 
Williams' first full-length production, under the title "Battle of Angels" in 
1940, was maligned in its Broadway reincarnation in 1957 and failed as a Marlon 
Brando-Anna Magnani-Sidney Lumet movie ("The Fugitive Kind," 1960). 
</P>
<P>
But Hall's production takes the melodrama and Williams' obsessive violence and 
sex -- the primary sources of critical carping -- and creates a churning, 
theatrical, even at times comical hell on Earth. Except for substituting a blow 
torch for ravenous killer hounds at the fadeout, the TV production is true to 
the play, particularly its blend of recrimination, lust and religion. 
</P>
<P>
The style is not naturalistic. The visual tone, with some montages, is 
alternately garish and pastoral/dreamlike. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' lost, victimized angels (the indelible Redgrave as a blond "wop" 
among racist apes, and Kevin Anderson as the guitar-playing vagabond who moves 
in with her) are scorchingly vulnerable. Redgrave, back to the camera, is naked 
in one scene, which is an artful example of nurturing nudity. 
</P>
<P>
Hall hasn't reined in this drama's excesses but has given them flight. The 
vivid supporting characters are alternately gross (Sloane Shelton's florid 
magpie), ravished (Anne Twomey's haunting, nympho-dipso temptress), or 
heartbreaking (Miriam Margolyes' sweet visionary painter). 
</P>
<P>
The narrative opening of two gossipy women superimposed against a wild car ride 
in a downpour is stylistically crucial and hurtles you into the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the musician drifter (who suggests a post-"Glass Menagerie" Tom 
Wingfield) turns to the searching Redgrave heroine with the sardonic words: 
"The make believe answer . . . love." You remember that irony at the KKK-hooded 
ending, which will shock plenty of viewers. Even for those who know the play, 
it's wrenching. RAY LOYND

2 KILLED, 3 WOUNDED IN FIGHTING AT 3 PARTIES; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: POLICE IN THREE CITIES SAID THE VIOLENCE OCCURRED AFTER SATURDAY NIGHT 
GATHERINGS WERE CRASHED BY RIVAL GROUPS.

Three Saturday night parties in Los Alamitos, Santa Ana and Buena Park erupted 
into bloody street fights among gang members, leaving two teen-agers dead and 
three seriously wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings and stabbings were unrelated, but all three melees involved large 
parties that apparently were crashed by rival gang members. Police said it is 
unusual for gangs to have such street brawls, noting that they typically attack 
rivals in drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang members are like everyone else, and Saturday night is party night," said 
Buena Park Police Lt. Patrick Black. "If rival gang members want to provoke 
something, they usually know where to find them. But most of the time it leads 
to drive-by shootings. I can't recall another one here like this in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Alamitos, police were called at 11:10 p.m. to 3952 San Mateo Ave., a 
residential street in the city's northern tip, sandwiched between Cypress and 
Long Beach. Apparently a fight had erupted in the street among the guests and 
an uninvited group of people from a rival gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy, apparently the host of the party, was stabbed to death. One 
of his guests, a 19-year-old male, was in serious condition with stab wounds at 
Long Beach Memorial Hospital, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After a helicopter search, police arrested a 17-year-old youth and a 
19-year-old man, both from Los Alamitos, and were holding them for questioning. 
As many as three other suspects remained at large Sunday, police said. Police 
declined to identify any of the suspects or victims. 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence is rare in Los Alamitos, and police there declined to discuss 
gang problems in the city. But Cypress police, who patrol streets within a 
block of the double stabbing, said they have seen increased gang activity in 
their city. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a noticeable increase over the last year or two. More and more of 
our patrol people are coming in contact with various gangs," Cypress Sgt. Sandy 
Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still pretty untouched, compared to L.A. County," she said. "It's pretty 
unusual to have something this major occur. Mostly we just see more graffiti. 
It's nothing real big right now, but three or four years down the road may be 
something else entirely." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, pools of blood still caked the sidewalk and driveway in front of the 
San Mateo Avenue house, a gray wood and brick home with a child's inflatable 
swimming pool on the front porch roof. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors identified the dead boy as Eddie Naverette, who had recently moved 
there with his mother and a younger brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rangel, who had been Naverette's stepfather until he and the boy's mother 
divorced, said Sunday that he did not think the boy was in a gang. Rangel said 
the boy had dropped out of school, was working with his uncle's construction 
company and spent a lot of time with his girlfriend and 1-year-old daughter 
Alexis. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they have never seen gangs in their middle-class neighborhood of 
single family homes, which is about two blocks from Los Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's an isolated incident," said John Balestracci, 56, who lives across 
the street from the house where the party was held. "The mother just recently 
took over the house." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Jo Ann Balestracci, 31, said they watched part of the fight from a 
window in their home. 
</P>
<P>
"All you saw were people running in all directions. We heard lots of yelling 
and heard a girl screaming. And we heard some kid yelling, 'You're going to 
die, boy, you're going to die!' " 
</P>
<P>
About the same time as the Los Alamitos stabbings, Santa Ana police found a 
17-year-old shot dead and another 17-year-old with a gunshot wound to the head 
at 1100 S. Rosewood Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The two teens were not identified. The injured youth was in critical condition 
Sunday at an unidentified hospital, police said. They had no suspects Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said shootings grew out of a street fight involving two rival 
gangs that had converged at a party. 
</P>
<P>
One witness said he called police about 10 p.m. to break up the party, but 
officers did not immediately respond. 
</P>
<P>
"I called four times over there. They said they were too busy," said Frank 
Balderrama, who lives on Rosewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There was loud music and cars in the street so I called police. Then, about 
five minutes later, there were 30 to 50 youths out there, pushing and shoving," 
Balderrama said. "I called (police) again. Then I heard bottles being broken. 
Some guys went in their cars and got chains. I called again. Then I heard five 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disgrace, the way (police) handled this. If they had cooperated with 
the first call I made, (the victim) wouldn't be dead," Balderrama said. "This 
town needs more police officers on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sunday that they could not comment on Balderrama's complaints

STREET SMART: TRAFFIC SIGNALS NEVER PLEASE ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it's the surge of post-Labor Day traffic or the jump in prices at the 
gas pump, but there has been much mail lately from Orange County motorists 
irked by unsynchronized traffic signals and all the problems they cause -- 
wasted time at red lights, smog from idling cars, increased gas consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three such offerings: Tim Pickwell of Newport Beach writes about his 
disdain for Jamboree Road's fickle traffic lights, while Andres Sullivan pans 
the signals in Irvine. Finally, we cap today's column with words of wisdom from 
Ed Vanwetswinkle of Costa Mesa, who would like to see a potential solution 
imported straight from Deutschland. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Jamboree Road between East Coast Highway and the San Diego Freeway is a major 
artery, yet it seems none of the traffic lights along this stretch are timed or 
coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon to hit a dozen red lights while traveling this relatively 
short distance. The posted speed limit is 50 m.p.h., but just getting into 
third gear is a major victory. 
</P>
<P>
Most annoying, however, is to move along with the rush-hour traffic and be 
forced to stop when a lone car approaches an insignificant intersection (such 
as Birch Street, Bison Avenue or one of the several lights at parking lots). It 
is neither efficient nor environmentally sound to have 50 cars in either 
direction (yes, I've counted) come to a stop, idle, sit and wait, burn gas, 
pollute the air and then gear up again just so they can travel the next 100 
yards to once again be stopped by a single car coming up to cross an 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for timing the lights on major surface streets like 
Jamboree? Why don't they require a longer waiting period for cars crossing 
Jamboree? Why do several office-building parking lots justify having traffic 
lights? Are there any plans to time the lights on Jamboree? What can I and 
other commuters do to help convince someone that this is necessary? 
</P>
<P>
Tim Pickwell 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
The city of Irvine seems to have adjusted its traffic lights in such a manner 
that you get one red light after another when cruising down any given street. 
</P>
<P>
It is my understanding that for years most traffic-light systems were set so 
that a vehicle traveling at the posted speed limit would hit green lights. This 
has the obvious advantages of allowing traffic to flow and reducing fuel 
consumption and exhaust emissions while allowing all those driving to make more 
productive use of their time. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine being such a "planned" community, it is surprising to find such 
anachronistic traffic controls. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Sullivan 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Let's start with the general and get to the specific. 
</P>
<P>
Most traffic signals in Orange County are computerized, gleaning information 
from wire "loops" embedded in the pavement that can detect cars passing by. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, such signals can never please all of the people all of the time. 
Traffic engineers try for a happy medium between forcing motorists on cross 
streets to sit forever and interrupting the flow on a heavily traveled arterial 
road. It's never perfect -- even in ultra-planned Irvine -- and can be further 
complicated if the equipment breaks down or the programming doesn't quite allow 
cars on a major street to get through several lights in sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Jamboree Road is a perfect example. At some times of the day, a motorist can, 
believe it or not, travel from the coast to the San Diego Freeway nearly 
unimpeded by red lights. But such instances are the exception rather than the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to improve the situation, the city of Newport Beach has hired a 
consultant to come up with ways to improve Jamboree's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try for a balance that gives the preference to the heavy traffic 
along Jamboree but doesn't become unreasonable for people waiting at the cross 
streets," said Richard Edmonston, Newport Beach traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the majority of gripes about Jamboree Road come from 
irritated motorists who have sat for what seemed an eternity at cross streets. 
</P>
<P>
During the morning and evening rush hours, the Jamboree traffic signals are 
operated by a computer at Newport Beach City Hall, Edmonston said. While this 
computer generally does a reasonably good job of keeping traffic flowing 
through green lights, the rolling topography of the roadway can cause a queue 
of cars to stretch out, he said. Some stragglers, as a result, may miss a 
signal or two. 
</P>
<P>
At other times of the day and night, the signals operate independently. If 
there's no one at a cross street, a motorist on Jamboree Road will typically 
get a green light. But even a lone car can, as Tim Pickwell points out, make a 
line of motorists come grinding to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
Some office buildings along Jamboree Road in Irvine warrant signals chiefly 
because of the number of cars they host. The heavy traffic from such buildings 
could pose a hazard if it wasn't regulated by a signal, transportation experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
While these transportation experts tinker with the existing system, some Orange 
County residents see a need for a more foreign approach. Consider the following 
letter: 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
In some European countries, specifically West Germany, a traffic system called 
Gruenewelle, or "Green Wave," has been used in an effort to reduce traffic 
congestion. The purpose of the Green Wave system is to keep traffic flowing at 
predetermined speeds on major streets despite the presence of numerous traffic 
signals, major intersections and a heavy volume of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a street like Brookhurst Avenue would display a sign indicating a 
"Green Wave at 45 m.p.h." All vehicles traveling at 45 m.p.h. on the street 
would be able to move through the signal lights without ever stopping for a red 
light. Vehicles exceeding or traveling slower than the Green Wave speed would 
be caught at red lights. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits would be cutting down on pollution, gas consumption, freeway 
traffic, time and aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets could be targeted as Green Wave streets. People would tend to use 
these streets more often, thereby reducing freeway stop-and-go traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The cost would be far less than that of adding new lanes to existing freeways 
or building new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Vanwetswinkle 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
The Green Wave may sound a bit like the title of a 1950s monster movie, but it 
seems a worthy idea. 
</P>
<P>
A similar approach was used in some U.S. cities in decades past. I can remember 
driving with my parents years ago through San Francisco's Sunset District and 
seeing signs advising a motorist that the signals were timed to 35 m.p.h. The 
system seemed to work pretty efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities, however, dropped that practice because of legal problems. 
Motorists trying to time the signals would sometimes squirt into an 
intersection before the red light had turned to green. If such scenarios were 
repeated, the Green Wave could truly turn into a horror flick.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;

<P>
PARKING STANDARDS SET FOR DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers who want to build housing in Santa Ana must now provide more parking 
space for residents and their visitors under requirements adopted by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely disheartening to see the kind of compaction that has occurred 
as a result of parking standards that weren't tough enough," Councilman Daniel 
E. Griset said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers now must provide four parking spaces and a guest space for every 
three-bedroom dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council was presented with a set of new parking standards for both 
the city's residential and commercial properties, the council only acted on the 
residential plan. 
</P>
<P>
They delayed action on the commercial portion at the request of Councilman 
Miguel A. Pulido Jr., who said he needed time to speak with oil company 
representatives who are concerned about what the new rules will mean to gas 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial aspect of the proposed parking standards has been controversial 
from the start. In August, Councilman John Acosta charged that the new 
requirements unfairly targeted Mr. J's, a restaurant at 2101 E. Edinger Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The business, which has been cited by the city for operating illegally as a 
nightclub, would be the only existing business affected by the change. GREG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 
</P>
<P>
COASTAL STRIP MAY BE FOCUS OF LEGAL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 26 acres of pristine coastal parkland across Coast Highway from the 
Ritz-Carlton hotel may be the site of the next round of legal battles between 
the feuding cities of Dana Point and Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District, which manages parkland for the 
city of Dana Point, announced last week that its board had voted to sue the 
Laguna Niguel Community Services District to gain control of the property, 
called Sea Terrace Park. 
</P>
<P>
The pending legal action is the latest round in the dispute between the two new 
cities over a 1.5-mile coastal strip of about 850 acres. That property, which 
includes the parkland, originally was under the sphere of influence of Laguna 
Niguel but was transferred to Dana Point in 1988 by the Local Agency Formation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel challenged LAFCO's reorganization of the city boundaries in court 
and lost. The Superior Court ruling upholding LAFCO is now before the 4th 
District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
While LAFCO has determined that the parkland belongs in Dana Point, the legal 
title to the property remains in the hands of the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District. The failure to relinquish that title is what prompted the 
planned lawsuit, said William Wilcoxen, attorney for the Capistrano Bay Park 
and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that, as lawsuits go, this is a pretty clear issue," Wilcoxen said. 
"LAFCO issued an order and they didn't follow it." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel City Atty. Terry Dixon said the city is awaiting outcome of the 
appeal before making any further moves. "I don't really understand why anyone 
is filing a lawsuit now," Dixon said. "Our attitude is that they know there is 
litigation pending regarding the reorganization. Given the outcome of that 
litigation, we'll be glad to cooperate with them." 
</P>
<P>
Sea Terrace Park was dedicated for public park use by the county in 1981 as 
part of the approval process for development surrounding the park. The 
agreement included a stipulation that the park be developed at no cost to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, however, the county did not take title to the land. The Laguna 
Niguel Community Services District did take title in July, 1988, a month after 
Dana Point residents voted to incorporate, but before the city formally came 
into existence in January, 1989. LEN HALL

WILDERNESS PARK SOON TO BE RESTORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind rows of condominiums and away from the noises of city traffic sit 45 
acres of bluffs, hills and rough terrain waiting to be transformed. 
</P>
<P>
Once a sand and gravel pit, the land soon will be restored to what it was 
nearly 70 years ago. Canyon Park, expected to open to the public next summer, 
will feature native California drought-tolerant plants and trees rather than 
the usual park landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see this area has been abused," said city Parks Supt. David Alkema, 
pointing to the edge of the park rimmed by houses and condos. "It continues to 
be abused. Some of our neighbors still use it as a dump." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa bought the property 13 years ago from a private owner to develop it 
into a wilderness park. But obstacles, such as obtaining permits from the 
California Coastal Commission, the federal Department of Fish and Wildlife, the 
state Department of Fish and Game and the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as 
other priorities, delayed the project, Alkema said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the original plans called for three artificial lakes and circulating 
stream beds, the regulatory agencies refused to allow their construction. Their 
concerns centered on the city's plans to remove willow groves that have become 
nesting sites for migratory birds, Alkema said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city planned to replace the groves after installing the lakes, it 
has revised its design and will preserve the willows. Much of the remaining 
areas, however, will be cleared out, including some mature pampas grasses, ice 
plants and other vegetation that has grown over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Also to be removed are a rusty skeleton of an old car and other debris, such as 
a platform built midway up a willow tree that once served as the floor to a 
child's tree house. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $1.5-million project calls for building a parking lot, a 
playground and a single road into the park with an entrance on Arbor Street. 
That, however, will be the extent of the park's polish. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to let the other plants grow a bit and then step back and let it 
be a wilderness area," Alkema said. "It's not going to take a lot of tax money 
to maintain, but, at the same time, it will allow recreation." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the park areas, however, will be too sensitive for human use. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be different trying to keep people out of certain areas. 
Normally, we want to get as many people out to the parks to use them, but now 
we're going to have to do almost the opposite," Alkema said. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be able to wander about the park on decomposed granite pathways 
that will lead them through different plant communities. Interpretive signs 
will describe plants, animals and different birds along the way. MARY ANNE

BUILDING RENOVATION DELAYS SOS OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Share Our Selves, the charity forced out of a westside neighborhood in June, 
faces another setback that will delay its reopening until Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
SOS has continually pushed back the projected opening date of its new quarters 
at 1550 Superior Ave. because of renovation work. The charity bought the 
12,000-square-foot building, as well as a restaurant on the property, for $1.4 
million after the City Council refused to renew its lease at the Rea Community 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer structural engineers have had to redesign the layout to accommodate 
state occupancy codes -- its maximum will be 500. SOS Founder and Executive 
Director Jean Forbath said she does not expect more than 100 people to be in 
the building at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the state requires engineers to install fire-safety features. The 
redesign includes a floor-to-ceiling fire wall, which will separate the storage 
area from the public areas, Forbath said. Fire doors, which have "panic bars" 
for easy use, must be installed at all exits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't realize that if we did any renovations, we would have to bring 
everything up to code," Forbath said. "It's a really old building." 
</P>
<P>
Although the November date is tentative, Forbath said she is certain SOS will 
reopen before the start of the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
To appease its future neighbors, SOS designed the building to include a large 
waiting room, eliminating the need for clients to wait in the parking lot, 
Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby business owners, fearing an increase in vandalism and loitering as a 
direct result of SOS's presence in the neighborhood, have fortified their 
properties with fences, extra lighting and other security measures. 
</P>
<P>
They have also formed an association to record complaints about the charity. 
The city has issued a one-year, conditional-use permit allowing SOS to operate 
at the new site. 
</P>
<P>
People living near the Rea Center, 661 Hamilton St., complained that those 
seeking help from SOS, which distributed emergency food, clothing and financial 
help, disrupted their neighborhood. After a long battle, they persuaded the 
council to evict the charity after 20 years in the city-managed community 
center. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
RAILROAD STATION TO BE RENOVATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union Station, with its white Spanish arches and red-tile roof, seems almost 
forgotten at the edge of defunct railroad tracks in an abandoned neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike so much of old, historic Anaheim, the 67-year-old railroad station 
will not be razed for development, but incorporated into a renovated downtown. 
</P>
<P>
In a plan approved by the City Council last week, the station will be saved and 
included in downtown redevelopment, which includes extensive commercial and 
residential building. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next month, Union Station will be moved from its current spot at 625 
E. Lincoln Ave. to 210 S. Atchison St., just across the street. The new 
location will be where Center Street ends, complementing the new homes to be 
built there. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be the jewel of Center Street," said Richard Bruckner, a Redevelopment 
Agency official familiar with the project. "It's something everyone has agreed 
would be a nice thing to save." 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1923, the station saw generations of passengers travel from Los 
Angeles to Anaheim and south to Santa Ana and San Diego. It wasn't the first 
station built in the city -- the Southern Pacific station was built when the 
city was founded in 1875 -- but became an important railway link for passengers 
and orange crops in growing Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper accounts over the years indicate that the station survived bitter 
struggles, which often threatened its existence after the railroad company 
stopped service to Anaheim in 1971. In February, 1972, the station was to be 
razed, only to be spared by the efforts of protesters, including then-City 
Councilman Don R. Roth. 
</P>
<P>
But plans to move it were thwarted in the early '70s after building inspectors 
deemed it unfit for transport. 
</P>
<P>
Relocating and renovating the building -- which was last used by CM School 
Supply Co. -- will cost just under $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner said the city community services department will conduct surveys to 
see if the old station might be converted into a child-care center to serve the 
nearly 400 new homes, apartments and townhouses in the redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
If there is insufficient demand for a child-care center, the station might be 
used for offices or another social service, he said.LISA MASCARO

A new survey of Anaheim residents reveals that they are most concerned about 
two issues: traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted last spring, included more than 1,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Similar surveys were conducted in 1988 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey indicate that residents were almost evenly divided when 
asked if they were satisfied with living in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of the respondents said they were more pleased with Anaheim 
since they moved here, and 42% said they were less pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood and environment were cited as the main reasons for the content or 
discontent of the respondents, and those who were displeased with their area 
also cited congestion, traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about crime took a significant jump in this year's survey. In 1988, 7% 
cited crime as their biggest worry. This year that figure rose to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic and related ills such as street repair and congestion remained the top 
concerns of respondents throughout the city. Thirty-six percent of the people 
surveyed said traffic was their main concern. The issue has been the top 
concern of residents since the survey was first conducted in 1986. LISA MASCARO

MIKE PENNER: RAMS GET SLIPPED A MICKEY

<P>
Cruelty to Mickey used to be a felony offense inside Anaheim city limits, but 
that was back in the old days, back when a guy like John Robinson might want to 
sip a few beers with a guy named Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Sutton had no buddies Sunday afternoon. Friendless, and often times 
defenseless, Mickey was the man the Philadelphia Eagles picked on, and picked 
on, and picked on, until there was nothing left to pick over. 
</P>
<P>
It was Randall Cunningham over the top to Mike Quick for a quick six, Mickey 
Sutton defending. 
</P>
<P>
It was Randall Cunningham lobbing deep into the end zone for Calvin Williams, 
Mickey Sutton defending. 
</P>
<P>
It was Randall Cunningham to Fred Barnett for 33 yards to sustain the game's 
final, and crushing drive, Mickey Sutton defending. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Mickey. At 5 feet 8 and 172 pounds, he was the smallest player on the 
field, giving away five inches and 23 pounds to Roger Ruzek, the Philadelphia 
kicker. Every time Mickey looked up, he was looking up to an Eagle wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey never asked to be here. He was happy in Buffalo, but the Bills cut him. 
He had nothing to do with Jerry Gray's knee injury and the Rams' open house at 
cornerback and the desperation that would drive a coach first to sign him and 
then to start him against the most unpredictable and imaginative quarterback in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey expected the worst. "I expect every pass to come my way," Mickey said. 
He's been around. He knows that given an option, NFL quarterbacks will never 
pick on anyone their own size. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham saw no need for a charitable contribution. The last time he played 
the Rams, in a 1989 wild-card playoff game, he lost, 21-7, and had to suffer 
seven months of Randall Can't Handle The Pressure headlines. Sunday, Cunningham 
was looking for any edge he could find and in Sutton, he found a little one. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham dedicated the Eagles' first touchdown in a 27-21 victory over the 
Rams to Mickey, a 15-yard pass to Quick. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the coach that was the play I wanted to do," Cunningham said. "It's 
called a '900' or something. It's just a streak. I'd watched all week in the 
films how Mickey Sutton was playing and with the height difference between him 
and Quick. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"So, I just threw the ball up there." 
</P>
<P>
Quick outleaped Mickey for the ball, just as Williams outleaped Mickey for 
Philadelphia's second touchdown. Buddy Ryan, the Eagles' nothing-in-moderation 
head coach, decided to pour it on. Mickey was a marked man and Ryan expressly 
instructed Cunningham to keep throwing out mousetraps. 
</P>
<P>
It was a 20-14 game when Cunningham one-hopped a pass to Williams near the Ram 
goal line. A big incompletion -- until Sutton was flagged for illegal contact. 
Cunningham got two more cracks at the end zone and with the second, running 
back Robert Drummond squirmed off right tackle for a two-yard score. Eagles, 
27-14, early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the fourth quarter, the Rams had pulled to within six points again and 
were hoping for a last chance at the football when Cunningham dropped back from 
his own 29-yard line on second and eight. 
</P>
<P>
There was Sutton, trying to cover Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
There was Barnett, straddling the sideline and Sutton, for a 33-yard reception 
that would keep Philadelphia in possession of the football for the remainder of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett was presented a game ball for making that catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was out of bounds," Mickey said. "I thought he was a step out of 
bounds." 
</P>
<P>
But on this day, words spoke just as loudly as actions. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to my side a lot," Mickey said. "They made some plays on me. But 
it's not like I was always three yards behind the guy or was beaten badly. I 
had the coverage. They just made the plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys get paid too." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur, Ram defensive coordinator, was quick to coordinate a defense for 
Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
"That happens," Shurmur said. "They always used a taller guy against Mickey. He 
had reasonably good coverage all three times (the passes to Quick, Williams and 
Barnett), but it simply became a physical thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Mickey didn't do anything wrong. They were just a little taller and he was 
just a little shorter." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't the only Ram to come up short, either. The Rams' incredible shrinking 
pass rush gave Cunningham enough time to think about burning Sutton again, mull 
over the philosophical implications, contemplate the unfairness of it all, 
consider the meaning of life . . . and then say, "What the hell, let's beat the 
little runt again." 
</P>
<P>
On that topic, Mickey was as gracious as he could be. 
</P>
<P>
"You definitely like to get a great pass rush going," he said, "but sometimes, 
it's not there. (The Eagles) were able to mix it up pretty well. We had a lot 
to think about. 
</P>
<P>
"When they get the run going along with the pass, Randall's a tough guy to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
It was a tale of mice and men, Sunday's game was. And as Mickey can tell you, 
it's no fun being the mouse.

EAGLES' TONEY GETS GROUNDED, AND THAT'S JUST FINE WITH HIM

Anthony Toney's four-yard run through the middle of the Rams' defense in the 
fourth quarter Sunday was of little historical importance to anyone, except 
Toney. 
</P>
<P>
The run gave Toney 100 yards, making him the first Eagle running back to reach 
the 100-yard mark in more than two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Toney finished with 103 yards in 24 carries in the Eagles' victory over the 
Rams at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The last time an Eagle running back surpassed 100 yards in a game was in 1987, 
when Keith Byars rushed for 102 against the Buffalo Bills in the last game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just too long to go without one," Toney said. "It's like Buddy (Ryan, 
Eagles' coach) always tells Keith and I, we won't get 100 yards a game because 
we don't carry 25 times a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually wind up running it 13 or 14 times (each) and catching a couple of 
passes. If that helps us win, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Eagles' wide receiver Mike Quick, who caught a 15-yard touchdown 
pass from Randall Cunningham in the second quarter, sat out most of the fourth 
quarter because of a sore quadriceps in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
"My leg was pretty sore from all the inactivity," said Quick, who missed most 
of last season after undergoing surgery on both knees. "I was out for 10 months 
doing nothing and that put a lot of stress on my quads. They're starting to 
come around now." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter absence of Quick, who caught three passes for 37 yards, gave 
some playing time to Fred Barnett, a rookie from Arkansas State. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett caught two passes for 39 yards, including a 33-yarder on second and 
eight with 5 minutes 40 seconds left that enabled the Eagles to run out the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
"As selfish as I might have been, I could have stayed in there," Quick said. 
"But I thought it was better to let Fred go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Money matters: Did Sunday's victory make up for losing to the Rams in the 
playoffs last year? 
</P>
<P>
Not as far as Ryan is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that playoff game was worth a lot of money to us," Ryan said. "They're 
just paying us regular-season salary for this." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle players are more than a little relieved they beat the Rams. And it 
goes beyond avoiding an 0-3 start. 
</P>
<P>
"Buddy Ryan must have showed us that playoff game film 100 times," said guard 
Mike Schad, a former Ram. "We even had to watch it on the plane ride out here 
yesterday. That film is burned in our minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we're a team that should beat the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Jerome Brown said he couldn't believe it when Saturday's 
in-flight entertainment turned out to be another showing of the Rams' 21-7 
victory last New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the boys said, 'God, no, not again,' " Brown said. "But you get to 
watching it again and maybe you learn something you can do better." 
</P>
<P>
When Cunningham connected with Mickey Shuler on a 12-yard pass play late in the 
third quarter, it marked the 89th consecutive game the veteran tight end had 
caught a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia picked up Shuler, who was waived by the New York Jets before the 
season opener, because tight end Keith Jackson was holding out. Jackson ended 
his holdout Wednesday and started in place of Shuler against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not it is in their best interests, the Rams now get to enjoy their 
first-ever bye week. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the NFL's new 16-games-in-17-weeks schedule, the entire NFC West 
will sit out the next weekend of play. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams, it should mean one light week of work to lick some wounds, forget 
about Sunday's defeat, and move on. The Rams play host to the Cincinnati 
Bengals in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to go into a bye with a loss, but we have no choice," quarterback Jim 
Everett said. "We're just going to have to regroup. I still believe in this 
team, I believe the things we do are correct." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will take their usual Tuesday off this week, then take Wednesday off, 
practice Thursday and Friday, take Saturday and Sunday off, then start up next 
Monday like a usual work week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to rest, get healthy and get ourselves in a good position 
to win the next week," tackle Jackie Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rams do get back to action, they almost surely will get back Pro Bowl 
cornerback Jerry Gray, who has been on injured reserve the last three weeks 
with a damaged knee. 
</P>
<P>
And Coach John Robinson, knowing Gray will be back, seems to be taking this 
off-week as a chance for his team to get ready to go to another level in the 
later stages of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a week off now and we just have to be a better team," Robinson said. 
"Whether we were 1-2 or 2-1, neither one of those numbers are disastrous as you 
look at the season in perspective. It's what happens to us from now on (that) 
will determine our season. One and two is not where we wanted to be, but there 
are (13 games) ahead, so we could end up 14-2."

JACKSON RETURNS IN TIME TO GIVE EAGLES NEEDED LIFT; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: TIGHT END, WHO ENDED HIS 50-DAY HOLDOUT WITHOUT SIGNING A NEW 
CONTRACT, BRINGS RELIEF TO PHILADELPHIA'S RECEIVING CORPS.

<P>
The exchange was brief -- more professional than cordial -- but it surprised 
Keith Jackson nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was walking off the field after the Philadelphia Eagles' 27-21 victory 
over the Rams Sunday at Anaheim Stadium when he was stopped by Eagles' owner 
Norman Braman. 
</P>
<P>
"Good game, Keith, good game," Braman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks," Jackson answered. 
</P>
<P>
Braman and Jackson hadn't exchanged too many words since Wednesday, when 
Jackson ended a 50-day holdout over his contract. With only two days of 
practice, Jackson started Sunday and caught four passes for 77 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson's return wasn't exactly smooth. 
</P>
<P>
He was upset the Eagles didn't renegotiate his four-year, $2.1-million 
contract, but he came back anyway. He said Braman was holding off negotiations 
with him so the Eagles, who lost their first two games, would keep losing. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said Braman was using the slow start as an excuse to fire Coach Buddy 
Ryan. Braman denied both charges. 
</P>
<P>
So did Braman and Jackson settle their differences Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying not to think about it," Jackson said. "We have to get the 
controversy out of the locker room if we want to win. All that's behind me 
now." 
</P>
<P>
While Jackson didn't get a warm welcome in the front office, Eagles' coaches 
and players were glad to have the third-year pro back. 
</P>
<P>
Especially Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith Jackson's presence opened up a lot of things," Ryan said. "You know he's 
the best tight end in football. We gave him the game ball for his leadership 
and enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
His presence brought relief to wide receiver Mike Quick, who had been 
double-teamed in Philadelphia's first two games -- losses to the New York 
Giants (27-20) and Phoenix Cardinals (23-21). 
</P>
<P>
Quick had three catches for 37 yards and a touchdown Sunday before leaving in 
the fourth quarter with a sore quadriceps in his left leg. He had only four 
catches for 81 yards and no touchdowns in his previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith is just another spoke in the wheel," Quick said. "With him back, we had 
a lot of soft spots (in the coverage) downfield. It was nice to have someone 
back who could work in the middle of the field." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's presence also gave Randall Cunningham, the Eagles' scrambling 
quarterback, an extra target. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Rams) really couldn't key on anybody," Cunningham said. "When they 
would key on the wideouts, we went to Keith. When they keyed on Keith, we went 
to the wideouts." 
</P>
<P>
Simple, but effective. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson caught passes of 20, 13, 16 and 28 yards. Three of his receptions came 
over the middle, when Cunningham was scrambling away from Ram defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Randall did a good job of picking up the man-to-man coverages," Jackson said. 
"He kept looking at me on the scramble." 
</P>
<P>
That's how Cunningham found Jackson over the middle for a 20-yard gain on the 
second play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing out there yelling, 'Hit me, hit me,' " Jackson said. "I wanted 
to get that first lick out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Randall and I have always had a knack for this. It's like with Doug Williams 
and Jimmy Giles, they have that knack too. Once (Cunningham) looks deep and 
doesn't find anyone, he knows he can look over the middle for me." 
</P>
<P>
But for the last two weeks, Jackson wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
Had he not ended his holdout, Jackson, a former All-American at Oklahoma, would 
have been in Norman, Okla., watching the Eagles on TV. 
</P>
<P>
When told he probably wouldn't get the Ram telecast in Oklahoma, Jackson said, 
"I would just watch it on my satellite (dish). Hey, we have money in Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
He'll be spending some of that money this week. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Gamble, Eagles' president, told Jackson he would have to pay fines 
totaling $114,500 for his holdout. He has to pay $68,000 for the two games he 
missed and $1,500 per day for the 31 days he missed of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
But for Jackson, it's money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad to be back," he said. "I think I did pretty good. (Former 
Oklahoma Coach Barry) Switzer always said I had some kind of magic about me. I 
was glad I brought some of the magic back today."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top teams: (Listed alphabetically) Capistrano Valley, Corona del Mar, Dana 
Hills, El Dorado, Estancia, Fountain Valley, Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Top individuals: Page Bartelt (junior, Capistrano Valley), Jamie Fouret 
(senior, Dana Hills), Jeannette Fylpaa (junior, University), Anne Mall (junior, 
Dana Hills), Jackie O'Leary (senior, Corona del Mar), Keri Phebus (junior, 
Corona del Mar), Kristen Pollock (senior, Corona del Mar), Renee Urricariet 
(senior, Fountain Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Important dates: Nov. 17, individual sectionals; Nov. 20, 29, 30, Southern 
Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Corona del Mar Coach Gary Salazar rates his Sea Kings as the team to 
beat in the Sea View League, and the returning talent he has supports his case. 
A third consecutive Southern Section 4-A team title seems an attainable goal. 
Phebus, O'Leary, Pollock and senior Courtney Strauss lead the team. Last 
season's Southern Section 3-A champion, Dana Hills, has moved up to the 4-A 
division and should be a good test for Corona del Mar during the playoffs, 
especially if Mall is healthy. Mall, arguably one of the top three singles 
players in the county, has been bothered by a rotator cuff strain in her right 
shoulder. Also contending in the 4-A class will be Capistrano Valley and its 
ace, Bartelt.

A DIFFERENT DRUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE AVERAGE STUDENT AT NEWLY OPENED CAL STATE SAN MARCOS IS 29 YEARS 
OLD. AS A RESULT, SOME OF THE FLEDGLING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND CLUBS 
ARE DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT. 
</P>

<P>
While universities around the country field football teams, Cal State San 
Marcos is trying to field a Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
While other campuses offer math clubs for super brains, Cal State San Marcos is 
thinking about forming a club for middle-aged students who fear math. 
</P>
<P>
While making it to editor of the college paper is a major honor at most 
schools, the newspaper serving Cal State San Marcos is co-edited by a student 
who doesn't attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
The university's large number of re-entry students, its commuter-campus 
atmosphere and the cramped, temporary facilities have made it difficult to 
develop extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the building process," said Ernest Zomalt, dean of student services 
at the young campus. If space and resources are required, the activity will be 
"deferred until we can meet those needs," Zomalt added. 
</P>
<P>
Integral activities such as student government, which provides student 
representation on university policy matters, are provided, but sports and a 
Greek system may have to wait until the permanent campus is established in 
1992, Zomalt said. 
</P>
<P>
The university opened its doors last month. Is is essentially a drive-through 
campus, which dampens participation in extracurricular activities. There are no 
freshmen or sophomores this year; local community colleges supply the bulk of 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be those who drive in, take a class and drive out," Zomalt said. 
"But that doesn't mean that we stop from trying to impact their lives as well." 
</P>
<P>
The age of the students -- a quarter are 35 years or older and the average age 
is 29 -- also means "they're not likely to be as interested in extracurricular 
activities," Zomalt said. 
</P>
<P>
But those demographics also give outside-the-classroom activities 
</P>
<P>
non-traditional forms. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first groups getting started, for example, is one for students who 
are parents, a reflection of the demographics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be an opportunity for people with children to get together 
and meet on issues such as child care, time management and stress reduction," 
said Patti Elenz-Martin, a counseling psychologist for both Cal State San 
Marcos and the North County branch of San Diego State University, which is in 
the same industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Elenz-Martin said the group, which does not have a name yet, also will address 
one of the most common concerns among students: math anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have been away from math for a while sometimes have stress involved 
with that," Elenz-Martin said. "Sometimes people have had some bad experiences 
from high school and they bring them to college, even if it's years later." 
</P>
<P>
There are other, more traditional organizations being formed. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Boisjolie, a junior English major at CSUSM, along with his roommate 
Jonathan Young, a Palomar College student, have put together a biweekly 
newspaper to serve the university. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't the (official) student newspaper of Cal State San Marcos. We serve 
the university community," Boisjolie said. Because a student government has not 
yet been created, there cannot be an officially sanctioned student newspaper, 
Boisjolie said, so they have to be careful about how they refer to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of the Pioneer, distributed during the second week of classes, 
was a 24-page tabloid with original typefaces designed by Young, and almost all 
of the stories and pictures were by Young and Boisjolie. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, we even sold the ads for it," said Young, who eventually hopes to 
transfer to CSUSM. The newspaper, which has attracted 10 new staff members for 
its second edition, has also managed to fill 23% of its pages with 
advertisements, enough to pay for material expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Boisjolie said the paper is not just a conduit of campus information, but is 
also intended to serve prospective students. About 5,000 copies of the 
newspaper are circulated to Palomar and Mira Costa colleges, the main feeder 
schools to the university, as well as the university and local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we have eight issues planned, and (getting it published) it's going 
to be hell," said Boisjolie, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Boisjolie spent all summer putting out the first issue, developing 
styles and pages, and now face the task of producing an issue every two weeks 
-- without sports pages, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Both Young and Boisjolie have attended journalism classes at Palomar College, 
and Boisjolie once served as editor of the college's student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first edition attracted new staff members, the only response in 
the form of a letter to the editor called the new venture an "embarrassing" 
paper devoted to "promoting right-wing propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
"You always need to expect the few people who are not going to like what you 
do," said Young, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no student government and probably won't be one until next 
semester, the two must fund the venture themselves. Armed with a business 
license in Young's name, the two have sold enough ads to break even. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to start a business. It just kind of happened," Young said. "It 
would sure be a lot easier to have college funding to support us. We don't want 
to sit here and bust our buns over advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
Young and Boisjolie would be more than willing to hand over their project to 
the school, if only someone there would take it. 
</P>
<P>
A student government is on the way, however. Ken Green, a junior studying 
business, is one of a handful of students working to establish a student 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest opportunity anyone can ever have," Green said. "We have 
all avenues open to us. There are no limitations. We are setting the traditions 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the thrill of it. We're looking at different constitutions and different 
methods, and we want to develop one that's going to be a model for other 
schools later on," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I see the student government doing is representing the 
students on the various university committees," said the former Palomar College 
student body president. 
</P>
<P>
Several other organizations are getting under way, including a Christian 
fellowship group, a Rotary Club for young adults, two academic clubs and a 
literary journal.

<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man, suffering from multiple stab wounds, stumbled into the 
lobby of a downtown hotel Sunday evening, collapsed on the floor and died, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man entered the Serra Francis Hometel at 943 10th Avenue at 5:25 p.m. and 
died at the scene, said a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics responded, but the man was dead by the time they arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the stabbing occurred at 917 10th Ave. and that the man fled the 
scene to seek help at the hotel, the spokesman said. Witnesses told police that 
a fight had broken out at that address and that the suspect fled shortly before 
the victim reached the hotel, the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect, Junius Derouen, 25, was later arrested and booked into County Jail 
on suspicion of murder.

2 ARRESTED AFTER CONFRONTATION ON MISSION BEACH BOARDWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego men were taken into custody Sunday night and each booked on five 
felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon after a confrontation with others 
near the Belmont Park area of Mission Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 6:15 p.m., a group of 10 to 20 black males allegedly attacked a group of 
whites on the boardwalk near Belmont Park, according to Sgt. Chuck Peck, a 
spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
A second group of whites was then attacked, but, while fighting back, forced 
the suspects onto the beach in the Bonita Cove area, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
There the assailants armed themselves with barbecue utensils stolen from a 
family that was picnicking at the beach, Peck said. They used the utensils to 
attack the group they had first confronted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said one of the suspects announced to the crowd that he had a gun, but 
none was displayed. By this time, a sizable crowd had gathered, and the 
suspects fled in several cars, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men who later returned were promptly arrested by police. Because the 
assailants "uttered numerous inflammatory racial statements," police are 
labeling this a hate crime, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Alexander, 19, and Richard Maxey, 25, were being held in County Jail 
downtown. They were also cited on suspicion of several misdemeanor violations 
in addition to the felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, Peck said.

SNAKEBITE ANTIDOTES IMPROVED

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new way to make effective snakebite anti-venom antidotes that have fewer side 
effects than existing products has been developed by researchers at the 
University of Wisconsin at Madison. About 45,000 people worldwide die each year 
from poisonous bites and stings, and many times that number are treated 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 80% of all patients treated with conventional anti-venoms develop 
allergic reactions to horse proteins in the anti-venoms. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular biologists Sean B. Carroll and Bruce Thalley report in today's 
edition of BioTechnology that they have made effective anti-venoms by injecting 
the poisons into chickens. The antibodies are concentrated in egg yolks, which 
makes isolation and purification easy. Chicken proteins also do not produce as 
severe a reaction as horse proteins. The anti-venoms have not yet been tested 
in humans.

U.S. SCIENTISTS STUDY KAMCHATKA VOLCANOES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists representing two U.S. agencies are studying volcanoes in Soviet 
Kamchatka this month, the first time Westerners have been allowed into the 
region in decades, according to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kamchatka Peninsula is both remote and home to sensitive Soviet military 
installations, factors that have discouraged study of the area's volcanoes by 
Soviet scientists and, until now, has kept the area off-limits to Western 
researchers," the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
Kamchatka is in the eastern Soviet Union, along the Bering Sea and Pacific 
Ocean. It is part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire," an area of frequent volcanic 
and earthquake activity that includes New Zealand, Japan, Alaska's Aleutian 
Peninsula and the west coasts of North America and South America. 
</P>
<P>
The five scientists from NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey arrived in 
Kamchatka earlier this month and will conduct joint field studies with Soviet 
researchers until Friday.

STREP BACTERIA HAVE SPLIT PERSONALITY; 
</P>
<P>
DISEASE: THEY SEEM TO BE EVOLVING INTO MORE VIRULENT FORM. GROUP A STRAIN 
CAUSES PNEUMONIA THAT KILLED JIM HENSON OF MUPPETS FAME. IT ALSO TRIGGERS OTHER 
DISORDERS FROM MILD TO DEADLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The same bacteria that commonly cause relatively innocuous cases of strep 
throat in school-age children and young adults appears to be evolving into a 
menacing, more virulent form. In recent years, it has produced a severe and 
potentially lethal -- though rare -- infection, most often in adults. 
</P>
<P>
The ubiquitous strain of bacteria known as Group A streptococcus causes the 
pneumonia that swiftly killed Muppeteer Jim Henson in May. It also triggers a 
variety of other disorders ranging from a relatively mild skin infection, 
impetigo, to potentially deadly ailments such as scarlet fever, rheumatic 
fever, respiratory disease and a newly described infection called severe 
streptococcal syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the devastating syndrome often starts with a minor skin infection 
from a skinned elbow or a bruised knee, said Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, an 
epidemiologist in the respiratory diseases branch of the Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta. The Group A strep bacteria present on the skin penetrate 
the wound, infiltrating the blood stream. Within 48 to 72 hours the microbes 
can wreak havoc in the body. 
</P>
<P>
The rapidly advancing infection often leads to a variety of symptoms including 
high fever, chills, extremely low blood pressure, muscle and tissue damage, a 
loss of circulation that may result in death or amputation, multiorgan failure 
of the kidneys, liver and lungs, and shock. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC estimates that the syndrome occurs in four or five out of every 100,000 
people. Of those infected, 30% die, Schwartz said. Twenty percent of those 
infected also seem to develop a more acute form of the syndrome, although 
researchers do not know why the infection is more severe in some people than 
others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers speculate that a toxin produced by Group A strep is involved either 
directly or indirectly in triggering the characteristic adverse reactions 
within the body. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury is still out. We don't know which toxin, if any, is responsible (for 
the syndrome), but the infection almost has to be toxin mediated," said Dr. 
Edward Kaplan, a pediatrician and director of the World Health Organization 
Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Streptococci at the 
University of Minnesota. "Once the infection gets started, something other than 
just the presence of the bacteria has to account for its symptoms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A report in the New England Journal of Medicine last year noted that eight of 
10 people with the syndrome whose bacteria could be grown in the laboratory 
produced a protein called Toxin A, the same toxin that caused severe cases of 
scarlet fever earlier in the century. The toxin "disappeared" around 1940, as 
did acute cases of scarlet fever. Since then, milder forms of scarlet fever -- 
caused by Group A strep bacteria producing Toxins B and C -- have been 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
The type of toxin produced, if any, in 10 other infected patients included in 
the study could not be determined, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. cases of severe streptococcal syndrome are believed to have 
surfaced in 1984 in Boise, Ida. Since then, cases have been documented 
throughout the United States and in Scandinavia, East Germany, England, 
Australia, New Zealand and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In order to track the incidence of infection and gather clinical and 
epidemiological data, the CDC recently began working with local and state 
health departments in California, Arizona, Colorado, Alabama, Ohio and 
Maryland. Samples of the Group A strep bacteria from all patients infected with 
the syndrome in the surveillance areas will be collected and sent to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Susan Lee, an epidemiologist with the Los Angeles County 
Health Department, earlier data collected by the department in January and 
February, 1989, detected seven cases of the syndrome. Five of the patients 
died, Lee said. "It is alarming." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Schwartz said, "It is not a disease that mothers and fathers need to 
be especially concerned with. Although strep infections are common, the severe 
syndrome is very, very rare," particularly in children. 
</P>
<P>
While roughly 50% of the cases of the syndrome begin with skin injuries, none 
are believed to be associated with complications associated with strep throat, 
Schwartz said. In 35% of the cases, the site of infection cannot be determined 
and in 15% of the cases, the infection begins with pneumonia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers understand little at the molecular level to explain how genetic 
switches might turn on, increasing the toxicity of bacteria that previously 
have been benign. They speculate that a population's resistance to infection 
through acquired immunity -- previous exposure to the strain of bacteria that 
causes infection -- may cause the bacteria to modify itself over time to become 
more infectious. 
</P>
<P>
Antibiotics, such as penicillin, have proved effective in treating the 
syndrome, but only if those infected seek treatment early, before the bacteria 
unleash their potent toxin or a related factor throughout the body. Once severe 
symptoms appear, simply killing the organism with antibiotics won't cure the 
patient, Kaplan said. In that case, doctors must use other means to treat the 
severe symptoms of the disease, such as multiorgan failure and muscle damage 
from the toxin -- a task that does not always end in success. 
</P>
<P>
Early reports of the syndrome in the United States implicated Toxin A as the 
culprit responsible for mediating severe streptococcal syndrome. Because the 
toxin is well-known for causing the severe cases of scarlet fever in children 
earlier in the century, some researchers have suggested that the syndrome may 
be a return of scarlet fever. 
</P>
<P>
Recent reports of the syndrome in Europe and in data collected by the CDC, 
however, indicate that far more patients diagnosed as having the syndrome are 
producing another bacterial toxin -- Toxin B, either with or without Toxin C, 
rather than Toxin A. Toxins B and C are also capable of causing scarlet fever, 
but typically produce milder forms of the illness as well as milder forms of 
severe streptococcal syndrome. The new finding has led scientists to speculate 
that another yet unrecognized toxin may be involved in the syndrome or that two 
distinct forms of the syndrome exist. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Schlivert, a microbiologist at the University of Minnesota who has 
studied severe streptococcal syndrome since it was first reported, said he 
believes one form of the illness occurs in healthy individuals, typically under 
50 years of age who aren't old enough to have been exposed to earlier Toxin A 
cases of scarlet fever. These patients almost always produce Toxin A and seem 
to develop the most severe form of the syndrome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schlivert speculates that a second form of the syndrome occurs more often in an 
older group of patients with underlying medical conditions that may predispose 
them to infection. 
</P>
<P>
The first group may, in fact, have scarlet fever, while the second group 
appears to have something completely new, Schlivert speculates. 
</P>
<P>
CDC's Schwartz disagrees. Their data indicates that severe streptococcal 
syndrome is different epidemiologically and clinically from scarlet fever. 
"Severe scarlet fever with Toxin A-producing bacteria occurred in children with 
sore throats," Schwartz said. "The new syndrome rarely occurs in children and 
it doesn't occur with a throat infection." 
</P>
<P>
Muscle and tissue destruction, a hallmark signal of the severe streptococcal 
syndrome, did not occur in earlier cases of scarlet fever, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major mystery why the overwhelming majority of strep infections occur 
in children, but the severe syndrome occurs most often in adults," Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although severe streptococcal syndrome is considered contagious, not everyone 
who comes into contact with an infected individual develops the syndrome, 
Schwartz said. Signs of the infection include a skin abrasion or cough that 
gets progressively worse within a relatively short time. Those infected 
typically develop signs of severe illness such as a fever and chills. Anyone 
with such symptoms should promptly seek medical attention, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Severe Streptococcal Syndrome 
</P>
<P>
The syndrome occurs most often in adults, beginning with an infection or cough 
that progressively worsens, leading to severe illness and destruction of muscle 
tissue and organs. 
</P>
<P>
1. The syndrome starts with a minor skin infection from an abrasion. 
</P>
<P>
2. Group A streptococcal bacteria present on the skin penetrate the wound, 
infiltrating the blood stream. 
</P>
<P>
3. Doctors believe the bacteria release toxins which cause the severe 
streptococcal syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
4. Infection can lead to a variety of symptoms, including high fever, chills, 
low blood pressure, shock, muscle and tissue damage, and multiple organ failure 
of the kidneys, liver and lungs. Antibiotics have proved effective in treating 
the syndrome when diagnosed early, before the bacteria release the toxins. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria occur in chains. Several toxins are released by the bacteria, but 
doctors believe that toxin A causes the most severe form of the syndrome.

</P>
<P>
It was only a few days ago that he toured this huge black township, looking in 
on a migrant workers' hostel reeking of human waste, a primary school and a new 
shopping center where he stopped to buy a pack of Camel Lights. 
</P>
<P>
When he appeared at the door of a neat yellow stucco home, he surprised 
Henrietta Mafokosho by asking if she'd give him and his wife a house tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shivering," Mafokosho, 21, recalled. "I couldn't believe such a great 
man was here in my house, shaking my hand. He's a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
There haven't been many white South African leaders in this troubled country's 
history whom Sowetans would call great men -- or even, for that matter, nice 
guys. But De Klerk is like none before him. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was sworn into office a year ago last week, the 54-year-old head of 
state has shaken up South Africa and the world with his stunning reform 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Sunday, he 
quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and declared that his nation 
is on "a great journey" toward full democracy. 
</P>
<P>
A smiling De Klerk, recalling the words of King, said: "Peace and freedom are 
the goals of all men. South Africa has embarked on a great journey. It is a 
journey for full democracy at home, and abroad full participation in the family 
of nations." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "the new South Africa is at hand" and promised that the "walls of 
apartheid are coming down." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who meets President Bush today, has said his mission is to persuade 
Americans that he is serious about reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people (in America) are still looking at South Africa through glasses 
they should have discarded by now," De Klerk said before embarking on his trip. 
He added that it would be "a great challenge to change the image burned into 
their minds by years and years" of violent scenes from South Africa on their 
television screens. 
</P>
<P>
But the trip comes as De Klerk's program to dismantle apartheid and begin 
negotiations, warmly welcomed both here and abroad, runs into its most serious 
difficulties since the government opened talks with the African National 
Congress in May. 
</P>
<P>
A month of factional violence in Johannesburg-area townships has left more than 
760 dead and put new obstacles on the road to peace. De Klerk has sent extra 
police into the townships in Operation Iron Fist, which seemed to halt the 
trouble, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered razor wire put up around flash points of trouble, 
prepared to impose curfews beginning Tuesday and declared a 10-day amnesty for 
the surrender of dangerous weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has criticized the crackdown, saying it amounts to a reimposition of 
the state of emergency and is designed to repress legitimate political 
activity. The ANC blames the current violence on right-wing white agitators who 
are stoking black fighting to undermine the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk says the fighting stems primarily from ethnic and political 
differences among blacks, although he says it is possible other, unknown, 
forces are behind some of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Incidents of unrest have increased sharply since De Klerk normalized black 
political activity by legalizing the ANC and other black organizations in a 
landmark speech Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The rising expectations of blacks living in ghettos has touched off hundreds of 
demonstrations. Some have been peaceful but others have been broken up with 
police tear gas and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
A recent judicial inquiry recommended that charges be brought against three 
dozen black and white police officers who killed five demonstrators without 
provocation in Sebokeng during a March protest. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes of unrest have been replayed nightly for nervous whites on state-run 
television, driving many into the lap of the government's right-wing political 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to De Klerk's woes is the almost daily criticism from militant white 
groups who complain that whites suspected in right-wing attacks and bombings 
have been detained without cause and tortured while in custody. Police 
officials express private fears for De Klerk's life. 
</P>
<P>
The growing power of the right wing has put pressure on the president to prove 
that his reforms will be good for the country's whites in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"De Klerk tries to project an image of sweet reasonableness, and he's done it 
successfully," said Sampie Terreblanche, a political analyst at Stellenbosch 
University. "But in the next six months, he'll have to deliver some of that 
sweetness." 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts agree that the lifting of economic and other sanctions against 
South Africa would go a long way toward easing the anxieties of whites, who 
have been financially and emotionally hurt by the campaign to isolate them from 
the West's markets, culture and sports fields. 
</P>
<P>
ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, during a U.S. tour in June, won assurances 
from many congressional leaders that sanctions will remain in place until 
apartheid reform is irreversible. The ANC says that point has not yet been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
So far, De Klerk has said he's disappointed that foreign governments have 
refused "to acknowledge that the process in South Africa has become 
irreversible. We sincerely say . . . there will be a new constitution. And that 
constitution will be fair and just. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is right for the international community to re-evaluate the situation 
and to put their money where their mouths are," De Klerk added. 
</P>
<P>
The president said, though, that he did not come to the United States "with hat 
in hand" to plead for an end to sanctions. "That will take care of itself as 
South Africans prove that we mean business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against South Africa, passed over President Reagan's veto in 1986, 
are among the most severe Pretoria faces. The American law outlines specific 
steps that must be taken by the South African government before the 
Administration can consider removing those sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration believes De Klerk has met most of those conditions. One 
obstacle will be removed when the government releases about 2,500 political 
prisoners. The government and the ANC have agreed on a plan to identify and 
release those activists, beginning in a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A more formidable obstacle is the lifting of the state of emergency in Natal 
province. Three years of black faction fighting in Natal between supporters of 
Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has 
killed nearly 4,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Even if De Klerk receives no promises from Washington, the trip still will be 
heralded back home as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The last South African 
leader to visit the United States was Gen. Jan Smuts, in 1945, three years 
before the National Party came to power. 
</P>
<P>
Many white South Africans have chafed under the diplomatic and economic 
isolation engendered by their country's system of apartheid, which segregates 
neighborhoods, schools and hospitals and denies the black majority a vote in 
national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the number of American firms doing business in South Africa has 
dropped from 386 to 129. Nevertheless, many South Africans still admire 
Americans and delight in American entertainment and products. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most popular programs on state-run television are "LA Law" and 
"thirtysomething." Theaters here show many American movies. And South Africans 
snap up everything from American canned goods to computers -- despite mark-ups 
that average 400% of the U.S. sales price. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's promises to negotiate a new constitution that will end apartheid and 
extend voting rights to black people has greatly improved Pretoria's relations 
with the United States, Europe and Africa. But that has yet to translate into 
trade agreements to aid South Africa's sagging economy. Many foreign 
governments are looking for more concrete signs of change. 
</P>
<P>
The president already has promised that the next session of Parliament, which 
opens in February, 1991, will scrap the Group Areas Act, a pillar of apartheid 
that carves the country into separate neighborhoods for blacks, mixed-race 
Coloreds, Indians and whites. 
</P>
<P>
He has moved less quickly on opening schools. White public schools will be 
allowed to open their doors to blacks next year if 72% of a school's parents 
agree. But the government still maintains veto power and, even in integrated 
schools, whites still will get first choice for openings. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has been heartened, though, by the warm reception many blacks in South 
Africa have given to his reform program. The graffiti artists in South Africa's 
townships have splattered his first initials -- "Viva F. W." -- next to their 
anti-apartheid slogans. 
</P>
<P>
And recent opinion polls suggest that if a multiracial election were held 
today, the white Afrikaner president would get one in five black votes. 
(Mandela would get three of the other four.) 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was cheered by hundreds of Sowetans during his recent tour here. Many 
were surprised to hear him admit that the conditions of many township 
residents, especially those living in the hostels that have been the flash 
points of recent violence, "were absolutely unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that so much needs to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He had told Soweto primary school pupils that he and "other leaders, the black 
leaders, all of us, are trying to work out a new South Africa in which you will 
be able to live happily." 
</P>
<P>
And at least some Sowetans were impressed by his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the township really like F. W. They believe in him," 
Henrietta Mafokosho said. "And they believe that in a few years, everything 
will be OK." 
</P>

<P>
HOMONG, Myanmar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thin, high-pitched drone of a single-engine plane intruded like a pesky 
insect on the twilight stillness of Tiger camp, a military installation that 
sprawls down a mountain valley under towering stands of tropical trees. 
</P>
<P>
A cowbell began tolling a melancholy alarm and the power was abruptly shut 
down, plunging the camp into darkness. As a precaution, the electricity stayed 
off for the entire night, turning the camp's inhabitants into slow-moving 
silhouettes under the faint illumination of starlight. 
</P>
<P>
There is an abundance of nervous jitters these days at the remote headquarters 
here of Khun Sa, a man regarded by the U.S. government as the "Opium King," the 
world's largest provider of heroin and the pre-eminent warlord in this lawless 
corner of Myanmar, which was once called Burma. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa -- the name means "Prince Prosperous" in the Shan dialect -- is the 
commanding general of the Mong Tai Army, an insurgent force he says is fighting 
to win political autonomy for the eastern Shan States from Myanmar's central 
government. He also admits to controlling 80% of the narcotics flowing out of 
Myanmar to the United States, an activity he argues is the only way he can feed 
his people and keep his movement alive. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Khun Sa craftily managed to elude his enemies and remain above the 
law. But recently, he has suffered a series of painful setbacks that may prove 
to be crippling, if not fatal, to his reign. 
</P>
<P>
His difficulties began with the announcement in March that he had been indicted 
by a federal grand jury in New York on 10 separate counts of drug trafficking 
stemming from the seizure of more than a ton of heroin in Bangkok, Thailand, on 
Feb. 14, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the night of blackout, Khun Sa reflected concern about his old 
nemesis, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration: 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the plane might be the Thais or the DEA," he admitted. He joked to 
two visiting journalists that he had kept them waiting for several hours 
because he feared they might be involved in a kidnaping plot. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to his nervousness, Khun Sa's troops have become embroiled in a huge 
battle near Doi Long, a mountain pass used by heroin caravans to travel from 
Myanmar into northern Thailand. The fighting, against a rival ethnic group 
called the Wa, threatens to divide Khun Sa's drug empire in what one Western 
official described as "a classic struggle for market share." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Khun Sa has been forced to close a major heroin refinery near the 
scene of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Strands from these two pressure points on Khun Sa have recently begun to 
intertwine. Western officials noted that the Wa were receiving assistance from 
the central Myanmar government, primarily in the form of transportation and 
artillery, and logistic support from the Thai government, which allowed the Wa 
to pass through Thai territory to get their troops into the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most intriguing sign of change is that the traditionally good 
relations that Khun Sa has enjoyed with Thai government officials are 
apparently souring. In the past, his troops could have climbed into pickup 
trucks for a quick drive down a Thai-built road that runs from his headquarters 
into north Thailand's highway network. Instead, reinforcements for the battle 
are now being forced to set off on foot for a two-week slog through the jungle 
to reach the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Khun Sa and many other regional experts scoffed at the U.S. 
indictment, given the obvious difficulty of making an arrest. But Western 
officials said that the indictment, by undermining his image as a Shan 
nationalist, may have made it harder for Thai officials to continue their cozy 
relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
"They say I have fangs and horns, but that's not fair," Khun Sa, dressed in 
crisply ironed olive military fatigues, said in an interview. "They say I am a 
drug king and a devil. But the king has no crown." 
</P>
<P>
He may lack the coronet, but the 56-year-old Khun Sa is undeniably master of a 
vast, finger-shaped salient of the Shan States, which pokes northward from the 
Thai border. By his own estimates, his domain includes an army of 15,000 men, 
including about 5,000 militia, and another 10,000 civilians -- a figure Western 
officials say is about one-third higher than their own estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"The Shan State is a lawless state," Khun Sa said seriously. "The law has never 
been enforced here. The people who own the most guns have the power." 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa's much-debated claim to legitimacy is based on an obscure document 
called the Panglong Agreement, which was reached in February, 1947, before what 
was then Burma achieved independence from Britain. The agreement provided for 
autonomy for the Shan States. This pledge, as well as later constitutional 
guarantees of equality with Burmese, was among the first promises forgotten 
when the new state of Burma was born. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the independence struggle is genuine, or merely a cover for drug 
dealing, as Western narcotics control officials allege, Khun Sa has erected a 
vast administrative infrastructure to support his operations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the army, there is a separate political movement, known as the 
Tai Revolutionary Council, as well as a governing executive committee, 
political workers, schools, hospitals and tax collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Homong, accessible by an 11-hour mule ride through the mountains, is 
quite comfortable by rural standards in Southeast Asia, it hardly offers Khun 
Sa many outlets for an existence as lavish as those enjoyed by Latin American 
drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
He is said to have a compound with three homes, to which he does not invite 
foreign guests. He has spent money acquiring a collection of beautiful horses. 
He has a wife and five grown children, among them a daughter who reportedly was 
educated in England under a pseudonym. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Khun Sa travels around in a white Toyota pickup truck accompanied 
by 10 bodyguards toting U.S.-made automatic weapons, including a roof-mounted, 
50-caliber heavy machine gun. He wears no jewelry other than a stainless steel 
Rolex watch and carries a rough-hewn, thick wooden cane. 
</P>
<P>
Much of an interview with Khun Sa was devoted to a sermon about his 
relationship with the drug trade, a finely honed rationalization in which he 
mixes sympathy for the West's drug users with obvious concern for his Shan 
clansmen, delicately sidestepping the moral dilemma of bankrolling an 
independence struggle through the misfortunes of others. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion is punctuated by a colloquial American "Well guys, how about 
some grub?" by Sang Joseph, a Shan and recent adherent to the cause who is Khun 
Sa's full-time publicity man. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa and his officers vigorously maintain that the group is not directly 
involved in the drug trade, but merely taxes the opium as it passes through 
areas controlled by his army. Officials said the group earns 60% of its revenue 
this way. 
</P>
<P>
Western narcotics officials paint an entirely different picture, saying that 
Khun Sa and his lieutenants organize the farmers who grow the opium poppies in 
the highlands and run the laboratories that reduce the opium to morphine base 
and then convert it to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
The Shan States, which cover 62,500 square miles -- almost the size of 
Washington state -- produce an estimated 2,625 tons of opium every year, more 
than half the total world output. The area has an ethnic smorgasbord of hill 
tribes like the Wa and Lizu and valley dwellers like the Shan. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa makes the point that most of the people in the highlands of the Shan 
States eke out the barest of livings from the soil, usually growing rice to 
feed themselves. Because there are no roads and little transportation, it is 
impossible for the farmers to grow cash crops that have to be rushed to market 
before spoiling. So they turn to poppy cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
A skilled self-publicist, Khun Sa gained fame in 1977 with an audacious 
proposal, made through a congressional emissary, to sell the opium crop 
directly to the United States for $300 million in development aid over a 
six-year period. He would then use his army to crush the narcotics trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not use a bandit to catch a bandit?" is his frequently quoted line. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has repeatedly rejected his offer. In the 1980s, it gave 
financial and materiel assistance to the Myanmar government to spray the opium 
fields, but the move apparently boomeranged, according to narcotics officials. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reducing production, the spraying scared farmers into vastly 
increasing their planting. The Myanmar government also sprayed without warning, 
ruining thousands of acres of normal farmland and poisoning the countryside 
with herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 17 years, the Western world has lost a lot of money on drug 
suppression, spent thousands of millions of dollars for nothing," Khun Sa said. 
"Instead, they should help people out of their misery." 
</P>
<P>
He scoffed at the DEA's efforts, said the drug trade is "flourishing" and 
predicted that even if he were caught -- a remote possibility given his 
location and the size of his army -- "they would have to feed me in jail and 
the cultivation of poppies would go on." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Khun Sa may also be a victim of his own publicity. The Democratic 
Alliance of Burma, a coalition of opposition groups, including some that 
occasionally dabble in selling opium, has consistently refused to admit Khun Sa 
because of his international reputation as a drug peddler. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest criticism raised by his critics among the Shan, however, is that 
for an insurgent leader, Khun Sa spends remarkably little energy battling the 
central government in Yangon, or Rangoon, as it used to be called. There is 
considerable fighting, but it is usually aimed at other insurgent groups in the 
Shan States trying to seize a part of the opium market. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Khun Sa has a long history of cooperation with government officials, 
who in turn have allowed his opium caravans to pass unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
From 1964 to 1967, he even headed a government-sponsored home guard unit called 
the Ka Kwe Ye, apparently winning government blessing to deal in drugs in 
exchange for helping to suppress ethnic rebels. Although jailed by the Burmese 
from 1969 to 1974, he was released to return to the Shan States and resume the 
suppression of rebel groups, which he achieved by converting some to his banner 
and killing off the others. Groups such as the Shan United Army and the Shan 
United Revolutionary Army were simply merged under his command. 
</P>
<P>
The Shan States had been exploited as opium producers by the remnants of the 
Kuomintang (Nationalist) army, which fled neighboring China after the victory 
of the Communist revolutionaries in 1949. Kuomintang generals co-opted Shan 
rebels and formed them into fighting units. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa was himself born into the family of an ethnic Chinese father and Shan 
mother. He is also known by his Chinese name, Chang Chifu. The Shan name Khun 
Sa was given him as a boy, long before his involvement with drugs made him into 
a truly prosperous prince. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Nationalist Chinese influence is still greatly in evidence: Chinese 
is the common language of Khun Sa's army and military training is conducted on 
the Nationalist model. Khun Sa said he even sends some officers to Taiwan for 
training, but this could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
His military deputy, Chang Suchuan, was a Kuomintang officer, and many of the 
other officials are also full-blooded Chinese rather than Shan. Even the camp 
doctor is Chinese, although he said he fled to the Shan States only during last 
year's student rebellion in China. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa's army is well outfitted by Third World insurgent standards, with every 
soldier in a clean uniform and boots. Most of the weaponry appears to have 
originated in the United States -- the M-16 rifle is most common -- but there 
is a smattering of Chinese arms. The army also produces its own mortar 
ammunition and some huge rudimentary rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers are paid $6 a month. Army officials admit to forcing about 40% of 
the troops to join up. The troops not at the battlefront live in neat teak 
buildings with tin roofs. There is a Saturday night disco, regular video 
viewing and a recently installed satellite dish that pulls in the latest news 
from CNN. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western officials, the fighting against the Wa at Doi Long could 
become an important turning point for Khun Sa. His troops are surrounded by the 
United Wa States Army on three sides and have their backs to the Thai border, 
in effect cut off from resupply. The fighting has been especially bloody in 
recent weeks, frequently involving hand-to-hand combat. The Wa are the region's 
fiercest fighters, mercenaries often compared to Nepal's Gurkhas. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa said his troops suffered 60 dead and 140 wounded in a single, 10-day 
battle in July. Wa casualties were not known, but were believed to be even 
higher since they were attacking Khun Sa's fixed positions and were thus more 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the fighting goes for or against Khun Sa -- one Western official said 
he was giving slight odds to the Wa -- it is unlikely that Khun Sa will be 
toppled entirely from his prominence in the Shan States. An outright Wa victory 
would confront the Myanmar government with a new, formidable enemy, and Khun Sa 
undoubtedly still has friends in positions of influence in both Myanmar and 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were the Yangon government, I wouldn't want to see Khun Sa eliminated," 
said one Western analyst. "I merely would like to see Khun Sa cut down to 
size."

DELIBERATE WILSON RELIES ON EXPERTS, LONGTIME AIDES

</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the early weeks of 1989, it seemed as though U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson had 
consulted half the state of California about whether to run for governor. But 
Gayle Wilson still was not sure if her husband would make the biggest move of 
his political career. 
</P>
<P>
Finally one night at the dinner table, she told Wilson that if he decided not 
to run for governor because he feared she might object, he would regret it and 
resent her for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to do it, do it!" Gayle Wilson told her husband. "And it really 
was 100% go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Deciding to run for governor is hardly an everyday political decision, but the 
story is typical of how Pete Wilson goes about collecting information and 
making decisions. By all accounts, the 57-year-old senator pursues a process 
that is thorough, wide-ranging, painstaking in detail -- and often frustrating 
to those who know him best. 
</P>
<P>
There is no particular mystery about the process, developed over four years in 
the California Assembly, 11 years as mayor of San Diego and eight years as the 
junior U.S. senator from California. Wilson relies heavily on talented and 
loyal aides -- mostly white and male -- but also reaches beyond this coterie to 
a variety of experts. On occasion, even those closest to him are not likely to 
know which way Wilson will tilt on an issue until he announces his decision. 
</P>
<P>
John G. Davies, a former law school colleague who often is described as 
Wilson's oldest and closest friend, recalls that he was taken totally by 
surprise when Wilson decided to seek his first elective office in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"I was astounded when he told me he was going to run for the Assembly. I had no 
inkling," said Davies, who received his political education with Wilson in 
Richard Nixon's 1962 gubernatorial campaign and still counsels the senator on 
some issues, including helping screen potential nominees for federal 
judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, there aren't many surprises when Wilson finally decides an 
issue, Davies added. "The process is too gradual to contain surprise." With a 
deep chuckle, almost a guffaw, Davies added, "He never moves fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have worked closely with Wilson talk about his demands for the facts 
-- all the facts. "He comes not lightly to decisions. Therefore, he does not 
come lightly to changes," said Robert S. White, the chief of Wilson's 80-member 
Senate staff who has been with Wilson since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
If he is elected governor on Nov. 6, associates say, there will be no elite 
"kitchen cabinet" of wealthy California businessmen such as counseled Ronald 
Reagan, and no eclectic circle of former seminary classmates and 
alternative-politics gurus who engaged in late-night gab fests with Jerry 
Brown. Nor would there be the sort of small, mysterious circle -- some in 
Sacramento refer to it as a "black box" -- that George Deukmejian seems to draw 
on for information and advice. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson may touch bases with old chums and a few wealthy advisers -- the Irvine 
Co.'s Donald L. Bren, for example, or San Diego savings and loan executive 
Gordon C. Luce. But they say he is more likely to call them to chat about local 
political trends than the nuts-and-bolts decisions of government, turning 
instead to professionals for expert opinion. 
</P>
<P>
One biographical account of Bren, the reclusive Orange County developer, 
described him and Wilson as old Marine buddies and claimed that Wilson would 
not have run for governor without the proper signal from him. If so, that would 
seem to make Bren a potential power behind the throne. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson aides insist that Bren has no such influence over Wilson. Wilson 
said their relationship dates from the unsuccessful 1974 gubernatorial campaign 
of Republican Houston I. Flournoy. "That's what it is: It's a friendship," 
Wilson said. He acknowledged that he might discuss a housing or planning issue 
with the billionaire developer but said he did that with Irvine Co. officials 
long before Bren took over the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an inner circle, it's a large one," said Otto Bos, a former 
newspaper reporter who has served Wilson for 14 years in a variety of roles. 
</P>
<P>
Bos is directing Wilson's campaign against Democrat Dianne Feinstein for 
governor. Were there a club of Wilson insiders, Bos would be one of its charter 
members and gatekeepers. So would White and campaign manager George Gorton, who 
has been Wilson's chief political sidekick since the first race for mayor in 
1971 and is in over-all charge of the 1990 election effort. This, in a sense, 
is Wilson's San Diego clique, those who have been with Wilson for 10 years or 
longer, going back to his days as mayor and even as a state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to specific issues or problems to be solved, there is a much 
larger circle of advisers to which Wilson can be expected to turn. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has compiled a list of experts and advisers in various fields with 
whom Wilson consulted during his years as San Diego's mayor. It contains 69 
names, including some Democrats, and ranges from scientists at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography to a former school board member also identified as 
the president of the San Diego Catfish Club. This is not exactly an exclusive 
circle and is typical of the wide field of friends, associates and 
acquaintances of anyone who has been in politics and government for nearly a 
quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
Bos said Wilson may have talked to as many as 200 people as he pondered whether 
to pursue the governorship so soon after his 1988 reelection to a second Senate 
term. 
</P>
<P>
The process included extensive private briefings in Sacramento by Deukmejian 
Administration officials, members of the Legislature, lobbyists and others, 
including onetime Assembly Speaker Robert T. Monagan, former head of the 
California Manufacturers Assn., and Kirk West, a former state finance official 
now president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there was little need for Wilson to test the political waters because 
he was all but drafted by key Republicans who saw him as the one GOP leader 
with a chance to continue the Republican reign in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the briefings he sought were designed to assess the state of the state, 
to find out if the office was worth having -- if California with all its growth 
and problems still can be managed by a governor. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Wilson said he went to Sacramento in search of "a fairly 
candid and cold-blooded assessment. . . . And then I made a decision." 
</P>
<P>
"It was doable," Wilson concluded. "Not easy, but doable. I decided change was 
needed and change could be effected and it was going to take someone who was 
willing to shake things up and that's when I decided to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Davies believes that Wilson's thoroughness is a legacy of his legal training. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to have unknown facts surface later," said Davies. "There's an 
abhorrence of that." Yet, when deadlines and demands of government do not 
permit the luxury of unlimited study, Davies said Wilson is "perfectly capable 
of making an educated guess and saying, 'We've got to go with it.' But he 
doesn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Given the flood of information that swamps senators these days, Wilson puts a 
priority on someone who can cut to the heart of the matter. Wilson sometimes 
will assemble groups of contenders to hash out an issue, but that is 
time-consuming and is not done often. After that, the written staff memo, 
ranging from one to perhaps seven pages, is Wilson's preference. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is well-written, it actually saves time," Wilson said. "If it is concise 
and really highlights the pertinent information, it spots the issue or issues, 
gives the background, what the question is before us, here are the options, 
here are the recommendations. That's a good memorandum." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson then smiled briefly and added: "Assuming they're making the right 
recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's background yields at least one case in which he may have wished there 
had been more questions asked, more fact-checking done. In 1973, the mayor's 
office was advised that some old bombs had been found in a housing development 
built on a former artillery range. Wilson asked the Army to sweep the area to 
make it safe. He later was advised that several dozen rounds of spent 
ammunition had been found, but military officials urged that "due caution still 
be taken" as other shells could work their way to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1983, after Wilson had moved on to the Senate, two young boys were 
killed when an old artillery shell they found exploded. The city eventually 
settled with their families on a $2.5-million liability payment. Some critics 
said that the Wilson Administration and the housing developers should have been 
more diligent in making sure there was no further hazard. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times early this year, the senator commented: "I would 
have to say in hindsight, because a child died, not enough was done, I suppose. 
But at the time, I think that the mayor and the City Council, who had asked 
that the survey be undertaken, were probably entitled to rely on the assurance 
that was given." 
</P>
<P>
But there are few case studies about Wilson being ill-prepared for the 
unexpected, his aides say. On the down side, his immersion into facts, 
sometimes pushing political ideology into the background, and his relish for 
government policy have helped forge Wilson's image as a passive technocrat 
rather than a politician who knows how to push the emotional buttons of voters. 
This is the sort of man who exhibits a sense of awe as he describes the U.S. 
Senate as "an intellectual candy store" because of all the sources of 
information at the disposal of senators. 
</P>
<P>
But chief of staff White and others describe a different Wilson. They say he 
can be witty and engaging, launching into lively philosophical debates and 
sometimes telling old war stories from his Assembly days that he punctuates 
with uncannily realistic impressions of long-dead legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"He is certainly willing to get into a discussion when you disagree with him," 
White said. "We have some strong discussions." 
</P>
<P>
When Wilson was called on to remember occasions in which one fact or another 
tipped the balance on an important decision, he chose a case that was fraught 
with emotion. In this instance it was an intensely personal story rather than a 
compilation of the facts that made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The setting was the Legislature in 1967 and the issue was California's 
controversial proposed abortion law, then considered one of the most liberal in 
the nation. This was a tough vote for a freshman Republican assemblyman and 
Wilson listened carefully to both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a man Wilson did not identify came to him with the story of his 
daughter who had become pregnant and, in light of existing legal restrictions, 
performed her own abortion "in a very inept, amateurish fashion." The parents 
learned of it only when advised by the family doctor that their daughter most 
likely could never have children. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the incident convinced him that the question of abortion was so 
personal that government should not be involved and that severe restrictions 
would only encourage law-abiding citizens to seek "back-alley" solutions to 
unwanted pregnancies. He voted for the statute that greatly liberalized 
conditions under which abortions could be obtained in California. The law 
remains in effect today. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Wilson opposes the federal government paying for abortions performed on 
poor women. He argues that privately funded abortions are available, so his 
vote against Medicaid is not limiting a poor woman's access to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Wilson, who supports federal funding for abortions, said she is "still 
working on him" to change his mind. "He said, 'If you can show me a study that 
says poor women aren't getting abortions because there's no funding, then I'd 
be willing to look at it differently,' " Gayle Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
When Wilson broke into politics in California, associates say there were few 
women and minorities involved in key GOP positions. And with Wilson, it is 
apparent that friendships and associations tend to be long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after winning his Assembly seat in 1966, Wilson was quickly welcomed 
into an Assembly leadership group of moderate Republicans. It was here that he 
formed a circle of friendships that remains today and may provide a pool for 
some key appointees to state jobs or judgeships if Wilson becomes governor. 
</P>
<P>
"When Pete came in in '67, we were immediately attracted to him. He was a 
bright guy who obviously had some great future," Former Republican Assemblyman 
William T. Bagley said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital, there is less unanimity about members of Wilson's 
Washington circle. Nearly everyone mentions Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) and 
Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, a 
former Honolulu lawyer who became involved in Wilson's 1982 Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Wilson cited Rudman and Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.). There are reports 
that Wilson and Vice President Dan Quayle were relatively close when Quayle 
represented Indiana in the Senate, but Wilson does not volunteer Quayle's name 
as among the inner circle. Wilson did mention Rudman, and also Sen. Robert W. 
(Bob) Packwood (R-Ore.). 
</P>
<P>
"He and I have had some knock-down, drag-out fights," Wilson said of Packwood. 
"We've become pretty good friends." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WILSON'S TOP AIDES 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Pete Wilson's top staff aides are notable among other factors for their 
longevity with the senator, who is the Republican nominee for governor of 
California. Four of Wilson's top aides have spent a total of nearly 60 years 
with him, dating back to his membership in the state Assembly in 1967. Here is 
a rundown of his top aides: 
</P>
<P>
GEORGE GORTON, 43, of San Diego, is Wilson's campaign manager with 
responsibility for overall direction of the campaign. He attended Munich 
University as part of an armed forces-University of Maryland extension program 
and is a political science and economics graduate of San Diego State 
University. Gorton, a political consultant, first worked for Wilson in his 1971 
campaign for mayor of San Diego. He managed Wilson's winning campaign for the 
Senate in 1982 and was the lead consultant when Wilson was reelected to the 
Senate in 1988. Gorton also has worked in the presidential campaigns of Richard 
M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT S. WHITE, 48, of San Diego, has been Wilson's top staff assistant since 
1967 when Wilson was elected to his first political office, a San Diego seat in 
the state Assembly. When Wilson became mayor of San Diego in 1971, White went 
with him as chief of staff. He has been the top aide in Wilson's Senate office 
in Washington since 1983, in charge of a full-time staff of about 80. White is 
a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard and holds a bachelor's degree in political 
science and journalism from San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
OTTO BOS, 45, is a native of the Netherlands whose family immigrated to the San 
Francisco Bay Area when he was 13. He graduated from San Francisco State 
University with a degree in journalism and history. Bos, a Vietnam veteran, 
covered politics and government for the San Diego Union from 1971 until joining 
Wilson as his City Hall press secretary in 1977. Bos went to Washington in 1983 
to serve as Wilson's Senate press secretary, returning to California several 
years later to lay the groundwork for Wilson's reelection bid. As director of 
Wilson's campaign for governor, Bos is in charge of the day-to-day operation. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM D. LIVINGSTONE, 38, is press secretary for Wilson's campaign for 
governor, working out of campaign headquarters in San Diego's Old Town. 
Livingstone is a 1974 graduate, with honors, in film and television from 
Montana State University in Bozeman and did graduate work at USC. After various 
ventures in the film business and studies in foreign relations, Livingstone 
went to work for the Senate Republican Conference in 1981 and then became press 
secretary for U.S. Sen. James A. McClure (R-Idaho). He joined Wilson's Senate 
staff as press secretary when Bos moved back to California in 1988 and later 
joined the gubernatorial campaign as press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
LOREN KAYE, 34, of Sacramento, serves as campaign research director, as he did 
in Wilson's 1982 campaign. Kaye also has worked in the office of Gov. George 
Deukmejian, most recently as deputy cabinet secretary. Kaye is the son of Peter 
Kaye, a veteran San Diego newspaperman who also served in Wilson's first 
campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
ROSALIE ZALIS, 53, of Los Angeles, director of coalitions, is in charge of 
Wilson's statewide organizational effort to mobilize women. She also serves as 
the campaign's liaison to the Jewish community. Zalis has been a political 
writer and analyst specializing in foreign affairs and women's issues. She was 
San Fernando Valley co-chair of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984 and the Bush 
campaign in 1988.

GASOLINE PRICE TOPS $1.38, AN ALL-TIME HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fueled by uncertainty in the Persian Gulf, gasoline prices have hit an all-time 
high with the average pump price jumping nearly 3 cents a gallon in the last 
two weeks, a leading oil analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
American motorists are paying an average of $1.3835 per gallon at the pump, 
according to the latest Lundberg Survey of national gasoline prices, which was 
conducted Friday. Motorists spent an average of $1.3544 cents a gallon on Sept. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
The previous high of just under $1.38 was set in March, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"The new high doesn't take into account inflation, but even so, it's 
significant," said Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the twice-monthly Lundberg 
Survey of 13,000 service stations. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have fluctuated greatly in recent days, Lundberg said Sunday, driven 
by fears of a war in the Middle East in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
neighboring Kuwait. The fear is that a war could create a serious supply 
upheaval and that replacing gasoline supplies could be difficult, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said Sunday that there is little hope of quick relief at the 
gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see oil prices coming down as long as we have so much production off 
the market -- what Iraq and Kuwait normally would have produced," said Kurt 
Wulff, an oil analyst with McDep Associates Inc., a New York-based oil and gas 
investment research firm. "I do see them coming down in the springtime when our 
consumption is less." 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg's survey showed that at self-service pumps, regular unleaded gasoline 
sold for $1.2736 a gallon on the average, premium unleaded was $1.4405 cents a 
gallon and regular leaded was $1.2551 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
At full-service stations, regular unleaded was $1.4959 a gallon, premium 
unleaded was $1.6319 and regular leaded was $1.4783 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
At one Los Angeles Chevron station, regular gasoline was selling Sunday for 
$1.24 a gallon at the self-service pump and for $1.51 at the full-service pump. 
Self-service unleaded was $1.28, while full-service unleaded sold for $1.61. 
Premium unleaded ran $1.45 for self-service and $1.68 for full service. 
</P>
<P>
"The general picture is that oil prices bumped up a lot in the middle of 
August, settled back a bit, and now we're right back where we were in the 
middle of August," Wulff said. "The question now is where we're headed from 
here. . . . If the current stalemate continues, I believe that oil prices will 
strengthen further." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lastelic, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said crude 
oil prices started to creep up in July, then took a big jump in August. As of 
two weeks ago, crude oil prices had climbed more than 30 cents a gallon since 
the Aug. 2 invasion. But gasoline prices have jumped only about 20 cents a 
gallon in the same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of proves that the (gasoline) companies are restraining the 
increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director for Citizen Action, a Washington-based 
consumer group, disputed Lastelic's view of oil company restraint. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, he said Sunday, although the price of crude oil fell $5 a barrel 
between January, 1990, and June, 1990, gasoline prices went up, "so refiners 
were not passing on their lower costs to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies have "shown some restraint in the last few weeks, but overall the 
companies have still earned a huge windfall since the beginning of August," 
Rothschild said. "They have slowed down the price increases somewhat for 
consumers, but they're passing on higher prices in the form of jet fuel and 
diesel fuel and home heating oil."

TIME TO BRING IN THE BEETS ON THE BIG APPLE'S LAST FAMILY FARM.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The corn swaying in the prematurely chill breeze stood as high as an elephant's 
eye. But the nearby red brick houses and public school stood even higher. 
</P>
<P>
It's harvest time on the last remaining working family farm in New York City. 
The carrots are being pulled from the rich dark soil. Radishes and dill, beets 
and turnips, parsley, scallions and other crops are being picked, cleaned and 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
The harvest of 1990 -- the 105th yearly harvest on the Klein family's land -- 
has been bountiful, the end product of a process that began in April. 
</P>
<P>
"You plant these little seeds. You watch them grow," said John Klein, a 
fourth-generation farmer. "You crawl up and down the rows weeding. You give 
fertilizer, and five days later the plant is twice as big. Then it's a carrot 
and people are eating it. 
</P>
<P>
"Harvest time is the best time of the year. You are doing all this hard work, 
and you are getting something out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, 25, wore a blue sweat shirt emblazoned with the word "Boss," short sweat 
pants and dirty white high-top basketball sneakers as he looked over the crops. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people get off the expressway and drive by. They can't believe they are 
in New York City," he said. "It's a little bit of the twilight zone." 
</P>
<P>
If the notion that a farm still exists in New York City brings shock, even 
suspension of belief, that notion quickly passes upon closer inspection of the 
land and its sturdy three-story red brick farmhouse with a basement kitchen big 
enough to feed 50 farmhands. 
</P>
<P>
Stand under the tall maple tree Klein's great-grandfather planted, glance at 
the gray Ford tractor, circa 1950, look out over the crops, and for a moment 
time stands still. If the Klein family farm is the last working farm in New 
York City, it is something more: a memorial to a gentler era, to continuity, to 
a quieter, more orderly life. 
</P>
<P>
The Klein family settled in rural Flushing, Queens, in 1895. Adam Klein's 
father, who operated a farm in Brooklyn, decided to stake his son to a spread. 
At one point, the Klein family owned 140 acres in the general area where the 
present farm stands. Nowadays, it owns just two acres. 
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage is testimony to urban growth, profit taking and pressures from 
highway builders, developers, speculators and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"My father wishes his father and his grandfather had not sold off the land," 
Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
As land prices and urban pressures rose, the family also acquired a series of 
farms on nearby Long Island. In addition to the remaining two acres in Queens, 
it owns 97 acres in Riverhead, N.Y. But as Long Island becomes more developed, 
pressure to put the land to other uses increases. 
</P>
<P>
"The next step is the ocean," Klein said. "We will be farming fish." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the Klein family sold off part of its farm to the Board of 
Education, which built Public School 26. The school next door and the farm 
share a somewhat symbiotic relationship. Some classes visit the farm and write 
essays. Other students help work the land, doing odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A while back things got out of hand. The kids had a tomato war in the 
schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who attended the University of Buffalo for three years, shares chores on 
the farm with his father. They commute on alternate days from their home in 
Riverhead. Klein's aunt lives in the Queens farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The commute makes it a long day. Klein awakens early -- not to the sound of a 
rooster but to the chatter of an all-sports radio station. By 7 a.m., he has 
made the journey to Queens. Even working two acres can be hard. 
</P>
<P>
"You go home, you're tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, he ventures deeper into New York City -- a journey he views 
warily. 
</P>
<P>
"I get nervous going into the city," he explained. "If I drive my car in, I 
have to worry. I went to Shea Stadium and they stole the radio. They don't care 
any more. They just shoot and stab you. It's laid back out here," Klein said. 
"It's not like people on Wall Street or in downtown Manhattan. The people who 
work in the stock market yell and scream. I don't yell and scream." 
</P>
<P>
But things aren't quite that easy on the farm. Klein pointed to a row of tall 
corn plants swaying in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"The squirrels are eating the corn," he said.

Map, New York; Photo, Harvest Time in Big Apple: It's harvest time on the last 
remaining working family farm in New York City -- a two-acre plot in the

BUDGET BLUES: Congressional preoccupation with budget negotiations is 
distracting the lawmakers from other major agenda items and creating a huge 
logjam of unfinished business. Besides the spate of appropriations bills held 
up by the budget impasse, the two houses are moving slowly on other matters, 
such as child care legislation. Even if a deficit reduction accord is reached, 
the budget package still could take three weeks to clear both the House and 
Senate, according to leadership timetables. 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly endless budget talks have wrecked lawmakers' plans for an early 
election-year getaway on Oct. 5. The backlog of money bills and other "must" 
measures is now so large that Capitol Hill insiders believe the lawmakers 
cannot adjourn until Oct. 20 at the earliest. That leaves only 16 days for 
incumbents to get in their final campaigning before the voters cast ballots on 
Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
GROUSING ABOUT GEPHARDT: House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is 
drawing fire from fellow Democrats for giving away too much in the budget 
negotiations with the Bush Administration. Although the tough-talking 
Missourian has carefully cultivated an image as an aggressive, highly partisan 
critic of GOP policies, rank-and-file Democrats complain that he has become too 
much of a statesman in his role as the Democrats' chief budget negotiator, 
agreeing to hefty concessions on Medicare and other longtime Democratic issues. 
"He's become a lightning rod for all the rank-and-file complaints" about the 
budget talks, one Congress watcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt's defenders say he hasn't given up his partisan fervor -- for example, 
he is still holding out for higher tax rates for the rich -- but that he simply 
is trying for a deficit-reduction package that will protect Democrats from 
getting too much of the blame if the budget talks fall apart. But hard-line 
Democrats aren't buying that. Particularly irksome to them: President Bush's 
praise of Gephardt for his cooperation in the budget talks. 
</P>
<P>
FED FRUSTRATIONS: The past weekend's accord among the Group of Seven finance 
ministers and central bankers to keep interest rates high may bolster the 
dollar temporarily but isn't likely to ease the friction between the Treasury 
and the Federal Reserve, analysts say. The two have sharply conflicting views 
as to what should be done about interest rates and the dollar -- the Treasury 
wants the Fed to lower interest rates, but the central bank is fearful that to 
do so would only send financial markets into a tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the markets are backing the Fed. The dollar has been plunging and, over 
the weekend, finance ministers of America's economic allies served notice that 
they expect the United States to join in holding monetary policy relatively 
tight to ward off inflation. The man on the spot: Treasury Secretary Nicholas 
F. Brady. Those familiar with internal policy discussions in the Administration 
say that the rift between Brady and the Fed is leaving him increasingly 
isolated. 
</P>
<P>
GLOBAL PLANNING: Interest groups pushing to resume U.S. participation in global 
family-planning efforts are counting on an abortion-rights majority in the 
November elections to help boost their cause with Congress. The abortion-rights 
advocates have two goals on Capitol Hill this year -- to increase overall 
funding and to restore the U.S. contribution to the two major international 
population-control groups -- money that Congress cut off in 1985.

</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III defended himself and his department from 
accusations that they led Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last July to believe 
that the United States would not oppose an invasion of Kuwait. Baker termed the 
charges "ludicrous" and "20-20 hindsighting." Baker also played down the threat 
of war in the Persian Gulf, saying the United States and its allies still have 
a "whole host" of non-military options to use against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz said he will boycott the U.N. General 
Assembly, which convenes today, because the United States has barred his 
official plane from landing in New York. The State Department told Iraq's 
ambassador in Washington last week that Aziz should come to New York on a 
commercial flight, Aziz told U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez De Cuellar in 
a letter. Perez de Cuellar said Sunday that he plans to hold more talks with 
Aziz about Iraq's refusal to withdraw from Kuwait but did not say when or where 
they would meet. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president said he would attack Israel and oil fields in Saudi Arabia 
if his country is "strangled" by mounting international efforts to force Iraqi 
troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's message, broadcast on Baghdad Radio, was one of the strongest 
statements yet by the besieged Iraqi leader and for the first time suggested 
that he was ready to fight over sanctions. Previously he has indicated that he 
would only strike if attacked first by Western forces. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq, military 
equipment and other material with war potential continues to slip through the 
naval web, according to U.S. military sources. They said some shipments marked 
for delivery to the Jordanian port of Aqaba are being taken overland to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The amount and type of cargo passing through Aqaba is classified information. 
But officers familiar with the situation indicated that the flow has been 
fairly extensive. One cargo vessel, intercepted by the U.S. Navy within the 
past week, carried British-made Land Rovers painted in military camouflage, 
they said. Another ship was carrying a load of scrap metal, aluminum, silica 
and other materials that are used to make explosives. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the cargoes were listed on the ships' manifests as bound for 
Aqaba, and there was no way for American boarding parties to determine whether 
they were ultimately destined for Iraq, the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis Indicators: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy interceptions of merchant ships since sanctions were imposed: 1,251. 
Of those, 880 were in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea and 371 
were in the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
American citizens and foreign relatives airlifted out of Baghdad: 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. citizens remaining in Iraq and Kuwait: 1,100

SOVIET PREMIER PREDICTS DISASTER IF RADICAL ECONOMIC PLAN WINS OUT;

<P>
RESTRUCTURING: RYZHKOV CALLS FOR A COMPROMISE TO KEEP FROM PLUNGING THE NATION 
INTO CHAOS.

<P>
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, fighting radical proposals for 
sweeping economic changes, appealed Sunday to the country's lawmakers to reject 
a program, endorsed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that would bring a quick 
end to state management of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that an overnight end to state ownership of industry and agriculture 
and government central planning would plunge the Soviet Union into chaos, 
Ryzhkov called for a compromise that would ensure the gradual development of a 
market economy but without further jeopardizing the country's stability. 
</P>
<P>
With a vote possible this week in the Supreme Soviet, the country's 
legislature, on two rival reform programs -- the radicals' plan for a 500-day 
transformation of the Soviet economy and his own plan for a gradual transition 
-- Ryzhkov urged the utmost caution in making what will be a fundamental change 
for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The country is not ready for a sharp swerve," Ryzhkov said in an interview on 
national television. "We are not ready to transfer to a new (economic) system, 
neither psychologically nor organizationally. . . . The market means freedom, 
but we have been working in a system based on direction and (central) 
administration. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to shift to a market economy in 100 days or 500 days. This is 
not realistic. This is only the beginning of the transition, and the transition 
will take years, not days. One cannot calculate this in days or months." 
</P>
<P>
Leonid I. Abalkin, the Soviet vice premier in charge of economic reform, was 
equally blunt as the government, faced with likely defeat in the Supreme 
Soviet, mounted an open counterattack following the radicals' success in 
winning Gorbachev's support, equivocal and wavering though it has been. 
</P>
<P>
The country's economic situation is so perilous, Abalkin told the conservative 
newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya, that "we are at the edge of an abyss. Any 
careless move can push us over. We have to appeal to people's reason." 
</P>
<P>
Both the measures and the timetable in the radicals program are unrealistic, 
Abalkin said, arguing that it is "simply impossible to restructure everything 
in weeks, months and maybe even years." 
</P>
<P>
Abalkin suggested that the radicals' proposals, dubbed the Shatalin Program 
after Gorbachev adviser Stanislav S. Shatalin, the principal author, amount to 
little more than what in American politics a few years ago might have been 
called voodoo economics. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being assured that there is a miraculous means -- and our people 
trust and believe in miracles -- by which they can move forward without plan, 
sacrifice or shocks, without decreasing their standard of living or increasing 
prices," Abalkin said. 
</P>
<P>
"In such crisis situations, people begin to believe en masse in all sorts of 
things -- extraterrestrial beings, UFOs, extrasensory phenomena. The 500-day 
program also contains a certain mysterious element. The idea of its miraculous 
power has been pushed consistently into the mass consciousness, but nobody has 
seen it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, "People are not ready to work in new conditions. 
Political instability in society, the activity of certain (political) forces, 
growing national separatism should also be kept in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"All this leads us to conclude," Abalkin said, "that if we move too fast and do 
not consider the possible consequences, it can result in a greater crisis in 
the economy and kill any desire to attempt reforms in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
The government has specific, realistic plans for a step-by-step transition to a 
market economy, he said. Among the immediate measures are increased prices for 
agricultural produce in an effort to stimulate the production of food and of 
some raw materials for industry. 
</P>
<P>
Embattled with calls countrywide for his resignation, Ryzhkov acknowledged the 
appeal that the radicals' proposals have because of their promise of swift 
improvement in the current economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government is convinced that its approach is correct, it is 
willing to discuss the speed and ways that a market economy is developed to 
replace that which the state has run for seven decades, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, we will come to some compromise," Ryzhkov said. "We have to take 
both programs and try to put them together." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov said that another basic difference, in addition to the speed of change, 
between his program and that of the radicals is the political character of the 
Soviet Union in the future as a federal state. 
</P>
<P>
While he envisions "a strong, united sovereign state" made up of constituent 
republics, the radicals believe it should be "a kind of an economic union of 
completely independent states united on the basis of certain interests," 
Ryzhkov said. 
</P>
<P>
"This profoundly changes the approach to our country's future," he said. "Our 
concept is based on the assumption of building an economy that would unite the 
country and enable us to take advantage of our vast territory and riches." 
</P>
<P>
The Shatalin plan is "essentially based on the recognition of the liquidation 
of the Soviet Union as a state," Abalkin said, arguing that it would no longer 
be a political but an economic union like that of the European Community or 
Comecon, the socialist trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
But the radicals continued to seek support for their fast-change approach. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are late, we will lose everything," said Mikhail Poltoranin, the 
information minister for the Russian Federation, which has already adopted the 
500-day program. "We are coming closer to 1991 and, as far as I know, the 
expected deficit in the state budget will grow to 340 billion rubles ($544 
billion at official exchange rates). That is our death."

KENYA'S PRESIDENT READY TO ACCEPT BRITISH REPORT ON OFFICIAL'S KILLING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Daniel Arap Moi on Sunday moved to end the Kenya government's 
dithering over a Scotland Yard investigation of the killing of Foreign Minister 
Robert J. Ouko by ordering his attorney general to accept the investigation 
report from British authorities. 
</P>
<P>
But he made no evident move toward assuring that the report's conclusions will 
be made public. 
</P>
<P>
The report was completed several weeks ago by Detective Supt. John Troon, whose 
British investigating team spent four months in Kenya this year trying to 
determine the circumstances of Ouko's death. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Atty. Gen. Matthew G. Muli has refused to receive the 
document except from Troon personally. He rejected as "unethical and 
unprecedented" such alternatives as its delivery in Nairobi by the British 
Ambassador to Kenya. Troon, as it happens, is scheduled to retire from Scotland 
Yard this week. 
</P>
<P>
The extended controversy over how to transmit Scotland Yard's findings has 
encouraged speculation that the investigation implicates government officials, 
possibly even members of the Moi Cabinet, in Ouko's death. 
</P>
<P>
Ouko's broken and charred remains were found Feb. 16 near his home in western 
Kenya, after his family reported that he had been missing for three days. An 
urbane and rapidly rising politician, Ouko was said to have had a serious 
falling-out with Moi just before his death. 
</P>
<P>
The Kenya police initially suggested that the death was a suicide, sparking 
days of demonstrations around the country accusing the police of covering up a 
political murder. Kenya's appeal as a member of the British Commonwealth for 
Scotland Yard's assistance quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Sunday, Moi recalled that when Ouko's body was discovered "I 
assured (the public) that my government will exercise its best endeavor to 
investigate the incident." However, he gave no indication that he intends the 
report, easily the most eagerly anticipated government document here this year, 
to be made public.

P.F. WESTBROOK; KEY PARTNER IN L.A. LAW FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip Fulmer Westbrook, key litigation partner for the O'Melveny &amp; Myers 
law firm for four decades, has died. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Westbrook died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of a ruptured aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Duluth, Minn., Westbrook earned bachelor's and law degrees at the 
University of Michigan. He served as a Navy officer in World War II and joined 
O'Melveny in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Among Westbrook's major cases was his successful defense of Occidental 
Petroleum against Armour &amp; Co. in a 48-day trial over trade secrets used in 
the manufacture of super-phosphoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
"In one afternoon of cross-examination, Phil destroyed Armour's expert witness, 
a key turning point in the case," recalled O'Melveny colleague Everett B. 
Clary. "Interestingly, Phil had outlined the questions he intended to ask this 
witness on a paper napkin during the lunch hour. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In his Hollywood cases, Clary said, Westbrook extricated entertainer Ricky 
Nelson from a bad contract, and was fired by legendary actress Mary Pickford 
when he refused to follow her orders, which he considered unethical. 
</P>
<P>
Westbrook won $400,000 for a Philippine financier in a counter-suit against 
producer Albert Zugsmith over a film that was never made, and then married his 
key witness, actress Fay Spain. Miss Spain died a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
After his semi-retirement in 1985, he served on the board of the Western Center 
on Law and Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Before marrying Miss Spain, Westbrook had been married to Julie Chockley, the 
mother of his children Stephen, Lloyd, Catherine and Lida. He is survived by 
his current wife, the former Zoya Trirogoff, the four children and another son, 
Joe Lazaro, and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday at Westwood Hill Congregational 
Church.

A former Green Beret imprisoned for illegally stockpiling millions of dollars 
of ammunition in Thailand claims that his superiors approved the illegal cache. 
In a letter to the San Francisco Examiner, Edward Gleason, once a top sergeant 
for the 80-man Green Beret unit in Thailand, said high-ranking army officers in 
the 1st Battalion of the 1st U.S. Special Forces Group gave him permission to 
collect a stash of bullets and explosives that filled a bunker 250 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Officers have denied knowledge of the stockpile. But Gleason said he repeatedly 
briefed both his battalion commanders and officers in the U.S. Military 
Assistance Group headquarters in Bangkok about the stockpile, the paper 
reported. Gleason, a Vietnam War hero now serving seven years for plotting to 
kill a Green Beret captain, said he doubts the Army's claim that the illegal 
cache was blown up in 1989.

CENTER FOR COUNTY WORKERS' SICK CHILDREN MAY CLOSE FOR LACK OF USE; 
</P>
<P>
DAY CARE: ONLY FOUR YOUNGSTERS HAVE BEEN CARED FOR THIS MONTH AT HICKORY 
DICKORY DOC, WHICH COST $11,000 TO SET UP. IT MAY BE SHARED WITH A PRIVATE 
COMPANY.

<P>
With much fanfare last year, county officials opened an innovative day-care 
center for employees to use when their children were ill. 
</P>
<P>
But now the county may shut down the brightly decorated bungalow in Ventura 
called Hickory Dickory Doc. The county's approximately 8,000 employees use it 
so rarely that often no children show up for care. 
</P>
<P>
"The usage is almost nil," said Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who proposed the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The center is designed for mildly ill children and is located behind Ventura 
County Medical Center, which provides a licensed practical nurse. The center is 
open weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for children 3 months to 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
But most days the center is closed because no children are brought in for care. 
It has never operated at full capacity -- six children. Only four children have 
been cared for so far this month. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the low usage, county supervisors plan to consider an agreement 
Tuesday allowing a large Ventura company to share Hickory Dickory Doc with the 
ill children of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaefer said she has reservations about such an arrangement with Lost 
Arrow, the parent company for Patagonia, Great Pacific Ironworks and Great 
Pacific Child Development. 
</P>
<P>
"I have questions about whether we should even continue, much less enter a 
contract with a private company," she said. "We're subsidizing county 
employees. I don't think we should subsidize a private child-care program with 
public money." 
</P>
<P>
She raised the possibility of converting it from a place for sick children to a 
traditional day-care center for well infants of county employees. She said the 
county has a waiting list of 20 employees who need such care. 
</P>
<P>
The center was set up as an experiment to find out if employees would use it, 
Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at it again before we go on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When it opened the center in the spring of 1989, Ventura County was hailed as a 
pioneer at a time of growing interest in child care by governmental agencies 
and private companies. It's the first government-operated program of its kind 
in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, according to Schaefer's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the county hoped it would reduce the $360,000 it pays in sick 
leave each year. In a survey of child-care needs conducted by the county's 
personnel staff, about 68% of those responding favored establishing a facility 
for mildly ill children. 
</P>
<P>
Why it wasn't used more is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't need it," Schaefer said. She also reasoned that perhaps parents 
preferred to stay home with their sick children. The county allows employees to 
use sick leave for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of thing that sounds great on paper," Schaefer said, but doesn't 
work in reality. 
</P>
<P>
One county employee, who asked not to be identified, praised the concept but 
said he and his wife have never needed to use it when their daughter was sick. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good excuse for one of us to stay home," he said. "It's a chance for 
some quiet time." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor may be the cost. The center charges $2 to $3 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said county employees knew about the center, and many attended an open 
house when the program started. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who used Hickory Dickory Doc liked it, Schaefer said. It looks much 
like a typical day-care center. Geared for quiet activity, the center has 
games, books and a big-screen television. In one corner, little chairs surround 
a blackboard. Cardboard blocks are stacked up next to a plastic tunnel that 
children can crawl through. Pink cribs and cots are positioned in secluded 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
In the front room are two big easy chairs, a mound of beanbag chairs and a 
child's rocker. Meals can be prepared in a kitchen or brought in on trays from 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
When there are no sick children to care for, the nurse assigned to the center 
works in another area of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The county spent $11,000 to get the program started. Most of the furnishings 
were donated. Ventura County Medical Center officials were unable on Friday to 
say how much the center costs to operate on an annual basis, nor were they able 
to say how many children have used it since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said fees paid by parents don't come close to paying for the nurses 
who are on call to work in the center. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie Erickson said "I hate to give up" on the center, which 
required a year of planning. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be careful about subsidizing child care," Erickson said. "But maybe 
by adding Patagonia it can become more self-supporting." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Garaway, Lost Arrow's child-care coordinator, had no explanation for the 
low usage of Hickory Dickory Doc by county employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents don't change child-care routines easily," she said. As for her 
company, she said, "The need is there, and the interest is there."

<P>
An Oxnard man was killed by a hit-and-run driver while walking across Saviers 
Road early Sunday, an Oxnard police spokesman said. A witness's tip led to the 
arrest of a suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Hernandez, 28, suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at St. 
John's Regional Medical Center after the 12:30 a.m. accident, Deputy Coroner 
Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was crossing Saviers Road near Date Street in an area where there is 
no crosswalk and was struck by a pickup truck, Sgt. Ken Nishihara said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver sped away, Nishihara said, but a witness followed the pickup for a 
short while before stopping at a pay phone to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Police immediately broadcast a description of the vehicle, and minutes later a 
California Highway Patrol officer stopped Jose Antonio Mejia in his pickup on 
the Ventura Freeway at Las Posas Road in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect put up no resistance, Nishihara said. 
</P>
<P>
Mejia, 22, of Oxnard was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and 
felony hit-and-run and was released on $10,000 bail. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

CAR CRASH TRAPS SOVIET EMIGRE BRIDE

A Soviet woman who came to the United States three weeks ago to get married was 
trapped inside a car for 30 minutes after her new husband lost control of his 
vehicle on U.S. 101 just south of the Santa Barbara County line. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Elina Levinson, 25, suffered minor injuries in the accident, which 
occurred about 8:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She was treated at Ventura County Medical Center and was released. The driver, 
26-year -- old Alex Gilshteyn of West Hollywood, was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Gilshteyn, who came to the United States as a Soviet Jewish refugee about three 
years ago, said he was glad the accident didn't happen in the Soviet Union. 
"Everything was fine, the emergency people arrived in a couple of minutes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, an emergency can take one or two hours, and if it's a Saturday or 
Sunday, all the doctors are busy." 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said Gilshteyn was driving north on the highway 
about 60 m.p.h. when he changed lanes and lost control of his Volvo. The car 
flipped three times before landing on the opposite side of the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
Gilshteyn was unharmed, but his wife was trapped in the passenger's seat about 
30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to cut through the car to get her out," said Capt. Hal Moore of the 
Ventura County Fire Department, who was involved in the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Gilshteyn, an optician at a West Hollywood clinic, said the accident turned out 
to be "a good experience. The attitude of the people was very friendly."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD ISSUE SHOULD CITY CHANGE ITS NAME?; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD, INCORPORATED AS A CITY JUNE 30, 1903, WAS NAMED FOR BROTHERS HENRY, 
JAMES, ROBERT AND BENJAMIN OXNARD, WHO BUILT A SUGAR FACTORY. THE AREA WAS 
FORMERLY CALLED KASUNALMU (THE SENDING PLACE) AND PLEASANT VALLEY. THE CITY 
MOTTO IS "MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY NAME." SHOULD THE CITY CHANGE ITS NAME?;

We don't need to change the name; we need to change people's attitude and think 
positively about it. I would encourage our resort operators when they're 
talking to potential customers about their amenities to remind them that it's 
in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Then Oxnard will be associated with beaches and rich agriculture and 
recreation, instead of the dingy little farm town it was 20 years ago. 
Out-of-towners who haven't been here for awhile come back and say they can't 
believe the changes we've made in Oxnard. If they had a referendum on a name 
change, I think the name Oxnard would win, based on civic pride. Besides, 
changing the name of a city would be a massive undertaking, what with having to 
change the letterhead and signage, for instance. We could add Santa to our name 
and be Santa Oxnard. The thing that I like about the word Oxnard is that once 
you tell people the name, they never forget it.

CSUN TRIES TO COPE WITH $6.6-MILLION CUT; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGETS: UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS AIM AT KEEPING ENROLLMENT UP WHILE REDUCING 
COSTS, FEARING A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF REDUCTIONS AND MORE DROPOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Grappling with a nearly $6.6-million state funding cut, Cal State Northridge 
administrators are trying to strike a delicate balance between shaving off 
excess and slashing so deeply into the curriculum that enrollment drops, which 
could trigger more budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
But administrators say that balance will probably tilt in the spring, 
especially if state revenues are lower than expected because of a recession or 
a decline in lottery revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that a lot of us are holding our breath on is the revenue 
projections," said Bonita Campbell, associate vice president for academic 
planning and resources. "I don't think we could handle a midterm cut without 
actually going into a layoff of long-term, full-time employees." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond edicts from college President James W. Cleary that departments cancel 
low-enrollment classes and restrict faculty travel and supply expenditures, the 
decisions about where to cut largely have been left to deans of the individual 
schools and the chairmen of the departments. 
</P>
<P>
So far, their solutions have included laying off part-time instructors, 
reducing library hours and delaying faculty research projects, all with an eye 
toward maintaining the courses students want and need the most. 
</P>
<P>
Offering fewer class sections sets off a chain reaction: As fewer class 
sections are offered, students have a harder time fitting the course they need 
or want into their schedules, which in turn lowers enrollment figures on which 
funding is based. 
</P>
<P>
"It does get into a Catch-22," Campbell said. "You're expected to take care of 
the same number of students, provide them with the same level of services, but 
without the resources that are needed to maintain that level of service. When 
you add it up, something doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The first and most visible change from the students' perspective was that 
neither the Oviatt Library nor the South Library are open on Sundays this 
semester, except during final exams. Campbell said user surveys showed that on 
Sundays the libraries were frequented more by the college's neighbors than by 
its students. However, when the proportion of the school's population living on 
campus grows with the opening of new dormitories next year, that is expected to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, the effects of the cuts have begun to be seen. Professors 
have been admonished by their department chairmen to charge students for copies 
whenever possible, to help meet the 15% cut in supply budgets. Computers and 
laboratory equipment that break down probably will not be repaired or replaced 
this year, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
And faculty members are working harder. Administrators report that in many 
areas, professors whose teaching loads had been reduced to give them time for 
research or administrative duties were instead asked to return to the full 
four-class load. Meanwhile, some of the part-time faculty members who normally 
would have filled in for those full-timers learned shortly before the start of 
the fall semester that they would not be teaching at all. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's budget this year was initially projected to include $118 million in 
state funding plus $31.6 million from student fees and other campus sources. 
Current state estimates call for cutting the state portion by $6.56 million -- 
resulting in a 4.4% reduction overall, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cut was slightly smaller than what was predicted by the California 
State University system in August, that is of little consolation to faculty. 
They said the most recent round of cuts comes after years of budgets that have 
fallen short of both inflation and the growth of the student body. 
</P>
<P>
"The faculty feels ripped off. . . . You really try to do a good job and those 
things that allow you to do that are being taken away from you," said Nancy 
Owens, a member of the university system's Academic Senate and a professor of 
home economics at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Systemwide, the budget for supporting the 20 state universities declined from 
nearly $1.8 billion to about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Approaches to handling the cuts vary around the state, CSU spokesman Stephen J. 
McCarthy said. Probably the most drastic measures were taken at San Francisco 
State, where he said about 100 part-time lecturers were laid off and about 200 
class sections were cut. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few systemwide changes made to help offset the skimpier state budget 
were a 10% increase in student tuition -- to $780 a year for full-time students 
who are California residents and $10,025 for non-residents -- and an 
across-the-board 5% reduction in management personnel spending. 
</P>
<P>
Also, for the first time this year at CSUN and the other campuses, a 
significant portion of such essential expenses as library books and periodicals 
and instructional equipment is being financed with state lottery money. In the 
past, most lottery money was reserved for such optional expenses as pilot 
programs and guest lecturers. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty and administrators are concerned about the switch and what it could 
mean if lottery money declines by 20% to 25%, as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very scary," Owens said. "What happens when the lottery revenue drops?" 
</P>
<P>
"I've done this for a while, seen budgets come and go, but this is the worst 
budget I've ever seen," said William Eadie, chairman of the popular speech 
communications department. 
</P>
<P>
Eadie is teaching two classes instead of his normal load of one, in addition to 
running the department and editing a national journal. Two other faculty 
members in his department abandoned research projects -- at least temporarily 
-- to resume a full teaching load, and fewer faculty will be able to travel to 
professional conferences this year. 
</P>
<P>
For the spring, Eadie hopes to avoid cutting the number of classes by 
increasing their size instead. 
</P>
<P>
In at least two other popular areas, philosophy and business, administrators 
also have held off making more drastic cuts until the spring, largely to avoid 
inconveniencing students and faculty. Even with the current budget, they expect 
to cancel several classes in the spring. If the state funds are cut even 
further midyear, "we're really going to wince," said William Hosek, dean of the 
School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in departments that offer the courses required for graduation hit 
students especially hard. Philosophy, for instance, has a 500-student waiting 
list for introductory logic courses, said Chairman Daniel Sedey. Faculty 
members say that students often cannot take logic and the other general 
education requirements until their senior year. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, many CSUN students have cross-enrolled at community colleges to 
take those classes, Sedey said. But the Los Angeles Community College District 
also has felt the impact of the state budget deficit, causing Valley community 
colleges to cancel hundreds of classes.

GANG SETUP SUSPECTED IN SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One North Hollywood teen-ager was killed and a second critically wounded early 
Sunday in a shooting police described as an apparent setup by rival gang 
members, who tricked the victims into believing they belonged to a friendly 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Joseph Solis, 19, was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting from 
multiple bullet wounds to the chest, Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Vojtecky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sayeed Fayad, also 19, was taken to an area hospital, where he was listed in 
critical but stable condition, Vojtecky said. He refused to identify the 
medical facility out of concern that the attackers might try to hunt Fayad 
down. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 3:30 a.m. in an alley behind the 13100 block of 
Victory Boulevard, where the victims and about six other members of their gang 
were loitering, Vojtecky said. The alley is known as a gathering spot for gang 
members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three youths drove up and began exchanging words and phrases with the victims' 
group in an apparent attempt to confuse them into thinking the newcomers were 
members of an allied gang, Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of friendly passwords "put them all at ease" and the victims 
approached the car to talk, Vojtecky said. Suddenly, according to witnesses, 
the driver produced a handgun and without provocation opened fire on the group, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the three assailants drove away, one yelled out the name of a rival gang, 
Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a setup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said police have no suspects but are trying to talk to members of the 
gang whose name was shouted from the car. He refused to identify the groups in 
question, saying it was Police Department policy not to give gangs publicity.

<P>
When the state's power brokers carved out California's congressional districts 
a decade ago, the high-desert city of Palmdale in north Los Angeles County was 
an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Palmdale has been unrepresented in the U.S. Congress. On the contrary, 
the 65,000 residents of the fast-growing city are in the extraordinary position 
of having three congressmen watch out for their interests. 
</P>
<P>
For these lawmakers, however, Palmdale represents only a tiny percentage of 
their constituencies. Each of their home offices -- and the majority of their 
respective districts -- range from 30 to 65 miles away. Even the congressmen 
themselves concede that figuring out who represents which neighborhoods can be 
difficult, and the City Hall staffer who refers residents to the respective 
lawmakers said last week that she had never heard of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, as far as good government is concerned, it probably would be 
best if all of it were in one district," said Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale), who represents Palmdale along with Reps. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) 
and David Dreier (R-Covina). "They'd feel a little closer." 
</P>
<P>
As the decennial redrawing of election districts approaches, many officials and 
activists in Palmdale agree. They maintain that a single officeholder 
representing the area would have greater incentive to focus on the region's 
defense, transportation and environmental concerns and pour more time and staff 
resources into the city. 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment applies equally to the entire Antelope Valley, which is split 
among the three congressmen who represent Palmdale, plus Rep. William M. Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield), whose district includes neighboring Lancaster. Some officials 
see this political drawing and quartering as an extension of the lack of 
respect they perceive at the state and county levels. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees, however, that the valley would be better off under one 
congressional roof. Some argue, in fact, that limited shares of four lawmakers 
are actually better than substantial stock in one. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had something I was trying to get through Congress, I would rather have 
four votes than one," said ex-Assemblyman Larry Chimbole. He added that calls 
for a home-grown congressman are often "the typical provincial thinking of 
these areas, the rah-rah viewpoint. I don't think the valley has suffered or 
been victimized at all." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most of those interviewed spoke well of the four legislators. 
Nevertheless, many said that the region -- which relies heavily on Edwards Air 
Force Base and defense contracts -- has an emerging identity and a political 
significance that merit a hometown voice in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are in the corner of the district, the attention is not the same as if 
you were in the center of the district," said Palmdale Mayor William J. (Pete) 
Knight, who cited efforts to win a rail link from Palmdale to the San Fernando 
Valley as one issue on which a locally based congressman could exert influence. 
"You have a limited number of voters and a limited amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale officials are not alone in such views. A study by the Rose Institute 
at Claremont McKenna College in 1980 found that a convincing majority of local 
government officials did not want their municipalities divided among state 
legislative or congressional districts, according to Alan Heslop, who teaches 
classes in government at the college and is an expert on reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt their power would be greatest if they had a one-to-one, unshared 
relationship," Heslop said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, at least 29 cities are divided among two or more legislators. The 
California Constitution calls for congressional districts to respect city and 
county boundaries "insofar as practical." It does not prohibit splitting them 
when deemed necessary. 
</P>
<P>
No one can yet predict how the state Legislature and governor will reapportion 
California following the 1990 census. But experts say that the Antelope 
Valley's threefold population growth in the past decade makes its consolidation 
as a cornerstone of a new congressional district likely. 
</P>
<P>
None expects a repeat of 1982, when the valley's small population, political 
homogeneity and location on the border of three counties led the Democratic 
line-drawers to carve it up to fill the population requirements of surrounding 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the griping, Thomas maintains this has often turned out to be in 
the valley's interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Antelope Valley gets the best representation of any area in 
California," said Thomas, who represented the entire valley prior to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place else in California that has direct representation on Ways and 
Means, Energy and Commerce, Appropriations and Banking," Thomas said, referring 
to powerful House committees. "We can utilize resources that no one member 
could ever utilize. But, on a day-to-day basis, it's perceived as a negative 
because, 'Nobody's looking out for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
All four lawmakers are senior conservatives and consistent proponents of the 
1980s defense build-up and the development of high-tech weapons programs, such 
as the B-1 bomber and the B-2 Stealth bomber, work on both of which has been 
done in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lewis ranks third in the House GOP leadership, and Moorhead is 
California's senior Republican. The districts the four represent are heavily 
Republican, as is the valley itself. 
</P>
<P>
When NASA proposed moving construction of the next space shuttle orbiter from 
Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale to Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc in 1987, 
the valley lawmakers -- led by Lewis and Thomas -- pooled their clout to block 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to four against one," said John Doherty, a senior aide to Rep. 
Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who was pushing for relocating the shuttle 
to his district, which includes Vandenberg. "It probably was one of the factors 
in that instance." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale City Manager Robert Toone agreed that the lawmakers have often teamed 
up for the city's benefit. He cited the space shuttle effort as well as $5.7 
million in Air Force funds obtained this year for widening congested Avenue M 
near Plant 42. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Knight said it took the city four years to get the road 
money. He maintains that more concentrated congressional pressure could have 
speeded the process. 
</P>
<P>
And even Lewis challenges the notion that Palmdale has triple the clout. He 
blames city officials for failing to come up with a game plan to mobilize the 
three lawmakers who represent the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been confusion about who you go to for x and y instead of going to 
everybody," Lewis said. He added that this has combined with "a lack of coming 
together so that Palmdale hasn't gotten the benefit of having all these 
members." 
</P>
<P>
Each lawmaker says he gets to the Antelope Valley as often as he can. But these 
visits are limited by distance and competing demands elsewhere in their 
districts and in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who represents more valley residents than the other three lawmakers 
combined, is the only one with a full-time district operation in the region. 
(Dreier has a part-time field office.) Thomas' office, which he calls "a 
vestigial remain" of the days when his district included the entire valley, is 
in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Moorhead, whose 22nd District includes the portion of Palmdale west of Sierra 
Highway, has offices in Glendale and Pasadena. He represents about 40,000 
valley residents, 6% of his total district. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who represents the other half of Palmdale, hails from San Bernardino 
County, which makes up most of his 35th District. His Redlands district office 
is about 55 miles from Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier was given the valley communities of Pearblossom and Littlerock when his 
33rd District was created in 1982. He later gained a small part of southeastern 
Palmdale when the expanding city annexed unincorporated territory within his 
district. The sliver of the Antelope Valley he represents is a 1 1/2-hour drive 
from his district office in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' sprawling 20th District extends into Kern and San Luis Obispo counties 
and throughout Inyo County. His 150,000 valley constituents represent only 20% 
of the population in his 21,000-square-mile district. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the valley in the past decade -- Palmdale, which had only 
12,297 residents in 1980, has grown by 432% -- combined with an apparent 
paucity of reliable, detailed maps, has created some confusion over exactly who 
represents which communities. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lewis and Dreier said they believe that Thomas still represents part of 
Palmdale. Although a finger of his district extends south past Palmdale into 
Saugus, he no longer represents any of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us actually have in our minds where those lines are," Lewis conceded. 
"I've yet to see a precise map of Palmdale" showing the congressional 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier says there is so much uncertainty about the lines that he responds to 
mail and constituent cases from throughout Palmdale, dispensing with the 
tradition of "bumping" letters or calls from other districts to that member's 
office. "They probably wrote all four of us and asked for our response," Dreier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when a reporter called Palmdale City Hall for information about 
congressional district boundaries, the administrative secretary who handles 
such inquiries said that Moorhead represented the city west of Sierra Highway 
and Lewis represented those to the east. Asked about Dreier, she replied, 
"Who's that?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion and inconvenience, there are political advantages to the 
incumbent in such geographical setups. 
</P>
<P>
A district that spans more than one county or splits cities protects an 
incumbent congressman by diluting the political base of a mayor or county 
supervisor with higher aspirations, said Heslop of Claremont McKenna College. 
This also affords the incumbent access to local contributors in more than one 
city or county. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the incumbents prefer the status quo, the population explosion 
in the Antelope Valley, as well as in neighboring Kern and San Bernardino 
counties, assures major changes when the new lines are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some valley activists envision a high-desert district that would stretch from 
the Antelope Valley east to Victorville and north to Barstow. They maintain 
that a district encompassing vast desert areas that identify with each other 
would be a logical "community of interest." 
</P>
<P>
"We are a different breed," said Lancaster Councilman Arnie Rodio, who was 
instrumental in forming the Desert and Mountains Division of the California 
League of Cities. "We have water problems, toxic waste dumps, sludge getting 
trucked up from other areas. . . . We would have someone pushing our issues." 
</P>
<P>
Even if a consensus forms that one member of Congress for the valley is ideal, 
there is little that proponents can do to make this happen. The state 
Legislature, with the governor's approval, has the final word in a complex, 
high-stakes redistricting process that is largely brokered in political back 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
As Democrats and Republicans vie over coveted seats, their only legal 
constraints are ensuring that each district has the same number of voters 
(expected to be 572,000 in 1992) and that minorities are not discriminated 
against. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the anvil of equal population on which this nut is cracked," said 
Thomas, one of the GOP's reapportionment leaders. "Not the rational idea of 
representation." 
</P>

the Antelope Valley.

<TEXT>
<P>
A.J. Foyt, the winningest driver in Indy-car racing, was badly injured Sunday 
when his car went off the rolling four-mile, 11-turn Road America course on the 
24th lap of the Texaco-Havoline 200. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt's condition was upgraded from serious to satisfactory after he entered the 
trauma unit at Milwaukee General Hospital, where he was treated for a broken 
left knee, broken left heel and dislocated right foot by Dr. Terry Trammell, 
Director of Medical Services for CART. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt's accident occurred on his 24th lap of the 50-lap, 200-mile race when his 
Lola-Chevrolet was racing in 14th place alongside Dominic Dobson as they 
approached the end of the straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Foyt went off the track before entering the first turn, drove over a 
shoulder and into a grassy depression. The accident crushed the front of the 
car in on Foyt, 55, and, after a small grass fire was extinguished, CART safety 
workers took more than 15 minutes to cut him loose. 
</P>
<P>
After being stabilized at the scene, he was transported by helicopter to the 
hospital, about 60 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"His vital signs are stable and have been stable throughout the entire 
episode," said Dr. Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART. "He's 
awake and alert and talking." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Thraap, publicist for the Foyt racing team, said from the hospital that 
Foyt likely will be in the facility for a day or two before being transported 
to Indianapolis for further care. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me 'I'll be back,' " Thraap said while answering questions about 
Foyt's future in racing. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the crash was not immediately known, but Dobson said: "It looks 
like to me he lost some brakes. We were side by side. I was on the inside, and 
he was on the outside. I braked at my normal point, but he kept going straight. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw some smoke, so he might have locked up the front (brakes). I saw him go 
over the side. At that point, it looks like you're at the end of the universe. 
The next time by, I noticed some skid marks." 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he elected to hit the fence (at the end of the straightaway) 
because 'if we had gone into the corner, we would have gone upside-down,' " 
Thraap said. 
</P>
<P>
The race was red-flagged on lap 33 to remove Foyt from the track, and cars were 
off the course for nearly 90 minutes. When they returned, pole-sitter Danny 
Sullivan was leading, but Michael Andretti inherited that top spot six laps 
later when Sullivan's gearbox broke. Andretti held off Emerson Fittipaldi to 
win by 2.04 seconds, with Rick Mears finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
Andretti's victory was his second in a row and fifth of the season. He won 
$76,054 for averaging 106.192 m.p.h., but his victory celebration was muted. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to God he'll be all right," Andretti said of Foyt. "He's a legend and 
I'm sorry something like this has happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
Foyt leads all Indy-car drivers with 67 victories, the last of which came in 
1981 at the Pocono 500. He has been badly injured several times, including a 
crash in the inaugural Michigan 500, in 1981, in which he broke his right arm, 
and a stock car crash last year at Charlotte, N.C., in which he suffered a 
serious concussion. 
</P>
<P>
He also has broken his back twice, broken his feet, cracked ribs and suffered 
burns, but each time has returned to a racing career that began in 1957 and 
includes seven Indy-car championships and four Indianapolis 500 victories.

END OF HIS BAN ONLY STARTS THE QUESTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: MARKETABILITY OF BEN JOHNSON AFTER SUSPENSION FOR STEROID USE 
POSES A GAMBLE FOR PROMOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson. Almost. The media 
were there, as before, chronicling a news conference. Johnson was as before, 
shy and yet brimming with confidence. There was the bluster, the bragging, the 
promise of big things to come. 
</P>
<P>
This scene, which played out two weeks ago in Italy, was familiar, with one 
exception. The new element was the pervasive skepticism that now attends 
Johnson's boasts. Overweening confidence among world class athletes is well 
accepted -- even expected. However, part of the expectation includes the 
understanding that the athlete can back up the boasts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson will at last get his chance to do that. It has been two years since 
Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal 
after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics. Johnson was 
also suspended from competition for two years; that suspension ends today. And 
so the questions begin: What can Johnson do when not assisted by 
performance-enhancing drugs? 
</P>
<P>
"Once he returns to the sport, and if he returns a winner, all is forgiven," 
said Paul Gaines, assistant meet director for the Hamilton Spectator Indoor 
Games, the Canadian meet to be held Jan. 11 that will mark Johnson's return to 
competition. "I think that is the attitude the public will display. You hear 
grumblings among media types and in some circles of the sport, but you have to 
give the guy the benefit of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"When this happened, it was a bitter disappointment for everyone in the sport 
to acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs. With the 
accolades cast upon him in the previous years, people were resentful. With the 
humility and shame that has been reflected on him, people tend to be more open 
minded about it. They hope the guy comes back clean and fast." 
</P>
<P>
Clean and fast. To some in track and field that represents a contradiction in 
terms. It is this apparent contradiction that Ben Johnson must overcome in his 
comeback. Charlie Francis, who coached Johnson for 12 years, estimated that 
steroids made Johnson faster by one meter. How much ground will Johnson lose as 
a drug-free sprinter? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, speaking at a news conference in Castelfranco Veneto, Italy, expressed 
little doubt he can regain his form of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take back the titles and the records I have been deprived of," the 
Associated Press quoted Johnson as saying. "I have been training very hard 
recently. I am at 90% right now. By strengthening training, I will be 100% by 
January. I have decided to start again to show everybody I'm still the best. 
I'm convinced I can set a new world record." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG MONEY 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of indoor meets this season doubt that Johnson will regain his 
records, but they hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him 
try. Indeed, in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in 
general (as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in Seville, Spain, 
in March), Johnson's return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in 
need of public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Al Franken, promoter of the Sunkist Invitational, is close to signing Johnson 
for his Jan. 18 meet, saying Johnson will receive the highest appearance fee 
Franken has ever paid -- $30,000, compared to the $23,000 Franken paid Carl 
Lewis. And there is a bonus in the contract that rewards Johnson for high 
attendance figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity," Franken 
said. "You'll get people who don't care about track, and you may attract back 
people who have quit coming to track. We need a push in the sport. It's been 
struggling. We need a hype. Someone who is a ticket seller. Ben sort of 
transcends the sport, and, God knows, we need someone to transcend the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Transcendent is the word for the appearence fees Johnson will reportedly earn. 
His value in Europe and Japan has not waned. He will be paid $60,000 for a meet 
in Stockholm. But American meet directors say they can't pay that kind of 
money, especially for an unproven runner. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's eligible to compete, to me, Ben Johnson is an attraction," said Ray 
Lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, 
N.J.. "I'd like to have Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs. But how well 
he's running will determine his value. That's the key. Whether he is worth as 
much after six meets, I don't know. You're only as good as your last race, and 
the fans know that." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, 
but perhaps not the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great 
runner or if he is what Carl Lewis said he is, a fair runner who got there by 
taking drugs," Schmertz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing. As far as the money, I expect a lot of big stars and 
I'm going to have a lot of problems giving out (big appearence fees). If you 
give him $10,000 and people are beating him, you could have problems." 
</P>
<P>
Already the backlash has begun. There is talk of informal athlete boycotts in 
Canada, where indoor meets often provide car fare and little else to star 
athletes. Johnson reportedly will be paid $10,000 (Canadian) for the meet in 
Hamilton, a figure that has caused some jealousy among his peers. 
</P>
<P>
Lumpp, who traditionally has one of the largest budgets in North America, said 
resentment is a problem faced every season by meet directors. "How many heavy 
hitters can a meet afford?" he said. "There are very few secrets among 
athletes, especially when there's X dollars given to one athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton promoter Gaines has heard it before, and makes no apology for paying 
Johnson more than other athletes. "My answer to that is 'Who puts (fans) in the 
seats? Right now, I can't think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as 
Ben Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
It would be ironic if Johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and 
field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for 
that damage," Gaines said. "We are very cognizant of the fact that people are 
looking upon his return with something like skepticism and animosity. To what 
extent, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Some meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to 
be associated with a meet that has Johnson as its marquee athlete, given 
Johnson's former association with anabolic steroids. Franken said he had 
meetings with his sponsor, Sunkist, to discuss the possible image problem. 
</P>
<P>
Schmertz, too, has given the matter some thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had that thought myself, paying him that much money," he said. "He was 
the greatest sprinter in history, then he was caught. Now he's got a lot of 
notoriety. He probably thinks he can be paid more because of the notoriety. 
It's a very complicated issue. I don't know how the public is going to react. 
Are they going to treat him as someone who has paid his penalty and now he's 
clean? I don't know. These questions have gone through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Will Kern, meet director for the Times Indoor Games, hesitates at considering 
it a moral issue. "It's kind of perplexing, isn't it?," Kern said. "I'm not 
God. I can't say that it's wrong, especially when deep down I know Johnson's 
not the only one who's ever taken drugs." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that may not happen is a much-discussed lucrative match race between 
Johnson and Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never allow it to happen," Primo Nebiolo, president of the 
International Amateur Atheltic Federation, said Sunday. "We do not allow 
two-horse races." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A NEW CAST 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 28, has passed at least four drug tests during his suspension. He has 
been an outspoken opponent of drug use and has spent the last year speaking to 
children, warning them against performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those around Johnson have changed, too. Francis is no longer his coach, 
having been replaced by Loren Seagrave, former women's coach at Louisiana State 
University. Others in Johnson's inner circle are Larry Heidebrecht, his agent; 
Kameel Azan, a Jamaican-born Toronto businessman and former hairdresser who is 
Johnson's adviser; and Ed Futerman, Johnson's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The key words in the Johnson camp are Damage Control, or more simply, control. 
Futerman limits Johnson's contact with the media, saying "Ben has said all he 
has to say. We don't need any more media." However, it was Futerman who offered 
to permit a British journalist to interview Johnson -- if he paid $10,000 and 
submitted his questions in advance. Johnson gave an in-depth interview to the 
German magazine, Sport, but only after being paid. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, he has had a low profile. He still is awaiting word from the 
Canadian Olympic Assn., which placed a lifetime ban on Johnson that prohibited 
him from representing Canada in the Olympic Games. The COA will meet on Friday 
and is expected to lift the ban.

<P>
That may go a long way to easing Johnson back into a sport that disowned him 
almost as swiftly as he burst on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Johnson after his positive test in Seoul is similar to what 
used to happen to famous East Europeans after defection. Any trace of them in 
their former countries disappeared. They no longer existed. Similarly, Johnson 
was erased from track and field's record books. Not only did he have to give 
back the gold medal, but he lost two world records, causing the sport to change 
its rules in order to take them. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF voted last September to adopt the controversial "Ben Johnson Rule" 
allowing the IAAF Council to decertify an athlete's records, titles and results 
if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The action gave the IAAF power to erase all of Johnson's results between June 
12, 1983, and June 12, 1989. Even though Johnson admitted to having taken drugs 
since 1981, the rule carries a six-year statue of limitations. The rule 
stripped Johnson of his world record of 9.83 in the 100 meters and 6.41 in the 
indoor 60 meters. Already gone was the 9.79 race from the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The records are gone but not forgotten. The question remains, is Ben Johnson 
capable of running at that brilliant level again? Meet promoters are willing to 
pay to find out. If the public will pay to watch Johnson is another question. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lumpp of the Meadowlands, "You don't have just a track and field story 
here, you have a human interest story. Here's a person who has reached the top 
of everything, lost it all, and now he's coming back to run. Will he be the 
same Johnson? I don't know, but people are willing to find out."

A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL

</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Jim Breech, not known for long kicks, set an NFL scoring record 
with a 46-yard field goal that started the Bengals to a 41-7 victory over New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Breech's longest field goal of the season extended his consecutive- 
</P>
<P>
game scoring streak to 152, one better than Fred Cox of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The record kick came on the same field where Cox's streak ended on Dec. 2, 
1973, in a 27-0 Cincinnati victory. Cox missed a 49-yard attempt in that game, 
ending a streak that began in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Breech's kick came just two minutes into the game. "I wanted to get it over 
with quick," Breech said. "I didn't know it would be two minutes into the first 
quarter. It was nice that it came on a field goal, too." 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, Breech was unemployed. The Bengals cut him to keep Jim Gallery, 
who could kick from longer distances. But Gallery made just two of six kicks in 
the Bengals' first four games, prompting the Bengals to bring Breech back. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my career was done," Breech said, cradling the record ball in his 
left arm. "I feel it's a real blessing for me. Everything that happens from 
here on out is icing on the cake. If I can play for a few more years, that's 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Ottis Anderson of the Giants moved ahead of Earl Campbell to become the NFL's 
No. 8 rusher. Anderson had 72 yards against the Dolphins to give him 9,433 
career rushing yards. Campbell had 9,407. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig of the 49ers tied Walter Payton's record for career receptions by a 
running back in the second quarter of San Francisco's 19-13 victory over the 
Atlanta Falcons. Craig's second catch of the game gave him 492 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRIENDS AND FOES 
</P>
<P>
All week long Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer and Green Bay's Lindy 
Infante answered questions about their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
The two had masterminded the Cleveland Browns' drive to the AFC championship 
games in 1986 and 1987, Schottenheimer as the head coach and Infante as his 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Last December the Chiefs all but knocked the Packers out of the playoffs with a 
21-3 victory. Because Schottenheimer is familiar with Infante's offense, the 
Chiefs' defense apparently had an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really players against players," said Schottenheimer after a 17-3 Chiefs 
victory Sunday at Green Bay, Wis. "This business is strange. I had a number of 
people ask me before the game, 'Is it hard to get ready and prepare to play 
against somebody who is such a personal friend?' And I said 'No.' "And I 
believed that during the course of the week. But now that it's over, you know 
it's bittersweet. We want to win obviously. But I hadn't thought much about it 
until after the game. I certainly would feel a hell of a lot worse if it were 
on the other side of the ledger." 
</P>
<P>
Did the Kansas City defense have an advantage because Schottenheimer and 
Infante run much the same offense? "We didn't know their plays but we knew what 
to expect in certain situations," said defensive back Kevin Ross. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Mervyn Fernandez caught a 66-yard touchdown pass from Jay Schroeder moments 
after Marcus Allen scored on a one-yard run to help the Raiders draw away to a 
20-3 victory over the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Humphrey ran 26 yards on a draw play, setting up David Treadwell's 
25-yard field goal 9:14 into overtime to lift the Denver Broncos past the 
Seattle Seahawks, 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Butler's 52-yard field goal with four seconds remaining led the Chicago 
Bears to a 19-16 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.

INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Garry Lewis of the Raiders sustained a broken clavicle on the first 
series against the Steelers. He will be sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor apparently injured his left hamstring on the 
final play against Miami and his status for next Sunday's game with Dallas is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota quarterback Wade Wilson sprained his right thumb on the Vikings' 
final offensive play in a 19-16 loss to the Bears and might need surgery. Rich 
Gannon and Sean Salisbury are the backups. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Rypien of the Redskins sustained a sprained left knee in the 
second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys, forcing him to miss the rest of the 
game. X-rays taken at RFK Stadium showed Rypien did not break a bone. But he 
did not return and he'll be examined further. 
</P>
<P>
Third-year player Stan Humphries, the only other quarterback on the roster, 
took over after Rypien was hit by defensive tackle Dean Hamel while throwing a 
pass with two minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Four Cowboys left the Washington game with injuries. Defensive back Stan 
Smagala sustained a broken left forearm; quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a 
bruised thigh on the next-to-last play; guard John Gesek sprained his right 
elbow and offensive tackle Mark Tuinei sprained his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis lost all three of its quarterbacks to ailments in a 24-10 loss to 
the Houston Oilers. Starter Jeff George left in the second quarter with an 
undisclosed stomach ailment, Jack Trudeau injured his passing hand and 
third-stringer Mark Herrmann sustained a collarbone injury late in the fourth 
quarter, necessitating George's return. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Steve Broussard, the Falcons' 1990 No. 1 draft choice, suffered a 
sprained knee after a hit by Ronnie Lott late in the third quarter of the 49ers 
19-13 victory over the Falcons. He did not return.

BRONCOS' KAY CAN PLAY 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Sunday he has given Denver Bronco tight 
end Clarence Kay the go-ahead to continue playing despite his status as a 
three-time offender of the league's drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview on NBC-TV's halftime show, Tagliabue said: "Clarence 
should be permitted to play with the Broncos and I've informed the Broncos of 
that recently." 
</P>
<P>
Kay faced the possibility of a lifetime ban because of his conviction last 
September in Edgewater, Colo., for driving while impaired by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota defensive tackle Keith Millard, after Chicago rushed for 215 yards in 
a 19-16 victory over the Vikings: "Now that the Bears have established a 
running game, everybody is going to try to run on us." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka, after utilizing 43 rushing plays and only 16 passes: 
"If I think we have to run it 70 times a game to beat somebody, then we'll run 
it 70 times a game." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski, who was sacked six times in his first 
start of the season, a 17-3 loss to Kansas City. "I would sum it up as a tough 
day." 
</P>
<P>
New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells, asked why Lawrence Taylor, who pulled a 
hamstring, was in for the final play of the Giants' 20-3 victory over Dolphins. 
"That's a good question. I can't think for everyone here." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Coach Bud Carson, on the Browns' 24-14 loss to San Diego: "We did 
some things that are mind-boggling at this stage of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Coach Joe Bugel on New Orleans quarterback John Fourcade: "He's like a 
wild dog. You back him into a corner, and he comes out fighting." 
</P>
<P>
New England quarterback Marc Wilson, on the Patriots' 41-7 loss to Cincinnati: 
"Everything that could happen to us did today. Maybe that's good -- we got out 
everything that could go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Saint quarterback John Fourcade entered Sunday's contest against Phoenix with 
the NFL's lowest quarterback efficiency rating, 17.7. His opposite number, the 
Cardinals' Timm Rosenbach had a 35.4 rating, second lowest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
How did this clash of the titans go? Fourcade completed 11 of 23 passes for 151 
yards in the Saints' 28-7 victory. Rosenbach completed 14 of 26 passes for 191 
yards. 
</P>
<P>

Sunday's game against the Giants, gained nine yards on five carries. The 
Giants' defense held its opponent below 20 minutes of possession for the second 
week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson's 2-17 record in his second year in Dallas gives him half as many 
losses he had in 10 years of coaching Oklahoma State and the University of 
Miami, where his combined record was 81-34.

ROOKIE DOESN'T LEAVE RAIDERS HOLDING BAG; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: AARON WALLACE MAKES THE MOST OF HIS CHANCE WITH TWO SACKS WHILE 
PROVIDING PASS RUSH IN PLACE OF HOWIE LONG. TEAM INJURY LIST EXPANDS AS 
CORNERBACK GARRY LEWIS COULD BE OUT FOR SIX WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Rookie linebacker Aaron Wallace, the Raiders' second-round draft pick, was 
nicknamed "Sackman" at Texas A&amp;M, where he set a school record with 42 
quarterback sacks, including 10 1/2 last season. 
</P>
<P>
After Wallace made four sacks in an exhibition game at Chicago last month, the 
Raiders expected a big contribution to their defense. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wallace didn't play much in the Raiders' first two regular-season 
games, he was used as their designated pass rusher in Sunday's game against the 
Pittsburgh Steelers because of an injury to defensive end Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace sacked Steeler quarterback Bubby Brister twice for 13 yards in losses 
as the Raiders rendered the Steeler offense disfunctional with a 20-3 victory 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime Howie Long is out you're going to miss him," Wallace said. "I was just 
trying to get in there and hold up my end." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace's first sack almost set up a touchdown late in the first half when he 
tackled Brister for a nine-yard loss at the Pittsburgh 31, forcing a fumble. 
Raider defensive end Scott Davis tried to scoop the ball and run, but couldn't 
hold onto it and Steeler tackle Tunch Ilkin recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace's second sack came when he raced around the left side of the Steeler 
line and tackled Brister for a four-yard loss late in the third period to force 
a punt. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaron is a big play player," Coach Art Shell said. "He has the ability to rush 
the passer and he showed that today." 
</P>
<P>
Employed at right defensive end in the Raiders' nickle defense, Wallace almost 
got another sack, but Brister got the ball away before Wallace flattened him. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now you don't want to tell him to do too much because he's a young guy," 
Raider noseguard Bob Golic said of Wallace. "You just tell him to get out there 
and use his speed and quickness to get to the quarterback and that's exactly 
what he's doing. When we needed it the most, he came out there and makes some 
big hits on Brister." 
</P>
<P>
Was Brister prepared for Wallace's strong pass rush? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's been asking me, 'have you ever heard of Wallace before?,' " 
Brister said. "Hell yes, I watched him on film. He's a good player and he's 
going to be a great one before it's all done." 
</P>
<P>
Although Wallace sustained a bruised right shoulder while trying to tackle 
Steeler kick returner Rod Woodson, he's not expected to miss next Sunday's game 
against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace wasn't the only Raider defender who played well as they failed to allow 
a touchdown for the second time in three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without Long, their defensive leader, the Raiders sacked Brister a 
total of six times for 38 yards in losses, intercepted a pass and caused 
Brister to fumble four times. 
</P>
<P>
Was Long surprised at how well the Raiders defense played without him? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even want to glorify that with an answer," Long snapped. "The defense 
does not revolve around Howie Long. The defense revolves around 11 players. The 
defense played great. Once they settled down they played great." 
</P>
<P>
Shell agreed with Long, saying, "This team dwells on doing things together. 
They believe in each other. They lost Howie last week and they rallied around 
each other and got the job done and they did the same thing again today. Until 
Howie gets back they'll continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Brister thought the loss of Long didn't make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"If Howie was in there they would have been better," Brister said. "But with 
the guys they had in there today, they're still a pretty good football team. 
Their defensive backs cover well, they've got great linebackers and their pass 
rush is pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Golic, who recovered two fumbles, said the depth of the Raider defense 
compensated for Long's absence. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, you're going to miss dramatically somebody with the impact of a 
Howie Long," Golic said. "We've got tremendous depth in our defensive line. 
We've got a lot of guys who step in and play very, very well, and I think you 
saw that today. 
</P>
<P>
"We totally believe in ourselves and our abilities and that's what's getting us 
through. Even in tough situations, you see us recover and play well." 
</P>
<P>
With Long already injured, the Raiders also lost another defensive starter when 
rookie cornerback Garry Lewis sustained a broken collarbone in the first 
quarter. Lewis is expected to be out six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone like Howie Lewis or Garry Lewis goes down we have the talent on 
our team to have other people step in and get the job done," linebacker Jerry 
Robinson said. "We get it done together and that's the big key. There's guys 
pulling together for one cause."

SPOOKED BY RECENT THEFTS, WARY ROLEX OWNERS TRADE DOWN TO OTHER BRANDS

What you didn't see, but could have, on the annual in/out lists last Jan. 1: 
</P>
<P>
In: Peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Out: Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Shemaria put her watch away this summer after reading grim tales of 
gun-toting Rolex bandits. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sweeney locked hers up when she realized she was spending more time trying 
to hide it than enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
Hilary Kornbluth, who had yearned for a gold Rolex for a long time, sold hers 
this year. It just wasn't worth the worry. 
</P>
<P>
And Carl Marcus, a Santa Ana jeweler, switched brands this spring after a thief 
relieved him at gunpoint of his $22,000 Rolex. He was just stepping into his 
Rolls-Royce outside the Westside Pavilion when he felt a gun against his head 
and heard a voice say, "It's Rolex time, (expletive)." 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore it's not. Not for a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
"I am besieged with calls from people who are afraid to wear their Rolexes," 
said Pepi Kelman, owner of the Beverly Hills jewelry store Pepi. "We have had 
an unusual number of people coming in and saying, 'My husband doesn't want me 
to wear my Rolex. I don't feel safe at the market, or in the car, or shopping.' 
Last week, I must have seen 10 women who were replacing their Rolexes." 
</P>
<P>
But they are not replacing their Rolexes with other status brands like Cartier, 
Audemars Piguet or Ebel. Instead, Kelman has begun recommending to her 
customers -- most of whom can afford any watch they like -- timepieces that 
cost a fraction of a gold Rolex. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney, Shemaria and Kornbluth all recently bought Sector brand watches from 
Kelman. Sector is a sporty, water-resistant, Italian-designed watch with Swiss 
movement. It has the heft of a Rolex but costs far less. 
</P>
<P>
"We're selling a lot of Sector Adventure models, which cost from $275 to $595, 
and the customers actually don't care if they lose it," said Kelman. 
</P>
<P>
Other brands that are selling -- some of which are known to watch buyers from 
magazine advertisements -- are Tabbah, Heuer, Lucien Rochat, Revue Thommen, 
Alain Silberstein and Misani. The top price for such models is usually about 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Thomas, who buys and sells vintage watches at the Watch Co. in West Los 
Angeles, said some of his customers are removing the gold watchbands from their 
Rolex Presidents and replacing them with less flashy crocodile or lizard bands. 
</P>
<P>
Any gold Rolexes Thomas buys now are sold to East Coast dealers and not even 
offered to customers here. (Thomas made headlines last November after he shot 
and killed two gunmen trying to rob his shop. Police said the robbers were 
probably looking for Rolexes.) 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area police reported last month that Rolex owners were being 
victimized at the rate of one per day. Three people have been murdered this 
year in connection with Rolex thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, police detectives arrested a 25-year-old Los Angeles man they 
believe may be responsible for at least some of the Rolex robberies. Police 
said two attorneys reported receiving phone calls from a man who said he wanted 
help turning himself in on outstanding warrants. The attorneys were robbed of 
their Rolexes when they met the potential client. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, thieves seek out all-gold, President models, which sell new 
for $10,000 and up. But that doesn't make owners of other models rest any 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't seem to fully realize what's going on," said Michael 
Taylor, a Los Angeles jeweler. "I wouldn't wear one. I used to wear a Rolex 
two-tone (stainless steel and gold), but I put it away out of caution." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, these days, caution and Rolex go together like armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself pulling my sleeve down a lot," said Sweeney, co-owner of Marix 
Tex Mex Cafes. "I'd worry about it when I was driving and I'd put my arm out 
the window. Or, if I didn't have long sleeves on, I'd be trying to stuff my 
hand in my jeans pocket to conceal it. It was probably somewhere before the 
beginning of the summer that I just said, 'No more.' My Rolex is locked up 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney's partner, Shemaria, arrived at the same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even have one of the kind they were stealing," she said. "I had a 
very 'household' model -- stainless steel and gold. But your watch is the last 
thing you want to be worried about." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is switching brands. For Carl Marcus, the Rolex mystique has 
proven irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
"A Rolex just makes me feel good," he said, and admitted that he's wearing one 
again. Not that he hasn't made concessions. After he was robbed, he traded in 
his Rolls Royce for a BMW and made a beeline for a tailor. 
</P>
<P>
"I went straight to a custom shirt shop and ordered three dozen shirts with 
extra long cuffs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But for many Rolex owners, especially women, the only appropriate sartorial 
adjustment is to put the Rolex away. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's such a hot item, I would probably put mine away for awhile," said 
West Los Angeles Police Det. Ronald Phillips. He said the Rolex robbery rate in 
his jurisdiction has remained steady, with a total of about 36 this year. Many 
victims, he said, are cased before the assaults, frequently by someone who asks 
for the time on the street, then tips off an accomplice, who commits the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who asks you the time of day is not a robber," said Phillips, "but 
when someone walks up and asks the time, it should be a clue for you to say, 
'Hey, what's going on around me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kornbluth, a West Los Angeles businesswoman, didn't want to have to spend one 
minute worrying about her watch. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finished graduate school, my family gave me a gold Rolex, which cost 
$8,000 or $9,000," she said. "I couldn't wait to get it. But the watch was more 
of a problem than it was worth. It lived in my safe deposit box. Now the watch 
I wear (a Sector) cost $350. It's stainless steel, gold-plated and looks better 
than a Rolex. If I lose it or it's stolen, it's replaceable. It's not worth 
risking your life over a stupid watch."

Wait a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, he looks like the same James Brown, hardest working man in show business, 
king of rhythm and blues, Godfather of Soul, but he's talking about coming out 
of a brand-new bag. 
</P>
<P>
James Brown, who could sweat up a storm dancing on electric legs, who put the 
word funk in the musical lexicon, made "Please, Please, Please" a lover's rap 
and whose foot-stomping grit makes today's performers seem pale and pudgy, is 
going to sing songs that are "more spiritual?" 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, in one of several conversations last Friday and Saturday -- this one 
during a ride through town in a silver Lincoln Continental -- assured a visitor 
that he didn't plan to start preaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do things that'll relate to people's culture, what your life has been 
about, where you got to go," Brown said. "I don't want to take the time to sing 
a song and lead people on just for a dollar."

Brown, who talked during time off from his work-release program, hinted at a 
bold new musical form that he has been working on while serving a six-year 
prison sentence. But he would not divulge specifics because he said that would 
help other performers beat him to the punch. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a universal sound," he said, "but it is going to be James Brown." He 
said his new sound will "hit 'em as clean as I hit 'em with 'Papa's Got a Brand 
New Bag,' a million-seller from the 1960s with a syncopated beat that ran 
counter to musical trends of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Getting wound up, Brown, who speaks in raspy, rapid patterns that contrasted 
strangely with the elevator music on the car radio, said that "if you're living 
in Australia, you're gonna say, 'That sounds like something we do.' If you live 
in Brazil, you'll be saying, 'That sounds Latin,' and if you're living in 
Germany, you'll say, 'Something's very European here.' That's the way I'm 
going." Since going to jail 21 months ago, he said, he has written eight songs, 
or as he put it, "I got eight new things ready." 
</P>
<P>
Whether he leads a musical revolution or winds up performing old hits in golden 
oldie concerts, James Brown is coming back. He will be eligible for parole next 
March, but he makes an appearance -- via video -- this weekend at the American 
Film Institute in Washington in the premiere of "James Brown: the Man, the 
Music &amp; the Message," a one-hour special about his life and career. Brown 
would like to be there in person, but the terms of his work-release program 
confine him to a two-county area. 
</P>
<P>
While Brown seems to relish the forum that prison has given for his views on 
improving the prison system and promoting education, he clearly remains bitter 
about being jailed. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that he should have gotten into the work-release program earlier 
and that he is "past due for parole." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what response prison officials make to his assertions, Brown said: "What 
did they say a long time ago when they had two water fountains?" 
</P>
<P>
After climbing to a mountaintop of riches and adulation, then plummeting to a 
pit of drugs and violence, Brown at age 57 is now raring to return. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hart, president of On the Potomac Productions and executive producer of 
the special, said, "The novelty of the rest period is over for him. He realizes 
he's in his September years. He wants to get back to work." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, by slowing him down, prison seems also to have diminished Brown's 
paunch. His gray pin-striped suit -- that he designed -- fit well. His 
straightened hair recalls his old glory days. Nevertheless, Brown clearly 
relishes the future. That seems to make the present more bearable, and, he 
says, over and over, he has learned from the past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 Brown had a series of run-ins with the law, including a conviction and 
suspended sentence on assault and battery charges involving a police officer. 
He pleaded no-contest to charges of carrying a pistol and possession of the 
drug PCP. Finally, there was the highly publicized incident in which Brown 
waved a shotgun at a roomful of people in an insurance seminar, then was chased 
at high speeds until police captured him by shooting out his truck tires. That 
put him in jail in December, 1988. The charges: failure to stop for a police 
car and aggravated assault. Police said he tried to run over two officers, a 
charge Brown denied. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, after serving 15 months of his term at State Park Correctional 
Institute in Columbia, S.C., Brown was placed in the work-release program at 
the Aiken-Barnwell Counties Community Action Commission, counseling students to 
stay in school and off drugs and calling attention to the plight of the poor. 
Brown said recent appearances ranged from a talk to poor pre-schoolers to a 
picnic for foster grandmothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I do things across the board," he said, "I'm about that." 
</P>
<P>
After work, Brown must return nightly to the minimum-security Lower Savannah 
Work Center here. He is given a weekend pass every other week, allowing him to 
spend time with his wife, Adrienne. 
</P>
<P>
Some Brown supporters have said that comparable convictions for white 
defendants resulted in far shorter sentences, but state officials rejected such 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Around the nation, Brown's supporters would like to see him pardoned, not 
paroled, because a pardon would restore rights that a convicted felon loses. 
The efforts take a two-pronged approach: asserting that Brown should be 
released because he has has a positive national impact and that his punishment 
was too harsh for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Reginald Simmons, an attorney here, was planning to file a petition as early as 
today seeking Brown's pardon, but he concedes the difficulty of the effort, 
saying Brown is such a "high-profile inmate" that officials "want to do 
everything by the book." 
</P>
<P>
More immediately, Brown and his supporters are hoping to create a splash in 
Washington with the premiere screenings of the special, which includes 
appearances by other entertainers. Hart said he is negotiating with television 
officials to syndicate the production. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is hoping to attend the screenings, which will be Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday at the American Film Institute, but that seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Archibald, director of public affairs for the South Carolina Department 
of Corrections, said Brown is forbidden to cross the state line, let alone go 
Washington, adding that if he is unhappy about that, then "17,000 other inmates 
are not happy that they can't go somewhere either. Unhappiness is a part of 
this business." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brown is preparing to get back into the business he knows best. As 
he does, he rides a roller coaster of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
During the drive around town, an occasional wave or clenched fist brought a 
flash of pleasure to his face. At another time he said that since his 
incarceration, he has seen conditions worsen for the impoverished and the 
uneducated. For many, he said, selling dope is the most attractive profession. 
Being in prison has made him focus on that. "I wish I didn't know what I know," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, during a photograph session on the manicured lawn at the home of 
friends, Brown was his old self, the man who loves to take credit for his 
creations, whether in music or clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I designed this," he said, showing the inside of his jacket, where "James 
Brown" was stitched on the pocket. His outfit was vintage JB -- bold gray 
pin-stripe suit, flared jacket with tucks in the back, emerald-green shirt and 
matching tie, gold and emerald-colored watch, burgundy boots with silver-tipped 
toes under pants sporting 3-inch cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brown talked energetically about his re-entry, his new spiritualism and 
"message music," and underlying it all was a rhythm from somewhere in the '60s, 
pulsating under squeals, grunts, moans -- and a raspy voice shouting, "Good 
God!"

YOUTH VS. EXPERIENCE IN NEW 'QUIZ KIDS'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: AFTERNOON GAME SHOW ON CHANNEL 13 IS A 50TH ANNIVERSARY SPINOFF OF 
RADIO'S 'QUIZ KIDS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shamola Williams, 14, had just blown into Los Angeles from the village of Stone 
Mountain, Ga. No mere sightseer, she was headed to Hollywood to make some 
money. Brains got her here, but could she take the pressure? 
</P>
<P>
Whisked to a sound stage at KTLA/Hollywood Center Studios, she was nervous as 
she waited for the cameras to roll on the set of the new syndicated game show, 
"The Quiz Kids Challenge." She was a black girl in celebrity-land for the first 
time, teamed up with two white boys from L.A. magnet schools in a 
"Jeopardy!"-inspired game show that tests kids against adults. 
</P>
<P>
When the director yelled "action" on the high-tech set and beaming host 
Jonathan Prince zeroed in on the contestants, Shamola, who looks like a 
Hollywood ingenue, suddenly became the epitome of Miss Cool. Her two teammates 
-- short and dark Aaron Tward, 13, from Northridge, and tall and blond Tim 
Williams, 14, from Santa Monica -- were aggressive allies. The three adults 
arrayed against them had their hands full, barely holding their own. 
</P>
<P>
These competitors are featured at 3:30 p.m. daily this week on the KCOP Channel 
13 daytime strip. New contestants appear each week against different adults. 
</P>
<P>
Since this Guber-Peters syndicated show debuted Sept. 10, the kids have been 
winning 60% of the time in a duel of smarts, speed and strategy. The production 
is a 50th-anniversary spinoff of the popular "Quiz Kids" NBC radio show from 
Chicago (1940-53). There were later, short-lived TV "Quiz Kids," but youth was 
never matched against experience until now. 
</P>
<P>
Like the successful "Jeopardy!," you have to know something to win on this 
show. The questions, from head writer Norm Fox and a half-dozen three-person 
research squads, are gnarly: 
</P>
<P>
* "There are three South American countries that lie on both sides of the 
Equator. Name them," asks host Prince, who is no slouch himself as a cum laud 
Harvard grad. 
</P>
<P>
* "If physiology deals with man's body, which 'ology' deals with his behavior?" 
</P>
<P>
* "The most powerful weapon is the written word. Which nation invented both 
paper and ammunition?" 
</P>
<P>
* "What is the shape of a snowflake?" 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes. 
</P>
<P>
(In order, the answers to the above were: Columbia, Brazil and Ecuador; 
psychology; China; the hexagon.) 
</P>
<P>
You won't find brighter young role models to endorse the merits of academic 
excellence than these kids. Winnowed from thousands of candidates in what 
co-executive producer Julian Fowles calls "a logistical nightmare," they are 
the survivors of an elaborate, rigorous testing format conducted by Fowles in 
schools and cities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 600 youths were auditioned in Detroit; six were selected to compete 
on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Every week, sets of children, with a parent or guardian, arrive at the studio 
gate. They meet each other for the first time, gobble down a quick lunch, get 
revved up in the manner of a locker room pep talk by the production's official 
cheerleader, contestant coordinator Martha Mayakis, and, in one furious day 
(usually on weekends), tape five consecutive half-hour shows. The production 
(one of five new game shows this fall in a market where the fallout is great) 
is seen in 80% of the nation's markets, according to co-executive producer 
Geoffrey Cowan, whose father, the late Louis Cowan, created the original show. 
</P>
<P>
The other executive producer is game show veteran Scott Sternberg, who produced 
the "Midnight Special" pop music series and who sewed up the deal as executive 
vice president at Guber-Peters Television. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody denies the "Jeopardy!"-style connection. The co-producer, Jules Minton, 
was head writer and associate producer of "Jeopardy!" 
</P>
<P>
Fowles and Cowan, who have been nursing the development of "The Quiz Kids 
Challenge" for three years under their Chilmark Productions trademark, 
originally piloted "Quix Kids" two years ago at the Disney Channel, but the 
Disney deal fell through. Now they're looking for the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"Game shows are the biggest crap shoot in TV," said Fowles, "but the payoff is 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Already, said Fowles, Guber-Peters has $10 million invested in the production 
(which is considered unusually high for this type of venture). 
</P>
<P>
The youths, who represent the top 1% of junior high schools, are recruited from 
the 9-to-15 age range. Support elements include classroom simulations of the 
games developed by Lifetime Learning Systems and local scholarship funds. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are unique role models," said Cowan, "but they're not nerds." 
</P>
<P>
Shamola Williams certainly isn't. In fact, as an athlete, she could whip most 
boys. A 110-meter low hurdler in school, she has only lost two races in her 
life. Raised with a strong West Indian influence by Jamaican parents, she 
typifies the kind of cross-cultural profile the producers are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
One competitor from Atlanta, from a future week, is 14-year old Meranee Phing, 
a girl from Thailand who speaks with a Southern accent. Then there's 
12-year-old David Ratajczak, whose father, an economics professor, is a 
consultant to the government. 
</P>
<P>
This week's 13-year old Aaron Tward, who goes to Portola Junior High in 
Tarzana, says that after a day of school, "I like to let my brain deteriorate. 
I have a lamp and always a book by my bed." His favorite author is Ray Bradbury 
and his favorite book is Douglas Adams' "A Hitchhiker's Guide to a Galaxy." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Williams, from Santa Monica's private Crossroads School, taught himself 
German but complains that "I have nobody to try it out on." His favorite book 
is "Catch 22." He "piddles around" on his computer after school. His dad, 
Richard Williams, was director of animation on "Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
"What will people be celebrating Jan. 1, 2001?" asks the quizmaster. Tim's arm 
whips up. "The new millennium," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The adults, who must pass the same test the kids take to make the show, look 
blank. The juvenile brain trust takes the pot.

UNIONS SAY THEY MAY TRY TO BUY JUST PART OF UAL; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE LEADER OF THE BUYOUT EFFORT SAYS A NEW OFFER IS BEING PUT 
TOGETHER -- AND IT MAY INVOLVE LESS THAN 100% OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK. THAT

The unions at United Airlines might not try to buy all of UAL Corp., the leader 
of the buyout effort said at a weekend gathering of union members. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler vice chairman hired by United's unions, 
said the unions are revising their offer for parent UAL Corp., and it isn't 
clear what shape it will take. "It is possible we could leave some (UAL stock) 
with public shareholders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first indication that the unions, whose members include the pilots, 
mechanics and flight attendants, might not try to buy the entire airline. A 
decision to buy only a portion of UAL's shares would reduce the cost of the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald made his comments during a brief interview at a picnic Saturday that 
was organized by United's San Francisco-area union employees. It was his first 
interview since the unions began work on a revised $3.9-billion offer in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The unions face an Oct. 9 deadline to present a fully financed bid to UAL's 
directors. They have given 23 banks until Oct. 3 to decide whether they will 
provide $2 billion in financing. 
</P>
<P>
Between Oct. 3 and Oct. 9, Greenwald said, the unions will negotiate financial 
support "from others (that) are not banks." Greenwald wouldn't identify the 
other potential participants. But it is known that the unions have sought 
support from aircraft and engine manufacturers, such as Boeing, Airbus 
Industrie and General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said it is possible that the unions might contribute up to $200 
million in equity in return for special preferred stock. He said most of that 
money would come from the pilots' retirement account, but that other employees 
would be invited to contribute. A previous union offer included wage 
concessions but no equity contributions from employees. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the unions do get enough money for their revised $175- to $180-a-share 
offer, it isn't clear whether UAL's board will accept it. When the board 
accepted a $201-a-share offer from the unions five months ago, it indicated 
that it would not accept a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said the board would leave the airline open to corporate raiders if 
it turns down the union's offer. One previous bidder for the airline, Los 
Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, recently expressed renewed interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
A rejection would also frustrate United's unions, he said. The unions have open 
contracts, and before the buyout effort, the flight attendants voted to strike 
if mediation failed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we will have an offer they (UAL directors) can say yes 
to," Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald declined to discuss terms of the new offer, but other sources have 
indicated that the revised bid includes $150 a share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The unions were forced to lower their offer after the crisis in the Persian 
Gulf made it impossible to finance the $201-a-share offer. Greenwald said 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait forced the unions to revise their five-year economic 
forecast for United, taking higher fuel prices into account. 
</P>
<P>
The projections show that United can meet its obligations if oil prices go as 
high as $37 a barrel, Greenwald said, adding he did not expect them to go that 
high. 
</P>
<P>
That projection, however, is optimistic compared to other forecasts. On Friday, 
the World Bank said a Mideast war could send oil prices soaring to $65 a barrel 
this year, and that they might remain somewhere between $30 and $40 a barrel 
during the next five years.

Alleged "Straw Man" Charged in Brookside Deal: Federal authorities filed 
charges against a third person allegedly involved in a fraudulent 1984 real 
estate deal involving the now-defunct Los Angeles-based thrift Brookside 
Savings and Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Breithaupt Jr. was charged with one count of aiding and abetting in his 
alleged role as the "straw man," or phony property owner, in the thrift's 
purchase of interest in a large apartment complex in San Antonio. The true 
holders of the property were Brookside's former chairman, Michael Moers, and 
former vice chairman Arthur Pastel, who both have pleaded guilty. (Court Case 
No. 90-727. Filed Sept. 18, 1990)

In its monthly report, the McLean, Va.-based trade group said machine tool 
shipments rose 3.8% in August to $242.30 million. It was the fifth consecutive 
month in which machine tools orders were above 1989's. The report is used to 
gauge capital spending by manufacturers.

Workers Plead Guilty in Defense Kickbacks Scheme: Two defense industry workers 
pleaded guilty to charges that they received more than $47,000 in kickbacks for 
directing the business of their employers to various defense subcontractors. 
The convictions of Frank Brown, 56, and Raymond Fisher, 67, marked the latest 
in a long-term government investigation of fraud and other improprieties in the 
defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher pleaded guilty to failing to report more than $22,000 of income on his 
1984 tax return and more than $18,000 on his 1985 return. Prosecutors said the 
unreported money stemmed from kickbacks he received from directing the business 
of his employer, the Eaton Corp., to various defense subcontractors. In a 
separate case, Brown pleaded guilty to failing to disclose more than $7,000 he 
allegedly received in kickbacks as an employee of Hamilton-Avent and Cetec.

EASTERN INTERNATIONAL BANK TRIES TO SHED 'CHINESE-ONLY' IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: EASTERN INTERNATIONAL BANK IN ALHAMBRA IS TARGETING THE LATINO 
COMMUNITY, WHICH IS GROWING FAST IN THE BIG ASIAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

In the Alhambra branch of Eastern International Bank, signs of its Chinese 
roots are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Bright red posters with Chinese characters adorn the walls. Tellers and 
customers freely converse in Mandarin, Cantonese and Fujianese, the dialect 
spoken in Fujian province and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, restaurants, bookstores and grocery stores line a busy stretch of 
Valley Boulevard in the western San Gabriel Valley, a haven for one of the 
nation's fastest-growing Chinese-American communities. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Eastern International wants to shed its reputation as a 
"Chinese-only" bank and is targeting another community: the area's burgeoning 
Latino population.

The 5-year-old institution that thrived on a heavy growth of immigrants from 
Taiwan and Hong Kong in the 1980s is smack in the middle of a diverse community 
of second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans and recent immigrants from 
Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Latinos constitute the largest ethnic group within a five-mile radius 
of Eastern's two branches in Alhambra and Chinatown, according to a recent 
marketing study conducted for the bank by Woodland Hills-based Terry Utterback 
&amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
"Asians and Latinos make up 80% of the market," said Glenn H. Yee, Eastern's 
president and chief executive. "Why concentrate on just half?" 
</P>
<P>
Frank Medina, executive director of the Latin Business Assn., put it more 
bluntly: "They're in the heart of East L.A. They wouldn't be able to survive" 
without Latino customers. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, larger mainstream businesses in Southern California and nationwide 
-- from car manufacturers to department stores to utilities -- are increasingly 
realizing that they must provide multilingual or culturally sensitive services 
to gain a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern and a few other minority-owned businesses have realized that the 
importance of cross-ethnic marketing applies to them as well, especially in 
communities where Latinos, Asians, blacks or whites live close together. Some 
experts say Asian businesses catering to a Latino community could be successful 
because the two groups share some common cultural traits, such as saving for 
their children's educations and an aggressive resolve to make it in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Yee, 45, born in Canton and fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, admits that he's 
no expert on the Latino market. So, he has brought an expert on board: John 
Hernandez, a Rowland Heights advertising, marketing and public relations 
consultant whom Yee met when he placed an advertisement in the Latin Business 
Assn. newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in Yee's Alhambra office, the two men talked about ways 
to reach the Latino population: advertisements in the Spanish-language news 
media, direct-mail campaigns to families with Latino surnames and recruiting 
more Spanish-speaking employees. Currently, two of the bank's 45 employees 
speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Community involvement will be a top priority, Yee said. In January, Eastern 
joined the Latin Business Assn., becoming the first Chinese-owned financial 
institution to be a member, Medina said. The bank also donated $1,000 in 
scholarship money to the Latin Business Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese in the past were not known to join too many things, as opposed to 
Westerners, who join everything," he said. "We want to let the community know 
we are very much interested to serve them in any way we can." 
</P>
<P>
However, Yee acknowledged that with only $84 million in deposits, Eastern 
International Bank is taking a chance in venturing outside its niche in the 
Asian community. Eastern was founded as a savings and loan institution, and 
recently converted to a commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
And Yee emphasized that he did not want to alienate either his customers or his 
Chinese banker peers. "These are uncharted waters," he said. "I don't want to 
get across the idea we're abandoning the Chinese. The Chinese community is very 
small. We all know each other." 
</P>
<P>
Larger Chinese banks have approached the Latino market with caution. Cathay 
Bank, with $560 million in deposits and six branches, advertises in Spanish 
publications and has five to 10 Spanish-speakers among its 300 employees, said 
Dunson Cheng, president and chief executive. Still, he said, "at this point in 
time the customer base is more Chinese and Southeast Asian immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
William Lau, first vice president and savings administrator for First Public 
Savings Bank, said an ideal customer base for his bank's Chinatown, Alhambra 
and Monterey Park branches would be "half-half" Asian and non-Asian. But, he 
conceded, that may be hard to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers look at us and see all Orientals, then don't come in at all," Lau 
said, adding that Asians still constitute 90% of the 11-year-old bank's 
clientele. "It's undeniable; we're an Oriental bank. When we advertised for a 
secretary and a teller for a couple of weeks, only Orientals applied." 
</P>
<P>
Another executive, Kellogg Chan of San Marino-based East-West Federal Bank, 
said: "I don't have that same problem as other Chinese banks, being perceived 
as Chinese. We have made loans to blacks, Hispanics, Caucasians. I don't target 
a specific ethnic group." 
</P>
<P>
Latino-owned banks, meanwhile, are concentrating on serving their own 
communities and would find it difficult to compete against mainstream banks for 
non-Latino customers, Medina said. "Right now, because there are larger 
institutions in the area with more resources available to them, the Latino bank 
owner will market specifically to (Latinos)," Medina said. "It's safer and 
easier to deal with in the beginning. Once they get themselves established, 
they can venture into other areas." 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles-based Pan American Bank, which also has branches in Santa Ana 
and Whittier, hires Spanish-speaking tellers, loan officers and supervisors to 
serve its 90% Latino clientele, said Lupe Gomez, an assistant cashier. 
</P>
<P>
Yee said his bank's experience in catering to Chinese immigrants will be an 
advantage with Latinos. For example, he is considering establishing a college 
fund account for families to set aside money for their children's education, a 
service that would be equally appealing to Asians and Latinos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez agreed. "For Latinos, education is extremely important," he said. 
"They have very many of the same kinds of motivations and characteristics the 
Chinese have. Other mainstream banks may not be prepared to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Yee said, "I told my son, there are two languages to learn: Chinese and 
Spanish. . . . Then you'll cover three-fourths of the globe."

DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: SISYPHUS, WILE E. COYOTE AND UAL UNIONS

<P>
Watching the poor souls who are members of United Airlines' labor unions try to 
buy the company is like watching a dog chase a mechanical rabbit around a 
track. You know that if form holds, you will always end up with a frustrated 
dog and an untouched rabbit. The only question is how close the dog will get 
before the rabbit pulls away again. 
</P>
<P>
Form, so far, has been holding pretty well. The unions' $300-a-share offer for 
UAL Corp., which owns the airline, came very close to going through but 
collapsed last October, when some banks pulled back their financing 
commitments. The unions then bid $201 a share in April, but that offer never 
got off the ground because the unions wouldn't put any cash of their own into 
the deal and lenders wouldn't finance it. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a new offer, at a lower price, running around. That offer, which 
may have surfaced by the time you read this, doesn't seem likely to go through, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, the unions change their pattern -- tamper with the 
mechanical rabbit, as it were -- by putting up cash money as a down payment. Or 
unless they find a sucker, such as European plane maker Airbus Industrie, that 
is so desperate for United Airlines' business that it will put big bucks into a 
UAL leveraged buyout. I wouldn't bet too much on it. 
</P>
<P>
Why am I so down on the union's latest offer? An offer that I haven't even 
seen? Because dogs almost always act like dogs, and mechanical rabbits like 
mechanical rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
At the risk of being obvious, I'd like to repeat what I said in April, when I 
said that the unions' $201-a-share offer wouldn't fly: The 1980s are over. 
No-cash-down takeovers are dead, dead, dead. In today's environment, no bank in 
its right mind will finance a multibillion-dollar buyout by any buyer who isn't 
putting money of his own into the venture. That was true in April, and it's 
even more true now. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 1 is that banking regulators are giving so-called highly leveraged 
transactions the hairy eyeball and are leaning on banks not to make many. 
Reason No. 2 is that with dead and dying LBOs littering the landscape, lenders 
have remembered that it's just plain stupid to lend money to someone who has 
none of his own money at risk. Because, you see, if the deal goes bad, the 
borrower can walk away at no loss to himself and stick the bank with a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
I feel bad for the UAL union members, who have been jerked around for years by 
takeover artists and would-be takeover artists, and who got into this whole 
messy business to preserve their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But I get tired of hearing every five minutes that a deal is just around the 
corner, stories that are obviously inspired by the unions and by the other half 
of the UAL Odd Couple, Coniston Partners. The unions want to save jobs and have 
workplace democracy. The Conistons, who own 11.8% of UAL's stock and have a 
$150-million paper loss on it, would sell to Attila the Hun, Saddam Hussein or 
even Frank Lorenzo to get out of this disaster alive. 
</P>
<P>
But the more important reason to write about the UAL unions' latest travail is 
that the unions' series of constantly lower offers shows what has happened to 
market psychology in the past 12 months. Think of it. A year ago, the unions 
almost pulled off a $300-a-share deal for UAL. Now, they will probably offer 
about half that price and will have to be very, very lucky to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the decline, of course, is that the airline business is 
taking its lumps. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has doubled the price of oil, 
which has driven airplane fuel prices through the roof. The U.S. economy seems 
headed for a recession (or something worse), which tends to reduce the number 
of business people who take airline trips. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the reason is that the junk bond market has turned to . . . well, 
junk. The stories that you may have read about the decline in the junk market 
are too kind. Any junkmeister willing to talk truth -- which means talking off 
the record -- will tell you that for most junk issues, there is virtually no 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Banks' junk takeover loans, of course, were made in response to the 
junk-financed takeovers mounted by Drexel Burnham Lambert and its clients. In 
Drexel's glory days, all it took to become a corporate raider was Drexel's 
phone number. Drexel could raise endless amounts of junk bond money to let 
anybody take over anything. Issuing a press release was enough to put a company 
in play. The commercial banks got into the junk takeover loan business to seize 
back the business that Drexel had gotten by issuing junk takeover bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But for the Drexel game to work, you need a real market for junk bonds -- a 
market in which you can buy or sell securities without changing their price 
much. In today's junk market, buying bonds is easy; you just can't sell them. 
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, in which brokers match buyers up with 
sellers, bond markets consist of dealers buying bonds, holding them and 
reselling them. With junk bond prices plummeting, no one wants to hold them. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the junk market as 100 sellers all looking for the exit; only there 
isn't any door. Which is why the junk market has pretty much croaked. And why, 
unless the unions put up real money or find an investor who will, the UAL 
buyout will always be a dog.

<P>
After shareholders hit L.A. Gear with 24 class-action suits in June, lawyers 
for the Southern California maker of trendy footwear and clothing ordered 
executives to clam up. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear officials called off a planned dinner for securities analysts at a 
July sporting goods show in Chicago, prompting one Sutro &amp; Co. stock 
watcher to cancel his trip there. 
</P>
<P>
"The company had always been very good about communicating, and then all of a 
sudden they stopped talking," said Jonathan H. Ziegler, who analyzes retail 
stocks for the San Francisco-based brokerage. "I didn't want to just see their 
spring line." 
</P>
<P>
The upshot was that Ziegler, who had been high on the company for years but had 
issued a "hold" recommendation at $48 a share, began telling investment clients 
that he could offer them no guidance on the stock whatsoever. Meanwhile, the 
shares have sunk to $14.25. 
</P>
<P>
With disappointed investors increasingly taking to the courts to complain about 
what they see as fraud or deceit by management, more companies are finding 
themselves in the position of L.A. Gear. To speak or not to speak about rosy 
projections and new miracle products becomes the question. If companies want to 
play it safe, mum should be the word. 
</P>
<P>
That was the message to Ziegler and about 340 other executives and investment 
professionals at a seminar held recently in Palo Alto by Morrison &amp; 
Foerster, a San Francisco-based law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Disclosures to Analysts and the Press: Avoiding Shareholder 
Litigation," the session was an attempt to guide concerned companies through a 
minefield of confusing and seemingly conflicting requirements about what they 
should reveal, and when. 
</P>
<P>
Companies looking for strict guidelines, however, were told that they were out 
of luck. "There are no clear rules that you can look up," said Joseph A. 
Grundfest, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official who now teaches 
at Stanford University's law school. "A great deal boils down to common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Grundfest added that companies choosing to maintain an open-door policy should 
be careful to reveal material information to all analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would you want to disclose some information selectively to a particular 
analyst . . . ahead of another?" he said, urging companies to avoid the 
"inadvertent slip of the tongue" that can get them into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Sherman, a Morrison &amp; Foerster attorney who spoke about the 
scarcity of law on the subject, noted that companies have "absolutely no duty 
to disclose material inside information" unless required by securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Yet confusion can reign, he said, when companies attempt to abide by stock 
exchange guidelines. He cited a passage in the New York Stock Exchange manual 
stating that "a listed company is expected to release quickly to the public any 
news or information which might reasonably be expected to materially affect the 
market for its securities." The document goes on: "But a corporation may be 
excused from announcements when there is a valid reason for doing so." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to avoid lawsuits is "to tell the truth," said William S. Lerach, 
a San Diego attorney who has represented shareholders against companies in more 
than 200 cases in the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very simple," he added. "That's all the federal law says. Don't conceal 
your problems. Don't fib." 
</P>
<P>
Lerach is the lead counsel on the L.A. Gear suits, which were recently 
consolidated into one complaint. He said companies should beware of hype. L.A. 
Gear shareholders, for example, allege that officials falsified financial 
statements and misrepresented the beneficial effect of a highly touted 
promotional deal with entertainer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. Ventrudo, L.A. Gear's chief financial officer, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although companies often settle such shareholder suits, frequently for tens of 
millions of dollars, L.A. Gear has "vowed to litigate to the bitter end," 
according to Lerach. (Law firms generally take these cases on a contingency 
basis, receiving 20% to 30% of a settlement or jury award. Lerach noted that 
plaintiffs in any given case may be represented by as many as seven law firms, 
with the fee split among them.) 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' warnings aside, some companies still believe that openness is the best 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The more you tell about the company, and the quicker you tell it to the widest 
possible audience, the less likely you are to run afoul of the traps artfully 
scattered in the shifting sands of the securities laws," Marvin L. Krasnansky, 
a spokesman for San Francisco-based McKesson Corp., told the seminar 
participants. Krasnansky said the company, a distributor of pharmaceuticals and 
bottled water, has developed a reputation for timely disclosure and has 
benefited from extensive coverage by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Although participants went away with the overwhelming message that silence is 
golden, it's unlikely that lawyers who represent shareholders will be running 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
As Leonard D. Simon, a colleague of Lerach, told the audience: "Why should I be 
here telling all you people how not to get into trouble? Because I'm sure you 
won't be able to follow my advice."

MARKET BEAT: TWO CAUTIOUS WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, many individual stocks are off 20% to 40% from their 1990 highs in this 
bear market. The long-term investor in stock mutual funds, however, needs to 
keep those figures in perspective: You didn't buy at the high, and if you've 
been in the funds all year, you're probably not doing so badly -- though you 
certainly ought to be prepared for a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say you bought into a typical stock fund in 1988. In 1989, the average 
fund jumped 24%. So far this year, the average fund is down 10.3%. So you 
haven't even given back the 1989 gain. 
</P>
<P>
Those are averages, which means your funds might be doing a lot better or 
worse. But the average 10.3% stock fund decline so far this year at least 
provides a good reference point: You still have time to act, if you so choose. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say you've stuck with your funds for many years, but now expect a 
severe bear market -- one that might last another year or more. You might want 
to sell a portion of your holdings to raise cash for investing opportunities 
later. 
</P>
<P>
There is no crime in taking some profits, especially for investors who have 
enjoyed the full ride of the 1980s bull market. There are tax considerations, 
of course, but they should be secondary to your investment outlook. 
</P>
<P>
But what is the smart outlook now? Here are the views of two stock fund 
managers, both of whom have managed to beat the market so far this year, even 
though their views are almost at polar opposites. One or the other might echo 
the concerns of the vast majority of investors today: 
</P>
<P>
Ted Gemlich's IDS Stock fund, based in Minneapolis, is down just 4% for the 
year. Gemlich has stuck with many of the big-name consumer growth stocks, such 
as Pepsico, Philip Morris and Dayton Hudson. He also has kept a heavy weighting 
in energy stocks, such as Halliburton and Mobil, and in health-care stocks. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a lesson in Gemlich's strategy, it's that diversification across 
industry groups pays off -- though admittedly, you have to pick the best 
industry groups. Gemlich also has built a large cash cushion -- 20% of the 
fund's $1.3 billion in assets -- as a prudent hedge against a falling market. 
That cash cushion may grow a little more, but for the most part Gemlich plans 
to stick with his 70-some stocks, even through a recession. Having already 
pruned his holdings, he says, "I wouldn't sell a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he says, he isn't rushing to buy stocks right now, even 
though some values look compelling. "I don't see any hurry at this point," he 
says. As the bear market progresses, he figures he'll be able to buy a lot of 
stocks cheaper later on. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the fence is Henry Van der Eb, who runs the $260-million 
Mathers stock fund in Bannockburn, Ill. Van der Eb started raising cash in 1989 
and has had about 85% of the portfolio in cash since the start of the year. 
Thus, he's escaped the market's plunge, and his fund is up about 7% year to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Eb figures that the debt spiral of the 1980s will have to be unwound, 
and he sees it as a tough experience for the economy. "This whole debt thing 
has to slow down, and it's not going to slow down just over the next month but 
over the next year or two," he says. "There's going to be a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Like Gemlich, Van der Eb is content to wait for much better buying 
opportunities later. There are only a handful of stocks in his portfolio now, 
one of which is Torrance-based International Technology. The company performs 
such tasks as assessing and decontaminating hazardous waste sites. Though 
earnings were erratic in the late 1980s, the company has been on a roll since 
mid-1989. It earned 42 cents a share in the year ended March 31 on revenue of 
$307 million. Van der Eb thinks 60 cents is likely this year, and 80 to 85 
cents the year after. "It's one of the few companies that is relatively immune 
to the economy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
International Technology's stock has run up from $4.625 in 1989 to $9 now, and 
it was as high as $12.125 in July. It's traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gemlich nor Van der Eb can guarantee that they'll know exactly when 
it's time to start buying again, of course. But their caution says a lot about 
the mood of many big investors today: If you haven't taken at least some of 
your long-term profits, you should. And with the economy sinking, now is not 
the time to jump head first into stocks. As more big investors come over to 
that point of view -- which seems inevitable -- the bear market will become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Die-hard numbers junkies may notice that the average stock fund's 
10.3% year-to-date decline is worse than the New York Stock Exchange composite 
index's 9.8% loss. Both figures included reinvested dividends. If the average 
portfolio manager has kept at least 10% of fund assets in cash this year, it 
may appear to be a real indictment of fund talent that the typical fund is 
under-performing an all-stock index. However, the funds' return is after 
deducting management fees, which generally run about 1%. So you can figure that 
the average fund's actual performance is closer to a 9.3% loss. Whether the 
funds should be doing better than that, given their cash levels, is still open 
for debate.

BUSH PRAISES DE KLERK FOR REFORMS, VOWS HELP

<P>
President Bush today warmly praised South African President Frederik W. de 
Klerk after a two-hour meeting with him and pledged U.S. assistance for his 
efforts to guide South Africa toward a post-apartheid democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he is confident that the reform process under way in South Africa is 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to encourage and assist the emerging new South Africa," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also said the process in South Africa is irreversible, promising to 
scrap the country's white supremacist system and replace it with a new system 
with "a vote of equal value to all South Africans." 
</P>
<P>
"We will not turn back," De Klerk said, his words seemingly aimed at doubters 
in the United States who believe he will not deliver on his pledges for a new 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was intent on paying tribute to De Klerk for the leadership he has 
provided in beginning to dismantle white supremacist rule in South Africa. 
Their discussion was partly aimed at devising ways the United States can help 
speed the process. 
</P>
<P>
No South African head of state has visited Washington since 1945. As recently 
as the Ronald Reagan Administration, the two countries were barely on speaking 
terms because of the sanctions Congress imposed on South Africa in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. attitude toward South Africa changed dramatically with the 
liberalizing steps De Klerk has taken, including freeing African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela from prison and lifting bans on democratic 
political groups. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official who briefed reporters said De Klerk's visit is not 
designed to bring about an end to U.S. sanctions. South Africa has fulfilled 
some, but not all, of the conditions required by law for the sanctions to be 
lifted.

Los Angeles proclaimed today "Free Kuwait Day" in a show of solidarity with 
Kuwaiti citizens in the United States who oppose Iraq's invasion and occupation 
of their nation. 
</P>
<P>
Donning red-and-white T-shirts bearing the message "Free Kuwait," about two 
dozen Kuwaitis and local supporters joined in a ceremony on the steps of City 
Hall to receive a proclamation signed by Mayor Tom Bradley and members of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to send the message out that we are opposed to Iraq's actions and that 
we sympathize with the cause of the Kuwaitis here," Councilman Michael Woo 
said. "No people should be subject to takeover by another."

<P>
The stock market sank to new lows for the year today in activity marked by 
heavy selling of the battered bank issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 59.41 to 2,452.97, its lowest 
close since it stood at 2,452.77 on July 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 236 up, 1,418 down and 329 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 162.21 million shares, against 201.05 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index dropped 3.52 to 167.51. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were bracing for more bad tidings from the banking 
industry after Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announcement Friday of a dividend cut, 
new reserves for loan losses and a staff reduction of 5,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The news by itself did not come as any great surprise to Wall Street, which was 
well aware of widespread credit problems facing the banks. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it evidently served to intensify the recession worries that have 
been depressing stock prices since midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers noted that the market also had to contend with another big jump in 
world oil prices. Crude oil futures for November delivery surpassed $38 a 
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 9.17% from 
9.11% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The continued rise in oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has 
intensified the bond market's concern that inflation is worsening. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation hurts bonds because it erodes their value and makes it less likely 
that the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates. Lower rates benefit 
fixed-return securities such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In early trading, short-term Treasuries fell between 1/8 point and 9/32 point, 
intermediate maturities ranged from 9/32 point to 3/8 point lower, and 
long-term issues lost as much as 1/2 point.

East Germany, once the front-line state in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, formally

<P>
With 10 days remaining before the merger, a protocol on the pullout of East 
German troops from the Warsaw Pact was signed in East Berlin by Defense 
Minister Rainer Eppelmann and the Warsaw Pact commander-in-chief, Soviet Gen. 
Piotr Lushev, the official news agency ADN said.

<P>
The two Germanys will unite Oct. 3, and the new country will be a member of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union lifted its objections to NATO membership for a united Germany 
in July, clearing a major obstacle to unification.

Maverick GOP gubernatorial candidate Pierre Rinfret today called for armed 
vigilantes to battle crime in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really want is a vigilante system with people carrying guns, unknown to 
anybody, so anybody who comes along and mugs somebody may have, standing next 
to him, a man who's been authorized," Rinfret said. 
</P>
<P>
Aides later said the Manhattan-based economist envisioned a volunteer corps of 
up to 100,000 police-trained vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Rinfret's opponent, dismissed the proposal 
as dangerous.

900 AMERICANS TRAPPED BY IRAQ, U.S. SAYS

<P>
At least 900 American men, women and children are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, 
the State Department said today as it again accused Saddam Hussein's government 
of barbarism. 
</P>
<P>
At least 93 of these U.S. hostages, including many with serious medical 
problems, have been detained by the Iraqi government. Nine were seized over the 
weekend, one as he tried to board what could be the last evacuation flight 
sanctioned by Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the adult male Americans in Iraq and Kuwait are in hiding, said 
Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. For the sake of their 
safety she declined to provide exact figures. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,900 American citizens and their foreign-born family members have 
been evacuated from the two Persian Gulf countries since Iraq seized Kuwait 
Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining behind, Tutwiler said, are 600 to 700 American citizens in Kuwait and 
300 to 350 in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it particularly deplorable that the Iraqis have not only ignored our 
request to evacuate Americans with serious medical problems, but are now 
beginning to detain them," the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
She called the detention of sick people, some of them with terminal illnesses, 
"barbaric." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it was using American men as human shields to deter a U.S. attack 
on oil refineries and other strategic installations. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and senior U.S. officials have not ruled out force as a means of 
compelling Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. Basically, however, the 
Administration is hoping an embargo on Iraqi commerce authorized by the U.N. 
Security Council on Aug. 6 will prompt him to relent. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Iraqi leader threatened to attack Saudi Arabia, other Arab 
countries and Israel if Iraq was "strangled" by the economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler called it "another outlandish, outrageous statement." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, she said, "we have not seen any responsible statement toward doing 
what the world is saying he must do, which is withdraw from Kuwait and let the 
restoration of the legitimate government in Kuwait go back."

Spurred by record tobacco exports, the U.S. tobacco industry recorded a 1990 
first-half trade surplus of $2.49 billion, up 28% from $1.94 billion a year 
earlier, the Tobacco Merchants Assn. said today. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the country's total merchandise trade deficit for the first six 
months of 1990 amounted to more than $41.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco surplus was led by product exports valued at $2.19 billion, 
including shipments of more than 73.7 billion cigarettes valued at $2 billion, 
the association said. During the period, the United States imported $59 million 
worth of finished tobacco products.

Delta Air Lines said today that its earnings for the first quarter of its 
fiscal year will be down sharply because of increased fuel prices that followed 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Roeck Jr., Delta's senior vice president of finance, said earnings 
for the quarter that will end Sunday would be "significantly worse" than those 
for the same quarter last year, when the airline posted record profits. 
</P>
<P>
Roeck said the airline is now paying 64% more for jet fuel than it was before 
the Aug. 2 invasion. Delta has twice raised domestic air fares to help offset 
the fuel price increases. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter ending last Sept. 30, net earnings were $133.1 million, or $2.38 
per share, on revenue of $2.17 billion.

Attorney James Linn said Marcos was assured of immunity by Theodore Greenberg, 
deputy chief of the U.S. Justice Department's fraud division. Both Greenberg 
and Westinghouse spokesman Paul Jones declined to comment on the grand jury 
proceedings.

The panel is to question Marcos on Tuesday. It is probing allegations that 
Westinghouse bribed the Philippines government to obtain a contract to build a

Private savings and loans posted a loss of $196 million in the second quarter 
of the year in the best showing since a weak profit of $10 million in the first 
quarter of 1989, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, released by the Office of Thrift Supervision, do not include the 
results for institutions seized by the United States and operated by the 
federal Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to predict that the trend of reduced losses in the 
industry will continue or that the industry as a whole will become profitable 
this year," said Timothy Ryan, the OTS director. 
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter loss of $196 million follows a loss of $374 million in the 
first quarter and a record $3.41-billion plunge in the final three months of 
1989, the OTS reported.

The U.S. government has underwritten war risk insurance on a commercial ship 
engaged in normal commercial trade for the first time since the Korean War, the 
shipping daily Lloyd's List reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's said the 40,921-ton Stonewall Jackson, owned by Waterman Steamship, is 
the first vessel operating commercially to take advantage of the U.S. 
government's standby war risk insurance program since it became effective Aug. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Administration has already issued war risk policies for 30 of the 
merchant vessels taken by the U.S. Military Sealift Command for operation 
Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf, Lloyd's List said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, any foreign or U.S. ship may apply to the Maritime 
Administration for war risk coverage provided the vessel is engaged in U.S. 
trade. The U.S. agency is permitted to quote rates when the rates and 
conditions being offered in the commercial insurance market are considered 
unfair and unreasonable.

Fatigue prompted three-time Tour de France winner and hometown favorite Greg 
LeMond to withdraw three-quarters of the way through the Du Pont Pro Cycling 
Championships race, which was won by Michael Carter of Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Carter outraced a field of 55 world-class cyclists from 12 countries Sunday to 
take top honors and move into contention for the U.S. Pro Cycling Federation's 
national criterium crown. 
</P>
<P>
He seized control of the race in the 15th lap and dominated from then on, 
finishing the 52-mile event in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 42 seconds. LeMond, who has 
a home in suburban Wayzata, withdrew in the 30th lap of the 40-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a hard race. I'm so embarrassed," said LeMond, who before the race 
accepted a plaque proclaiming Sunday "Greg LeMond Day" in Minnesota. "I knew 
I'd feel bad, but not this bad. I've felt lousy all week. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the race started, I debated if I should start it. I should never have 
started. If it were a flat course, I wouldn't have had a problem. But on a 
course like this, there was no faking today."

FOYT EXPECTED TO FULLY RECOVER FROM CRASH

A. J. Foyt, the winningest driver in Indy Car racing history, will fully 
recover from multiple fractures suffered in a weekend crash, doctors said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt remained in satisfactory condition after being transferred from a 
Milwaukee hospital to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where he was 
scheduled to undergo a second operation late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, 55, sustained multiple leg and foot fractures in a crash Sunday at the 
Texaco Havoline 200 at the Road America raceway in Elkhart Lake, Wis., about 60 
miles north of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not the kind of injuries we feel will end his career," said Dr. 
James Stiehl, an orthopedic surgeon at Milwaukee County Medical Complex who 
supervised Foyt's initial 4 1/2-hour operation. "Ultimately, we feel he'll gain 
a full recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons planned to reclose some wounds and review some surgical procedures 
completed Sunday night, said Dr. Terry Trammell, director of medical services 
for Championship Auto Racing Teams. 
</P>
<P>
The accident ended Foyt's 1990 racing season. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell said Foyt would be unable to walk for eight weeks and would require 
four to six months to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do everything I can to get him back into the car, but in the end 
it's a decision he'll have to make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Past injuries to Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 champion, include a crash during 
the 1981 Michigan 500 in which he broke his right arm, and a stock car crash 
last year at Charlotte, N.C., in which he sustained a serious concussion. 
</P>
<P>
But the crash Sunday resulted in the worst injuries of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel he'll make it back behind the wheel to compete again if that's what he 
wants to do," said Tony George, president of the Indianapolis 500. "He's in 
good shape for a man 55 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been a fast healer," George added. "Whether or not he heals as 
fast at 55 as he did at 25, we'll know in a couple of months. But my impression 
is that he still heals pretty fast at 55." 
</P>
<P>
Foyt was in 14th place, a lap behind the leaders, when his car went off the 
rolling four-mile, 11-turn circuit at Elkhart Lake at the end of the main 
straightaway, drove over an embankment and into a grassy depression, crushing 
his legs. 
</P>
<P>
CART safety workers struggled for more than 15 minutes to pry the crushed front 
end off Foyt, before transporting him to Milwaukee by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue interrupted the race for about 90 minutes. Michael Andretti 
eventually won. 
</P>
<P>
The operation on Sunday at the Milwaukee County Medical Complex was to repair 
Foyt's left foot and dislocated left knee with a plate and screws, Stiehl said. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt also suffered a fractured left heel and a dislocated right ankle. A broken 
toe on his right foot was mended with a surgical pin, Stiehl said.

</P>
<P>
"He is conscious and starting to respond, but he is still in our intensive care 
unit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Geringer, 19, was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly 
weapon, Police Lt. Rich Molomy said. Geringer later was released after posting 
$22,000 bail, Molomy said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Albrecht had been taunting Raiders fans throughout the game. 
Then a Raiders fan walked over to him and punched him, knocking him to the 
ground. While he was on the ground he was kicked in the head.

FOOTBALL: GARDENA SOPHOMORE SAYS THE 31-0 VICTORY OVER USC LEAVES WASHINGTON 
WITH BRAGGING RIGHTS AND INSIDE TRACK TO THE ROSE BOWL.

<P>
These are the times that free men's souls. 
</P>
<P>
Old men. Young men. Huskies men. 
</P>
<P>
They had heard about what it was like to beat USC, these Washington players, 
but until Saturday on a sizzling-hot plastic field in absurdly unseasonable 
weather, none of them actually had experienced it. Even the fifth-year seniors 
in that postgame locker room had only talked about beating the Trojans and 
their guy who gets dolled up in a gladiator's skirt, and their band that plays 
one verse from the song "Conquest" over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Every other time these Huskies had heard that song, it carried the sound of 
defeat into their heads. This time, it was a death knell for USC and 
left-handed quarterback Todd Marinovich, who came ranked at the very top of a 
California prep recruiting class two years ago along with another left-hander 
named Mark Brunell. 
</P>
<P>
This was the day they said Marinovich would have several of, and now he has had 
one. This also was the day a lot of people in the Northwest have been saying 
Brunell, the Washington quarterback, was incapable of. 
</P>
<P>
On a day for the celebration of 100 years of Huskies football, the surprise was 
that Washington's defense could make the Trojans impotent and that Brunell 
would choose this moment for his coming-out party. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, it was a day for the Huskies to experience the kick of thoroughly 
beating USC, 31-0. With it came a cleansing rush of emotion that so enraptured 
Washington Coach Don James that he did something immediately after the game his 
wife, Carol, never had seen him do. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what he was doing at first," Carol said. "He went back behind 
the bench, and I thought he was going up into the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, James got as close as he could to the crowd and reached out for them, 
all the way back to the tunnel that leads up to the conference and locker 
rooms. When he got there, he was hit by a wave of emotion. Players ran to him, 
hugged him, pounded him on the back, slapped his hands and danced around him. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, after the screaming died down and they let the players out, 
James was still wiping away the tears when the press came in the room. 
</P>
<P>
Said he had something in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't sure what it was, but it might have been the blinding light of 
watching USC players leave the field scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain what it means to me, I can't put it in words and I wish I 
could," said sophomore Darius Turner, who scored two touchdowns and experienced 
a kind of redemption for a choice he made three years ago to leave Gardena and 
come north. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Turner's parents flew up for the game on a flight that 
included Marv Marinovich, the father of Todd. Turner's mother and father 
reported that the father of the quarterback was a proud papa who came to the 
hinterlands anticipating a USC victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great for a number of reasons," Turner said. "It gives us that inside 
track on the Rose Bowl, it shows us what we need to do to beat good teams, and 
me being from L.A. and all, well, it means I can go back home with a little bit 
of bragging rights, you know? 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about beating these guys and I've definitely planned on it. Now, 
I'm a part of a team that's done it, and that's what I came here to do. I 
didn't think I could ever feel this good. It's unbelievable. It was a great 
feeling beating UCLA last year in the Rose Bowl (during the regular season), 
but this tops that." 
</P>
<P>
This was what they had in mind when they planned a 100-year celebration of 
Huskies football around this game in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Hugh McElhenny and Nesby Glasgow come in and talk to us (Friday) 
night," said running back Greg Lewis. "They were sharing some Husky tradition, 
telling us what it's like to beat SC. 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing this for the Huskies of the last 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been that long, but for all the ones who suited up Saturday and got 
their first taste of a victory over USC, it was worth it, for crying out loud.

N.Y. TRACKS REQUIRE BETTER CLASS OF HORSE TO BRING BACK BETTORS

<TEXT>
<P>
An hour before post time on a sunny, cool midweek afternoon at Belmont Park, 
the fans are none-deep at the clubhouse admission gates. Vendors of programs, 
tip sheets and racing papers, interrupted only occasionally by customers, chat 
among themselves. The tomblike quiet of Belmont's vast lobby goes directly and 
chillingly to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
The horseplayers have fled to the off-track betting shops and simulcast 
facilities. Their migration is well-documented and the New York Racing Assn. is 
at a loss to win them back. The reasons are myriad: inept management; downward 
spiraling parimutuel taxes; the declining quality and increasing danger of 
public transportation; ludicrous marketing; discourteous help at every turn; 
expansion of simulcasting; the rise of lotteries and nearby casinos; the 
softening economy; the self-defeating practice of the six-day racing week and 
the year-round season . . . just to scratch the surface. The race track is left 
to the hard-core horseplayers, and their number shrinks steadily from year to 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, fewer than 14,000 were at Belmont on a recent Saturday for the 
Woodward Handicap, a race in which the nation's leading thoroughbred was 
entered. The weather was perfect. That card included the Grade I Futurity, one 
of the major 2-year-old events of what was once the Fall Championship Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The average weekday crowd count stops just past 7,000 since the NYRA's 
ill-conceived simulcast experiment at Aqueduct was aborted last week. During 
the error portion of the trial-and-error debacle in South Ozone Park, the 
audience at Belmont fell short of 7,000 on most weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Belmont is a great place to go to the races, its problems notwithstanding. 
It is no longer a place, however, where one often sees great racing or even 
consistently acceptable racing. 
</P>
<P>
Although much effort is expended to present large fields of substandard horses 
that are more betting fodder than horse races, there is no evidence of effort 
to improve the quality of day-to-day racing at NYRA's race tracks. The major 
portion of the NYRA racing program during the spring and fall meetings at 
Belmont is not appreciably different than it is during the winter at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
The barns at Belmont Park are full of horses that should long ago have been 
ejected from the grounds of a race track attempting to offer a bettable 
product. Yet they fill races such as Thursday's second, for $30,000 maiden 
claimers. It drew a vapid field of 20 abysmally untalented hoofed creatures, 
some as old as age 5. 
</P>
<P>
No horse should be permitted to race as a maiden in New York after having 
reached its fourth birthday. Neither of the 5-year-old starters won the race, 
which went to a 3-year-old first-time starter sent from Delaware Park for the 
easy score. 
</P>
<P>
Trainers from New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland have been 
sending horses to New York and winning races with increasing frequency and 
facility, which is exactly the reverse of the manner in which things are 
supposed to happen in Eastern racing circles. Friday's program, too typically, 
came complete with a pair of maiden claiming races, one for hopeless 
3-year-olds and up, the other for 2-year-olds whose owners have lost hope. This 
is parimutuel garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Horses such as these must disappear before the crowds reappear. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
A minimum claiming price of $25,000, now in force only at Saratoga, would be a 
reasonable starting point. Accompany that with the elimination of maiden 
claiming races and the requirement that a maiden must finish at least fourth 
within the first five starts of its career. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-month season would make such refinements in the racing program easier to 
achieve -- if anyone at NYRA is indeed interested in improving the only product 
it has to sell. A 10-month season and a five-day week would fit like a glove. 
And, perhaps, if NYRA presented racing upon which the players could bet with 
conviction, there would again be players betting at the race track.

Emmylou Harris says it takes hard work and discipline to sing pure country 
music and make it sound easy. 
</P>
<P>
"All you need is the tiniest movement," Harris said in a recent interview. 
"Simplicity and grace and unadornment are so difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Harris has sold more than 12 million records and taken home six Grammy Awards, 
more than any woman in country music history. 
</P>
<P>
"What not to play in country music is as important as what to play in country 
music. It's all understatement and how to work within that framework," she 
said. "People think country music is easy. It's not. It's very difficult."

The government today lifted a 16-year-old ban on the movie "Fiddler on the 
Roof," condemned by the former military regime for its alleged Marxist content. 
</P>
<P>
The new civilian government said its decree was necessary "because the nation 
has started a time of real implementation of the principles of democracy and 
freedom."
