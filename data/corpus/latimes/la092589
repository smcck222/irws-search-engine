BIRD VACCINES HAILED BY VETS AS A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first vaccines designed to shield exotic pet birds from two fatal viruses 
went on the market last week, with veterinarians hailing them as representing a 
breakthrough in avian medicine akin to the human polio inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there was no immunization for exotic birds, even though the viruses 
responsible for Pacheco's disease and Psittacine pox kill thousands of 
parakeets, parrots, macaws and related species each year, leaving thousands of 
pet owners heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Medical Breakthrough' 
</P>
<P>
Avian veterinarian Larry Nemetz, a bird specialist whose Santa Ana clinic was 
among the first to use the vaccines this week, described them as "a medical 
breakthrough in the bird market." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first recipient at Nemetz's clinic was a scarlet macaw named 
Alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
The large bird sidled to the far edge of the examining table, but Nemetz was 
too quick. Deftly, he swaddled the bird in an orange towel, stroked its head 
and plunged first one hypodermic into a feathered breast, then another. 
</P>
<P>
Alfalfa screeched. But it was over quickly, as Nemetz released the immunized 
bird to owner Patti Brittain. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor baby," Brittain cooed. "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of First in Nation 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Alfalfa was lucky: It was one of the first pet birds in the country 
to be vaccinated against Pacheco's and pox. 
</P>
<P>
A New England firm, Maine Biologic Laboratories, has had Department of 
Agriculture approval since last winter to market the vaccines, but the company 
-- accustomed to developing drugs for chickens and turkeys but not exotic birds 
-- only recently asked a veterinary business to distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
That firm, California Avian Laboratory, made its initial shipments of vaccine 
last week. And Nemetz, who runs the Bird In-House Rehabilitation and Diagnostic 
Clinic in Santa Ana, was among the first to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Rosskopf, an avian veterinarian from Fountain Valley, also ordered 
the vaccines. "We've been waiting for his kind of thing for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There have long been immunizations for poultry as well as vaccines for dogs and 
cats -- but none for pet birds, noted Dr. Susan Wells, a zoo veterinarian in 
New Orleans who is president of the 2,000-member Assn. of Avian Veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, she said, manufacturers have not considered the bird market a 
lucrative one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2.5 Birds Per Home 
</P>
<P>
But recently that has changed. A 1987 survey by the American Veterinary Medical 
Assn. estimated that 5 million U.S. households have pet birds, with an average 
of 2.5 birds in those homes. 
</P>
<P>
Avian vets say those figures vastly understate the count. "A lot of us believe 
there are 50 million pet birds," many of them in Southern California, said Dr. 
Alan M. Fudge, president of California Avian Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Fudge and other doctors said the vaccines mark a new era in avian medicine. 
They could prevent outbreaks of pox and Pacheco's when imported birds are in 
quarantine or in pet stores, and the vaccines offer some assurance to bird 
owners that their pets will stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Maine Biologic worked on vaccines for poultry for 32 years but 
ventured into exotic birds just two years ago at the request of importers, said 
Dr. Kenneth Eslen, the company's president. In a normal shipment of 500 
blue-front Amazon parrots that might retail for $1,000 apiece, "it's not 
unusual to lose 30% to 50%" to pox in the quarantine pens, Eslen said. 
</P>
<P>
But the vaccines, made up of dead virus cells, finally offer protection, Eslen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco's, named after the Brazilian veterinarian who discovered it in the 
1930s, is a highly contagious disease caused by a herpes virus that destroys 
the liver. 
</P>
<P>
It moves so rapidly that often there are few symptoms -- ruffled feathers or 
yellow droppings. But sometimes, Nemetz said, "The bird says 'Good morning,' 
falls off the perch and dies." 
</P>
<P>
The disease can sometimes be treated with the drug cyclovir, which is also used 
to treat human herpes, Rosskopf said, "but it's so devastating that by the time 
you figure out they have it, they're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he said, he diagnoses it after death. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Psittacine pox -- which affects birds in the parrot family -- is 
characterized by lesions around the eyes, but these can spread to the throat 
and internal organs, causing death. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets into an air pipe, the bird just suffocates," Nemetz said. "There 
is no cure. The vet just says, 'I'm sorry. This is the disease.' " 
</P>
<P>
But now, Nemetz and other avian veterinarians said, they can practice 
preventive medicine. Nemetz has telephoned some bird owners, letting them know 
about the vaccines, which he offers at about $18 for both shots. Each vaccine 
also requires a follow-up shot within eight weeks and an annual booster. 
</P>
<P>
Nemetz has also told pet store owners that he will inoculate their birds and 
give them a certificate of vaccination that the birds' new owners can have. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the reaction has been positive. Shelly Pollin, owner of Bird and Board, 
a store in Orange, said she will be vaccinating all her birds and, starting 
early next year, will demand that owners of all boarded birds show proof of 
vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
The new vaccines "are a relief," she said: "I have no experience with Pacheco's 
or pox -- luckily. But I know of people who have. It can be very deadly. It can 
spread quickly," wiping out a dealer's entire stock. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Nemetz's clinic, he vaccinated Alfalfa's companions, a 
green-winged macaw named Buckwheat and a blue-and-gold macaw named Sparky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nibbled Her Ear 
</P>
<P>
After the injections, they ruffled their feathers, strutted a bit on the 
examining table, then hopped over to Brittain to perch on her shoulder and 
nibble her ear. 
</P>
<P>
Brittain said she doubts that she will get another bird, so her three macaws 
will probably not be exposed to disease that way. 
</P>
<P>
But, she noted, her family often takes the birds to the beach, and she would 
not want to risk their health. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are like her children, Brittain said. "And I'm an overanxious mother. 
I wouldn't want to take a chance. . . . Like with children, the minute there's 
something new, I want it. I want the best."

U.S. FINDS WATER IN RYDER CUP; 
</P>
<P>
IN 14-14 TIE, AMERICAN CHANCES TO WIN GO KERPLUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus was not present Sunday at The Belfry, but the American players 
who were here as the 28th Ryder Cup sizzled and then fizzled to an 
anticlimactic conclusion no doubt could hear his words burning their ears. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus long has contended that pros on the U.S. tour today have a tendency to 
wilt under pressure because they so seldom experience it. Translation: The 
modern tour is so lucrative that players can win hundreds of thousands of 
dollars without having to win a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight time since 1985, the United States did not win this 
biennial tournament. Neither did it lose, finishing seven rounds of golf over 
three days in a 14-14 tie with the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
That is only the second time that the competition has ended in a tie since 
1927, when an English seed merchant named Sam Ryder donated the small gold cup. 
</P>
<P>
The result left both sides with an empty feeling, particularly the Americans. 
Even though they have a substantial lead in the series, 21-5-2, the Europeans, 
as a result of the tie, retain the cup in their tour headquarters at The 
Belfry. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans were so, so close to taking it home with them today on the 
Concorde. Trailing, 9-7, after two days of alternate-shot and best-ball play, 
they entered Sunday's 12 individual matches needing 7 1/2 points for the 
championship. Teams receive a point for a victory, a half-point for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
About halfway into Sunday's round, it appeared as if they would win all the 
matches they needed and then some. They were ahead in nine and tied in another. 
So desperate was the situation for the Europeans that a television commentator 
for the British Broadcasting Company began to make excuses. 
</P>
<P>
With no rain, or even clouds in the sky, no wind and temperatures in the 70s, 
how, he asked, could anyone expect the Europeans to win? It might have been the 
first time anyone has used the excuse that the weather was too good. 
</P>
<P>
But with no water coming from above on the tournament's first rainless day, the 
Americans went looking for it. 
</P>
<P>
They found it on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Americans who was leading at the time was Paul Azinger, a turn of 
events that stunned the Europeans. That was not because they disrespect Azinger 
but because they have so much respect for the man he was leading, Seve 
Ballesteros of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In a match in which the score changed on 11 of the first 15 holes, Azinger had 
a one-hole lead going to the par 4, 474-yard 18th and needed only to equal 
Ballesteros' score on the hole to win. 
</P>
<P>
So what did Azinger do? He hit his drive into the water about 250 yards off the 
tee. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for him, Ballesteros hit his drive into the right rough and then 
knocked his second shot into the water fronting the green. Both bogied, good 
enough for Azinger to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Americans a 3-0 lead for the day. Although Azinger was in the 
first pair to tee off, two of his teammates, Tom Kite and Chip Beck, made short 
work of their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Kite beat England's Howard Clark, 8 and 7, the most lopsided Ryder Cup result 
since 1953. In only 11 holes, Kite had six birdies and might have made another 
if the hole had not been conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Next up on the 18th tee was PGA champion Payne Stewart, who was even with 
Spain's Jose-Maria Olazabol. Into the water went Stewart's drive, soon followed 
by Stewart. He pulled his rain-suit over his trademark knickers and tried three 
times with his water wedge to hit the ball out, never getting farther than the 
bank before he conceded the hole and the match to Olazabol. 
</P>
<P>
Then came British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia, who was even in his match 
with Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty, the leading money winner this year on 
the European tour. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia hit his drive into the water, took a drop onto the fairway and hit 
another shot into the water that guards the green. 
</P>
<P>
Rafferty, who did not even have to hit a second shot before the hole was 
conceded to him, tried to console Calcavecchia but could not find the words. 
</P>
<P>
"What could you say?" he asked later. "He obviously choked." 
</P>
<P>
This has become a recurring Ryder Cup nightmare for the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Europe won for the first time since 1957 at The Belfry four years ago, 
Englishman Sam Torrance clinching the victory when Andy North hit his tee shot 
into the water on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
But the water does not have to be at The Belfry to sink the Americans. Three of 
them hit their drives into the water on the 18th two years ago at Muirfield 
Village in Dublin, Ohio, as Europe claimed a two-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
You might think that the Americans' non-playing captain, Ray Floyd, would have 
warned his players about the water on the 18th Sunday, but what could he say? 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at The Belfry, he lost his individual match when he went into 
the water on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the pressure," Floyd said Sunday. " . . . This is like major-championship 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
After England's Mark James beat Mark O'Meara, 3 and 2, the Europeans suddenly 
were in a 3-3 tie with the Americans and needed only two more points to clinch 
a tie. 
</P>
<P>
With Ireland's Christy O'Connor Jr. and Fred Couples tied on the 18th fairway, 
European captain Tony Jacklin told his man, "If you put him under pressure, I 
promise you you'll win." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor hit his second shot about four feet from the hole. Couples went into a 
green-side bunker, pitched out, two-putted for a bogey and conceded. He at 
least stayed out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, 41, was the last man selected for the team after Sandy Lyle withdrew 
because he has been playing poorly. His uncle, Christy O'Connor Sr., is one of 
Ireland's great players of all time, having won 13 points in 10 Ryder Cups. 
</P>
<P>
The nephew had played in only one Ryder Cup, 1975, and had never won a point. 
In fact, he had not had a victory of any kind since 1978. When he beat Couples, 
O'Connor broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Three times, Americans came to the 18th with chances to win or at least tie 
matches and lost. That became four straight when Ken Green bogied by 
three-putting. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Jose-Maria Canizares made a short par putt for the victory, Europe's 
fifth of the day and the one they needed to clinch a tie. Canizares, 42, the 
oldest player on either team, left the green in an embrace with his younger but 
more celebrated compatriots, Ballesteros and Olazabol. 
</P>
<P>
In the four remaining twosomes, all the Europeans needed was a tie in any of 
them to win their third straight Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But as the crowd of 27,000 began an early celebration, suddenly it was the 
Americans who began to apply the pressure. The Europeans proved that they have 
no magical formula to handle it, either. 
</P>
<P>
Tied after 17 holes, Mark McCumber parred and Scotland's Gordon Brand Jr. 
bogied. Tom Watson birdied the 17th to beat England's Sam Torrance, 3 and 1. 
Nick Faldo hit his drive into the water on the 18th and double-bogied, giving 
the hole and the match to American Lanny Wadkins. 
</P>
<P>
It came down to two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange against crowd 
favorite Ian Woosnam of England. Woosnam led by one through 15, but Strange 
birdied the final four holes to win by two and salvage a tie for the U.S. pros. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked forward to going back with the Ryder Cup on the Concorde," Floyd 
said. "I'm not going back with the Ryder Cup. But at least I'm not going back a 
loser."

RAIDERS TRAIL BIG EARLY, RALLY BIT LATE; 
</P>
<P>
BRONCOS ROLL TO 28-0 LEAD, THIS TIME HOLD ON FOR 31-21 VICTORY

DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having pulled off professional football's third-biggest rally in their last 
appearance, the Raiders arrived in Mile High Stadium Sunday apparently intent 
on breaking the record. 
</P>
<P>
They put on an amazing comedy of errors -- try two fumbled snaps, three 
interceptions, three consecutive holding penalties on tackle Rory Graves and a 
12-men-on-the-field penalty against the defense -- and fell behind, 28-0, but 
it was all for naught. This year's rally got them only to within 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Broncos held on to exorcise the ghosts of last year's game and won, 
31-21. 
</P>
<P>
"They just got that 21-point lead on us," Greg Townsend said. "Twenty-four? Was 
it 28? I'll get it right." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to count when the score is mounting so fast, but it's getting to be 
an occupational hazard for the Raiders in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, they fell behind, 24-0, and won in overtime, 30-27. It was Mike 
Shanahan's first game back as a Raider, and Jay Schroeder's first start. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, with the storm clouds of Al Davis' displeasure gathering above 
Shanahan's head, they came out convinced that they could throw on the young 
Bronco secondary and could reverse their fortunes on defense by attacking in 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? 
</P>
<P>
That fox, Dan Reeves, had his young secondary back off. 
</P>
<P>
That greyhound, John Elway, ran away from the Raider rushers. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't play very much man-to-man and that's what we wanted to catch them 
in," Mervyn Fernandez said. "When they played that three-deep zone, they 
dropped off, it seemed like 900 miles." 
</P>
<P>
On the first Raider possession, they marched smartly to the Bronco 45 . . . 
where Schroeder and center Dan Turk messed up the snap. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have pulled away too quickly because the clock was down to one 
second," Schroeder said. "I was trying to get the play off and he (Turk) was 
making line calls. The ball got on the ground and it got kicked forward." 
</P>
<P>
And a Bronco got on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Elway had his troops third and eight at the Raider 29. He 
dropped back. The rush came after him. He glided forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh geez," Al Davis moaned in the pressbox. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend got his fingers on Elway's shoulder pads but Elway ripped away, 
swooped upfield, got a good block at the five and dived into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the half went like this: 
</P>
<P>
Turk's shotgun snap to Schroeder goes wide. Broncos recover at the Raider 16. 
Three running plays make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos start their third possession at their 47. Sammy Winder runs for 
seven. Elway hits Mark Jackson on a deep post behind Lionel Washington for the 
last 46 and a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder gets crunched by linebacker Simon Fletcher and fumbles the ball away 
at the Denver 45. Six plays later, Elway beats another Raider rush, tearing 
away from Mike Wise who spins him around, throwing back across his body to 
Jackson, who is running away from him in the end zone and it's 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
What's a poor Raider to do? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the guys on this team aren't from here," Greg Townsend said. "One 
thing we mentioned at halftime was, we've been here before. We did show some 
character out there. We made it a game. I'm thankful for that. We did make some 
progress. I don't think we gave as much on the run as we had been." 
</P>
<P>
They did, actually, but the defense made some plays, too. 
</P>
<P>
On the first Denver possession of the second half, Elway threw a short pass 
right to Washington, the Raider cornerback who was rolling up into a zone and 
caught the Bronco quarterback by surprise. Washington caught the ball at the 
Bronco 22 and returned it down the sideline, cut inside Elway at the five and 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
On the second Raider possession of the fourth period, they caught Denver in 
something called "cover eight" and sprung Mervyn Fernandez open down the left 
sideline. Schroeder hit him at the Denver 34 and Fernandez outran the pursuit, 
completing a 75-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
"Cover eight is a cornerback up, a safety back," Fernandez said. "The 
cornerback bumps you, the safety picks you up. But they play their safeties so 
far inside, we knew we could hit them on the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
On the next Denver series, they forced the Broncos into a third-and-eight, 
launched a safety blitz, and saw Townsend, Elway's personal nemesis, arrive 
with a vengeance in Elway's face. In 1985, Townsend turned the game here with a 
sack of Elway that forced a fumble in overtime and set up the winning field 
goal. Last season, Townsend turned the Coliseum meeting with an interception 
that he ran back for a touchdown. This time, he forced a fumble that Linden 
King, just six days out of retirement, picked up at the Denver 15 and returned 
it for his first pro touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
That made the score 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had already lost one threat when their late-third-period drive 
reached the Denver 12, and went into reverse on Graves' three holds. Graves was 
a pleasant surprise at right tackle last season but his switch to the left 
side, where he doesn't have the tight end's help and is more exposed, has been 
a problem for him. 
</P>
<P>
They got one chance to tie the game, taking over at their 37 with 4:13 left. At 
third and five, Schroeder went back to pass and buzzed a short pass over the 
line to a receiver hooking up. Instead, he hit rookie safety Steve Atwater, who 
was no more than 10 feet away, guarding Marcus Allen and hidden from Schroeder. 
Atwater leaped into the air and speared the pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos took over at the Raider 36, ground it out to the 21, ran the 
Raiders out of timeouts, and set up David Treadwell for a 38-yard field goal 
that made it 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders took what consolation was possible in their comeback and their 
character but character isn't enough. They're 1-2, already two games behind the 
Broncos (3-0). For the third straight game, they gave up more than 150 yards 
rushing (the Broncos got 170), so their main problem is unsolved. Either they 
dam it up soon or they're going to get a lot of practice rallying.

RAMS LEAD PACKERS BY 31 AT HALF, NEED FIELD GOAL TO ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What exactly do you do with a 31-point lead? The Rams didn't know. They looked 
at it, coddled it, loved it. They spat and shined it. They sat it on a couch 
and analyzed it. 
</P>
<P>
They talked to it. It talked back. "We couldn't really lose this thing, could 
we?" 
</P>
<P>
Impossible. It's halftime. The game's over. You know it. The Green Bay Packers 
know it. 
</P>
<P>
But what about those voices? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, they did it last week, they did it last week," safety Vince Newsome told 
himself over and over. 
</P>
<P>
In the therapy session that was the locker room Sunday, the Rams could talk 
about their 41-38 victory over the Packers before 57,701 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed good to get it off their chests, the same chests that were heaving by 
game's end as the Packers nearly erased a 38-7 deficit completely, losing what 
would have been the game-tying touchdown when Brent Fullwood fumbled in the 
Rams' end zone with 11:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Was it ever in doubt? That depends on which half you saw. The first was so 
one-sided you wondered if the Packers would come back out. The Rams scored 28 
points in the second quarter. Greg Bell passed the 100-yard rushing mark in the 
second quarter on a 45-yard scoring run. Bell finished with 221, the 
fourth-highest total in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Harder to conceive was that the Rams needed every last one of his yards to 
clinch the game; Bell's breath-taking (his breath) 46-yard run in the final 
minute finally clinching it. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams can all read. They knew the Packers trailed New Orleans, 21-0, last 
week before rallying to victory. The Pack could do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Sure. 
</P>
<P>
"How many of you were writing your stories at halftime?" Coach John Robinson 
asked reporters. "So were we." 
</P>
<P>
But that was before the teams exchanged game plans. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Packers became Rams and Rams became Packers. Green Bay 
scored 21 points. The Rams scored none. Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowksi, 
who had three first-half interceptions, threw two scoring passes in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Ram quarterback Jim Everett, who threw two touchdown passes in the first half, 
had two crucial third-quarter interceptions. The Rams opened the second half 
with punt, interception, punt, interception, punt. 
</P>
<P>
The tide was shifting and the Rams couldn't stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone thought the game was won," said Newsome, who returned an 
intercepted pass 81 yards for touchdown in the second quarter. "In the first 
half we couldn't do anything wrong. Then, you could see it leaving." 
</P>
<P>
How a game was almost lost: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 38-14. The Packers scored on their first possession of the third quarter on 
a 18-yard pass from Majkowski to Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 38-21. This one took only three plays after Brian Noble stepped in front of 
an Everett pass and returned it 10 yards to the Rams' 22. Fullwood scored on an 
11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 38-28. On first down at the 20, Majkowski and Sharpe burned corner Cliff 
Hicks for 57 yards down the left sideline. With 2:34 left in the quarter, 
Majkowski tossed one yard to tight end Ed West for the score. The Packers have 
156 yards in the quarter, the Rams minus-five. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 38-31. Ken Stills intercepted an Everett pass at the Ram 45-yard line with 
56 seconds left in the quarter. Six plays later, Chris Jacke cut the lead to a 
touchdown with a 43-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson pulled Everett aside and tried to calm him. "He gave me a pep talk," 
Everett said of the conversation. "It was humorous. I think it was about some 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
Was this a time for jokes? The Rams couldn't win. On their next possession, a 
third-down pass for Pete Holohan that could have extended the drive hit referee 
Hendi Ancich over the middle and fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers got the ball back at the Ram 41 after a punt. Majkowski and Sharpe 
went after Hicks again, drawing a 40-yard pass interception penalty for 
first-and-goal. Green Bay was a yard from tying the score. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, expecting the touchdown, called his offensive unit together on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"He told the team that we were going to win the game," Bell recalled later. 
</P>
<P>
Did Robinson know something? On first and goal, Fullwood plowed up the middle, 
but fumbled when hit by Shawn Miller and Frank Stams. The ball rolled into the 
end zone and was recovered by Doug Reed, who couldn't believe the good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
It took that break to get the Rams going again. The Rams drove 52 yards on 12 
plays and made the score 41-31 on Mike Lansford's 45-yard field goal. The Rams 
exhaled. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little fear factor there," center Doug Smith said of the drive. 
"And a necessity factor." 
</P>
<P>
Good thing, too, because the Packers, who had suddenly been transformed into an 
offensive machine, drove 79 yards on their next possession and cut the lead to 
41-38 on a one-yard Fullwood run with 2:21 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers had two timeouts and the two-minute warning to stop the clock, so 
the Rams needed at least one first down to keep the ball and run the game out. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:13 left, Everett threw 15 yards to receiver Henry Ellard, who dragged 
his toes on the sidelines to keep both feet in bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams faced third and one at their 49 with 1:51 left when Bell took a pitch, 
("It was old reliable, Student Body Right," he said) and headed toward the 
line. Bell, however, cut back to the left and broke outside and down the left 
sideline for a 46-yard run to save the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a week for Bell. Tuesday night, he got food poisoning after eating 
Chinese take-out. The vomiting and pain were so acute he thought he needed an 
appendectomy. He took a few antacids but awoke at 2 a.m. and "couldn't walk." 
</P>
<P>
Bell admitted himself to the La Mirada Hospital emergency center, where it was 
he was diagnosed as having food poisoning. Bell missed Wednesday's practice and 
was weak all week. 
</P>
<P>
But in the game's last two drives, when the Rams needed him most, Bell rushed 
for 76 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said his lungs were aching from the smog, Bell plunged on, putting 
to rest maybe forever the shadow that followed him west from Buffalo, where his 
will was sometimes questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired," Bell said. "But if I had to go out there and run 10 more times, 
I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson called Bell's performance "outstanding," but fell short of calling 
Bell one of the great backs in the league. What exactly is great these days? 
Bell has rushed for 417 yards in three games and is averaging 5.5 yards per 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
"He does not fumble, and he runs hard when we really have to have it," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was more effusive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most underrated runner in the league," he said. "He's not flashy, 
he's not arrogant in the press. . . . A lot of guys were running on empty. If 
he runs like that on empty . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It was a day Bell will never forget, and one the Packers wish could have lasted 
five more minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should be embarrassed about the Green Bay Packers," Coach Lindy Infante 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Here are the top four rushing performances in Rams history: Eric Dickerson, 248 
yards vs. Dallas, 1985; Willie Ellison, 247 yards vs. New Orleans, 1971; Tom 
Wilson, 223 yards vs Green Bay, 1956; Greg Bell, 221 yards vs. Green Bay, 1989. 
. . . Dickerson's record performance was in a playoff game. His top 
regular-season game was 215 yards vs. Houston in 1984. . . . No one in the 
Rams' secondary could cover Sterling Sharpe. He finished with eight catches for 
164 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Where's the D? The teams combined for 882 yards in total offense. The Packers 
finished with 442; the Rams 440. . . . Packer quarterback Don Majkowski 
completed 25 of 43 passes for 335 yards with three interceptions. . . . Jim 
Everett was 19 for 31 with 238 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. 
. . . LeRoy Irvin returns from his 30-day suspension today.

The Koncak Syndrome is the talk of the National Basketball Assn.'s off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Atlanta signed free agent Jon Koncak to a six-year, $13.2-million 
deal, the Hawks gave Dominique Wilkins a five-year, $14.5-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Hubbard of Newsday quoted Wilkins on Koncak: "Let's put it this way. He's a 
very, very good friend right now." 
</P>
<P>
Is Koncak's salary inflated? He averaged 4.7 points and 6.1 rebounds last 
season. He will make $2.5 million this season, the same salary as the Lakers' 
Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Greener pastures: From Peter May of The Hartford Courant: "Dino Radja made 
approximately $9,200 playing last year for his club team in Split, Yugoslavia. 
The Boston Celtics signed him for the startling amount of $425,000 -- which has 
to be a record for a second-rounder -- and guaranteed it. No wonder he doesn't 
want to go back." 
</P>
<P>
Add May: "The Danny Ferry trade rumors are everywhere. The Clippers apparently 
want a shooting guard and at least one No. 1 for the ex-Duke star, who spurned 
them for Europe. The Charlotte Hornets (Dell Curry and two No. 1s), San Antonio 
Spurs (Willie Anderson and a No. 1) and Philadelphia 76ers (Hersey Hawkins and 
a No. 1) all reportedly are interested." 
</P>
<P>
Last add May: "(Bill) Fitch, by the way, hasn't been to New Jersey since he 
signed as coach several weeks ago. Maybe he's planning to stay in Texas and 
coach the Nets via satellite dish. At least that way he wouldn't have to watch 
them in person." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Sept. 25, 1982, Northwestern ended a 34-game losing streak with 
a 31-6 victory over Northern Illinois. Who starred for the Wildcats? 
</P>
<P>
Pooh-poohed: Inside Sports on former UCLA guard Pooh Richardson and the 
Minnesota Timberwolves: "After an unexpectedly productive haul in the expansion 
draft, they caught many off guard with the selection of Jerome (Pooh) 
Richardson (10th) in the college draft. Despite a breakthrough year at UCLA, 
Richardson was considered to be no better than fourth- or fifth-best point 
guard behind Tim Hardaway, Mookie Blaylock, B.J. Armstrong and Sherman 
Douglas." 
</P>
<P>
Add Richardson: David Aldridge of the Washington Post reports that Minnesota 
Coach Bill Musselman prefers free-agent guard Sidney Lowe to Richardson. David 
Rivers, claimed off the Lakers' roster, might be the odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
Age-old question: Inside Sports on the Lakers' Vlade Divac: "He rates among the 
world's best young players. Except that some believe he's 30, not 21 as he 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
Fitchburg State update: The Falcons lost their 34th consecutive game, 6-0, to 
Westfield State Friday night.

Quotebook: Chicago Cub broadcaster Harry Caray in Sport magazine, on rumors 
that he was fired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1969 because he had had an

MONTANA TAKES LUMPS, THEN STRIKES; 
</P>
<P>
49ER HAS FOUR FOURTH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWN PASSES TO BEAT EAGLES, 38-28

<P>
You can beat up on Joe Montana. But actually beating him is a little harder. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Philadelphia Eagles weren't in it at the end Sunday, losing to the 
San Francisco 49ers, 38-28, after sacking Montana eight times. 
</P>
<P>
Knocked around for more than 45 minutes at Veterans Stadium, Montana, the 
National Football League's quarterback of the 1980s, responded with four 
touchdown passes in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Montana, 33, took the game away from Randall Cunningham, 26, who is 
sometimes called the quarterback of the 1990s. Cunningham had the Eagles ahead 
after two quarters, 12-10, after three, 18-10, and in the fourth, 21-10 and 
28-17, before the deluge. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed 11 of 12 passes in the fourth quarter for 228 of his 428 
total yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's new coach, George Seifert, who replaced Bill Walsh this season, said: 
"Montana's coolness under pressure was the difference in a hell of a game 
between two fine football teams." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (2-1) were playing for field goals most of the afternoon, collecting 
four plus a safety and two touchdowns. The 49ers (3-0), their eyes on the end 
zone, got five touchdown passes from Montana. 
</P>
<P>
The five matched his 49er high on a day when he needed some courage to keep 
standing in against one of the NFL's rougher defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of the game," Montana said after taking a long series of brutal 
hits from Reggie White, Jerome Brown and the others in Philadelphia's quick, 
massive four-man line. "Everyone gets hit in this league." 
</P>
<P>
But not this often. And not this hard. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan, a defensive expert, aimed to win by attacking 
the 49ers up the middle, shutting down their running game and their short 
passing offense thereby forcing the defending Super Bowl champions to try to 
win with big plays -- or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's plan worked so well in the first three quarters that the 49ers gained 
only one yard running and but one touchdown passing. Montana had possession for 
only three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And even on Montana's first-quarter touchdown, the Eagles had almost every 49er 
plugged or otherwise defensed except flanker Jerry Rice, who outplayed Eagle 
cornerback Izel Jenkins on his way into the open. 
</P>
<P>
There, Montana, going down, hit him with a long pass on a 68-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers otherwise weren't a factor on series after series for three quarters. 
So, in the fourth quarter they threw out their game plan and went into a 
four-receiver offense, which most NFL teams are using this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, like most NFL teams, was defenseless against this. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't tackle," Ryan said. "We didn't get a rush on the passer." 
</P>
<P>
Thus in the end, Montana won with four kinds of touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
First, he threw into the flat to a single-covered split end, John Taylor, who, 
after Jenkins missed the tackle, sprinted untouched into the end zone for a 
70-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
Next, ending a 75-yard drive, Montana threw an eight-yard pass to a back, Tom 
Rathman, who was running free in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after taking his eighth sack, Montana threw to a tight end running a 
crossing pattern, Brent Jones, for 25 yards and six more points. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Rice got open again, and Montana passed to him on a 33-yard touchdown 
play. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Eagle offense played conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham didn't throw a pass in his first three series. And, time and again, 
the Eagles ran on first and second downs, forcing Cunningham to face 
third-and-long situations. 
</P>
<P>
Against the 49ers, Cunningham failed to consistently make first downs in such 
circumstances. Few quarterbacks can. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cunningham seldom ran. Although he led the Eagles in rushing, he 
gained only 52 yards on eight scrambles. This wasn't enough on a day when 
Montana outpassed him, 428-192 yards. Montana completed 25 of 34 passes and had 
one interception; Cunningham was 19 of 38 and also had one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert, like Ryan, is a former defensive coordinator. It's difficult to tell 
what Seifert's defense would have done had Cunningham attacked with rollout 
plays. But the 49ers didn't have much trouble with Cunningham in the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's most artistic scoring series came in the fourth quarter, in the 
midst of Montana's touchdown burst, when Cunningham passed twice on first down 
and twice on second, once reaching former Raider tight end Jimmie Giles with a 
well thrown 31-yard pass down the middle -- difficult to deliver accurately. 
</P>
<P>
He also passed three yards to Giles for the touchdown, despite having to wait 
until third down to throw. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles looked better in the preseason when Cunningham was calling the plays 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
And when Montana wasn't on the other side of the ball. The 49ers have lost last 
year's coach, but not last year's quarterback.

REDSKINS RUN OVER COWBOYS, 30-7;

<P>
WITH RIGGS OUT, BYNER AND MORRIS PICK UP SLACK FOR WASHINGTON

Even with Gerald Riggs, the National Football League's leading rusher, sitting 
out the second half with a bruised chest, the Washington Redskins still had 
little difficulty defeating the Dallas Cowboys, 30-7, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest Byner scored on his first run as a Redskin, a 12-yarder, and Jamie 
Morris scored a touchdown and gained 100 yards in 26 carries to spoil Jimmy 
Johnson's regular-season home debut as the Cowboys' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Joe Gibbs said he was a little worried when Riggs couldn't 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from having the biggest back in the NFL (Riggs at 232) to Morris (188) 
and he does the job," Gibbs said. "It was great to get Byner going, too. We had 
a good 1-2 punch in there." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was livid after the game and gave his team a dressing down. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a very good football team, as anybody who saw us play can see, and 
it's not a good feeling," Johnson said. "I told my players I will not accept us 
being a poor football team. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that anyone of them not willing to work to let me know and I'll 
find somebody who is willing to work." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the Cowboys, 0-3 and off to their worst start since 1963, will 
start working harder, beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll spend more time on the field and in meetings and running more after 
practice," he said. "We'll do anything we have to do to turn this thing around. 
</P>
<P>
"I want this team to remember how awful they are so they'll work to get better. 
The only way you move to a new level is by working. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't live with this and I can't let them live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas rookie quarterbacks Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh each were intercepted 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
"We just stunk up the field," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Aikman would start next week, although Walsh replaced him in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no controversy," Johnson said. "Walsh is still on the second team."

GIANTS LOWER THE BOOM, 35-7;

<P>
HOGEBOOM IS CUT OFF AT THE PASS AS CARDINALS TAKE A BIG FALL

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Giants are 3-0 and once again winning with defense. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Kinard returned an interception 58 yards for a touchdown and the Giants' 
defense forced six first-half turnovers in a 35-7 victory over the Phoenix 
Cardinals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Lawrence Taylor, however, cautioned that this Giant defense 
shouldn't be compared to the one of a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not like the defenses of the past," Taylor said. "We can't just line 
up. We have to work hard and force the turnovers. That's the way we start in 
the huddle. We talk about turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants did more than talk against the Cardinals (2-1). They intercepted 
four of Gary Hogeboom's first eight passes and recovered two fumbles to move 
into sole possession of first place in the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just three weeks, fellas," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said. "I'm under no 
illusions where we are. What's our turnover ratio, plus nine. That's why we're 
3-0." 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the game the Cardinals had been nearly perfect on offense, turning 
the ball over only three times while not allowing a sack against Hogeboom. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who came into the game with statistically the National Football 
League's second-worst defense in yards allowed per game, changed those numbers 
for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Besides four interceptions, the Giants' defense also sacked Hogeboom five 
times. One by linebacker Gary Reasons resulted in a third-quarter safety and 
another by Leonard Marshall was almost a safety. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the Giants had the game well in hand. They built a 20-0 halftime lead 
and did not allow Phoenix to score until the final two minutes on a 21-yard 
pass from Hogeboom to J.T. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
New York took a 7-0 lead on its first series with Phil Simms (11 of 21 for 202 
yards) hitting Stephen Baker on a 39-yard scoring pass play. 
</P>
<P>
It was Baker's first reception of the season and he turned it into a score by 
going the final 20 yards after breaking tackles by Roland Mitchell and Mike 
Zordich. 
</P>
<P>
Kinard, criticized by Parcells earlier in the week, stretched the lead to 14-0 
just 2:22 later by grabbing an overthrown Hogeboom pass and winding his way to 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix didn't score until 1:47 remained and Hogeboom passed 21 yards to J.T. 
Smith. Hogeboom finished 19 of 32 for 222 yards.

TOMCZAK PASSES TEST AS BEARS BEAT DETROIT

Chicago quarterback Mike Tomczak silenced some critics and impressed his coach 
Sunday in leading the Bears to a 47-27 victory against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak, who had completed only 40% of his passes this season, hit 17 of 25 for 
a career-high 302 yards to help the Bears improve to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears finished with 542 total yards while holding the Lions to 305. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike came out firing," Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said. "He gunned the ball and 
the receivers caught it." 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak is 19-3 as a starter for the Bears, 18-3 in regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
In leading Chicago over Detroit for the 10th straight time, Tomczak frequently 
victimized cornerback Jerry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great day passing-wise," Tomczak said. "It seemed like we were scoring 
on every possession out there. We knew we had to put some points on the board 
because they can be so explosive. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't anything we ad-libbed. We sent one guy long on almost every pass 
play. They got behind the defense and I was fortunate enough to get the ball to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harbaugh replaced Tomczak for the last five minutes and got the Bears' 
final score on a one-yard keeper. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Neal Anderson carried 16 times for 116 yards, including a 53-yard 
touchdown run, and Kevin Butler kicked four field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Barry Sanders, the 1988 Heisman Trophy winner, carried 18 times for 
126 yards and a touchdown before leaving with a hip pointer early in the third 
quarter. Quarterback Bob Gagliano ran for two touchdowns and Eddie Murray 
kicked two field goals for the Lions (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano completed nine of 19 passes for 126 yards with three interceptions.

BRONCO QUARTERBACK GETS RUNNING ATTACK IN GEAR

<P>
At first, it was vintage John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Broncos' quarterback ran for a touchdown and threw for two more in a 
31-21 victory over the Raiders Sunday at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Elway scrambled for a 29-yard touchdown run on the Broncos' first possession. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a designed play, but John has the option of running any time he sees 
fit," Bronco running back Sammy Winder said. "And it was wide open for him 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Pressured by the Raider pass rush, Elway ran out of the pocket, eluded defender 
Greg Townsend and dashed to the end zone. Elway pumped his right arm in 
celebration as he was mobbed by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I got to about the 10-yard line I saw that the end zone was open," Elway 
said. "I didn't even think about sliding (to avoid being tackled). It was open 
and I was going to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I got away from running last year, but I'm going to keep doing it. Today I 
made some plays that I haven't made in quite a while. I've still got some 
things I've got to do but I'm getting back to my old style." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves doesn't like Elway's old style. 
</P>
<P>
Although Elway is one of the best running quarterbacks in the National Football 
League, Reeves cringes every time Elway takes off. 
</P>
<P>
"When John gets out of the pocket nobody runs any better than John does," 
Reeves said. "He was hard to bring down. He was breaking an awful lot of 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"But the thing I'm disappointed in is that we've got to quit having him run. 
I'm not sure he has confidence that we're going to protect him." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Reeves likes it or not, Elway is going to keep on running. 
</P>
<P>
"It (scrambling) is part of my game," Elway said. "I've thought about it and 
I've stayed away from it, but four of the five (interceptions) I've thrown this 
year have been on plays where I usually would have run." 
</P>
<P>
Elway also passed well in the first half, hitting five of eight passes for 99 
yards, including touchdowns of 46 and 11 yards to wide receiver Mark Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Elway was on target to Jackson on his first touchdown pass, putting the ball 
between two defensive backs at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson thinks Elway is throwing better this season than he did last year when 
he had elbow and shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think injuries bugged him last year," Jackson said. "This year he's not 
injured. That's the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Elway had to improvise on the second touchdown pass because of some confusion. 
But Jackson broke off his pass pattern and Elway eluded Raider defender Mike 
Wise to find Jackson in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the wrong play from the sideline," Elway said. "When Dan signaled in the 
play I thought it was something else. And the Raiders had it covered because 
they were in a zone. But Mark did a good job of breaking his route off. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark does a good job of getting open and he has great instincts for finding 
the open spot. That makes him a great target on broken plays." 
</P>
<P>
Elway didn't see the end of the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit after I threw it," Elway said. "I was waiting for the crowd 
reaction, but once I heard the screams I was pretty happy." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said Elway also did a good job of improvising. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a weakness in their defense and John looked the guy off to the backside 
and I ran a post," Jackson said. "The Raiders were in double coverage and John 
got it to me." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half Elway had his problems. 
</P>
<P>
Elway set up two Raider touchdowns with an interception and a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Raider cornerback Lionel Washington intercepted an Elway pass and returned it 
32 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter and Linden King returned an Elway 
fumble 11 yards for a fourth-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Although he played an extraordinary first half, Elway was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you do some good things offensively and some lousy things the only thing 
you remember are the lousy things," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 28-0, at halftime, Elway and the Broncos turned conservative in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
After accumulating 195 yards of total offense in the first half, Denver had 98 
yards in the second half. Elway completed only six of 15 passes for 33 yards in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Broncos too conservative? 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't trying to be conservative," Elway said. "We felt good about what we 
were doing in the first half and tried to stay with it in the second half. But 
the Raiders had nothing to lose and they showed us some new stuff in the second 
half on defense."

RAMS 41, PACKERS 38; 
</P>
<P>
PACKERS FIND RAMS' BELL HARD TO STOMACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Until Sunday, Greg Bell's most memorable run came last week at his Anaheim 
home, when he sprinted from his dining room table to the medicine cabinet in 
search of a cure to foul fowl. 
</P>
<P>
He guzzled Pepto-Bismol. He popped down Alka-Seltzers as if they were grapes. 
Nothing worked, including his stomach. A few hours later, in the wee hours of 
Wednesday, Bell made his way into the La Mirada emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis: bad chicken in his Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
Bell was bed-ridden on Wednesday, queasy on Thursday, slightly stronger on 
Friday, better on Saturday and unstoppable on Sunday, as the Ram tailback 
rushed for a career-high 221 yards against the Green Bay Packers. And so what 
if the chicken was a bit undercooked; how about that fortune cookie? 
</P>
<P>
Bell carried 28 of the 33 times the Rams ran the ball. He averaged nearly eight 
yards a carry. He had runs of 45, 46, 17, 22 and 10 yards, among others. So 
concerned were the Rams, that he was escorted off the field by several team 
officials shortly before the game concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I was tired," he said. "But if I had to go back out right now and carry 
the ball 10 more times, I would still be able to do it because that's what I 
am, a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bell complained more about the smog than the Packers. Makes sense. 
Their defense wasn't half as thick or biting as the dense, dirty air that 
settled over Anaheim Stadium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"My chest is still hurting," Bell said. "I'm not a California boy. Back in Ohio 
(Bell was born in Columbus), we had fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
And he probably had replacement help, too. But not Sunday. Regular understudy 
Gaston Green was sidelined because of a hamstring injury. First-round draft 
pick Cleveland Gary, who was supposed to see limited playing time at both 
tailback and fullback, was scratched from the lineup because of an auto 
accident earlier last week. That left Robert Delpino, a novice at tailback, to 
help ease Bell's duties. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino didn't carry the ball. Buford McGee was handed the ball -- once -- and 
gained two yards. Ron Brown made a token appearance in the Ram backfield and 
didn't get an inch. Quarterback Jim Everett contributed minus-six yards to the 
Ram rushing effort. 
</P>
<P>
This was Bell's game and he was more than happy to have it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a situation where Greg Bell really wanted to play the best game he 
could play," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
You could see this sort of thing coming. After last week's game against the 
Indianapolis Colts, Coach John Robinson had grumbled openly about the absence 
of a Ram running game. It is the core of his offense and without it, he gets a 
little testy. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the Ram offensive linemen and running backs found themselves the 
center of attention during last week's preparation for the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to the drawing board," offensive tackle Jackie Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
And what they found was a disturbing picture, full of blown assignments and an 
unusual lack of physical dominance, a Ram trademark. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Bell &amp; Co. saw to that, a fact that didn't escape Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was pretty tired, but he just kept playing, just seemed to keep 
going and late in the game he seemed to have more energy. That's part of the 
criteria I would use in getting a player from the good range to the really good 
or great range. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I admire about him. He does not fumble the ball and he runs hard 
when we really had to have it." 
</P>
<P>
Bell's most important run came with less than two minutes remaining in the game 
and the Rams clinging to a three-point lead. With the ball on the Ram 48, Bell 
took a pitch from Everett, darted past several Packers and then broke free for 
a 46-yard gain. It clinched the game as Everett spent the next three plays 
dropping to a knee to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a situation where we just decided to run our old reliable, John's 
Student Body Right," Bell said. "It was going to be man on man, who wanted the 
yards, who's going to stop who. At that point, we looked at each other and 
said, 'We're going to get this first down and continue to let the clock run.' I 
don't think that if they would have had 13 men on the field they were going to 
stop us that play because we were determined to get that first down." 
</P>
<P>
Bell has 417 yards after three games, which is only 40 yards less than he had 
after five games last year, his best as a pro. So if Bell still is upset about 
his off-season contract problems, he has an odd way of showing it. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, at one point I had decided I wasn't going to play this season," 
he said. "But then I looked at it. I have a family to look at." 
</P>
<P>
He also had a good friend, Todd Bell, sit out an entire season because of a 
contract dispute with the Chicago Bears. The Bears won the Super Bowl that 
year. Bell doesn't want to make the same mistake of poor timing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't afford to sit out because this could be the year," he said. "I'm at a 
peak age in my life. I'm stronger, I'm faster than probably I was as a rookie. 
I've got the explosion and the biggest part of it is that I've got the 
knowledge to play tailback in the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say Bell is pleased with his two-year, $450,000 deal. He isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a great contract, by no matter," he said. "But you know, there's a 
lot of glory to come out of playing in the National Football League. And the 
things you take away from me now, you'll never be able to take the memories 
away from me when I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, then Bell might want to tuck Sunday's game away. It was one 
to remember.

Dave Parker doesn't seem to be enjoying Oakland's stretch run. To hear him tell 
it, winning the American League West title is a chore. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get it out of the way," Parker said Sunday after his two-run single 
in the fifth inning helped give the Athletics a 9-3 victory over the Minnesota 
Twins and put them another step ahead of the Angels. "We just want to get it 
behind us and go on." 
</P>
<P>
The A's could clinch as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The A's victory over the Twins combined with the Angels' loss at Cleveland put 
Oakland 5 1/2 games up with a week to play, reducing their magic number to two. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go home now and hopefully win the next two and kill the suspense and 
say, 'The hell with this,' " said Parker, who has batted .324 and driven in 18 
runs during the last 17 games. "We'd like to go out and get 27 outs and do it 
quietly." 
</P>
<P>
The A's play their final seven games at home, where they are 49-25. Their 45-36 
road record is the best in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
After Parker, who leads the team in RBIs with 95, gave the A's the lead, Jose 
Canseco hit a run-scoring single in the seventh, Dave Henderson singled home a 
run in the ninth and Mark McGwire followed with a three-run homer, his second 
of the game and 31st of the season. 
</P>
<P>
While Oakland has won with its veteran rotation, the Twins have lost seven of 
eight, with their four rookie pitchers going 0-6.

It wasn't Chuck Cary's intention to prolong the race in the American League 
East when he pitched seven strong innings to give the New York Yankees a 2-0 
victory over the Orioles Sunday at Baltimore. He wasn't out there to hurt 
Baltimore any more than he was out there to help Toronto. That's not his 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to win a game just so the Orioles don't win a pennant," Cary 
said. "One of my best friends, Bob Melvin, is in that clubhouse, and I'd like 
nothing more than for him to win it. But I'm pitching for myself. I've got to 
think about next year." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore is still thinking about this year. "We're one out with six games to 
go," said Oriole starter Jeff Ballard, the league's winningest left-hander. "I 
think it's still anybody's title." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard's record fell to 18-8 after he won seven of his last eight decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles dropped two of three to the Yankees this weekend, but remained one 
game behind Toronto as a result of the Blue Jays' loss at Milwaukee. The 
Orioles and Blue Jays each have six games left, including three in Toronto to 
close the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third time the Orioles lost a home series in 16 dates since 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 51,173 attended Baltimore's final home game of the season, giving 
the Orioles a record season attendance total of 2,534,875. The Orioles drew 
2,132,387 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 8, Toronto 3 -- Joey Meyer's three-run double broke a sixth-inning 
tie and sent the Brewers on their way to a victory over the Blue Jays in 
Milwaukee, keeping the Brewers' very slight playoff hopes alive in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Call the Brewers spoilers if you will. "Spoiler is a pretty good term, because 
in order to be a spoiler, you have to win," said Milwaukee Manager Tom 
Trebelhorn, whose team travels to Baltimore while Toronto heads to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little easier to swallow when the Orioles lose," Toronto Manager Cito 
Gaston said. "We just hope they (Milwaukee) do well in the next couple of games 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The third-place Brewers won two of three and pulled to within 5 1/2 games of 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's two-out drive hit the top of the left-field wall and put Milwaukee 
ahead, 5-2. Robin Yount singled with one out, Rob Deer walked and Greg Vaughn 
beat out a grounder to short. Meyer cleared the bases on a 3 and 1 pitch and 
chased starter John Cerutti. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Filer (7-3), gave up two runs on six hits in six innings. Chuck Crim went 
three innings for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, Seattle 1 -- Bo Jackson hit a two-run triple to keep the Royals' 
slim hopes of winning the West alive with a victory over the Mariners at Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, shut out on four hits in losing the first two games of the series, 
remained 5 1/2 games behind Oakland and pulled into a second-place tie with the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners made nine errors during the four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Detroit 2 -- Wade Boggs got two hits and scored two runs as the Red 
Sox won at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, trying to become the first player to get 200 hits and 100 walks in four 
consecutive seasons, has 197 hits and 103 walks. Lou Gehrig is the only other 
player to accomplish the feat three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a novelty than anything else," Boggs said. "It's something you 
can look back on during the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Chicago 4 -- Rookie Dean Palmer hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning 
to lead the Rangers past the White Sox at Arlington, Tex.

Wendy Bruce won the all-around title at the U.S. World Championship team 
trials, earning one of eight spots on a squad that will compete in the women's 
world gymnastics championships next month in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce, 16, of North Lauderdale, Fla., won the floor exercise with a score of 
9.662 points and placed second on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
She finished with a 75.539 score in the two-day trials at Arizona State in 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Brandy Johnson, ranked fourth in the world and the reigning U.S. champion, 
missed the trials with a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., won the U.S. Championships at Minneapolis 
in July and her 77.020 points counted for her score here. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 15 other competing gymnasts could top Johnson's total, so she made 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Johnson and Bruce on the U.S. team are Christy Henrich, 17, of 
Independence, Mo.; Sandy Woolsey, 17, of Tempe; Chelle Stack, 16, of Huntington 
Beach; and Kim Kelly, 16, of King of Prussia, Pa.

NEWSWIRE: SUNDAY SILENCE WINS SUPER DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday Silence won the $1-million Super Derby at Louisiana Downs by six lengths 
Sunday, setting up a horse-of-the-year duel with Easy Goer in the $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Returning from a two-month layoff, Sunday Silence covered the 1 1/4 miles in a 
slow 2:03 1/5, but the 3-year-old colt still dominated. 
</P>
<P>
Coming around the final turn, Sunday Silence was less than a length ahead, but, 
under Patrick Valenzuela, he pulled away as the field straightened for home. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-bred longshot Big Earl was second. Awe Inspiring, the second pick in 
the field of eight, was third. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, worth $600,000 to the dark bay son of Halo-Wishing Well, increased 
his career winnings to $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
After upsetting favored Easy Goer in the first two races of the Triple Crown, 
Sunday Silence finished second by eight lengths in the Belmont, then was upset 
by Prized in the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park in July. 
</P>
<P>
"If we win the Breeders' Classic, the choice will be hard," winning trainer 
Charlie Whittingham said of the horse-of-the-year award. "Easy Goer has the 
Eastern vote." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence paid $2.80, $2.60 and $2.20. Big Earl, who set much of the early 
pace, paid $7.80 and $2.20. Awe Inspiring returned $2.20 to show.

ADOLF WOLFLI: HIS ART EMERGED FROM MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1864, Adolf Wolfli was born in a small village outside of Bern, Switzerland. 
Orphaned at the age of 9, he was put to work as a laborer, and his unhappy 
childhood was followed by a failed career as a mason and a stint in the army. 
Socially isolated and withdrawn, Wolfli was sentenced to two years in prison at 
the age of 26 for the attempted molestation of two young girls. When he was 31, 
he was committed for life to Waldau, a mental institution near Bern, for 
molesting a 3-year-old girl. At Waldau he was diagnosed schizophrenic; four 
years after his arrival at the asylum, Wolfli's tragic story took a magical 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
He began to pour out the tormented workings of his memory and imagination onto 
paper. Drawing and writing obsessively, this untrained novice who'd had no 
known exposure to art hammered out a visual vocabulary of such originality and 
power that his body of work stands as one of the cornerstones of Outsider Art 
(the popular designation for art created by persons who, either by choice or 
fate, are isolated from society). 
</P>
<P>
In 1921, psychologist Walter Morgenthaler published a landmark monograph on 
Wolfli titled "A Mentally Ill Person as Artist," which presented the idea -- 
revolutionary at the time -- that the images Wolfli produced were not the 
ravings of a lunatic but were, in fact, art. That the rest of the world is 
coming to share Morgenthaler's views can be seen in the fact that "The Other 
Side of the Moon: The World of Adolf Wolfli" has taken up residence at the 
University Art Museum at UC Santa Barbara through Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
On loan from the Kunstmuseum in Bern where the Wolfli archives are permanently 
housed, the 85 works that make up the show -- a fraction of his output -- do a 
marvelous job of conveying the breadth of Wolfli's achievement. Working up 
until his death in 1930, Wolfli completed 25,000 pieces and went through 
several distinct periods; first-rate examples from each are included. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing one notices about Wolfli's work is how suffocatingly dense it 
is. Walking a tightrope between picturing and manic patterning, Wolfli 
constructed labyrinthine mazes with no point of entry or exit. Pulsating with 
organic life, his patterning -- which employs everything from clock hands and 
buildings to snails and birds -- is evocative of musculature one minute, an 
illuminated manuscript the next. 
</P>
<P>
Executed in plain and colored pencil on newsprint that was bound into books, 
Wolfli's largely autobiographical art was essentially an attempt to mythologize 
himself. Interspersing real facts from his life with fantastic tales of 
adventure that constituted the life he longed for, Wolfli chronicled scientific 
explorations and pleasure trips, personal disasters and redemption, tales of 
war and reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Encrusted with musical notation and beautifully scripted German text, his 
drawings also feature maps of cities from around the world, an occult numbering 
system, ideas for social and political reform, and investment strategies with 
interest calculations. Wolfli had a highly pronounced sense of order, and his 
detailed renderings of elaborately developed systems are widely interpreted as 
his defense against his chaotically schizophrenic interior life. Simultaneously 
perceiving himself as a persecuted child, an intellectual giant and a god, 
Wolfli had several different signatures for his work, including "Cast-Off 
Accident," "St. Adolf-Great-Great-God," and "Grim Casualty"; three or more of 
his identities often appear on the same drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Empty space terrified Wolfli and he rarely used perspective or attempted to 
depict three-dimensional forms in space, because such forms imply a surrounding 
emptiness. Ascending balloons, a favorite recurring motif, represent Wolfli's 
yearning for heaven, but alas, Wolfli had no faith that his sins would be 
forgiven and his balloons always plummet to earth. Unsociable and plagued by 
hallucinatory voices that were often violent, Wolfli gave further evidence of 
his conflicted inner life in his depiction of himself; the eyes of the male 
figure who appears in most of the drawings are dark, hooded and filled with 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
One of the many astonishing things about Wolfli's work is the fact that while 
all of his work bears his unmistakable stamp, no two works are remotely alike. 
The tonal range he got out of a simple lead pencil is astonishing, as is his 
feverishly inventive imagination. He had no musical training, yet he composed 
reams of music over the course of his life, and productions using Wolfli's 
richly cadenced text as librettos have been staged in Europe and the United 
States. Though he had no more than rudimentary training in math, numbers 
fascinated him and "Wolfli the Allgebrahtor," as he dubbed himself, devised 
impossibly complex formulas and equations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1915, Wolfli began constructing collages that combined his drawings with 
images cut from popular periodicals, and his unerring sense of composition 
really shines in these remarkably modern-looking works. However, the fact that 
he was using material not of his own design doesn't mean that he was emerging 
from his interior world; rather, Wolfli viewed the cutouts as little more than 
flat shapes that he recruited toward the completion of his life's work, which 
was to construct a universe so packed with static forms that there was no room 
left for chance or desire.

Singer-actor Pat Boone is expected to have his broken jaw set today) at UCLA 
Medical Center, where he was being treated for a bad fall from his bicycle. 
Boone, 55, was injured about 7:35 p.m. Saturday when the front wheel of his 
bicycle became caught in a steel grating on a Beverly Hills street, not far 
from his home, police said. "He flipped head first over the handle bars, 
breaking his jaw and suffering lacerations," said Beverly Hills Police Lt. 
Miles Lee. He was transported by paramedics to UCLA Medical Center. Hospital 
spokesman Richard Elbaum said Boone was in good condition Sunday and would 
likely be released from the hospital early in the week. "He's walking around 
and the nurses tell me he's doing really well," Elbaum said. The entertainer is 
a born-again Christian whose fortunes have risen and fallen with the changing 
times. During the 1950s, when ballads were popular, he recorded several hits, 
including, "Love Letters in the Sand," "Friendly Persuasion" and "April Love."

Walt Disney World is facing charges involving the abuse and killing of wild 
birds, the Orlando Sentinel reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said workers at the Florida theme park's Discovery Island fired a 
rifle at hawks, beat vultures to death with a stick and destroyed the nests and 
eggs of egrets and ibises. The workers said the supervisor at the 11-acre 
zoological park sanctioned the alleged abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The two-month investigation has resulted in 16 state and federal charges 
against Disney and five employees, most involving the deaths of vultures 
crammed into a tiny, overheated shed for days with limited food and water. 
</P>
<P>
Disney had no comment Sunday on the report. Claudia Puig

ALL-RODRIGO CONCERT OPENS LA JOLLA SEASON 
</P>

<P>
LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Nee and his La Jolla Civic-University Orchestra inaugurated the fall 
season with a curious all-Rodrigo program Saturday night at UC San Diego's 
Mandeville Auditorium. Although most local music organizations don't get in 
gear until mid-October -- some are even waiting to begin after the Soviet arts 
festival does its damage -- the La Jollans bravely set the pace. 
</P>
<P>
An entire concert devoted to Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo, whose aversion 
to dissonance is nearly equal to that of the typical orchestra board member, is 
hardly typical of Nee's programming. Over the years, music director Nee has 
favored unjustly neglected large-scale works and avant-garde orphans only a 
composer could love. After some 20 years on the La Jolla podium, Nee evidently 
is not willing to be bound to any pat formula. 
</P>
<P>
For this program, the orchestra was appropriately scaled down to a generous 
40-piece ensemble. After a respectable reading of the opening "Soleriana," a 
sugar-coated orchestral dance suite, the evening devolved into a series of star 
turns for various guest performers. Soprano Laurie Romero gave the four 
orchestral songs, "Quatro Madrigali Amatorios," a rousing, stylish 
interpretation that made the audience wish to hear much more of this brilliant 
young singer. With impassioned declamation and sympathetic phrasing, Romero 
made these Andalusian folk melodies shimmer. And her bright, full voice with 
its slightly dramatic edge flaunted the fioritura of the final song "De los 
alamos" with coquettish abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Pile and Alexander Dunn, two promising local guitarists, interpreted 
Rodrigo's signature works, the "Concierto de Aranjuez" and the "Fantasia para 
un gentilhombre" with more equivocal results. Pile projected a confident, 
brightly articulated approach to the "Concierto de Aranjuez," and the orchestra 
gave a solid accompaniment to this staple of the classical radio airwaves. 
While Pile gracefully negotiated the intricate traceries of the lyrical middle 
movement, he lost some of his momentum in the finale. This did not prevent him, 
however, from playing a Rodrigo work for solo guitar as an encore. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Fantasia," Dunn was too cautious, too reserved to make his own case for 
the familiar concerto. He displayed a supple technique, but he appeared lost in 
his own musical thoughts, too frequently ignoring the orchestral accompaniment. 
Since it was the orchestra's poorest showing of the evening, he might be 
partially forgiven for such retreats, but it contributed to a fragmented, 
inconclusive performance.

BANDO MITSUHIRO KAI PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By -- LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 20th anniversary program by Bando Mitsuhiro Kai began auspiciously in the 
Japan America Theatre Saturday night with Mitsujiro and Hideko Bando 
(distinguished guests from Japan) joining Mitsuhiro Bando in the ceremonial 
"Shiki Sanbaso." Here the meticulous technical control and expressive purity of 
Japanese classical dancing were evident in each tiny inclination of the head, 
every formal deployment of sleeve or fan. 
</P>
<P>
The performance ended, some three and a half hours later, with "Gion No 
Yozakura," in which one sober, gestural duet by Hirochizu and Hiroteru Bando 
distilled the exquisite stylization of womanhood at the heart of the eight-part 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Kabuki is, of course, an all-male art -- but Kabuki concert dance glories 
in its women. Indeed, this showcase for the dance school that Mitsuhiro Bando 
founded 20 years ago in East Los Angeles managed to include one piece 
dramatizing female superiority ("Onna Date," with Yukiko Sasaki triumphing in 
formalized combat with Kanjiro and Kiyoshi Bando) and one feminized version of 
a Grand Kabuki masterwork. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, "Renjishi" shows a father lion educating his son. In their first 
scene, lionhood is presented obliquely but later the characters reappear to 
prowl the stage wearing eight-foot-long manes. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, however, Hideko Bando portrayed a mother lion opposite a high 
school student from Torrance who was granted the stage name of Hidesomi Bando 
only this April. Thus the imitative and instructional action of their duet 
assumed a new significance. And if the spectacular mane-swirling that forms the 
climax of "Renjishi" was missing, Hideko Bando's powerful dramatic focus gave 
each stamp and head-toss true leonine majesty. 
</P>
<P>
Dances celebrating different types of flowers and different types of women 
completed the program -- many featuring younger members of the Bando Mitsuhiro 
Kai. Taped music accompanied the dancing. -- LEWIS SEGAL

BARBAGALLO IN RECITAL AT UCLA PIANO FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Personal charm and musical blandness marked James Barbagallo's latest Southland 
performances. And his substantial and sensibly paced program did not mitigate 
the lack of character in his playing at the final recital in a series offered 
by young Americans, and given in connection with the UCLA Piano Competition and 
Festival, in Schoenberg Hall Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, that program began with Schumann's quirky but practically 
irresistible G-minor Sonata, crested on three liquescent pieces by Debussy, 
flirted briefly with Chopin and ended on the upbeat rhetoric of Samuel Barber's 
familiar Sonata, Opus 26. Too bad Barbagallo made so few distinctions between 
these works, flattening out their contrasts and minimizing their stylistic 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
The instrument on which he played did not help; in most moments, its apparently 
limited range of colors -- one noticed the same limitations at David Buechner's 
recital on Wednesday -- failed the composers' intentions. Inner voices either 
lacked life or became outspoken; complex lines blended inappropriately, 
becoming single, simple musical threads; the entire performance suffered from 
monochromy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the bulk of the blame must reflect Barbagallo's own pianistic 
personality. The old maxim, "What you are is mirrored in your performance," 
applies here: Barbagallo appears to be a nice man, a competent technician and a 
musician without strong feelings. This experience became perfectly pleasant, 
but not memorable. Oddly enough, it was greeted with cheers and bravos by the 
friendly audience in Schoenberg Hall. 
</P>
<P>
And there were glimmers of hope in certain poignant moments in Chopin's 
Nocturne in E, Opus 62, No. 2, and in the single encore -- he could have taken 
two more; why didn't he? -- Grieg's Notturno in C, Opus 54, No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
But even here, Barbagallo didn't integrate the materials tightly, or find all 
their urgency, or escape his comfortable niche of emotional flabbiness.DANIEL

ELLEN FULLMAN PLAYS HER LONG STRING INSTRUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By -- JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a peculiarly American type of composer/performer, for whom the 
creation of music is a do-it-yourself affair from the ground up. Harry Partch 
and John Cage are patron saints of the musical tinkerers, whose on-going 
tradition is honorably represented locally by Brian Ransom and others. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessean Ellen Fullman, lately of Austin, Texas, is another in this lineage. 
Friday she and Daniele Massie demonstrated her Long String Instrument in a 
Sonic Series concert at LACE, co-sponsored by the Independent Composers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
The Long String Instrument is just that, wire strings in three clusters running 
the length of the LACE performance gallery. At one end they are fastened to 
resonating boxes, from which comes an earthy and surprisingly loud buzzing -- a 
sound somewhere between bagpipes and a quiescent beehive. 
</P>
<P>
The strings are waist high, and easily set vibrating, as many in the audience 
proved after the performance. Clamps at precisely measured points give each 
string a pitch, in a strict proportional tuning, reflected in a graphic 
notation Fullman has created, which indicates both the string relationships and 
the movement of the performers. 
</P>
<P>
Fullman's concert was of a single, long, multi-sectional work, untitled. She 
and Massie paced between the string clusters like rapt acolytes in a very 
serious rite, stroking the strings with rosin-covered hands. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, her music is both intense and serene. The attractively eerie, 
acoustically unstable droning suggests urgency, while the slow formal 
development of the piece invites an intuitive, suspended-intellect sort of 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The work Friday grew denser in texture, more active in rhythm throughout, then 
closed in a short denouement as Fullman and Massie retreated almost the length 
of the instrument. The nature of the instrument seems to emphasize the 
fundamental pitch and its nearest neighbors in the harmonic series, creating 
balance problems. But the dense, live sounds of a single string are complex 
enough to sustain a type of acoustic polyphony in themselves. -- JOHN HENKEN

'FRANKIE AND JOHNNY': MAKING A ONE-NIGHT LOVE LAST LONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That irresistible couple, Frankie and Johnny, are back in Southern California 
and what's amazing is how durable these middle-aged klutzes are. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Terrence McNally may have written a relatively slight piece in 
"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" -- the retelling of a one-night 
encounter between a short-order cook and a waitress who work for the same New 
York City joint -- but he has crafted it with uncommon skill and perception. 
</P>
<P>
In the play's current incarnation, which opened Saturday on South Coast 
Repertory's Second Stage in Costa Mesa, Karen Hensel plays the pudgy, pragmatic 
realist Frankie, who's happy for the roll in the hay but now wants her 
apartment to herself again, thank you -- and Richard Doyle portrays Johnny, the 
incurable romantic from Brooklyn Heights who spouts Shakespeare, is sure he's 
found his life's mate, won't stop talking and absolutely will not leave. A 
likely story? Love stories rarely are, but McNally -- and South Coast veterans 
Hensel and Doyle -- know how to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
The play starts at the end of the beginning, with the sounds of love-making in 
the dark (audiences intimidated by nudity, explicit language and sex are fairly 
warned), but it's all much tamer from there. It goes on to become a long night 
of sparring, wooing, snapping, reeling, ranting, cooking, confessing and 
ultimately connecting. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first act, you feel that you've watched a satisfying 
one-acter that's also a terrific workout for a pair of good performers. What 
could another act bring? The real goods. 
</P>
<P>
If Act One is mostly fun and games, Act Two brings on fiber and sinew. That's 
what lifts "Frankie and Johnny" out of the realm of the ordinary two-character 
knockabout and makes it a provocative, engaging play. Act Two is where we get 
to know these people, even as they get to know each other. The real Johnny: an 
ex-boozer, the product of foster homes, nursing the wounds of an earlier failed 
marriage and the shame and surrender of his two kids to life with his ex-wife's 
wealthy new husband. Frankie: a would-be actress made cannily wary of love and 
happiness by some rotten experiences with a violent man. 
</P>
<P>
There may be nothing all that exceptional about a past littered with such 
prevalent incidents, but it is in the quality of the confessions, the 
forthrightness of the writing, the careful skirting of sentimentality in favor 
of candor and true romance that the distinction lies. There is nothing in 
memory quite as unprepossessing and unforgettable as the final image of these 
two ordinary folks listening to Debussy's "Clair de Lune" on the radio as the 
sun comes up, pensively brushing their teeth, and reaching across an eternity 
of kitchen countertop to touch fingers . . . 
</P>
<P>
Director Warner Shook has seen to it that Hensel and Doyle play the energy (in 
his case) and the negativism (in hers) without lapsing into mawkishness. 
Hensel's Frankie is pugnacious and untidy, with just enough vulnerability 
showing under the gruffness, like a slip below the hemline. Doyle, in the 
tougher job, has to bluster and battle his way through to winning her heart. 
"You're so . . . sincere," she barks at him at one point. Who can withstand so 
much of that? But Doyle, like some dogged kitchen Quixote, never lets go of his 
impossible dream. And wins. 
</P>
<P>
John Iacovelli designed the cluttered one-room walk-up, but it is Brian Gale's 
lights -- from the different drab areas in the room, to the silver-blue 
moonlight filtering in -- that truly make it. Costume designer Ann Bruice's job 
was easiest: boxer shorts and undistinguished (on purpose) robes. 
</P>

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'LIFE'S BODY' OPENS SEASON FOR FILMFORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Filmforum begins its fall season at LACE tonight at 8 with Corinne Cantrill's 
uniquely powerful "In This Life's Body" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a life-threatening illness, Cantrill, whose work with her husband, 
Arthur, has established them as Australia's most distinguished experimental 
film makers, decided to tell us about herself via snapshots (and snatches of 
home movies) accompanied by her own spoken narration. 
</P>
<P>
This austere approach could quickly prove a bore if the subject were a lesser 
person, but this reflective and candid woman, now 60, emerges in her own 
process of self-discovery as thoroughly extraordinary, an individual who from 
early age has embraced life fully, turning her back on a difficult childhood, 
disregarding convention and at last discovering that her true calling was film 
making. 
</P>
<P>
Her story is a record of bohemian life in postwar Europe and later in Sydney. 
Now a vibrant, plump Earth Mother, Cantrill is oblique about the nature of her 
illness; the point is that she confronted it in her own courageous way, 
refusing major surgery in favor of alternative therapies. Since completing this 
film, the Cantrills have made more films and won fresh honors. Information: 
(714) 923-2441.

NOT MUCH PUNCH TO 'MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight at 9 on NBC (channels 4, 36, 39), it's the movie named after a '60s 
song of the week: "My Boyfriend's Back." And, yes, if you watch it, you're 
gonna be sorry. Hey-la, hey-la. 
</P>
<P>
No, this is not a docudrama about the girl group, the Angels, that briefly hit 
it big with the title song back in 1963, but rather a comedy-drama about the 
fictional Bouffants, played for maximum cuteness by TV stars Jill Eikenberry, 
Sandy Duncan and Judith Light. 
</P>
<P>
Fiction is truly duller than truth as a TV executive (guess which network) 
tracks down the three middle-aged Bouffants, whose collective hair, if not 
their egos, has deflated over the years, reuniting them for a live TV nostalgia 
special to be titled "The Warholians Who Wouldn't Go Away" -- er, "My 
Boyfriend's Back." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the network exec as a self-serving, dimwitted hunk (which makes you 
wonder about NBC's self-image), John Sanderford mutters such things as: "My 
entire television career is riding on my promise to deliver the Bouffants!" 
This makes him sound more like a desperate French caterer than a brilliant 
media VP. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts are welcomed by Duncan, who's become a housewife, and Light, who's 
carried the singing torch to new lows at a bowling alley lounge -- but thwarted 
by Eikenberry, who is an executive herself now reluctant to look back at her 
high-haired past. 
</P>
<P>
Eikenberry is a high-powered professional not unlike the one she plays on "L.A. 
Law," only here she sports a much worse makeup job (which may be intentionally 
ironic, since she's supposed to be a cosmetics firm VP but probably isn't) and 
is cold, unavailable and secretly insecure. Do we sense some tearful 
reconciliation and girlish rediscovery coming on here? Do we sense a pillow 
fight approaching? 
</P>
<P>
A few actual oldies stars, including Mary Wells and Gary Puckett, make cameos, 
but writer Lindsay Harrison and director Paul Schneider show no sense of 
authenticity or affection for the period(s) -- the early 1960s or the late 
1980s.

Chinese art prodigy Wang Yani, who first took up a paintbrush when she was 2 
and had her own exhibitions at museums in China by age 6, gave her latest 
painting to the city of San Francisco. "Impressions of the Zoo," painted by the 
14-year-old in the Chinese xieyi, or idea writing style, depicts a flock of 
flamingos she admired at the zoo. Exhibits of Wang Yani's work will be 
displayed in several U.S. cities during the next few months. The teen-ager from 
Guangxi province already has had exhibits in Britain, West Germany and Japan.

A preliminary autopsy report indicates that a murder suspect killed in a 
shoot-out near Los Banos shot himself in the head, FBI officials said in 
Fresno. David Polson, 41, was shot and killed Wednesday after he brandished a 
gun at agents who had chased him eight miles from a restaurant. Authorities had 
been tipped to his whereabouts after the case was featured Sept. 10 on the 
television show "America's Most Wanted." Polson was wanted on an indictment 
charging him with the murder of his live-in girlfriend, who disappeared 
Christmas Day, 1986. Her body was found Jan. 18, 1987, dumped along a road 
north of Las Vegas.

California has dumped 100 to 200 unsupervised prison inmates each month for the 
last three years in the Reno area without any notice, state and local officials 
have charged. Nevada Atty. Gen. Brian McKay said, "It's a crappy way to conduct 
law enforcement, especially between two sister states." He said he has called 
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to complain. The inmates are paroled 
from the California Correction Facility in Susanville, hauled by van into Reno 
to either the airport or the bus station where they are supposed to take 
transportation to their homes -- usually the Los Angeles area. The inmates are 
supposed to report to their parole officer in their hometowns the next day. 
Dist. Atty. Mills Lane and Reno Police Chief Robert Bradshaw, in a Reno 
Gazette-Journal article, said a person just passing through can commit a crime 
and run. "Those people are almost impossible to catch," Lane said.

Haiti's military government announced that the country will hold general 
elections next year, transferring power to a civilian president. It will be 
Haiti's first presidential election since Jan. 18, 1988, when civilian Leslie 
Manigat was elected in balloting widely regarded as rigged by the army. Manigat 
was ousted in a military coup five months later. The government of Lt. Gen. 
Prosper Avril said the elections will be held in two rounds -- on Oct. 17 and 
Nov. 11, 1990. Avril, who took over in a coup that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri 
Namphy, has said repeatedly that he is heading a transition government that 
eventually will relinquish power to civilians.

The Legislature might be gone for the year, but rats are still roaming the 
Capitol. Four "formidable-sized rats" have been trapped in the last few days, 
says Bob Connelly, the Capitol's administrative officer. "We've always had 
mice, as well as crickets and wasps," he said. "But the rats were kind of like 
the Phantom of the Opera. . . . It was like the Loch Ness monster, where 
everyone knew someone who had seen it, but nobody had actually seen it 
himself." A pest-control firm was hired and set traps and put down a 
rodenticide, he said. Three rats were trapped and killed in the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee room and another was found in the basement, Connelly said.

Two weeks after Hungary opened its border with Austria to East German refugees, 
arrivals in West Germany reached nearly 20,000 with no apparent end in sight. 
Austria reported more East Germans in transit from Hungary to West Germany. And 
another 900 East Germans are occupying Bonn's embassies in Prague, 
Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw, Poland, demanding passage to West Germany. The Bonn 
government's earlier estimate that 100,000 East Germans could emigrate or 
escape to West Germany this year was exceeded by mid-September, and officials 
now say the exodus could reach as many as 200,000 by year's end.

Chinese exiles meeting in Paris chose former government official Yan Jiaqi and 
student protest leader Wuer Kaixi to lead an international movement to end 
Communist rule in their country. On the final day of a three-day inaugural 
meeting of the Federation of Democracy in China, delegates elected Yan as 
chairman and Wuer as vice chairman. Yan, 47, a former director of the Institute 
of Political Science and adviser to ousted Chinese Communist Party leader Zhao 
Ziyang, is on China's most-wanted list. Wuer, 21, is one of the best known of 
21 student leaders accused of "counterrevolutionary crimes."

A reformist bloc of Soviet lawmakers adopted a platform that calls for allowing 
ownership of private property, letting market conditions set prices and and 
freeing television of government control. The 345-member bloc in the Supreme 
Soviet, which convenes a new legislative session today, also drafted a bill 
that they say could lead to the formation of non-Communist political parties. 
The group's platform emphasizes new laws to guarantee human rights. It includes 
the freedoms to publish, strike and travel freely. Soviets now must obtain 
permission to move into desired urban areas such as Moscow.

China's Communist Party Central Committee will meet next month to ratify a 
detailed economic policy that will chart the country's course for the next two 
years, the New York Times reported in today's editions. The meeting will also 
decide the fate of ousted Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, 
Chinese officials told the newspaper. Most people in the central party 
apparatus believe that Zhao, who was sympathetic to pro-democracy student 
demonstrators whose protest movement was crushed, will be vigorously denounced 
but will not face a criminal trial, the newspaper reported.

3 SLAIN ON POMONA STREET BY HAIL OF BULLETS FROM TRUCK 
</P>

<P>
Friends and relatives of Cornelio Perez Ruiz sat stone-faced Sunday under a 
lemon tree on the quiet, sun-baked cul-de-sac in Pomona where earlier the young 
man and two friends had been shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who turned 18 a week ago; Vincent Salazar, 20, and Eduardo Cruz, 17, 
were gunned down outside Perez's home on Lee Place about 2 a.m. Sunday as they 
walked home from a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were seeking three to six armed men riding in a small truck 
who had argued with the three victims at the store, then opened fire on them 
with pistols and a semiautomatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"My son was a good boy," Primitivo Perez, 66, said in Spanish as he sat in a 
folding chair on his front lawn, a straw hat shading his face. "And now they 
took him from me. What can I say? I know nothing. I do not know why this 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The victims did not appear to be affiliated with a gang, police said. But 
detectives suspect that the gunmen may belong to one of the four or five local 
Latino gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence is nothing new in the city of 121,000 residents 35 miles east of 
Los Angeles. Two people were killed and five injured in two days of gang 
shootings in January, prompting the arrest of 36 people. Territorial wars among 
Latino gangs in Pomona have been common for years. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sunday's triple homicide shattered a calm of many months and left 
an air of unease among residents in the neat tract houses of south Pomona where 
the victims had lived -- and died. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Perez, who had just returned from a weekend trip to Mexicali to learn 
his son was dead, was surrounded by friends and relatives Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Perez said, someone had fired a shot into his home. For 
some time, he has been trying to sell his house to move back to Mexico with his 
wife after 35 years in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors, many of whom had been awakened by the shootings, expressed 
surprise that violence had reached their community. But others said they saw it 
coming because the corner where the Perez house sits was becoming a youth 
hangout. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are a lot of gangs in the area, but it's the first time it's come 
down this little street," said a resident, who would only identify herself as 
Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the type you'd see and right off the bat know they were gangs," said 
another neighbor, a county worker who asked not to be identified. "It was just 
an invitation for someone to come by and start making trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Perez was a student at Garey High School, his friends said, while Salazar 
worked at a bottling plant in Lakewood. Additional information about Cruz was 
not available. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows gang violence plagues all communities," Pomona Police Lt. Larry 
Todd said. "Nobody's immune. That's the sad part." 
</P>
<P>
Four other people died in gang violence in the county late Saturday and early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* Samuel White, 15, was killed when three to four men shot him and a 
15-year-old girl as the victims stood on a street corner in South Los Angeles 
about 9:40 p.m. Saturday, police said. The girl, Eve Thornton, was hospitalized 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
* Jose Ortiz, 15, was killed and two others wounded when a gunman opened fire 
at a wedding anniversary party in East Los Angeles at 11:10 p.m. Saturday, 
sheriff's deputies said. Steven Gonzales, 14, and John Chavez, 31, were 
hospitalized in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
* Albert Harris, 22, a suspected gang member, died about 4 a.m. Sunday after 
two reputed members of a rival gang shot him in the head at a hamburger stand 
at 254 E. Manchester Ave., Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made in the three shootings. 
</P>
<P>
* A 16-year-old female gang member was arrested in the stabbing death of 
Roberto Mendieta, 18, after a robbery at 2:10 a.m. in the 1300 block of South 
Kenmore Avenue. The suspect was held at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder 
and robbery. Several other assailants, described only as young men, were at 
large, Los Angeles police said.

WHAT DROVE RAMIREZ? PENALTY HEARING MAY OFFER CLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Moments after Richard Ramirez's conviction in 13 serial murders, Los Angeles 
Homicide Detective Frank Salerno, who led the Night Stalker task force, mused: 
"We'll just never know" what drove Ramirez to commit the gruesome killings. 
</P>
<P>
But at least some tenuous clues as to what drove Ramirez may begin to emerge 
when the trial's penalty phase starts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It is during this stage of a death penalty trial when defense lawyers usually 
call sympathetic witnesses, whose testimony is intended to persuade a jury to 
spare the convicted person's life. Whether that testimony includes claims of a 
bad childhood, a tearful family or a plea from the defendant himself, it is all 
meant to show what is known in legal jargon as "mitigating" circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the guilt phase, the jury can consider pure sympathy in recommending a 
sentence," said Los Angeles County Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay, who 
decides in which cases a death penalty is sought. "The defense has wide 
latitude and hardly anything is inadmissible." 
</P>
<P>
Livesay said juries recommend the gas chamber in only about a third of the 
cases in which the death penalty is sought here. No one has been executed in 
California, however, for a quarter of a century, although there are 262 inmates 
on San Quentin's Death Row, 85 of them from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The more heinous the crime, the more likely the death sentence. But if recent 
cases are any indication, juries are unpredictable and the outcome of even 
highly publicized multiple murder convictions is by no means certain. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono, convicted in 1983 of murdering 
nine young women and girls in the Northeast Los Angeles-Glendale area, was 
sentenced to life in prison without parole. Jurors, who voted after only an 
hour's deliberation, refused to say why they rejected the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge and attorneys on both sides speculated that it was because 
Buono's cousin and accomplice, Kenneth Bianchi, received a life sentence 
through a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, another jury took only an hour to decide to spare the life of Brandon 
Tholmer, a mentally disordered sex offender convicted in 1986 of raping and 
killing four elderly women in the Hollywood-Silver Lake area and a prime 
suspect in a score of similar slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argued that Tholmer was borderline mentally retarded and had 
spent most of his life in prisons or mental institutions. Even the brother of 
one of his victims testified that his murdered sister would not have wanted 
Tholmer to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
Said one juror: "He had suffered most of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's lawyers have steadfastly refused to disclose their strategy, but 
attorney Ray Clark said family members and acquaintances may testify on his 
behalf. During the marathon jury deliberations in the guilt phase, Ramirez's 
chief counsel, Daniel V. Hernandez, spent many days in Texas, Ramirez's home 
state, apparently lining up such witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Their testimony could provide new insights into Ramirez's past. His father, 
Julian Ramirez, told a reporter in El Paso, Tex., on Thursday that "I don't 
know if he did it or not." 
</P>
<P>
"But if he did, he didn't do it by himself. . . . I've accepted he was a thief, 
but I've never accepted that he did the things they say he did," the father 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The media turned him into a monster," the elder Ramirez said. "He's really 
just a poor boy who was raised to believe in God" but was led astray by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the background of the 29-year-old devil-worshiping 
drifter from El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped out of high school, but by his own admission has had some training 
as an electrician. His acquaintances in El Paso, interviewed after his arrest 
more than four years ago, said he was widely known in the barrios as a petty 
thief and drug user. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in the early 1980s, Ramirez arrived in Los Angeles and began hanging 
out at the downtown Greyhound Bus depot and living out of seedy hotels nearby, 
where he was said to have met up with assorted thieves, burglars, drug dealers 
and people who fenced stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Attys. Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson do not 
plan to present any "aggravating" circumstances during the penalty phase. 
Instead, they intend to simply argue to the Superior Court jury that the 13 
murders and 30 other felonies "speak for themselves" in justifying a death 
verdict, Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors said several relatives of Ramirez's victims -- as well as 
at least one woman who survived his attack -- have expressed their desire to 
speak at his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who refused to remain in court for the reading of the verdicts last 
week, had said he wants to skip the penalty phase as well, attorneys said. That 
is expected to be the first issue of debate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that Ramirez is required by law to be present unless 
he is disruptive, while the defense says Judge Michael A. Tynan can allow the 
defendant to listen through a speaker in a holding cell as he did when the 
verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who was dressed in jail blues and wearing ankle chains, was excused 
from the courtroom after Tynan cited a federal appeals court ruling last month. 
That ruling overturned the 1976 conviction of former Black Panther Johnny Spain 
because he was forced to wear chains in court and that may have prejudiced the 
jury against him and made it difficult for him to assist in his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the Spain case have asked for a rehearing and say they are 
prepared to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Should Tynan order Ramirez to remain in court against his will, it is likely 
that he would be shackled, which could be considered by an appeals court to be 
similarly prejudicial. Conversely, his absence could be interpreted as 
disregard for the jury. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing whatever testimony may be presented, the only decision for the 
jury of seven women and five men will be whether to condemn Ramirez to die in 
the gas chamber at San Quentin or order him imprisoned for life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
If the jury deadlocks, Tynan would have to declare a mistrial of the penalty 
phase. That would require selection of a new jury and an exhaustive review of 
the evidence that led to the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
To face the death penalty, a criminal defendant must not only be convicted of a 
first-degree murder, but a jury must also return at least one finding of a 
"special circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
In the Night Stalker case, Halpin and Yochelson alleged 19 special 
circumstances, including the commission of multiple murders, the commission or 
attempted commission of a burglary and the commission of assorted sex crimes. 
The jury agreed on each allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Other special circumstances provided by state law include the murder of a 
judge, police officer or elected official in retaliation for the performance of 
their official duties; murder to prevent a witness from testifying; killing 
someone while lying in wait, or torturing the murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of tactics have been used by the defense in other death penalty 
cases, with varying results: 
</P>
<P>
* Billionaire Boys Club leader Joe Hunt, convicted in 1987 of the murder of 
Beverly Hills con man Ron Levin, was sentenced to life without parole because 
jurors wished him a fate worse than death. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that the death penalty was too quick," one juror said. "Joe Hunt 
needs time to sit and think about the things he did." 
</P>
<P>
They said they were not influenced by the fact that Levin's body was never 
found or because Hunt failed to take the stand in his own defense as his lawyer 
had promised. Nor were they swayed by pleas from his mother or testimony about 
his unhappy childhood. 
</P>
<P>
* Daniel Steven Jenkins was sentenced last year to die in the gas chamber for 
the slaying of an off-duty police detective in front of the officer's 
6-year-old son. Jenkins acted as his own attorney and insisted on his innocence 
in asking the jury to spare his life. 
</P>
<P>
It did not work. One juror said Jenkins' shrewd, unremorseful arguments were 
his own undoing. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert M. Bloom Jr., convicted in 1983 of the execution slaying of his 
father, stepmother and 8-year-old stepsister, also represented himself during 
the penalty phase, arguing for his own death and refusing to present character 
witnesses or other mitigating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where justice cries out for the death penalty," Bloom told a 
Los Angeles jury. "A life sentence is no deterrent. . . . If you give life, 
I'll laugh all day long . . . (and) I'll kill again in prison." 
</P>
<P>
The jury granted his wish. 
</P>
<P>
* Randy Steven Kraft, a computer genius portrayed by prosecutors as perhaps the 
most prolific serial killer in the country, was sentenced to death last month 
for the gruesome murders of 16 young men in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite more than 50 character witnesses who described Kraft as caring, loving 
and extremely bright, and psychiatric tests that showed he suffered from brain 
abnormalities, jurors said afterward that their choice was clear. 
</P>
<P>
"He should die for what he did to all these people," said one. "I've had 
nightmares thinking about the horror of what this man has done." 
</P>
<P>
In the event that the Ramirez jury returns a death sentence, Tynan must make a 
legal finding as to whether the evidence supports such a verdict. If he agrees 
with the jury, Tynan then would set a formal sentencing date, probably months 
from now, to allow time for possible psychiatric evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
Death sentences are automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court. Because 
of the volume of evidence to be reviewed in the Ramirez case and a massive 
backlog of death penalty appeals, the process would be lengthy. 
</P>
<P>
If the state high court eventually affirms a death penalty, the sentence can 
still be appealed, right up to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"This could take years, many years," Yochelson said.

MURDER SUSPECT IS RETURNED FROM SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect in the murder earlier this month of a 23-year-old Escondido woman was 
returned to San Diego on Sunday from the San Joaquin Valley community of 
Kingsburg, where he was captured Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Filomen Huerta, 23, of Escondido was wanted on a arrest warrant, with bail set 
at $1 million, in the slaying of Sylvia Flores, whose decomposing body was 
found along San Pasqual Road near the San Diego Wild Animal Park on Sept. 16. 
Flores died from a blow to the face with a blunt instrument, the county 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Huerta's automobile was spotted in Kingsburg on Friday by law enforcement 
officers, who arrested him without incident. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police homicide detectives returned him to San Diego on Sunday. His 
arraignment is expected early this week. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Dave Cohen said investigators no longer believe that Flores' 
slaying was related to a series of murders of young women, many of them 
prostitutes, over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
Huerta was identified as a suspect in the Flores murder by a joint 
investigation conducted by San Diego and Escondido police and the Metropolitan 
Homicide Task Force, which is investigating the more than 40 unsolved murders. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect and victim were acquainted, Cohen said, but no motive has been 
found for the murder. Huerta is not a suspect in any other killings, Cohen 
said.

<P>
A biologist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory has adapted conventional 
biological techniques for staining cells to produce an extremely sensitive new 
technique for recovering fingerprints at crime scenes. The new technique works 
on a number of materials from which fingerprints could not previously be 
recovered, such as the sticky side of adhesive tape, which is widely used in 
wrapping dope, counterfeit money, and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is one of the top five developments in the fingerprint field," said 
Deputy Agent John Piper of the U.S. Secret Service, a fingerprint specialist. 
Both the Secret Service and the FBI have begun using the method, which was 
developed by George Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
The technique uses extremely small particles of gold, which adhere to proteins 
left on surfaces as part of the fingerprint. The gold-labeled fingerprint is 
then bathed in a silver solution to enhance the image. Among the materials on 
which the technique has worked are computer disks, credit cards, bullet 
cartridges, wet and dry paper, glass and Styrofoam.

THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX MUDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's growing frenzy for some sort of cut in the capital gains tax is 
being driven by politics and not by economic common sense. Democrats and 
Republicans in Congress should take a deep breath and back away from their race 
to reap political capital by offering the most appealing package of capital 
gains rate reductions. Then President Bush should realize that his reelection 
prospects in 1992 will not turn on the outcome of his 1988 campaign pledge to 
cut the capital gains tax rate from the present maximum 28% (33% in some income 
categories) to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Until Bush ran for President, there was no passion for further tinkering with 
the tax system. The reforms of 1986 have only now gone fully into effect. 
Congressional tax writers urged that no major changes be considered until they 
could see how the reforms were working. But during the 1988 campaign, Candidate 
Bush pledged to seek a reduction in the capital gains tax rate. Now President 
Bush is pursuing his promise, in part to generate some quick revenue that would 
be gleaned from the turnover of stocks, property and other assets that would be 
triggered by the lower rate. The revenue bonus, however, would turn into a 
deficit of an estimated $11 billion by the sixth year of the program, according 
to Treasury Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders in Congress originally opposed any capital gains reduction 
on the argument that it primarily would benefit the rich. Under the pre-reform 
system, taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or more got three-fourths of the 
benefits. But fearful of being outmaneuvered by the President, Democrats have 
countered with a package that would include a more modest capital gains 
reduction, a tax increase in top income brackets and reinstatement of the 
$2,000 deduction for investments in Individual Retirement Accounts. 
</P>
<P>
There is some argument for changing the 1986 law. Doing away with the IRA 
deduction was a mistake. And the new tax rates contain a quirk by which a 
couple's taxable income of between $77,850 and $177,720 a year is assessed at 
33% while all other income above that enjoys a maximum rate of 28%. That should 
be fixed. Democrats would raise the maximum tax rate for all the higher 
brackets to 33% and use the revenue raised to pay for restoration of the IRA 
deduction and to reduce the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush has pledged to veto any tax increase, and the heart of the argument 
remains the wisdom of cutting the capital gains rate. Before tax reform, the 
increased value of assets held for more than six months were taxed at only 20% 
compared with rates of up to 50% on other income. In exchange for greatly 
reduced rates, Congress decided to tax gains the same as regular income. 
</P>
<P>
If that is to be changed, there should be some rationale other than politics -- 
to provide more equity in the system, obtain some desired economic effect or 
provide significant new revenue. But the Bush plan would not provide more 
equity and ultimately would lose revenue. 
</P>
<P>
A number of economists and businessmen agree with Bush that lowering the gains 
rate will encourage new investment and savings. But this opinion is by no means 
unanimous. Herbert Stein, who was chief economic adviser to Richard M. Nixon, 
argues that evidence of economic benefit is murky. Further, to have the desired 
effect of increasing savings and the quality of investment, the lower rate 
should apply only to future investments, and not to assets held today. 
</P>
<P>
Those investment decisions already have been made on the basis of existing tax 
law. But allowing the lower tax on assets acquired after the law goes into 
effect probably would eliminate the chance of picking up any new revenue, Stein 
added, along with any real political interest in such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
There may be ways to fashion capital gains legislation that would channel new 
investment into specific areas such as research and development, but that runs 
the risk of creating a whole new generation of tax shelters. There are other 
ways for government to encourage such investment. 
</P>
<P>
Both the President and Congress should reassess just what it is they are trying 
to achieve by slapping together an isolated tax plan this year. Together 
perhaps they can fashion a program that will do the job that really needs to be 
done.

HOUSE VOTES TO PROTECT FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding bills and amendments to fireproof the flag: 
</P>
<P>
What rubbish -- all of it! 
</P>
<P>
The flag symbolizes love of country. The love felt by the individual. Burning, 
blasphemy, and desecration can't touch it. 
</P>
<P>
Symbols and words are used to represent what people see as underlying realities 
that may or may not exist but, nevertheless, exist apart from the symbols and 
words. What did stoning do to remedy blasphemy or the Inquisition against 
heresy? 
</P>
<P>
Obscenity? The flag flying over a Ku Klux Klan meeting is what obscenity's all 
about.

HOUSE VOTES TO PROTECT FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a little perplexed regarding the House of Representatives' vote on a bill 
which states: "Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, or tramples upon 
any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for 
not more than one year, or both." 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that I cannot knowingly tear a flag stamp in half without being 
fined or imprisoned? Does this mean that my daughter, having brought home a 
flag which she had made in school out of paper and crayon, cannot knowingly 
mutilate her creation? Or does this rule only apply to nylon flags bigger than 
a specific size made in Taiwan, Korea or the Philippines? Does this mean that a 
flag patch, once sewn onto the back of a pair of jeans with a hole in them, 
cannot ever be sat upon -- is that mutilation, defacement or trampling? 
</P>
<P>
The rule our representatives have passed is absurd and, regardless of what they 
pass, it still violates the First Amendment right of freedom of expression and 
speech. If they decide that they object to drinkers of chocolate milkshakes and 
pass a law that imprisons them, I'll still be slurping my shake. Our reps need 
shaking -- passing laws against things which they don't like doesn't make the 
law right. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if they add an amendment to that law stating that it's OK to tear a 
stamp; that it's OK to throw away a child's flag creation; that it's OK to sit 
on a flag patch, well, then, it'll be a greatly profound and wise law. But 
perhaps readers have a few more amendments that they want to add.

OFF TO A GOOD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new National AIDS Commission has made a propitious start on its work, 
demonstrating both the wisdom of Congress in creating the commission and the 
strength of its members, appointed by Congress and President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At its initial meeting, the commission moved quickly into the critical problem 
of drug abuse, expressing its disappointment at the failure of President Bush 
to address the AIDS problem in conjunction with his massive anti-drug campaign. 
That stand was important in several ways. It demonstrated the independence of 
the commission and its willingness, unanimously, to chide the President even 
though he appointed some of the members. 
</P>
<P>
It also demonstrated a commitment to implement the recommendations of the 
Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Epidemic, 
headed by Adm. James Watkins during the Reagan Administration. That commission 
had made on-demand drug treatment one of its highest priorities because the 
fastest growing HIV-infected population is comprised of intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
The new commission received encouragement on that very point on its first day 
of meeting from retiring Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. He lamented President 
Reagan's failure to implement the constructive report of the Watkins-led 
commission. "What was needed was for the executive branch that appointed it to 
pick it up and run with it," Koop said. "We need that desperately." 
</P>
<P>
Commission members also moved quickly to support congressional action 
increasing funds for AZT treatment of HIV-infected persons while at the same 
time urging Congress to resist amendments. That was a useful reminder that 
amendments in the past have been ideologically slanted to impose limitations 
and regulations strongly opposed by most public health officials but supported 
by those who appear more interested in castigating homosexual and drug-abusing 
victims of the disease than controlling the pandemic. 
</P>
<P>
The commission head, Dr. June Osborn, dean of the School of Public Health at 
the University of Michigan, has set a remarkably constructive tone for 
commission work. Her major goal: "The development of a national consensus that 
liberates the compassion of the American people." She added, in an interview: 
"There is still a widespread tendency to want to have people with AIDS fired or 
relocated so they don't work next to you. All of that is coming from 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
The President has made statements that reflect that same commitment to 
compassion. The challenge may come, however, when the commission clarifies the 
priorities and the cost of addressing the problems, which multiply each day. 
But cannot be ignored without paying an even more exorbitant price.

A constitutional amendment and/or statute to prohibit the desecration of the 
American flag would establish an ominous precedent -- it would deprive 
Americans of a freedom the rest of the world can enjoy.

HOUSE VOTES TO PROTECT FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conservative pundits often justify U.S. support for various brutal right-wing 
dictatorships by making a fine distinction between them and left-wing 
dictatorships. The key word is always "totalitarian." Communist governments are 
totalitarian because they create government-centered societies in which the 
state is often accorded semi-religious status. They frequently point to the 
huge pictures of Mao and Lenin that constitute the official wallpaper of China 
and the Soviet Union. Of course, this kind of thing never happens in right-wing 
dictatorships (Hitler clearly does not count). 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 12, the House of Representatives passed a statute against burning the 
flag (Part I, Sept. 13). It seems to me that we are treating the flag with an 
idolatrous fervor not very different from those totalitarian societies. 
</P>
<P>
A Buddhist would point out that we have mistaken the finger pointing at the 
moon for the moon itself. The flag represents the freedom to live and express 
ourselves freely. So, when somebody burns that symbol of freedom, we all get 
the urge to throw that person in the slammer. 
</P>
<P>
Am I the only person to see a contradiction here? Are Republicans and Democrats 
so afraid of the destruction of a symbol of freedom that they are willing to 
destroy freedom in order to protect it? This couldn't bear some resemblance to 
that dreaded "T" word, could it?

My heart sank when I heard it is now illegal to "desecrate" the flag. Who is to 
say what is desecration? How can it possibly be distinguished from freedom of 
expression? 
</P>
<P>
Our elected representatives championed this simplistic issue to improve their 
popularity ratings. Unfortunately, doing what's popular is more important to 
them than doing what's right. And if outlawing flag-burning will improve their 
ratings, that's what matters. Not whether our basic rights are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing dissatisfaction with government is what our country was founded 
upon. Our lawmakers have now removed that right from us, and we have supported 
it.

A MANDATE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SENDS AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY INTO AN 
UPROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hidden Hills is a community that tries to live by its name. It has just two 
entrances, both gated and guarded. Million-dollar houses sit behind spacious 
front yards, oak trees and white ranch-style fences. 
</P>
<P>
It is a town without apartments, without condominiums and without, well, poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
But now the city is grappling with a state mandate that it provide low-cost 
housing. A proposal before the City Council to annex land outside the gates and 
build 46 units of multifamily housing for senior citizens has resulted in a 
controversy that has shaken the serene community of 2,000 people west of 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Two stormy public meetings have pitted opponents of the plan against the city's 
attorney, who supports it. In the second meeting, on Monday, an uncertain City 
Council voted unanimously to informally poll residents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sensitive issue for some of us in this community," said 
resident Susan Porcaro. "Yes, there is a need for low-income housing. No, we 
don't want it on our street. . . . We worked our tails off to have this house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incorporated in 1961 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills was incorporated in 1961 to retain the area's rural, equestrian 
quality and to fight a planned extension of Burbank Boulevard through the 
community. Some residents say opposition to the affordable housing plan stems 
from residents' desire to keep Hidden Hills an island in a sea of urban growth. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's a suggestion that the city wishes to annex an area that has 
higher density, I think there's a reaction," said Paul Gilbert, president of 
the town's community association, which owns and maintains the city's roads and 
its two gates. 
</P>
<P>
"Low density is the desire, and there's no other innuendo or implication to 
flow from that," added Gilbert, who said he has yet to make up his mind on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this summer, an anonymous letter was circulated in town. It said in 
part: "Keep in mind, the residents of the low-income housing project would: 1) 
Have a right to vote in our city elections, 2) Have a right to be members of 
our city commissions . . . 3) Have a right to use all city-owned facilities, 
such as the swimming pool, tennis courts, administration building, etc., 4) 
And, have their best interests conflict with our best interests. Is this what 
we really want for our community???" 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Wayne K. Lemieux says he finds the controversy hard to understand. 
The project would house senior citizens outside the town's gates and would be 
shielded from the existing city by a hill. Its residents would use different 
access roads, he said. Lemieux called the opposition unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are being unreasonable, I look for ulterior motives," Lemieux 
said. "I don't know if there are any here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senior-Citizen Project 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills is considering the senior-citizen housing project because of a 
complex set of circumstances that some residents have found difficult to 
understand and some city officials have found difficult to explain. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the city formed a redevelopment agency to finance a needed 
flood-control project without new taxes. Hidden Hills was promptly sued by Los 
Angeles County and a private attorney, Murray O. Kane, who contended that the 
city was not blighted and thus should not reap the tax benefits of 
redevelopment at the expense of county taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the suit with the county was settled, with county officials agreeing 
to pay $5.1 million for the drainage project. But Kane contested the 
settlement. Under state redevelopment law, a portion of redevelopment money 
must be spent on affordable housing, he contended. In May, Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. agreed to dismiss the suit if Hidden 
Hills would agree to an affordable housing plan. The City Council consented. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the wealthy desert city of Indian Wells was involved in a similar 
controversy after it launched a redevelopment agency to attract upscale resort 
businesses. Confronted with the affordable housing regulations, the city and a 
resort developer lobbied Sacramento for an exemption that passed the 
Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Hidden Hills' settlement in the redevelopment lawsuit, Lemieux cites 
state law that requires all cities to provide for affordable housing in their 
planning and zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills argued last year to the Southern California Assn. of Governments, 
a regional planning agency responsible for enforcing the housing law, that the 
city has no more room for affordable housing and that building it would not be 
feasible. SCAG rejected the argument. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is identifying what the need is, not how feasible it is," 
said Jim Minuto, manager of SCAG's housing program. "The city, in their housing 
element, has to address that need." 
</P>
<P>
The senior project would be built on a small portion of 25 acres that would be 
annexed to the city from Los Angeles County. A private developer would build 
nine luxury houses on 20 acres and commercial buildings and the project for 
senior citizens on the remainder. The land is along Lasher Road between the 
city's southern boundary and the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comply With State Law 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux sees the project as a way to settle the Kane matter and comply with 
state law. Not doing anything, he maintains, could subject Hidden Hills to a 
lawsuit in which the city could be forced to build housing without any control 
over its cost and location. 
</P>
<P>
But at the two public meetings Sept. 7 and Monday, residents expressed 
considerable desire to fight the state's affordable housing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to take a chance that you're going to get caught. . . ?" Lemieux 
said at the Sept. 7 hearing. He was interrupted by an approving roar. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want low-cost housing," resident Philip Gardner said. "We don't want 
Willie Brown and Jerry Brown controlling our interests." 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want low-income housing right next door," Porcaro said. "We are 
not any different from anybody else in any other area who owns a house." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Howard, the Tarzana developer who wants to build the project, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake for the community to try to stick their head in the sand 
and say they don't have to comply with laws," Howard said. "They have an 
opportunity now to comply with the law in a manner that would have a very 
minimal effect on the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised by Opposition 
</P>
<P>
The council, however, remains unsure that the answer is so simple. Council 
members agreed to the poll after appearing somewhat taken aback by the volume 
of opposition that surfaced at the public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is bewildering," Councilwoman Kathleen D. Bartizal said, adding that she is 
unsure of whether the opponents are representative of the town's feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The council did not specify when the poll would take place or what question 
would be asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be one hellacious question," Lemieux said. If the choice is 
between the council obeying and defying state law, "I'm not going to give them 
that choice." 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Chris K. Van Peski said, "The City Council will draft the poll 
rather than the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Van Peski said he is still unsure of the city's legal obligations. He contends 
that Hidden Hills already has low-income retired residents who bought their 
homes many years ago. Estimating how many would be strictly conjecture, he 
said. The town's 1989 estimated median household income is $75,000, according 
to the U. S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
The poll has prompted Councilwoman Colleen Hartman to talk of resigning after 
19 years. Although Hartman voted to conduct the poll, she said she would resign 
if the poll directs the council to defy state law. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're wrong, I don't need to join them," she said.

OFFICERS WALKING BEATS TO GET NEIGHBORHOOD BACK ON ITS FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
For the two years that Rosa Gaspar has lived in an apartment on Orion Avenue in 
Sepulveda, her world has been delineated by the locked iron gate that surrounds 
her complex. 
</P>
<P>
As much as possible, she stays inside, behind the gate that keeps the drug 
dealers, prostitutes and transients out. Concerned for the safety of her 
10-year-old son, she does not let the boy play outside unless she is there to 
watch. She doesn't even let him take out the trash. 
</P>
<P>
But Gaspar believes that things may be changing where she lives in the 8900 
block of Orion. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that Los Angeles police have begun foot patrols for the first 
time in the Sepulveda neighborhoods south of Nordhoff Street that include 
Orion, Langdon and Columbus avenues. A 2-week-old pilot program to study the 
effectiveness of foot beats in the city has placed officers on walking patrols 
in the area five nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
Gaspar, like many other residents and police officers, believes that the 
patrols may be a deterrent to drug dealers, prostitutes and other problems in 
the neighborhood, which is made up mostly of apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Is Changing' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling more and more comfortable with the police here," Gaspar said. "I 
think with the police here, it is changing." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. George Thomas, who coordinates the foot patrol, said the Police Department 
is doing what more police agencies across the country are doing: going back to 
basics. 
</P>
<P>
"The foot beat is a tradition that is at the core of law enforcement," Thomas 
said. "When you are in a patrol car, you are cut off from the people. You are 
on the outside looking in. The foot beat takes away that barrier. It puts 
police officers in contact with the people they serve." 
</P>
<P>
Although a handful of drug dealers and several drug buyers and loiterers have 
been arrested since the officers were put on foot in the area, Thomas said the 
goal of the program is not more arrests. Police hope that their presence will 
make drug dealers and prostitutes and their customers go somewhere else. In the 
meantime, officers hope to improve relations with the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not as interested in putting people in jail as we are in letting kids 
play and ride their bikes, letting people enjoy their neighborhood without 
being in danger," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Beat Planned 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda foot beat -- which includes two-block stretches of Orion, Langdon 
and Columbus between Nordhoff and Rayen streets -- is the only such patrol in 
the San Fernando Valley. Thomas said the department expects to put foot 
officers on a beat covering the Pierce Park public housing complex in Pacoima 
early next month. 
</P>
<P>
In Sepulveda, six to eight officers walk the beat between 5 p.m. and midnight 
Wednesday through Sunday. The officers work in pairs and take to the sidewalks 
in an area where more than 800 arrests for drugs, prostitution, thefts and 
gang-related crimes were made in the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol is one of 18 new foot beats in a pilot program approved by the Los 
Angeles City Council. The council voted in September to implement the beats as 
a means of increasing police presence in high-crime neighborhoods. The foot 
beats do not entail the addition of new officers. Rather, they are being manned 
by officers working on overtime shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Although originally set for a 10-month tryout, the program was vetoed four days 
after it started by Mayor Tom Bradley, who said he would support a shorter 
three-month program. While the issue is being hashed out by the mayor and the 
council, the Police Department has continued the patrols and expects at least 
the three-month program to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popularity Returns 
</P>
<P>
Experts on foot patrols said cities grappling with neighborhood crime, 
particularly drug problems, are increasingly turning to foot patrols to fight 
the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Departments from Alberta to Tallahassee are doing it," New York City Police 
Lt. Thomas Madden said. "It is to get back in touch with their communities." 
</P>
<P>
Madden is assigned to the Vera Institute of Justice, a police research 
organization that monitors foot patrols that it helped establish five years ago 
in New York City's police precincts. 
</P>
<P>
"The foot patrol is efficient and effective," Madden said. "It is not just a 
community relations gimmick. These officers take pro-active roles in the 
neighborhoods. Having them there improves quality of life conditions. The 
officers are right there in the neighborhood as a physical representation of 
the local government." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5-Year Growth 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 U. S. cities have officers on foot beats, according to the 
National Neighborhood Foot Patrol Center in East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, it is clearly the trend in policing today," said David 
Carter, a professor at Michigan State University's School of Criminal Justice, 
where the center is located. 
</P>
<P>
"The foot patrol was almost extinct," Carter said. "During the last five years 
is when we have seen its growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The contemporary foot patrol goes beyond having a cop walk a beat like we used 
to have years ago. They are out there to talk to people, get to know them, to 
establish a liaison between residents and their government." 
</P>
<P>
The rise in popularity of the foot beat among police departments coincides with 
the rise of neighborhood problems associated with crack cocaine, Carter said. 
Crack dealers and users can quickly spread through a neighborhood, turning 
entire blocks into areas of danger and decay. He said the posting of officers 
on foot helps re-establish a sense of order in neighborhoods and shows 
law-abiding citizens that local government cares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Crime Evidence 
</P>
<P>
On the beat on Orion on a recent night, open drug and prostitution problems 
were not apparent. Graffiti on walls and dumpsters on the street hinted at 
troubles, but Thomas said the police presence was acting as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and other officers were greeted warmly as they walked along the 
sidewalks. They introduced themselves to adults and passed out baseball cards 
to youngsters. They chased a known hooker out of a parking garage and checked 
alleys for drug users. On Langdon, a teen-ager was asked how his high school 
basketball team would do this year. A man known to police as a paroled drug 
dealer who lives elsewhere was sternly told that he did not belong on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Officer John Girard has worked patrol, narcotics and vice operations around the 
neighborhood for nine years. But only now is he getting the chance to work the 
street on foot, to establish contacts with concerned residents. He said he is 
already nurturing the start of a committee of residents and landlords. The 
first meeting is scheduled Oct. 26 at a nearby church. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to try to develop a community strategy for dealing with the 
problems of the area," Girard said. "There are a lot of good people here that 
want to do something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baseball Cards 
</P>
<P>
During the evening patrol, 10-year-old cousins Victor and Henry Funez rode up 
to Thomas and Girard on their bikes. They hopped off and approached the men in 
blue uniforms and hats. Victor timidly asked: "Do you have baseball cards?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding?" Thomas asked back. "Of course I have baseball cards." 
</P>
<P>
The boys were each presented with cards featuring Orel Hershiser, which 
promptly brought smiles all around. For Victor, the appearance of the foot 
patrol officers is something he looks forward to each night -- and not just 
because of the baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to see them here," he said of the officers. "There are too many drug 
dealers. I want the police to keep them out." 
</P>
<P>
How long and how well police can do what the boy wants depends on whether the 
foot patrols are continued by the city's politicians at the end of the pilot 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like cockroaches in the kitchen," Officer Gene Ferone said one night 
while on foot patrol on Columbus Avenue. "You hit them with the light and they 
hit the bricks; they're gone. You turn the light out and they are going to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, while the foot patrol is still a presence on Orion, Langdon and 
Columbus, police said its effect has already been positive. 
</P>
<P>
"The good people are coming out," Thomas said. "They are feeling safer, and 
that is the name of the game."

Growing up in North Hollywood in the 1930s, Vera Arndt found countless hours of 
entertainment at the Sidney Lanier Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
The books she found there transported her to the high seas, where pirates 
pillaged merchant ships, and to deserted islands, where Robinson Crusoe and 
other unfortunate sailors fought the elements in their struggles to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Arndt was one of nearly 75 North Hollywood residents who gathered Sunday to 
celebrate the 60th anniversary of the library, now known as the North 
Hollywood/Amelia Earhart Regional Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
The library has changed tremendously during its 60-year history, said Arndt and 
other celebrants who remembered the facility's early days. In addition to its 
new name, it has more than twice as much space, technology that links it to the 
central library and a vast number of services to meet the needs of a different 
population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brick Building 
</P>
<P>
The one-story, Mission-style brick building with Spanish tile work was opened 
in 1929 to replace a storefront operation known as the Sepulveda Library, which 
could not meet the demand caused by the area's rapid population growth. 
</P>
<P>
Officials named the new facility after Lanier, an obscure 19th-Century Southern 
poet, because the books from the Sepulveda Library were already coded SL, and 
librarians did not want to relabel them, said Joyce Elliott, regional manager 
of the library. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone went looking for an American literary figure with the right initials," 
Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, however, at the suggestion of a local resident, officials renamed the 
library for Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and 
Pacific oceans. Earhart, who disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on an attempted 
around-the-world flight in 1937, lived in nearby Toluca Lake for several years 
when she was in her 20s. 
</P>
<P>
On the south wall of the building, there is a quote from a Lanier poem that 
could have been written for Earhart. "I am but a small winged bird, but I will 
conquer the world." 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, the library building more than doubled in size with the addition of 
three rooms paid for by a city bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Once local residents wishing to tap the central library's resources had to make 
the trip downtown, recalled Bill Coenig, 75, who has been using the North 
Hollywood Library for more than half a century. Now, computers link patrons 
directly to the central library's catalogue, and librarians there ship books to 
the regional branches. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you can do almost anything here that you could do at the downtown 
library," said Coenig, president of the Friends of the North Hollywood Library. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outreach Programs 
</P>
<P>
Coenig also noted that the library has outreach programs and services to cater 
to the changed population of the east San Fernando Valley. Once serving an 
almost entirely white, affluent population, the library now has a collection of 
Spanish-language books, prints all promotional literature in English and 
Spanish, and runs literacy programs to help adults improve their reading 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime patrons say that the changes have given the library a different 
atmosphere, but they are pleased to see it growing and expanding in scope. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a more homey atmosphere," said Arndt, who now uses the library to keep 
up on current events rather than to escape into the fantasy world of adventure 
stories. "It is a city library now, not a local library, but it is nice to see 
it being cherished and kept up."

ROBBERY SUSPECT IS SHOT WHILE FLEEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido police officer shot and wounded a fleeing robbery suspect Sunday 
afternoon while pursuing the man down a flood-control channel into a 
residential district. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified suspect was one of three arrested by Escondido police after 
they allegedly attacked another youth outside a K mart store at 620 W. Mission 
Ave. and grabbed a package from him, which reportedly contained a "ghetto 
blaster," a portable stereo radio, a police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer John Elliott was chasing the suspect when the suspect turned toward him 
suddenly in a manner indicating that he might have a weapon. Elliott shot the 
man in the buttocks, police said. The suspect, described as about 21 years old 
and a resident of the La Jolla Indian reservation, was taken to Palomar Medical 
Center in Escondido, where he underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three suspects apprehended nor the robbery victim was identified by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation of the shooting will be conducted, the police spokeswoman 
said. Elliott has five years of law enforcement experience, including four 
years with the Escondido department.

CHARGERS PUT A ROADBLOCK ON THE CHIEFS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE INTERCEPTS FIVE; BERNSTINE SCORES TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the Kansas City Chiefs arrived at their San Diego hotel Saturday, 15 of 
their rooms were not ready. This was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs do not travel well. The only thing they have in common with the road 
is accidents. Take a set of 3-week-old quintuplets away from home, and they 
will be more comfortable than the Chiefs in a strange town. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers know this to be happily true. Before Sunday, their defense had not 
taken the ball away once, and they had not won a game. Against the Chiefs, they 
intercepted five Steve DeBerg passes, rushed for 200 yards and improved to 1-2 
with a 21-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sit at home and draw it up, this is the way you'd like it to take 
place," said Dan Henning, the first-year Charger coach. "We took the ball away 
on defense, controlled it on offense, kicked the ball out of trouble when we 
had to and went away with a win. That's exactly how it ought to be." 
</P>
<P>
For the Chiefs (1-2), it was exactly the way it has been for more than two 
years. They have lost eight consecutive games away from Arrowhead Stadium and 
16 of their past 18 on the road. They are 3-24 in their past 27 AFC West road 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for either of these teams in the playoffs. But don't look for 
Henning in the unemployment office just yet, either. 
</P>
<P>
An embattled Henning finally witnessed the kind of defense he was told he had 
inherited when he took this job last February. And his running game, led by 
H-back Rod Bernstine, ran over and around a defense that entered the game 
ranked third in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine, who spent the entire off-season recovering from reconstructive knee 
surgery, caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Jim McMahon in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the fourth, he raced 32 yards up the middle on a third-and-eight draw 
play for the score that put the Chargers out of reach. Before the play, 
Bernstine was discouraged when a Chief linebacker yelled the word "draw" as a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. Bernstine, shielded initially by 6-foot-7, 307-pound left 
tackle Joel Patten, broke several tackles en route to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I grabbed the back of Joel's pants and pushed him right into one defender," 
said Bernstine, who played fullback at Texas A&amp;M before converting to tight 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patten: "If anything helped on that block, it was my sheer size. They 
probably couldn't see Rod behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Patten said he was especially pleased with Kansas City's inability to stop the 
play even though they knew it was coming. Larry Beightol, the offensive line 
coach, had addressed that very subject before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that if we had to resort to trickery, we were reeling, going 
backwards," Patten said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did today," he added, "has been our potential all year." 
</P>
<P>
And they did it without starting left tackle Brett Miller, who underwent minor 
knee surgery Friday. James FitzPatrick replaced Miller and played well. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine led all Charger rushers with 73 yards in five carries. But rookie 
Marion Butts added 62 yards in 15 rushes, and Tim Spencer gained 57 in 13 
tries, including a nine-yard touchdown in the first period set up by free 
safety Vencie Glenn's interception. Glenn's interception came after defensive 
back Elvis Patterson tipped the ball. It was the first of the year for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer's score was his first since 1986. "I almost forgot how to get into the 
end zone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer also was an integral part of the Chargers' beleaguered special teams 
units that had their best game of the year. Former CFL punter Hank Ilesic, 
signed earlier this week, averaged 44.8 for five kicks, including a 60-yarder. 
This despite being made by the officials to alter his kicking shoe moments 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Charger kickoff coverage and kickoff return units, last in the league 
after two games, outplayed the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Henning instructed the public address announcer to introduce 
the special teams unit that blocked a Houston punt last week. Usually the 
announcer introduces either the starting offense or defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get these people (special teams) to step up, be recognized 
and have some pride," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Glenn predicted that one Charger take-away would lead to a 
bunch more. He was right. Cornerback Gill Byrd added two interceptions. Strong 
safety Martin Bayless and nickel back Lester Lyles got one apiece. All of which 
helped offset a career-high 112 yards rushing by Christian Okoye, Kansas City's 
260-pound fullback. 
</P>
<P>
"He (DeBerg) was watching the side where he was going to throw to," Glenn said. 
"It seemed like he was telegraphing his passes." 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg said the Charger defensive alignment, which often included linebackers 
in a three-point stance, was more responsible. "It was basically a seven-man 
front," DeBerg said. 
</P>
<P>
And it included Cedric Figaro at inside linebacker in place of Jim Collins. 
Figaro weighs 17 pounds more than Collins. And, Henning said, "We wanted that 
extra heft against this team. Collins is more into reads. The two of them give 
is a good combination." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Chargers fumbled the ball away twice, and McMahon threw three 
interceptions for a minus-five turnover/take-away differential. Against the 
Chiefs, they were plus five. Kansas City's only points came on Nick Lowery 
field goals of 23 and 31 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense allowed fewer than 300 yards for the first time this year. 
It added three sacks, including the first by rookie Burt Grossman, the team's 
No. 1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon completed 11 of 18 for 96 yards and one touchdown. More important, he 
threw no interceptions and was not sacked. "Two losses," he said, "don't 
necessarily knock us out of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps defensive end Leslie O'Neal, who led the Chargers with 1 1/2 sacks, put 
it best when he said, "We played more like an experienced team today." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Chiefs couldn't wait to get home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday's game Charger running back Gary Anderson told NBC's Bob Costas, 
"If I can't play with the Chargers, I'd like to play with someone else." 
Anderson, an unsigned free agent, was the Chargers' leading rusher and most 
valuable player last year. Moments after his remarks, Bobby Beathard, the 
former Washington general manager, told Costas: "The demands are ridiculous. 
Gary Anderson is simply not a million-dollar back." Ralph Cindrich, Anderson's 
agent, said earlier this week Anderson isn't asking for that much. . . . 
Charger rookie Marion Butts, who entered the game tied for the NFL lead in 
touchdowns with four, carried three times for minus two yards in the first 
half. On his first two carries of the second half he broke off two 14-yard 
gains. . . . The Charger single-game record for interceptions is six. They have 
done that five different times. They intercepted five Sunday. The last time 
they did that was Sept. 20, 1981, at Kansas City. Kansas City quarterback Steve 
DeBerg, playing for Tampa Bay, threw seven interceptions against the 49ers on 
Sept. 7, 1986. . . . Gill Byrd's 20 career interceptions rank him eighth on the 
all-time Charger list. . . . Linebacker Billy Ray Smith led the Charger defense 
in tackles (seven) for the first time since last Nov. 6. . . . Chiefs' 
linebacker Derrick Thomas, who had five tackles, 2 1/2 sacks and one forced 
fumble last week against the Raiders, had three tackles and no sacks against 
the Chargers. . . . The Kansas City defense has allowed just nine receptions by 
opposing wide receivers in three games. Anthony Miller (two catches for 55 
yards) was the only Charger wideout to catch a ball. . . . "Jim McMahon didn't 
do anything that impressed me," said Kansas City free safety Deron Cherry. 
Surely, the feeling was mutual. The fact that McMahon has never lost three 
consecutive starts in this, his eighth season, is impressive by anybody's 
standards. . . . Sunday's attendance was 40,128, a whopping increase of 115 
people from last week's home opener. The Chargers play in Phoenix and Denver 
before returning home again Oct. 15 to play Seattle.

PADRES WONDER 'WHAT IF?' AFTER BENES SHUTS OUT DODGERS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the question came up Sunday afternoon, Padre Manager Jack McKeon winced, 
closed his eyes and waited for the pain to subside. 
</P>
<P>
He has avoided even thinking about it. What good does it do now, he tells 
himself? All it does is cause aggravation and heartache. Besides, the damage 
already is done. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just moments after the Padres' 1-0 victory Sunday afternoon over the 
Dodgers, the topic again arose. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the Padres (86-70) -- who have won 24 of their past 30 games, 
and 26 of 33 -- are still five games behind the San Francisco Giants with just 
six remaining, would they still be in this predicament if pitcher Andy Benes 
had been with the Padres all season? 
</P>
<P>
Or, what would have happened if Benes had just joined the team in June, when 
starter Eric Show suffered a season-ending back injury? 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, who often has wondered this these past weeks, said almost in a whisper: 
"I don't know what we'd have done had we had him all year. I really don't. But 
I sure wish I could have had the chance to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in light of what's happened now. There's no telling where we'd be." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes, the kid who was supposed to be back home in Evansville, Ind., 
resting for the winter, won his sixth consecutive decision Sunday, outpitching 
1988 Cy Young winner Orel Hershiser for the second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Benes, who did not allow his first hit until Hershiser's single with one out in 
the sixth, yielded just four hits in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out seven and 
allowed just two men to reach second. And when he tired in the eighth, on came 
Mark Davis, who used one pitch to get out of a two-on, two-out jam and finished 
the game for his major league-leading 42nd save. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he goes out there," McKeon said of Benes, "he's in complete control 
of the game. I've never seen a guy come up from our organization and dominate 
like he has." 
</P>
<P>
Benes, if you recall, is the one who triggered the Padres' pennant surge on the 
night of Aug. 23 with his first major league victory, and has not let the 
Padres down since. The Padres are 7-0 in his past seven starts, in which Benes 
has a 2.22 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Just what kind of confidence does McKeon have in him? 
</P>
<P>
"If we made the playoffs and played against Chicago," McKeon said, "I wouldn't 
hesitate to start him the first game." 
</P>
<P>
So, uh, just how much does it bother you now the way Benes was handled this 
season? 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sick," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Can you blame him? 
</P>
<P>
Benes, the No. 1 pick in the 1988 June free-agent draft, wasn't even invited to 
the Padre major league camp. McKeon protested, but it was a lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be too much pressure on the kid." 
</P>
<P>
"We got to build a solid foundation for him." 
</P>
<P>
"The media would be too much on him." 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to learn to pitch first." 
</P>
<P>
The Padre minor league department had all of the reasons why Benes didn't 
belong in camp. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of watching Benes develop, McKeon got to see plenty of other pitchers. 
He saw Matt Maysey. He saw Ricky Bones. He saw Joe Bitker. He saw Terry 
Gilmore. He saw Joe Lynch. He saw . . . 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and Benes? He was pitching against something like the San Diego State Vegas 
junior-varsity team. Once, he got excited when he found out he was going to 
pitch against the Oakland Athletics in camp, only to find out it was their "B" 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
When camp broke, Benes was off to Wichita, Kan., home of the Padres' double-A 
team. Benes figured his stay would last only a month, particularly after he won 
his first four starts with a 0.44 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise. Three months later, Benes still was in Wichita. It wasn't until July 
8 when he finally was promoted . . . to triple-A Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't argue with what happened," Benes said, "but I really felt like after 
five or six starts, I got bored. I wasn't concentrating as much. I regressed." 
</P>
<P>
Well, at about the time Benes was just making his way to Las Vegas, the Padres 
learned that Show was going to be finished for the season and that Walt Terrell 
(5-13) wasn't going to improve. 
</P>
<P>
So they threw Don Schulze in the rotation for four starts. Greg Harris was 
given seven starts. Even Pat Clements started a game. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, the guy McKeon wanted was Benes. 
</P>
<P>
"But our minor league people kept saying he wasn't ready, he wasn't ready," 
McKeon said. "That's the thing that got me. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not take a chance? You don't know what's going to happen unless you take a 
chance. I took a chance (while managing Kansas City) with Dennis Leonard. I 
took a chance with Al Cowens. I took a chance with Frank White. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I just told them, 'Hey, bring him up, will you? If it doesn't work 
out, I'll take the heat. I want him up here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Benes arrived on Aug. 8 without a changeup, a curveball that he couldn't throw 
for strikes and a fastball that was losing its zip. 
</P>
<P>
In 15 days, after working with Padre pitching coach Pat Dobson, Benes was 
pitching as well as anyone on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Dodgers what they think of him. They have yet to score off him in 
15 innings, obtaining just six hits and batting .125 against Benes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of pitcher that moves the ball around in and out," second 
baseman Willie Randolph said. "If you're not guessing right on, you're in 
trouble. He's a pretty poised young kid." 
</P>
<P>
Benes' poise, perhaps, is the biggest surprise of all. Rookies, particularly 
those 22 years old, aren't expected to fare well in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
But here he is, dropped in the middle of a pennant race, facing Orel Hershiser, 
with 37,679 fans watching, the largest crowd he's ever pitched in front of. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to block it out," Benes said, "but every once in a while I'd sneak a 
peek and take a look around. It was pretty awesome." 
</P>
<P>
The only frightful aspect of Benes' performance for the Padres was that he 
might have to leave in midst of a scoreless tie. While Benes was mowing down 
the Dodgers, the Padres kept putting runners on base against Hershiser, but 
they couldn't get anyone across the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Until the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
After Benes opened the inning by bouncing out, Bip Roberts singled to left. 
Roberto Alomar followed with a single to center. Tony Gwynn hit a sacrifice fly 
to center. And just like that, the Padres had the only run they needed. 
</P>
<P>
It all all that Hershiser (14-15) could stomach. He pulled himself out of the 
game after the seventh and soon became the losing pitcher for the eighth 
consecutive time, and the fourth time against the Padres. In his past 50 
innings, the Dodgers have scored a whopping three runs for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever go through a season again where we can say we beat 
them four times," McKeon said. " We're thankful we had a guy like Benes out 
there to match him." 
</P>
<P>
Now, if only the Giants would quit matching the Padres. Although the Padres 
have gone 11-4 since Sept. 9, they have failed to gain a game in the standings, 
leaving the Giants' magic number at two. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look good does it," Gwynn said. "All we can do is hope. But I've 
seen strange things happen. Don't write us off yet." 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "Miracles do happen." 
</P>
<P>
And at this point for the Padres, that's all they have left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to Houston Astro pitcher Mike Scott, Manager Jack McKeon 
says that the 1989 Cy Young award belongs to Mark Davis, whose 42 saves is just 
four shy of the major league record set in 1985 by Dave Righetti of the 
Yankees. "The best guy should win the Cy Young," he said, "and I don't care if 
it's a starter or a reliever. And my guy is the best guy. He should win it. He 
has been the difference in 50% of our wins, and he didn't have one cheap save 
all year." . . . Padre first baseman Jack Clark, who has a baseball-sized lump 
in his left thigh, was kept out of the lineup Sunday. He suffered the injury 
while rounding third base in the fifth inning of Saturday's 7-1 victory over 
the Dodgers.

A memorial service is scheduled on campus today for former University of 
Colorado and Vista quarterback Sal Aunese, who died Saturday following a 
six-month battle with inoperable stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, 21, the honorary Colorado football captain whose struggle with cancer 
helped inspire his teammates to three consecutive victories this season, was 
admitted to University Hospital in Denver a week ago with breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal Aunese was a special young man who fought a brave battle," Colorado 
chancellor Jim Corbridge said. "We're all very proud that he was one of our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
"He was not only a fine athlete, but he was as nice a young man as you'll ever 
want to meet," said Marie Romero, president of the Parent Teacher Association 
at Vista High, where Aunese led the football team to a perfect record and a 
section championship in 1985. "When he got sick, it hit us like a two-by-four 
hit across the back.

MIKE DOWNEY: CHANNELED DEMOCRACY PROVIDES THE ULTIMATE IN USER FRIENDLINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Let me tell you about the greatest television innovation since the mute switch. 
</P>
<P>
First, a confession: 
</P>
<P>
I like TV. I watch TV. I am not one of those snobs who won't watch anything on 
the tube except six-part PBS specials made in Great Britain. I'm willing to 
watch the silliest things on TV -- professional wrestling, "ALF," even Sam 
Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as with the network executives themselves, I am always looking for ways to 
improve the quality of TV. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I am so delighted to tell you about this latest development. I 
haven't been this excited since Bryant Gumbel made up with Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Have you heard what has been happening at WAVE-TV in Louisville? 
</P>
<P>
No? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the very wise people who run Channel 3 in that very nice Kentucky city 
have come up with a new system for watching professional football. And, if this 
thing catches on, Sunday will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Every week during the National Football League season, WAVE-TV permits its 
viewers to vote on which game they would like to view. 
</P>
<P>
You read that correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of picking up your daily TV listings to find out what NFL game is being 
shoved down your throat at a particular hour, Louisville viewers may telephone 
the station to cast votes for the game of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever game wins, WAVE airs. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 3 in Louisville happens to run American Football Conference games, the 
NBC network's special province. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on Sunday in Southern California, for example, viewers were exposed to the 
game between the Raiders and Denver Broncos, which happened to be the network's 
game of choice. You can tell because its No. 1 broadcasting team of Dick Enberg 
and Bill Walsh handled the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Louisville football fans also were tuned in to the Raider-Bronco 
game, but only because it won their election. 
</P>
<P>
By one vote. 
</P>
<P>
In the weekly phone poll, this game received exactly one more vote than the 
game between the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets. Democracy triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, Channel 3 televised the Jets vs. the Cleveland Browns, which 
beat out Pittsburgh vs. Cincinnati and Miami vs. New England. More than 10,000 
votes were cast. 
</P>
<P>
This is a novel approach to TV viewing. Wouldn't it be nice to have the 
privilege one of these days to not be forced to watch some particularly crummy 
NFL team -- the Raiders, for instance -- and instead watch somebody 
interesting, such as, oh, you know, anybody but the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there might be kinks in this system. First one that comes to mind is 
that your home team might always get the most votes, no matter what opponent it 
is playing that week. 
</P>
<P>
This is where Louisville has it licked. Louisville has no home team. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly this is why the WAVE-TV approach to watching football already has 
spread to two other fairly large markets, Albuquerque and Raleigh. Neither has 
pro football, either. 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't some brave programmer try this stunt in, say, San Francisco or 
Philadelphia or Chicago? Even if these people did vote to watch their home 
teams, they might like some say-so about which AFC game they have to watch. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco area, I'll bet they'd rather watch a bad Raider game than 
a good Denver-Cleveland game, even if the Broncos and Browns are unbeaten. Just 
a hunch. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose there would be concerns about some form of ballot-box stuffing. You 
know, prank-playing kids flooding the station's switchboard with votes for the 
Atlanta Falcons vs. the Green Bay Packers on the same day the San Francisco 
49ers are playing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
But let's cross that goal line when we come to it. 
</P>
<P>
This could be the start of something swell. This could give us all an 
opportunity to be heard, to express ourselves, to become as angry as Howard 
Beale and tell the world that we just aren't going to take Detroit Lion games 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, if this ever spread to regular network programming, we could all be in TV 
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, what if we all got to vote on whether we wanted to watch "Masterpiece 
Theatre," a George Bush state-of-the-union address or a Roseanne Barr rerun at 
a given hour? I doubt if Roseanne would win by more than a couple of million 
votes.

TONGUE TIED: NEW CHARGER PUNTER GETS IN BIND OVER SHOELACES 
</P>

<P>
Hank Ilesic hadn't even wiped all the shaving cream off his face Sunday before 
a bunch of reporters wanted to know what all this fuss was about his right 
shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic was called in by the Chargers from Canada last week to take over the 
punting duties from Lewis Colbert, who had a dismal 33.3-yard average in the 
first two games. Ilesic, a 13-year veteran of the Canadian Football League, has 
been in town only long enough to figure out it's a good deal warmer here than 
in Toronto, where he averaged 44.0 yards a punt last season with the Argonauts. 
</P>
<P>
So he has been practicing his punting with this funny-sized American football 
for a few days. He was all set to give it a go against the Kansas City Chiefs 
before 40,128 spectators at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium when, just a few 
minutes before kickoff, Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer beckoned the 
officiating crew and informed them that Ilesic's shoe was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Huh? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, it seems this brand of shoe has a leather tongue that covers the laces. 
One of the officials ended up on the phone to Art McNally, supervisor of 
officials for the National Football League, and asked him if it was OK for 
Ilesic to kick. McNally's answer was something to the effect of: "Not unless 
the laces are showing." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Sid Brooks, the Charger equipment manager, solved the problem easily 
enough, cutting away enough leather so the laces were exposed. Ilesic kicked. 
The Chargers defeated the Chiefs, 21-6. And everything was dandy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ilesic really couldn't understand what all the commotion was about. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal," he said. "We have a game to play. If you're upset about it, 
it's going to affect your performance." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when Charger Coach Dan Henning told Ilesic he couldn't use the 
shoe as is, Ilesic shrugged, put on the makeshift version and punted five times 
for an average of 44.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably disturbed me a lot more than it did Hank," said Henning, who made 
the announcement about the shoe problem as if he was breaking the biggest news 
since the Jim McMahon trade. Yet Henning also gave his new punter a vote of 
confidence, saying: "Under the conditions I think he had a pretty good day." 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this guy Ilesic has been around for a few years. His punting career 
in the CFL survived 13 seasons and 1,573 kicks. So it was no surprise to Joe 
Madden, the Charger special teams coach, that he was able to jump into this 
strange shoe and do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a professional," Madden said. "He'll improve on that, I promise." 
</P>
<P>
Which is saying a lot, considering Ilesic gave the fans their first opportunity 
this season to applaud a punt. That happened midway through the second quarter 
when he sent Chief returner Naz Worthen retreating at a sprinter's pace for a 
ball that traveled 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The next episode of the "Hank's Punting Shoe" will begin today, when Brooks 
stuffs the thing in a Federal Express package and sends it to the league office 
with a photo of an American-made shoe that looks just like it. Brooks isn't 
convinced there's anything wrong with Canada's version. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the shoe was made in Canada," said Brooks of the protest. "I said, 
'Yeah, rain shoes are made in Canada, too, and we use them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic doesn't plan to spend a lot of time worrying about the whole thing. He's 
taking an attitude of, "Hey, if the shoe fits, wear it." To him, the Chiefs' 
ploy was all just part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he said. "The new kid on the street. If you can distract the opposition 
in any way, try it." 
</P>
<P>
If not distracted, Ilesic certainly noted a few differences punting in an NFL 
game than in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is so much quicker here," he said. "The incoming rush, the punt 
returners. You have to get the ball off a lot quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic says he has waited for this opportunity for years and plans to make the 
most of it. He says he doesn't know a whole lot about the Chargers or their 
history, and he hasn't seen much more of San Diego than the stadium and his 
hotel. But he has a good feeling about this place. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like a stranger, an outsider," he said. "In due time, I'll settle 
down and get accustomed to the surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
It's bound to get easier than the first game. Then again, he may not get this 
much attention again for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like breaking into the league with some controversy," he said.

TIE WAS A HEAD CASE FOR AZTECS; 
</P>
<P>
LUGINBILL SAYS TEAM MADE 'ATROCIOUS' MENTAL ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state of the San Diego State football team was upgraded from "despicable" 
to "atrocious" Sunday by Coach Al Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
At least it sounded like an upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a lack of physical effort," Luginbill said of SDSU's performance in 
Saturday's 41-41 tie with Cal State Fullerton. "Mentally, we were atrocious." 
</P>
<P>
Because they were mental rather than physical errors, Luginbill said he is 
encouraged that the players can learn from their mistakes. He was a bit more 
positive than he was late Saturday night, when he called his team's performance 
"despicable" minutes after the game. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill wasn't the only one in the Aztec locker room late Saturday night who 
was having trouble explaining how SDSU could enter a game few thought it would 
lose and still be able to figure out a way not to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't explain it," said running back Darrin Wagner, who gained 162 
yards on 22 carries but fumbled at the SDSU 20 with 7:35 left. That set up a 
touchdown that put Cal State Fullerton ahead, 38-34. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have blown them out," Wagner said. "They shouldn't have even scored, 
the way we played last week (against UCLA). But nobody was pumped up like last 
week. Everyone was just standing around." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton noticed, especially running back Mike Pringle, who gained 
158 yards on 25 rushes, caught six passes for 34 yards and one touchdown and 
returned three kickoffs for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude in the other locker room was, 'Cal State Who?' " Pringle said. 
"We showed them." 
</P>
<P>
Said SDSU defensive tackle Pio Sagapolutele: "They're Cal State Fullerton, and 
there's a stereotype when you think of them. But they beat us in every category 
of the game. We're lucky we came out with a tie." 
</P>
<P>
After watching films Sunday, Luginbill said he plans to change some personnel 
on the kickoff teams during practice this week. Breakdowns on kickoffs 
contributed to SDSU's poor field position several times. Of 13 Cal State 
Fullerton drives, all but two started at the Titans' own 32 or better. Nine of 
SDSU's 13 drives started at the Aztecs' own 26 or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Junior safety Morey Paul, who was ejected after a personal foul late in the 
first quarter Saturday, met with Luginbill Sunday and will begin the week on 
the second team. His situation will be evaluated day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"His status on the trip to Utah will be dependent upon his attitude in this 
week's practices," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Utah, SDSU's next opponent, was beaten, 67-20, by Hawaii late Saturday . . . 
SDSU's 41-41 tie with Cal State Fullerton is the second highest scoring 
Division I tie in NCAA history. The highest was between San Jose State and Utah 
State in 1979, a 48-48 tie. . . . The 41 points scored by SDSU were the most in 
a non-winning effort in school history. . . . Senior guard Damon Baldwin 
dislocated his left elbow in Saturday's game and is doubtful for this week's 
game in Utah. . . . How excited was Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy after 
the tie? "I wish we had a fight song to sing," he said. . . . In three games, 
SDSU has been called for 27 penalties (200 yards). Aztec opponents have been 
called for 14 penalties (106 yards). . . . The crowd of 15,721 Saturday was the 
lowest to attend an SDSU game in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium since Nov. 23, 
1985, when just 10,343 showed up to watch SDSU play New Mexico.

FEW CHANGES IN TV STANDARDS, SAY EXECS; 
</P>
<P>
NETWORKS ADD CENSORS, BUT LAST YEAR'S CONTENT CONTROVERSIES HAVE LITTLE IMPACT 
ON NEW SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last season, executive producer Michael Jacobs worked without much interference 
from NBC on his series "My Two Dads," a comedy about a teen-age girl who 
acquires two "dads" when her mother dies without being sure which man is the 
girl's father. 
</P>
<P>
This season, things are a little different. "My Two Dads" not only has two 
dads, but also two network censors with whom the producers now consult on every 
script. 
</P>
<P>
Following a TV season that ended in a highly publicized storm of viewer 
complaints and advertiser boycotts over sex, violence and profanity in 
prime-time shows -- ranging from NBC's titillating "Nightingales" series about 
student nurses to Fox's bawdy comedy "Married . . . With Children" to a host of 
tabloid shows -- the network entertainment chiefs pledged to be more sensitive 
to the audience's tastes this season. NBC bolstered its broadcast standards 
department and Fox hired its first person in that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
But as the new TV season enters its second week, the face of prime-time 
television does not seem to have undergone dramatic change. Most producers 
report that, while the climate may have grown slightly more conservative than 
it was last year, it's basically business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly haven't had any pressure," said David Jacobs, executive producer 
of CBS' "Knots Landing" and "Paradise." He said that networks still rely more 
on ratings than on advertiser input in deciding content of shows. "That's what 
the networks ultimately look at: performance. As far as I can see, the networks 
aren't starving." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Bochco, former executive producer of NBC's "L.A. Law," which caused a 
stir last season with an episode that included the word goddamn, said that he 
continues to fight the same battles with the network censors as always on his 
new ABC series "Doogie Howser, M.D." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is some backlash; I think they (the networks) are nervous," he 
said. "But you know, I have always felt pressed by somebody about something. I 
think inevitably television is maturing, it will continue to mature, and that 
maturation process will always unnerve some people." 
</P>
<P>
Even Jacobs of "My Two Dads" said that, although NBC censors have greater input 
than last season, he believes it has less to do with any new-found morality 
than with the fact that the show has moved from its 9:30 time period to 8:30 
p.m. "I think it is a more delicate time slot," he said. "Last season, we were 
on after 'Night Court,' and 'Night Court' is a very adult show." 
</P>
<P>
And "Married . . . With Children," the focus of a storm of controversy last 
season after a Michigan woman wrote to its advertisers to complain, has 
returned to its usual irreverence, said co-executive producer Michael Moye. 
</P>
<P>
Moye said that when Terry Rakolta first made headlines by asking advertisers to 
boycott the show, there was "a lot of overreaction" at Fox Broadcasting -- but 
that the company has since allowed the producers as much creative freedom as 
they had last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of feverish meetings going on that we had to suffer through," 
he said. "We just had to ride it out. Our show is intrinsically controversial; 
there is nothing we could do to really change it without destroying the theme 
of the show." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dungan and Jeff Stein, executive producers of the long-running ABC comedy 
"Mr. Belvedere" and the new NBC comedy "Sister Kate," about a nun in charge of 
an orphanage, reported that they have had more discussions with NBC than with 
ABC -- but that that was to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall either network saying we have to watch it because of this 
outside pressure," Dungan said. "You know, with 'Belvedere,' you're talking 
about an established show. But with the NBC show, it's new and it's fragile. 
You're not only doing a new show, but you're doing a new show about a woman who 
is a nun, and it involves children -- you will be put under a microscope." 
</P>
<P>
The "microscope" picked up one objectionable line in "Sister Kate's" first 
episode -- and cut it. 
</P>
<P>
In the scene, Sister Kate (Stephanie Beacham), armed with a golf club, breaks 
in on one of her teen-age girls on a date with a boy who is trying to force 
himself on her. "What are you doing here?" the boy asks. Her original response: 
"I'm here to hit some balls." 
</P>
<P>
The producers agreed to replace the line with "I'm here to up your handicap." 
Stein said they did so as a favor to the network rather than as a result of 
pressure, however. "It's a new show in an 8 o'clock time slot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, despite last season's dissent over lingerie in "Nightingales," 
the same episode of "Sister Kate" did include a scene in which two of the 
show's teen-age girls posed in short lace nightgowns around a sleeping older 
man for what were described as potential blackmail photos. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get a note from the network on that, because it played funny -- not 
smarmy," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC did have concerns about how much flesh would be on display in "Baywatch," 
its new Friday-night drama focusing on the lives of Malibu lifeguards. Grant 
Tinker, president of GTG Entertainment, which produces the series, said the 
network was worried that the bikini-clad bodies on the beach might conjure up 
memories of the lingerie-and-leotard scenes that caused the "Nightingales" 
flap. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC made it very clear -- and I hope we didn't need to hear this -- that they 
didn't want a T&amp;A show," Tinker said. "They did expect us to exercise good 
judgment and good taste in terms of telling the story. They just didn't want a 
lot of people oiling their bodies instead of telling a story. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (the networks) got a little burned last year, and it scared 'em," 
said Tinker, a former chairman of NBC. "Not just because we are all supposed to 
be good citizens, but because the advertisers began to grumble and mutter. When 
that happens, it can really get to you in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Living Dolls," about a houseful of teen-age models sharing quarters much 
as the "Nightingales" nurses did, seems a prime target for comparison; the 
girls even start their day with an aerobics class. So far, however, the 
producers of the comedy, which debuts Tuesday, say they have received no 
cautionary notes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that several years ago, at the height of ABC's era of 'jiggle 
television,' we would be skewing the show a little differently," said 
co-executive producer Phyllis Glick. "We have four very attractive girls on the 
show. It's possible that we would be costuming them differently, or thinking of 
the (camera) angles that would be more exploitative. That's not happening now, 
and I think it's not just specifically as a result of 'Nightingales,' but a 
result of an evolution of several years of television. I think audiences are 
not responding to it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Downing, an executive producer of ABC's action series "MacGyver," said 
that the network does limit the number of gunshots, the number of "hooks to the 
head" and -- depending on which advocacy group is in vogue at the time -- the 
number of alcoholic drinks poured or cigarettes smoked. He added, however, that 
the standards this season are no different from previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The content of shows, Downing suggested, will probably continue to be 
determined by the best interest of the network rather than by the demands of 
advocacy groups. "The bottom line is . . . some producers have enough power 
that other people don't tell them what to do," he said. "You'll always see 
shows that get away with more outrageous things than other shows, if it's a hot 
producer who the big shots at the network don't want to (cross) -- or if they 
are particularly interested in seeing a certain show go on the air."

REMEMBERING BERLIN -- ALWAYS;

<P>
'IF YOU'RE A PRO YOU WRITE WHAT YOU GOTTA WRITE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK HIRSHBERG, Hirshberg, a publicist at Paramount in the 1940s, worked 
with Irving Berlin on White Christmas and Blue Skies. Following are 
recollections and excerpts of conversations he taped over the years with the 
reclusive composer who died Friday at age 101. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had the good fortune to work on an almost daily basis with Irving Berlin for 
close to two years at one time, and for other shorter spans. We had many 
conversations, some of which I managed to record. This was no minor 
accomplishment inasmuch as Berlin, a wiry, supercharged individual, aspired to 
assert complete control over any project with which he was associated. 
</P>
<P>
He was almost always in motion, seldom remaining seated for more than a few 
minutes unless he was at the piano. He preferred to patrol the executive 
corridors at Paramount Studios, where we worked, or pace nervously in circles 
around his office, frequently in shirt sleeves, lost in introspection, hands 
clasped behind his back, torso bent slightly forward as he moved. Like an ice 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
He was a genial man, as sharp a businessman as he was a beguiling and 
perceptive poet. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin once told me, with his customary candor, that some of his output "was 
trash." Nonetheless, his ability to churn out songs so enchanting and timeless 
that their appeal spans generations and socioeconomic strata and national and 
racial boundaries is unrivaled in the annals of American music. 
</P>
<P>
"Some songs just write themselves," Berlin said. "Take 'Cheek to Cheek,' for 
instance. It is quite a long, involved song. I wrote it for Astaire and Rogers 
in 'Top Hat.' I did it after dinner one evening while staying at the Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, I was not satisfied lyrically with 'Always.' I had the tune 
finished for months but couldn't get the lyric right. Then one day I just 
ad-libbed it and it worked. For me, lyrics are the hardest part." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no special recipe for success," Berlin told me. "Some very good songs 
never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the timing is wrong and a good song dies. It happens to all writers. 
In my opinion, Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine' is one of the greatest pieces 
of music written by anybody. It was in a show called 'Jubilee' many years ago 
and it was a failure until much later Artie Shaw, the big-band leader, made a 
recording and everyone suddenly discovered it is a classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'White Christmas' because I had to write a song about Christmas for 
the show. I was a good songwriter so I wrote a good song." 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain basic emotions, not only in songwriting and play writing but 
also in making speeches or writing stories. There's self-pity, which is 'All 
Alone' or 'Remember' . . . where you feel sorry for yourself. There's 
happiness. There's the straight love song, like 'Always.' There's the homesick 
song -- songs about Dixie. There's the patriotic song, such as 'God Bless 
America.' 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've written songs that were failures. You can be so clever that 
you write around your subject and become oblique. Your pencil becomes so sharp 
that you write from the outside rather than the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all amateurs until we write a hit, and there are no basic rules. When I 
started, we were confined to an octave and maybe a note, although 'Alexander's 
Ragtime Band' went beyond that. Then Jerome Kern came along and wrote two 
octaves, or an octave and three quarters. It didn't make a darn bit of 
difference because Jerome Kern had talent and a heart of gold and he just wrote 
great melodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can give you all sorts of rules, but you may go home and break them all and 
write the biggest hit ever written. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pro you write what you gotta write. Someone needs a ballad, you 
write a ballad. It's a matter of talent. Some of the biggest hits I've had were 
written because we needed a ballad in the publishing house. I've written many 
songs because the situation called for a boy and a girl to sing a love song. 
</P>
<P>
"Take 'Annie Get Your Gun.' Herbert and Dorothy Fields wrote the book about 
Annie Oakley, who was a fantastic rifle shot. The situations called for a love 
song, so I wrote 'They Say That Falling in Love Is Wonderful.' I thought that 
would be the big hit. We all felt 'I Got the Sun in the Mornin' would be a 
rhythm smash. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Annie Get Your Gun' has 16 songs. It's a true story. Frank Butler was the 
world's greatest marksman with a rifle. But when Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, 
in which Butler starred, came to town, little Annie Oakley beat him. Buffalo 
Bill asked Annie to join his show but she didn't want to leave home. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to write a song that would sell her on the idea of coming along . . . 
the glories of riding on a train. The excitement. I tried to wrap it up in one 
phrase, and the phrase was 'There's No Business Like Show Business.' I wrote it 
as a throwaway song to advance the story line. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan it as an anthem for show business. But, according to my ASCAP 
survey, it is my most-performed song. Not the biggest record seller, but the 
most-performed." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a professional songwriter, you write. You write in the morning, you 
write at night, you write in a taxi or on the subway. You have it in your mind 
until you're finished, and even after it's finished. It may turn out to be very 
bad. I have songs written years ago that I'd still like to change. 
</P>
<P>
"A professional songwriter doesn't work business hours. He subconsciously 
gathers material and ideas all the time. I don't have a notebook filled with 
titles or these ideas, but they're tucked away somewhere in memory. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing about longevity in this business. You don't get 
holier-than-thou. You don't give something to the public with the attitude 
that, well, here it is and you damn better like it. You try to guess what they 
want and then try to please them." 
</P>
<P>
"(George M. Cohan) was my ideal," Berlin said. "I tried to write like him. He 
was the fellow who supplied special material to the guys who sang in the 
saloons when I was a kid. I started by writing parodies of current songs by 
other composers -- at first I just wrote lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a bit older I became a singing waiter, and I want you to know I was 
a pretty good one. At least, I thought I was pretty good until we made the 
movie version of 'This Is The Army' at Warner Brothers in which I sang 'Oh, How 
I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.' An electrician heard my prerecording and said 
that if the guy who wrote that song could hear this fellow sing it he'd turn 
over in his grave." 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is principally in the creation of songs," Berlin once told me. 
"But we live in a country and society that is based on free enterprise. Just 
try buying a painting by Picasso or Cezanne and see what you'll be charged." 
Around 1944, Berlin bought up copyrights to all his songs. They are still owned 
by his estate. He refused more than one offer in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars for his catalogue, claiming he would not know what to do with the money 
and the would-be purchasers would not know what to do with his music. 
</P>
<P>
At his death, Berlin was still living in the house on Beekman Place in New York 
which he purchased in 1946 from its builder and original owner, the late James 
Forrestal, one-time Navy Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to rent it but we couldn't, so we bought it," he remembered. "It's 
on the East River in what is supposed to be a fashionable neighborhood. But the 
East River doesn't impress me because they picked me out of the East River when 
I was a kid . . . a little lower downtown, perhaps, but still the same river, 
tugboats and all." 
</P>
<P>
During his life Berlin stubbornly resisted all offers to use his life story as 
the basis for a Broadway musical or film. He told me that when he died his 
children could make such a decision, if they chose. 
</P>
<P>
"My private life is private, but I'll be very happy to talk about it," he said 
puckishly. "We have a nice corner house in New York. We spend out summers in 
the Catskills, and we go there in winter, too. There's lots of deer up there. 
And snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I seldom relax. My hobby is songwriting. My wife and I used to go dancing, but 
we'd sooner sit and talk. I'm not a good dancer. I'm a very big eater. I like 
good food. I like to cook but they tell me I cook badly. I've found if you buy 
good meat you should leave it alone -- the same as with a good song. Don't do 
too big of an arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin said the most important advice he would offer aspiring songwriters was, 
"Never throw anything away." 
</P>
<P>
"During World War I, I wrote a song at Camp Upton for a soldier show called 
'Yip, Yip Yaphank'," he said. "I intended it as the finale but we didn't use 
it. It went into the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1938 I was in London for the opening of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band.' It was 
September, near the time Neville Chamberlain came back from meeting Hitler with 
his piece of paper about peace in our time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was distraught about the threat of war, and when I returned to New York I 
wanted to write a patriotic song. I wrote one called 'Thanks, America,' but it 
was a very sad song. 
</P>
<P>
"But the word 'America' recalled the song I wrote 20 years earlier at Camp 
Upton. I hauled it out of the trunk and rewrote it. The first 16 bars and the 
last eight are exactly as they were written originally, but I changed the 
middle because I wanted to write a song about peace, not about war. 
</P>
<P>
"A short time afterwards, when Kate Smith asked me to write a patriotic song 
for her, I just gave her the revised version of the old song." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was "God Bless America" rescued from the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my personal favorite song." 
</P>
<P>
When last we talked, Berlin seemed interested in dispelling a myth about his 
keyboard ability. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I can only play that special piano with the movable keyboard. I 
play in the key of F sharp, which are the black keys. Years ago all fakers 
played that way. We played by ear, and the publishing companies had these 
transposing pianos because we could not transpose. We really could not write 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"For me F sharp happened because the black keys are right under your fingers. 
But as I progressed, I got to know the relative keys. I took lessons once or 
twice but I wasn't any good. 
</P>
<P>
"George M. Cohan had a couple of transposing pianos. He played in the key of C, 
which is also supposed to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I began composing away from the piano. I developed a system 
whereby I envisioned the keyboard in my mind, and I could encode the proper 
notes on paper. I work mainly with ideas. I write words and music together, one 
phrase at a time. But I can play any piano." 
</P>
<P>
Today Berlin's old moveable piano stands mute in the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington.

REMEMBERING BERLIN-ALWAYS; 
</P>
<P>
THE BEST TRIBUTE IS TO TREAT HIS SONGS WITH RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irving Berlin lived longer than he wanted to live. That's got to be the message 
of his later years, when he was only a voice on the phone to his friends and 
business associates, and then not even that. 
</P>
<P>
A Carnegie Hall tribute was the only celebration that Berlin, who died Friday 
of natural causes, allowed for his 100th birthday last year. He didn't attend 
it and didn't acknowledge it. Perhaps it depressed him. He wasn't producing hit 
songs now, and that was how he had always measured success. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin has been public property since 1912, but we have never known much about 
the inner man. He refused to write his biography and refused to let anyone else 
do so. There would be no movie version of his life either. His life was his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
He was also exceptionally protective of his songs. In 1980, a small Los Angeles 
theater put together a revue of Berlin's pre-1920s material called "Early 
Berlin." A phone call from New York cut short its run. You didn't do an Irving 
Berlin show without consulting Irving Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
A suspicious man -- but then he had to keep his wits about him as a kid selling 
papers on the Lower East Side. Berlin counted his royalties for a good reason: 
he could remember being poor. 
</P>
<P>
He never studied music. He couldn't even read music. He got "secretaries" to 
take down his stuff. Perhaps we will learn more, now, about how that worked. In 
any case, Berlin published at least a thousand songs and may have left a 
thousand more in his trunk. 
</P>
<P>
His output includes great songs, good songs, songs that did the job and 
potboilers. The man who wrote "Remember" and "Always" also wrote "Any Bonds 
Today" and "I Like Ike." 
</P>
<P>
That's not so surprising as the fact that the man who wrote "Oh, How I Hate to 
Get Up in the Morning" also wrote "Let's Face the Music and Dance." 
</P>
<P>
Again there's a mystery here. Berlin wasn't a faceless composer. There is such 
a thing as a typical Irving Berlin song. Whether the mood is snappy ("I Love a 
Piano") or sad ("All Alone"), the tune will be simple and the words will be "so 
natural that you want to go to war." 
</P>
<P>
(Years later, Berlin said that if this line from "Alexander's Ragtime Band" 
sounded too martial, it could be changed to "so natural that you want to hear 
some more." Has anyone ever sung it that way?) 
</P>
<P>
His early songs are as unpretentious as a straw hat. They are even corny. 
"Waiting for a ring . . . a ting-a-ling. . . . " Cole Porter wouldn't have 
written that in a million years. But at the top of the 1930s, Berlin started 
writing stuff that matched Porter for sophistication and even went beyond him 
in a certain respect: songs like "Puttin' on the Ritz," "Cheek to Cheek," 
"Let's Face the Music and Dance." 
</P>
<P>
These were luxury-liner songs that nevertheless had something dark about them, 
a sense that the ship was nearing the iceberg. Fred Astaire, who introduced 
many of these songs, was a major influence here. But so were the times. Berlin 
had lost a lot of money in the Crash, and wasn't sure what was on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1940s, he had turned into a national institution, the composer of "God 
Bless America" and "White Christmas." But there was a question in his own mind 
as to whether he could write the score for the new Ethel Merman musical, "Annie 
Get Your Gun," originally assigned to the late Jerome Kern. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin wasn't sure that a musical about Annie Oakley was his kind of a show. 
This was resolved when the idea of "Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better" came 
to him in a taxi cab. He wrote it overnight. How come? "They needed it right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin couldn't explain his gift and didn't want to analyze it. It had 
something to do with feelings and something to do with a shrewd sense of what 
the public wanted; but that was as far as he cared to go. All that bothered him 
was that "someday I'll reach for my talent and it won't be there." 
</P>
<P>
In 1962 he wrote a Broadway show called "Mr. President." It had an enormous 
advance sale, but it got dreadful notices, and quickly closed. Broadway decided 
(or perhaps Berlin decided) that he no longer knew what the theater audience 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later MGM scrapped a big Berlin musical film, "Say It With Music," 
and this was his farewell to Hollywood. He had once told a reporter that he 
couldn't retire: that he needed to work to stay happy. "When I rest I get 
restless." Now he had nothing to do but rest. No wonder he turned to the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
His death will bring more all-star tributes. The biggest tribute would simply 
be to treat his songs with respect. We have come to treat them carelessly, like 
furniture that has always been there. That was the attitude at the 
under-rehearsed Carnegie Hall birthday concert, which richly deserved Berlin's 
snub. It was as if the performers thought that all they had to do was remind 
the audience of Berlin's songs, without having studied them on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Not so. Berlin's work needs to be approached as carefully as Joan Morris 
approaches the ballads of the 1890s. His songs aren't as naive as they look, 
and when they are, that naivete has to be respected. 
</P>
<P>
Ella Fitzgerald does so when she sings "How About Me?" in "The Irving Berlin 
Songbook." Bernadette Peters does so all the time: she understands Berlin's 
forlorn shopgirls perfectly. Or, listen to Sinatra's "How Deep Is the Ocean." 
"And if I ever lost you . . . how much would I cry?" sounds as if he has lost 
her. 
</P>
<P>
For all Berlin's pep, it's his sad songs that we believe the most.

PARTY ICONS REPLACE FALLEN CHINA GODDESS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the spot in Tian An Men Square where student demonstrators set up a "Goddess 
of Democracy" this spring, there now stand the figures of a worker, a peasant, 
a soldier and an intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
These "socialist art" icons of Chinese communism, set up for the Oct. 1 
National Day celebrations, and the students' statue, which was modeled after 
the Statue of Liberty and destroyed by martial-law troops on the night of June 
3-4, symbolize two clashing visions of China's future. 
</P>
<P>
The new, 25-foot-high figures symbolize the old Maoist dream of dictatorship by 
a worker-peasant-soldier alliance, combined with new emphasis placed during the 
past decade on respect for technical and scientific skills. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, China's still-dominant octogenarian revolutionaries 
have sought desperately to crush the vision symbolized by the "Goddess of 
Democracy" and reimpose stability based on the type of hard-line Marxist 
ideology represented by the new statues. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasis on the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung's dictum that art must serve 
socialism is only one of many elements in this attempt to suppress all 
opposition and reinforce political orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrests and Executions 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of arrests, at least 30 executions, a continued search for fugitive 
pro-democracy activists, purges of reformist officials from party and 
government positions, waves of televised propaganda and new political 
indoctrination sessions in schools and at workplaces -- all are aimed at 
consolidating more restrictive political and economic policies and ensuring 
that street protests do not break out again. 
</P>
<P>
Orders also have been issued that many young university graduates in Beijing 
are to be sent to provincial cities or rural towns for a year or more of 
lower-level work experience. These transfers are aimed especially at people who 
graduated within the last five years and now work in central government offices 
or Communist Party organizations. Many college graduates who wish to enter 
graduate school are also being required to work at a job for at least a year 
before continuing their studies. 
</P>
<P>
The summer-long crackdown has restored a superficial calm in Beijing and 
throughout the country. But helmeted soldiers still stand guard at major 
bridges and intersections in the capital, and police are making spot checks of 
personal identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
In what amounts to a symbol of continued instability, Tian An Men Square, the 
center of this spring's protests, remains closed to ordinary pedestrian 
traffic, although Chinese and foreign visitors in organized groups can receive 
permission to sightsee in the square. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly announced figures on arrests are in the range of 5,000, but it is 
clear that far more people -- perhaps 10,000, perhaps more than double that 
figure -- have in fact been detained. Arrests are still continuing, although 
the current rate is impossible to determine. Some of those detained have 
already been released after periods of intense interrogation and ideological 
indoctrination and, at least in a few cases, beatings. 
</P>
<P>
Executions have taken a toll of uncertain magnitude. China has officially 
announced about 30 executions that appeared to be related to the June unrest, 
but whether much larger numbers of protesters have been executed secretly is 
impossible to know. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Meng, a respected writer associated with less restrictive policies toward 
the arts, has been removed from his position as minister of culture, and a more 
orthodox ideologue, He Jingzhi, has taken over his duties. 
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiang, a key reformist ally of ousted Communist Party General Secretary 
Zhao Ziyang, was fired earlier this month from the post of governor of Hainan 
province. Liang's ouster came as part of an anti-corruption drive -- he was 
accused of "abusing power for private gain" -- but this effort appears to be 
partially intended as a tool for attacks on Zhao's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crackdown on Media 
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to reassert hard-line control of the media, editors of 
several of the nation's most important official newspapers have been replaced 
and at least a dozen journalists were detained, although some were subsequently 
released. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy-handed propaganda campaign is playing a key role in the process of 
control. It aims to rewrite the history of this spring's student protests and 
establish an official version of events, officially described as a 
"counterrevolutionary rebellion," from which public deviation is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But there are many indications that at least in Beijing, where hundreds of 
thousands of people took to the streets in support of the pro-democracy student 
demonstrators who were at the core of the protests, the government has had 
little success in convincing the public that the bloody crackdown in June was 
justified. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died that night as the army 
shot its way into the city against crowds seeking to block its path. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Communist Party member," one Beijing area university student told a 
foreign acquaintance a few days ago, "but I still think the (student) movement 
was right." 
</P>
<P>
More remarkable than that sentiment is the fact that the young man made his 
statement in front of three other Chinese. He acknowledged that he could lose 
his party membership for such a comment but expressed confidence that he could 
trust those who were with him not to turn him in. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most profound differences between the current crackdown and 
earlier waves of political repression in China. On campuses and also in many 
work units, friends and colleagues know that everyone resents the government's 
actions. Many Chinese are cautious, but some feel they need not be. In general, 
only those who were deeply involved in the pro-democracy protests are genuinely 
afraid. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, however, it is an act of some bravery for Chinese to talk to 
foreigners these days. While there are no restrictions on casual conversations 
between foreign tourists or business people and Chinese, students at some 
Beijing campuses have been warned they will be punished if caught talking to 
foreign diplomats or journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"The view I've been getting is that the events of the past three months were 
horrible and very deeply upsetting to China's intellectuals, but they tend to 
take a long-range view . . . that things haven't really permanently changed 
course or direction," a visiting American scholar commented recently. 
</P>
<P>
"They very much want the outside world to see it that way," he added. "They do 
not want to be punished (by foreign rejection of academic contacts) and they do 
not want China to be punished. . . . (But) there is an underlying feeling of 
anxiety. They're not sure how much further the current atmosphere of scrutiny 
of intellectuals will be carried. There is this sense of waiting for the other 
shoe to drop." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harsh Rhetoric 
</P>
<P>
This sense of foreboding is reinforced by harsh rhetoric, some of it 
reminiscent of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, that has reappeared in the 
state-run media over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
A mid-September commentary in the official Guangming Daily declared that "class 
enemies" have opposed the "people's democratic dictatorship" by spreading the 
theory that "class struggle has been wiped out" and by advocating "bourgeois 
democracy, freedom and human rights." 
</P>
<P>
Such class enemies, the commentary declared, must be "firmly, precisely and 
ruthlessly" attacked. 
</P>
<P>
As part of National Day preparations, some billboards in Beijing also have 
resumed carrying propaganda messages. 
</P>
<P>
"Support the Four Cardinal Principles . . . Carry Forward the Construction Work 
of Socialist Modernization in the Capital," declares one such message. 
</P>
<P>
The Four Cardinal Principles are socialism, the "people's democratic 
dictatorship," the leadership of the Communist Party and "Marxism, Leninism and 
Mao Tse-tung thought." 
</P>
<P>
The government also has launched a new wave of censorship against publications 
deemed to be pornographic or politically subversive. Particular efforts have 
been made to suppress the works of reformers who have fled overseas. In Beijing 
alone, 490,000 banned books and periodicals have been seized, according to a 
report Friday by the official New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown has alienated virtually an entire generation of educated youth, 
who until the June slaughter had placed great hopes in the possibility of rapid 
liberalization of the Communist Party itself. Ambitious, educated young people 
in China today have only one dream: to study abroad. Only a tiny percentage 
will succeed, but many have turned their energies to studying English and 
trying to work through the bureaucratic maze of domestic and foreign hurdles 
they must overcome if they are to escape China through this route. 
</P>
<P>
For most of these students, the greatest hurdles still lie abroad -- in winning 
university acceptance, arranging financial assistance and, in the case of the 
United States, convincing consular officials that they do not intend to become 
immigrants, as such an intention disqualifies them under U.S. law from 
receiving student visas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese government has also imposed a variety of new restrictions on 
the pursuit of study abroad, including cuts in funding for certain categories 
of students and imposition of a new rule requiring those who receive a foreign 
visa to go back to a public security office for final approval to leave China. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the lines outside Western embassies this summer have been longer than 
ever, and the study of English has never been so popular. 
</P>
<P>
An American English teacher in Beijing described the situation this way: "One 
of my students from last year . . . told me that he tries to spend all his time 
working on his studies and exercising now, partially to keep his mind off the 
'environment,' which he says depresses him, and partially to improve his 
chances of going overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he and his classmates have all been feeling very depressed lately, and 
all of them . . . are working harder than ever to improve their chances of 
going overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Students also have taken songs praising socialism or the Communist Party and 
used them either as calls for rebellion or as vehicles for ridicule, all 
without needing to change the words. 
</P>
<P>
During this month's Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, a time when friends traditionally 
gather at a pleasant spot outdoors to view the full moon, a group of students 
met on a Beijing campus for a songfest. 
</P>
<P>
This was no happy occasion, however, according to one of those who 
participated. The songs were superficially acceptable to authorities -- tunes 
such as "Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China," "The Sky Is 
Bright Over New China" and a song about how the People's Liberation Army 
liberates the Chinese people. But as the students sang, many of them cried. 
</P>
<P>
Educated young people are not the only ones who have tuned out the government's 
propaganda drive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most politically reliable individuals in China are the maids and 
drivers of the Diplomatic Service Bureau, an agency of the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry that enforces a monopoly on the provision of service personnel for 
diplomats and journalists stationed in Beijing. It is an open secret that part 
of the function of these people is to spy on the foreigners for whom they work. 
</P>
<P>
But when a foreign resident in Beijing got a chance recently to stand near the 
door of a meeting room and watch a political education class for maids and 
drivers of the bureau, it was clear that most of those in the study session 
were exceedingly bored or on the verge of falling asleep.

SHAMIR SEEKS TO MUZZLE CABINET ON PEACE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir moved Sunday to muzzle public remarks by Cabinet 
ministers on a politically divisive Egyptian peace initiative. 
</P>
<P>
An outspoken critic of the initiative himself, Shamir called on his ministers 
to make no more comments about the plan without first checking with the Foreign 
Ministry, an Israel Radio report said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his morning Cabinet meeting, the broadcast disclosed, the prime 
minister appeared to be directing his criticism at Shimon Peres, head of the 
Labor Party and Shamir's deputy prime minister in a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Peres is visiting the United States, where he has repeatedly told interviewers 
that he believes that the initiative of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
presents good possibilities for bringing Israelis and Palestinians together for 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, like Shamir a member of the Likud Party, the 
senior partner in the ruling coalition, is also traveling in the United States, 
and was quoted in Los Angeles as critical of Peres for speaking on foreign 
affairs, Arens' own field. 
</P>
<P>
Differences between the two parties have stirred feverish speculation here 
about the future of the coalition government. The Jerusalem Post, in its Sunday 
editions, quoted unidentified sources in Shamir's office as saying that Labor 
Party ministers' "promoting" Mubarak's initiative while traveling abroad "is no 
longer tolerable." 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is not willing to compromise on the government's (own) 
initiative," the Post quoted its sources as saying. "If a confrontation such as 
(abandoning the Likud-Labor coalition and) going to elections is necessary, 
Shamir would prefer it now." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir put forward the Israeli plan in May, calling for elections of a panel of 
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to negotiate interim 
self-rule in the territories and, later, the future of the disputed land. 
Earlier this month, Mubarak formally countered with a list of 10 conditions, or 
modifications, to the Shamir plan, which he said could bring the two sides 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization and leading West Bank Palestinians had 
rejected the Israeli proposal for failing to specify certain conditions. 
Mubarak's modifications have filled in some of the blanks but raised points 
that Likud finds unacceptable. One recommends including several Palestinians 
from outside the territories on a delegation to discuss the elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shamir, Rabin Differ 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister, Labor's Yitzhak Rabin, went to Cairo last week to discuss 
the Egyptian plan with Mubarak and, speaking there and on his return, called 
the initiative "an important step." According to one political analyst here, 
Shamir considers himself close to Rabin and has been hurt by the public break 
on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister himself has political restraints within his own party from 
right-wing ministers such as Ariel Sharon. "There are sincere differences over 
Mubarak's 10 points," the analyst said, "but there's a lot of political 
brinkmanship going on too. The coalition could break over this issue, but some 
sort of compromise is more likely." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has called for a meeting of his so-called Inner Cabinet on the peace 
process once Peres and Arens return to Israel, hoping to debate and settle the 
matter behind closed doors. On Sunday, however, a minister of the religious 
Sephardic Torah Guardians, or Shas party, called for a referendum on the issue, 
an improbable prospect but one that would bring the debate fully into the 
political arena. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the clandestine leadership of the Palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories distributed a leaflet Sunday demanding a role for the PLO 
in the process, criticizing the Mubarak initiative for not providing for one.

AIDS TRIALS SHORTCHANGE MINORITIES AND DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blacks, Latinos and intravenous drug users, the groups increasingly afflicted 
with AIDS virus infections, are significantly under-represented in federally 
sponsored AIDS clinical trials, according to a Times analysis of government 
statistics obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of August, blacks and Latinos accounted for 42% of adult AIDS 
patients in the United States but only 20.4% of patients that have been 
enrolled in National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) AIDS 
trials. Intravenous drug users accounted for 27.5% of adult AIDS patients but 
only 11.3% of the participants in the federal studies. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a matter of frustration to us," said Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of 
the NIAID AIDS program. "We want to change (the participation of minorities and 
drug users), but you can't just push a button in Washington and have everything 
change all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
The low representation of members of minority groups and drug users means that 
researchers cannot gather optimal information about new AIDS therapies for 
these patients, according to leading AIDS researchers and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs may behave differently in different racial and ethnic groups and in 
women," said Dr. Richard Chaisson, director of the AIDS service at the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. "Consequently, you can't generalize from studies 
done in middle-class gay white men." 
</P>
<P>
For example, blacks and whites have important differences in their response to 
common high blood pressure drugs. Researchers will not be able to learn if 
similar differences are important for AIDS drugs unless they study the drugs in 
substantial numbers of whites and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Many intravenous drug users are also treated with other drugs, such as 
methadone. Researchers will not be able to learn if AIDS drugs, such as AZT, 
have beneficial or harmful interactions with methadone and other psychoactive 
drugs unless they conduct studies of patients who are taking them. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, members of minority groups and intravenous drug users may be 
deprived of their "only opportunity to obtain access to a promising new (AIDS) 
treatment" that may be very expensive and in limited supply, according to Dr. 
Margaret Hamburg, a special assistant to the director of the NIAID program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inequity of Health Care 
</P>
<P>
The causes of the problem are complex. They range from an insufficient number 
of AIDS clinical research centers at hospitals and clinics that predominantly 
serve minorities to inadequate recruitment efforts by researchers and the 
general inequity of American health care, which favors the socio-economically 
advantaged. 
</P>
<P>
The government is taking remedial steps, such as sponsoring community programs 
for AIDS research and funding projects designed to increase minority 
participation in AIDS drug trials. Some universities have set up satellite 
research sites at hospitals with large numbers of minorities; UCLA has 
established sites at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance and Olive View 
Medical Center in Sylmar, and Harvard Medical School has established a site at 
Boston City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, these and other corrective measures have had little overall 
impact. Some say stronger actions are required. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government has its way of influencing you by the amount of money 
they put in your pocket," said Dr. Lawrence S. Brown Jr., senior vice president 
for research and medical affairs at the Addiction Research and Treatment Corp. 
in New York City. "There need to be some incentives attached to those dollars 
in terms of enrolling racial and ethnic minorities." The organization runs 
clinics that treat thousands of drug addicts, predominantly black and Latino, 
in Brooklyn and Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$57-Million Budget 
</P>
<P>
The federally sponsored trials, known as the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, are 
the nation's largest source of experimental AIDS care, with a 1989 budget of 
about $57 million. They are conducted at academic medical centers throughout 
the country, including five in California. Since the program began in 1986, 
more than 7,500 patients have been enrolled. Currently, there are about 5,500 
active participants. 
</P>
<P>
The Times analysis concentrated on the 32 largest AIDS clinical trials units, 
which primarily serve adult patients. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that at six units, including Harvard Medical School in Boston and 
Stanford University Medical Center, less than 10% of participants in trials are 
black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Merigan, director of the Stanford unit, said the medical center's 
statistics reflect the location of its campus, in an affluent suburban area. 
Merigan acknowledged that AIDS research centers need "to go where the patients 
are . . . if we are going to be in business in five years" but said researchers 
can't "do that overnight." 
</P>
<P>
At an additional 11 units, including UCLA, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco and 
two units in New York City, less than 20% of the participants are black or 
Latino. By comparison, the majority of AIDS patients in New York City and about 
24% of AIDS patients in California are black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Blacks Near Campus 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Samuel Bozzette, clinical director of the UC San Diego unit, said the 
representation of Latinos and intravenous drug users is proportionate but 
blacks are under-represented because most black residents of San Diego County 
do not live near the medical center campus. Bozzette said the unit does not 
"have the resources" to establish an off-campus clinic in a black community. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, four units have minority participation rates of 40% or more -- 
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, Cornell University Medical 
College and Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, and the University of 
Miami. County-USC Medical Center ranked fifth, with a minority participation 
rate of 38.1%. 
</P>
<P>
In other findings: 
</P>
<P>
* For intravenous drug users, 24 of the 32 units have participation rates of 
15% or less, including three units in New York City, where intravenous drug 
users represent more than 40% of newly diagnosed AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, intravenous drug users represent 25% or more of study participants 
at four units -- the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the 
University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Albert Einstein, and 
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers believe that current or previous intravenous drug users, by 
the very nature of their addiction, may be less suitable for drug trials than 
other potential participants. For instance, they may be more prone to miss 
appointments or medication doses and to seek pain medications from their 
physicians. As a result, researchers may need to give them more personal 
attention to assure successful participation. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford's Merigan, who has studied the issue, said such concerns are often 
blown out of proportion. While many intravenous drug users are reluctant to 
enroll in AIDS trials, most of those who enroll turn out to be "excellent" 
participants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Women represent 6.8% of the participants in the trials, compared to 8.9% of 
all adult AIDS patients. In part, the lower percentage of women in the trials 
reflects the fact that most women infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS, are minority group members or intravenous drug 
users. 
</P>
<P>
Hoth said there is no "systematic exclusion of women" from the federal trials, 
except for restrictions that women of childbearing age must not be pregnant and 
use contraception. 
</P>
<P>
This view was disputed by Iris Long, who directs an AIDS treatment registry 
that monitors trials in New York City and northern New Jersey. Long said that 
the women who have AIDS are almost all poor, and that "poor women do not have 
access" to the teaching hospitals where the trials are primarily conducted. 
</P>
<P>
* More than half of the nearly 300 children in federal AIDS trials are black or 
Latino. Nationally, blacks and Latinos account for about 75% of pediatric AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
In general, members of minority groups are under-represented in clinical trials 
of many diseases, compared to their proportion of the general population. But 
the problem is considered particularly significant for AIDS, because HIV 
infections are disproportionately common in minority groups. Moreover, many 
HIV-infected members of minority groups acquired the virus through intravenous 
drug use or sexual contact with an intravenous drug user. 
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose of clinical research studies, according to Hoth, is not to 
provide patients with access to experimental drugs but to find out as 
"expeditiously as possible" which drugs work. On the other hand, as Hoth 
explained at the international AIDS conference in Montreal in June, "clinical 
trials represent hope," and "it is only equitable that there should be equal 
access to clinical trials." 
</P>
<P>
From a practical standpoint, the patients who are recruited into research 
trials are those who receive primary health care at the hospitals where the 
trials are conducted. But financial and geographic barriers may prevent many 
HIV-infected individuals from seeking care at elite academic medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, poor patients, intravenous drugs users and patients without health 
insurance often do not have personal physicians at all. As a result, they are 
unlikely to learn about the trials that might benefit them, according to many 
of the researchers and government officials interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Some drug studies pay patients to participate, but the federally sponsored AIDS 
trials do not. The AIDS clinical trials units do receive federal funds to pay 
for their patients' medications and medical care, but they may still be 
"reluctant . . . to accept responsibility" for patients without health 
insurance or a personal physician, according to Hamburg of NIAID. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those interviewed explained that a research center might have to 
provide primary health care for patients who do not have personal physicians. 
Moreover, if an AIDS patient without health insurance developed pneumonia and 
needed to be hospitalized, the trials unit might need to use research funds to 
pay for the hospitalization, thereby decreasing the total number of patients it 
could enroll in studies. 
</P>
<P>
Many affluent academic medical centers also have general policies that 
discourage the admission of "uncompensated" patients. Enrolling a patient with 
health insurance might seem more attractive, because the insurance would likely 
pay for hospitalizations as well as routine physician visits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serve Own Patients First 
</P>
<P>
"The major universities have done a good job of serving white gay men, but have 
done less well serving blacks and Hispanics, particularly intravenous drug 
users," said Chaisson of Johns Hopkins. "The hospitals who (were) funded take 
care of their own patients, who happen to have insurance. They make an effort 
to recruit other patients, but they take care of their patients first." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Chaisson said he had discussed a proposed study of tuberculosis 
prevention in AIDS-virus infected individuals with about 70 other federally 
funded AIDS researchers during an AIDS clinical trials group meeting in July. 
The study would primarily enroll minorities and intravenous drug users; many 
middle-class whites have never been exposed to the bacillus that causes 
tuberculosis, and thus are not at risk. "Only three of the institutions said 
they had the patient population or interest in participating," Chaisson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another recruitment difficulty is that many minorities, unlike many 
middle-class whites, do not view research as a "clearly defined benefit," 
according to Carole Levine, executive director of the Citizens Commission on 
AIDS in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
For example, many blacks still have vivid memories of the infamous Tuskegee 
syphilis experiment. Between 1932 and 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service 
deliberately withheld treatment from more than 400 black men with syphilis to 
gather data on the unchecked progression of the disease, which can lead to 
severe disability and death. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (minorities) are suspicious of being used as guinea pigs even when 
they are not being used as guinea pigs," said Dr. Bruce Soloway, a family 
physician at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in New York City, which serves a minority 
population particularly hard-hit by the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"Real-life barriers" such as a lack of child care or transportation are also 
very significant, Levine said. Unlike medication and medical care, such 
expenses are usually not covered. Because participants undergo frequent tests 
and examinations, these expenses can be quite significant. 
</P>
<P>
Hoth said the federal government has "no formal policy" on providing child care 
and transportation for AIDS study participants but is studying the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Many minorities are also reluctant to leave their communities. As an example, 
Soloway said he had encouraged at least 50 of his patients over the last 
several years to enroll in federal AIDS Trial 019, the study which demonstrated 
that the drug AZT is effective in forestalling AIDS in some asymptomatic 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Although the research site, at Albert Einstein, was only several miles away, 
only one patient enrolled. "It is only two or three miles, but for some (of my 
patients) that is farther than they can possibly go," Soloway said. 
</P>
<P>
Soloway added that trials at the five clinical trials units in Manhattan "might 
as well be in Los Angeles," as far as his patients were concerned. "The 
precondition of doing research in these groups is to bring research to the 
patients, not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
The Times analysis also highlighted the lack of adult AIDS clinical trials 
units in five of the 13 metropolitan areas with the largest number of AIDS 
cases -- Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of an adult clinical trials unit is most striking in Houston, which 
has had more than 3,000 AIDS cases. Houston now ranks fourth in AIDS cases, 
behind New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Dallas, with 1,750 cases, ranks 
12th. 
</P>
<P>
In Pennsylvania, NIAID established AIDS clinical trials units in Pittsburgh, 
which has had about 400 AIDS cases, and Hershey, a town of 13,000 people 100 
miles west of Philadelphia. By comparison, no center was established in 
Philadelphia, although it has five medical schools. Philadelphia has had about 
2,200 AIDS cases and ranks ninth in AIDS cases nationally. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about these findings, NIAID's Hoth said geographic factors were "not 
taken into consideration" when most of the grants were initially awarded in 
1986 and 1987. "We felt the most important thing for the country was to get the 
scientifically best centers to get answers about which (AIDS) drugs work," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hoth said, the demographics of the epidemic, which at first 
primarily struck white gay men in San Francisco, New York City and Los Angeles, 
has shifted toward minorities and intravenous drug users and other metropolitan 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Hoth said the federal institute is now turning its attention to demographic and 
geographic factors. Earlier this month, for example, Hoth met with Texas 
investigators about the possibility of establishing an AIDS clinical trials 
unit there. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if demographics will be considered when grants to AIDS clinical trials 
units come up for renewal in 1991, Hoth said: "You better believe that 
demographics will be a factor." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year, the federal government will spend between $5 million and 
$10 million on projects designed to increase minority participation in AIDS 
drug trials, Hoth said. It has plans to expand the number of minority health 
professionals in AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NIAID AIDS program has hired Dr. George Counts, a senior 
infectious disease specialist who is black, from the University of Washington 
in Seattle, as chief of a new clinical research management branch. One of his 
key tasks is to make sure that the AIDS clinical trials units do a better job 
of recruiting minorities and intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Another widely publicized program, federally funded AIDS community research 
programs, may also help, but it is still in the planning stages. Although $6 
million is available to fund between 10 and 20 community programs, the 
government has yet to announce which programs will be funded. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
A WALK FOR AIDS

About 12,000 people walked in Hollywood, raising $1.8 million to fight AIDS.

AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks, Latinos and intravenous drug users are substantially under-represented 
in ongoing federally sponsored trials of new AIDS drugs. As of Aug. 28, 20.4% 
of the 7,659 patients who have been enrolled in National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) trials were black or Latino. By comparison, 
about 42% of adult AIDS patients in the United States are black or Latino. In 
the trials, 11.3% of the enrolled patients were previous or current users of 
intravenous drugs. By comparison, 27.5% of all adult AIDS patients report 
previous or current intravenous drug use. Women represent 6.8% of the enrollees 
in the trials, compared to 8.9% of all adult AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the percentages of blacks, Latinos, intravenous drug users and women 
in federal AIDS clinical trials, as well as comparable statistics for adult 
AIDS cases in the United States and California.

DRIVE PLANNED IN SCHOOLS TO COMBAT TEEN USE OF STEROIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the first major state effort to stem the growing use of anabolic steroids 
among U.S. teen-agers, California secondary-school teachers next month will 
begin receiving a comprehensive curriculum that emphasizes the dangers of 
taking drugs to boost muscle strength and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The steroid education package is designed to overcome traditional student 
antipathy toward drug education by using games, videos and student role-playing 
to drive home points about steroids, often little understood by the teen-agers 
who consider taking the powerful hormones. 
</P>
<P>
The material is geared toward broadening the knowledge of parents and school 
coaches as well. Educators say some coaches used steroids during their own days 
as athletes, and in some cases see steroid use as a way to enhance the 
competitiveness of their teams, overlooking the risks to students. 
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the San Diego County office of education have put the 80-page 
curriculum together under contract with the state Department of Education, 
which plans to tie the plan to its Healthy Kids, Healthy California initiative 
that covers exercise and nutritional concepts as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Reasonable' 
</P>
<P>
"It's an excellent idea to show that it is not reasonable to take any drug 
unless you are sick and have a reason to do so," said Dr. Don H. Catlin, chief 
of clinical pharmacology at the UCLA Medical Center and director of the testing 
laboratory for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Catlin consulted on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Impetus for the new curriculum has come from several areas, both nationally and 
locally. More than 6.6% of U.S. high school seniors said that they had used 
steroids in a national survey released by the American Medical Assn. in 
December, 1988. Some say the figure is probably higher in California -- 
especially in the Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego areas -- because the 
drugs can be obtained cheaply and without regulation across the border in 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
At Carlsbad High School last spring, a teacher's aide and part-time basketball 
coach was arrested and accused of selling anabolic steroids to school athletes. 
The aide, Gregory Thomas Triona, faces trial Oct. 30 in Vista Superior Court on 
felony charges of selling steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Public interest was stimulated by the suspension of Canadian sprinter Ben 
Johnson after his positive test for steroids during the 1988 Olympic Games in 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"This curriculum is long overdue," said Dr. Francis Nettl, a specialist in a 
joint UC San Diego-San Diego State University project on sports medicine and a 
finalist in track and field trials for the British Olympic team in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"This information needs to get out at an early stage, at even the junior high 
level, that there are serious side effects. . . ," Nettl said. "For too long, 
the sports world has denied anyone even used them, or that there were problems, 
even though (use) has been going on since the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Develop Strength 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids are synthetic chemical compounds that mimic the natural human 
body hormones that develop muscle mass and accentuate so-called masculine 
traits of body hair, aggression and deep voices. They are legally available in 
the United States only by prescription for use by starvation or burn victims 
and for other medical conditions where changing hormonal levels can be 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes have used them for years, mainly through black market purchases, to 
develop strength and bulk more quickly than through weightlifting and nutrition 
alone. Recently teen-agers have discovered their potential for improving 
physical appearance. 
</P>
<P>
But an increasing body of scientific data has shown many side effects, both 
short- and long-term, ranging from acne and shrunken testicles to stunted 
growth, dangerous cholesterol levels, liver cancer, high blood pressure, 
increased aggression and cardiovascular damage. 
</P>
<P>
It is the potential side effects that the new curriculum hopes to impress on 
students in a creative manner, although officials do not pretend that results 
will be quick or easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if students can be shown how they work and what can happen, they 
can begin to realize that the effects won't be worth it," said Justin 
Cunningham, a San Diego County office of education health specialist who wrote 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We deliberately avoid a how-to-use approach, as well as a scare tactics 
approach," said Cunningham, a former Kern County educator whose interest in 
steroids was piqued two years ago after he discovered that almost every player 
on the county's premier high school football team had taken steroids in the 
belief that the drugs would give them an edge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Illness 
</P>
<P>
The initial lessons, part of an intended five-part unit over a one-week period, 
involve students asking themselves whether they would risk serious illness or 
injury for the guarantee of an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
"Some will say 'yes' at the beginning," Cunningham said, which indicates the 
perceptions that educators find themselves dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of Cunningham's lessons explains anabolic steroids scientifically and 
shows that, as with any drug, individuals are affected in different ways. The 
students play a game of dice to simulate side effects, rolling one die at first 
to determine effects from initial use, later adding second and third dice as 
the chances of more serious side effects -- including death -- increase, along 
with higher dosages. 
</P>
<P>
"We also talk about ethics, having the students 'become' the Olympic committee 
and decide whether Ben Johnson should have been stripped of his medal," 
Cunningham said. "And finally, we try to point them toward reliable information 
on strength and development, on human performance, and also talk about 
alternatives for achieving (peer) security than emphasizing physical appearance 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
The strength coach at Rancho Buena Vista High School, San Diego County's 
top-ranked football team, said the curriculum will make his job easier. 
</P>
<P>
"It will make these kids think, participate and act on the information," said 
43-year-old Mike Burgener, a former Notre Dame football player, Olympic 
weightlifter and admitted user of steroids during his college days. "What I've 
been doing myself is more a lecture type of thing," which may or may not always 
be effective. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just get up and say, 'Don't take the drugs,' because that can turn 
them off," Burgener said. "You've got to let them make up their own minds." 
</P>
<P>
Nettl of the UC San Diego-San Diego State sports medicine program said that 
many coaches also need more education. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, they are probably guilty at times of turning kids on by telling 
a kid that if he wants a football scholarship, he needs to gain weight, and 
gives a name and number" of a person who will supply the steroids, Nettl said. 
"The coaches often believe there is no harm, that if you control the dose there 
won't be any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Burgener agreed in part, but said that, "while most coaches would never condone 
steroid use, sometimes by telling a student they want him bigger and faster 
without stressing there is a natural way to do it, through weights and 
nutrition, they leave the impression that steroids are OK, the Ben Johnson way 
. . . and the kids already know that steroids are around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Random Testing 
</P>
<P>
Nettl would like to see the curriculum coupled with random testing of athletes, 
including those in high school, as suggested this summer by the National High 
School Athletic Coaches Assn. in conjunction with the American Assn. for 
Clinical Chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that you have to have punishments, that whoever takes these will be 
heavily penalized, as horrible as that might sound to some," Nettl said. "It 
absolutely would have an effect on high-school kids because there would then be 
kids afraid, and there would be peer pressure not to take them . . . education 
alone can't do it, but can play a big part." 
</P>
<P>
For the meantime, the curriculum will be officially unveiled at a statewide 
conference of coaches next month. Robert Ryan, with the critical health issues 
unit at the state Department of Education, said the program should be at most 
school districts statewide by year's end.

HAITI'S MILITARY REGIME PLEDGES ELECTIONS IN '90

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military government announced Sunday that Haiti will hold general elections 
next year, transferring power to a civilian president. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Haiti's first presidential election since Jan. 17, 1988, when 
civilian Leslie Manigat was elected in balloting widely regarded as rigged by 
the army. Manigat was ousted in a military coup five months later. 
</P>
<P>
In a communique read over state radio Sunday, the government of Lt. Gen. 
Prosper Avril made the announcement of local, legislative and presidential 
elections next year. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections will be held in two rounds -- Oct. 17 and Nov. 11, 
1990. The first round will be among an expected field of about 10 candidates, 
and the second will be a runoff among an unspecified number of the top 
vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
"All dispositions have been taken to guarantee security and ensure a peaceful 
transition of power," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
The first free and fair general elections since Haiti gained independence from 
France in 1804 took place on Nov. 29, 1987. At least 34 voters were shot and 
hacked to death at the polls by thugs in collusion with the army, and the 
election was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Under Haiti's constitution, no member of the military can run for president 
within a year of resigning. To seek office, Avril would therefore have to 
resign before Oct. 17, but he has said repeatedly that he is heading a 
transition government that eventually will relinquish power to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer of power to a civilian government is one of the conditions the U.S. 
government has placed for full restoration of some $60 million in foreign aid 
suspended after the 1987 election massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Avril, who holds a law degree and was formerly associated with the 30-year 
Duvalier dictatorship, was installed as president on Sept. 17, 1988, in a coup 
by noncommissioned officers demanding an end to state-sponsored violence. The 
coup overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. 
</P>
<P>
The government announced the elections dates after receiving the 
recommendations of an independent electoral council Saturday. The nine-member 
council, which was set up in April to organize and oversee elections, spent the 
month of August on a nationwide fact-finding tour. 
</P>
<P>
The communique said the electoral council will set up its central, district, 
municipal and local offices between now and the end of the year and will take a 
census and register voters from January to March. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 3 million eligible voters, and the council will have to 
set up about 6,000 voting places.

JEWS' FEELINGS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, GLEMP SAYS

<P>
Cardinal Jozef Glemp said in an interview that neither he nor the Polish 
Catholic Church he leads had adequately understood the significance of the 
Auschwitz death camp as a symbol for Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there were some mistakes committed by the church. . . . We actually were 
not aware that there would be such deep feelings on the part of Jews toward 
this place. We actually did not understand the Shoah (Holocaust) doctrine," 
Glemp said at his Warsaw residence. 
</P>
<P>
Remarks by Glemp last month resisting the relocation of a Catholic convent away 
from Auschwitz offended many Jews and pushed Polish-Jewish relations to a 
crisis point. About 2.5 million of the 4 million people who were killed by the 
Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II were Jews, and many Jews have objected 
to the convent's presence as an intrusion into what they say should be a Jewish 
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview Saturday, Glemp confirmed that he now favors moving the 
convent and reaffirmed the validity of a 1987 agreement between the Catholic 
church and Jewish organizations to relocate the convent building. He said that 
the Carmelite nuns would be moved away from the camp, although he said he could 
not name the date. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Jewish people also must understand the importance that 
Auschwitz has for Poles. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that Jews went through the Holocaust and they sacrificed so many 
lives, but we also would like them to know that Poles also went through 
exterminations at Oswiecim (Auschwitz)," Glemp said. 
</P>
<P>
In statements last month, the Polish church leader had sought to annul the 1987 
agreement to move the convent, calling the accord unacceptable and declaring 
that it would have to be renegotiated. Glemp said at the time that Jewish 
insistence that the church honor its agreement was an affront to Polish 
sovereignty. He also said that moving the nuns would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The primate's attempt at conciliation in Saturday's interview followed a 
statement by the Vatican last week, which supported the 1987 agreement and 
offered to help pay for a new convent to be built some distance from Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp said the Carmelite nuns had settled at Auschwitz in 1984 "with good 
intentions" and that it was not easy for Polish Catholics to understand why the 
convent's presence is offensive to Jews. He said it would require work in every 
Catholic parish to explain the Jewish view that the only fitting memorial at a 
site where so many Jews were gassed and burned is emptiness and silence.

<P>
With an American-style political convention and the slogan "Everything Will Be 
Better," the Sandinista National Liberation Front opened its electoral campaign 
Sunday by choosing President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez to 
run for reelection next Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
After a daylong debate among 1,700 party delegates, the Great Convention of the 
People also adopted a platform endorsing the revolutionary government's recent 
turn toward fiscal conservatism and export-led growth to revive the country's 
shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
The festive mood in Managua's modern convention center, animated by live folk 
music and hundreds of balloons, was a reflection of the Sandinistas' enormous 
advantage over the 14-party coalition led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the 
strongest of nine opposition candidates.

Clad in red and black neckerchiefs and armed with noisemakers, the delegations 
of blue-collar workers, farmers, combat veterans, war widows and other interest 
groups came from a Sandinista network of "mass organizations" that reaches into 
nearly every town and neighborhood and dwarfs the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Party of Militants' 
</P>
<P>
"In other countries, there are more sophisticated ways of campaigning, but ours 
is a party of militants," said Bayardo Arce, the convention chairman. "They 
give their evenings and weekends to the party. They are always campaigning, and 
this is our principal asset." 
</P>
<P>
It was with this edge in mind that the Bush Administration proposed last week 
to spend $9 million on the election campaign here, some in direct assistance to 
Chamorro's war chest and the rest on poll-watcher training and get-out-the-vote 
drives that will indirectly help the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas begin the campaign with a nearly 2-to-1 lead in independent 
opinion polls, with about 40% of the electorate still undecided. They have 
already begun an intense door-to-door campaign, seeking to identify and win 
over the uncommitted, and they are counting on contributions from 40,000 active 
party members, who give 4% of their salaries to the party. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, 43, who led the decade-old government as junta coordinator before his 
election as president in 1984, is consistently the most popular candidate in 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
He and Ramirez, a 47-year-old novelist and intellectual, were first nominated 
last May in an unpublicized meeting of the nine-man Sandinista National 
Directorate, of which Ortega is a member, and the two were ratified by 
acclamation at the end of the Managua convention Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In a tribute to Ortega's growing personal stature in a collective leadership, 
Interior Minister Tomas Borge, his longtime political rival, gave the 
nominating address. 
</P>
<P>
"The wisdom of collegial leadership has worked with success in the peculiar 
conditions of Nicaragua, but we do not deny the role of individuals," Borge 
said. "Who has run all over the world, tirelessly defending our point of view? 
Who has visited every corner of our country, facing the people and listening 
with infinite patience to complaints, demands and criticism? 
</P>
<P>
"Who? Him!" Borge declared, pointing to Ortega, who sat near him on the dais. 
Then the two men embraced. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, delegates wore T-shirts reading "Daniel Presidente," a sign 
of the convention's rubber-stamp role. 
</P>
<P>
But Sandinista leaders used the unprecedented public gathering -- and the weeks 
of intense consultations that preceded it -- to promote grass-roots 
participation in other decisions by the party, which is still evolving from its 
origin as a guerrilla army obedient to its comandantes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinista Front is not a secret society, and this is not a secret 
meeting," Ortega said. "This is an example of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The proceedings were open to the press and broadcast live on Radio Sandino, the 
ruling party's station. Some delegates rose to sing, recite poetry or otherwise 
praise the party leadership, but others offered blunt criticism. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, about half of the incumbents were dropped from the slate of 180 
Sandinistas nominated as candidates for the National Assembly, and several 
proposals were added to a platform drafted by party leaders -- among them calls 
for greater spending on universities and a more progressive tax structure. 
</P>
<P>
The platform is more specific than the opposition's in promising progress. It 
sets goals of 5% annual economic growth -- with 6,000 new houses, 1,000 new 
classrooms and 600 new buses per year -- and promises a massive literacy 
crusade like the one conducted in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Party officials said these goals are based on assumptions that Ortega will win, 
that the election will be widely perceived as fair, that the war with the 
U.S.-backed Contras will not resume and that Washington will eventually offer 
to renew economic assistance cut off in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The platform calls for a "respectful agreement" between the Sandinistas and the 
United States.

"Basically it was a bump on the head," said Stanley Davis, deputy press 
secretary for Dinkins, who is Manhattan borough president. Dinkins and three 
others were riding in a car that was broadsided by another auto. Dinkins was 
the winner of the Democratic mayoral primary this month.

One person was arrested outside a Chinatown restaurant Sunday during a 
demonstration protesting human rights violations in China. Inside, 600 people 
were attending a luncheon celebrating the 40th anniversary of China's Communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Although several protests have been staged by Chinese students and others in 
Los Angeles since troops crushed student-led, pro-democracy demonstrations in 
Beijing in June, the rallies have generally been peaceful and without arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Chich Jen Tung, 52, of Monterey Park, was booked on a misdemeanor charge of 
interfering with a police officer in performance of his duties. 
</P>
<P>
"He is from a group that is more strident, and we were unable to control him," 
said Ting Huang, a spokesman for the Chinese community groups and students 
staging the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Huang said that, as diners left the Golden Palace restaurant on North Broadway, 
demonstrators shouted in Chinese, "We have to overthrow the Chinese Communist 
Party!" and "How can you sit down and enjoy your meal when the meals are the 
blood, sweat and tears of the Chinese people!"

Israel's Housing Ministry is asking Tel Aviv residents to consider moving to 
the violence-torn occupied West Bank, site of a Palestinian uprising, for a 
better life away from city pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry, headed by hard-line Second Vice Prime Minister David Levy of the 
Likud Party, is offering special terms for about 200 homes at Jewish 
settlements near Tel Aviv, where prices are high and land is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Ministry Director General Amos Ungar told Israel Radio that the settlements 
offer "a better quality of life. It is still 5, 10, 15 minutes at the most from 
Tel Aviv." He said houses are larger in the settlements. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be able to enjoy the facilities of living not in the center of the 
city but, so to speak, in the countryside," Ungar said. 
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 Jews live in settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
home to 1.7 million Palestinians waging a 21-month-old uprising against Israeli 
rule.

COUNCILMAN POINTS OUT HE'S NO NEWCOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Robert A. Curtis likes to point out that he is no newcomer to 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, 34, moved there as a boy with his family in 1967, grew up in one of the 
community's first housing tracts, graduated from Mission Viejo High School in 
1973 and was the first student representative on the Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District board of education. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of USC and Loyola law school, he became active in partisan politics 
while in law school, serving as an assistant secretary in the state Republican 
Party. After a stint as law clerk for Justice William P. Clark of the state 
Supreme Court, he bought a plane ticket to New Hampshire in the winter of 1980 
to campaign for presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
That led to an appointment with the U.S. Justice Department in Washington, 
until "the grass looked greener" back in California. He moved to San Clemente 
to make a "Quixotic" run for Congress in the 43rd District in 1982, finishing 
12th among 18 in the primary, which was won by Johnnie R. Crean, who was later 
defeated by Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) in an unprecedented write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis enjoys politics and does not rule out running for higher office in the 
future. Though "content" with the challenges on the council, "if the 
opportunity arises in the future, I think I would seek it, but it depends on 
whether it's the right time and right place. There are a lot of personal and 
professional considerations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In private practice until earlier this year, Curtis recently became an 
assistant district attorney in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Although a conservative, Curtis came out in support of the controversial 
slow-growth Measure A in Orange County last year, arguing that it was necessary 
to assure roads for new development. Many of his colleagues were puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis enjoys his maverick image. His idols are Winston Churchill and Roman 
orator Marcus Cicero, for "each had periods of political isolation, but they 
are best remembered as being true to their values and principles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His favorite song, he confirmed with a laugh, is Frank Sinatra's rendition of 
"My Way." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the tape's worn out," he joked.

10 HURT JUMPING FROM VAN DURING CHASE ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM and JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a daring escape attempt, at least 10 people believed to be illegal 
immigrants jumped from a moving van on a busy stretch of Interstate 5 in San 
Clemente, some landing on the asphalt shoulder, others rolling down an 
embankment, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The van, a green 1974 Dodge, was being chased by Border Patrol agents. The 
people began "bailing out" of it sometime before 9 p.m. Saturday night as it 
slowed to 35 m.p.h. in the northbound lanes near the Avenida Pico off-ramp, an 
INS spokesman said. "There were bodies everywhere," said Mike Gregg, an agent 
for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the passengers, six of whom were women, were treated for various 
injuries at the scene, then taken to one of two area hospitals. A 10th person, 
a man who had suffered cuts and was badly bruised, was discovered wandering 
several hours later in a nearby residential neighborhood. Authorities were 
unable to determine the exact number of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
At least four of the injured remained hospitalized Sunday night at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. All were in satisfactory 
condition, hospital officials said. The others had apparently been released. 
</P>
<P>
Aida Ayala, 30, who had suffered head injuries, was one of those hospitalized 
Sunday. She said that she had paid someone $100 to be driven from the border 
town of San Ysidro to Los Angeles to find work. Three years ago, she said, her 
husband was blinded in a construction accident, leaving her the sole provider 
for a family of five. Now, she said, her 6-year-old son has a life-threatening 
throat illness. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, who said she worked in a dress factory in Mexico, estimated that she 
would need $600 to pay for treatment for her son, whose abilities to breathe 
and speak are impaired. That was why, she said, she decided to come to the 
United States long enough to make the money, then return home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very afraid because I had never left my home before," Ayala said. "I 
don't know what I can do now." 
</P>
<P>
Ayala had been riding in the back of the windowless van as it slowed 
approaching the Border Patrol checkpoint south of San Clemente in San Diego 
County about 8:30 p.m. INS agent Gregg said that as the van reached the front 
of the line and agents began asking the driver questions, the van sped off. Two 
Border Patrol squad cars gave chase, at speeds reaching 80 m.p.h., as the van 
wove in and out of freeway traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After about four miles, the van suddenly slowed as it neared the Avenida Pico 
off-ramp, Gregg said. Agents then saw passengers in the van jumping out, some 
getting to their feet and scrambling down a steep embankment overlooking San 
Clemente hospital; others, stunned by the fall, lay motionless along the 
freeway shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The van did not ever stop, authorities said. One Border Patrol unit pulled over 
to tend to the injured; the other followed the van as it angled across all four 
northbound lanes to a dirt shoulder next to the center divider. The driver 
jumped out, ran across the southbound lanes, dodging traffic as he did so, and 
disappeared into the darkness, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van Was Left Running 
</P>
<P>
The driver had left the van running and in neutral gear, Gregg said. It had 
begun to roll backward into the traffic lanes as the agents reached it, Gregg 
said, and because all the doors were locked, one agent smashed a window with 
his elbow to reach the brake. The agent was later treated for minor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen smugglers abandon their vehicles while moving, but this is the 
first time I can remember passengers jumping," Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente fire and paramedic units arriving at the scene found that most of 
the injured were too stunned to move. Paramedic Tom Harris said it was a 
strange sight, "a lot of victims and no cars. Usually with multiple victims you 
see a lot cars." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the injuries, Harris said, were head and leg scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala said she remembered nothing from the time of the chase until she regained 
consciousness in the hospital. She said she remembered passing "many bridges" 
as the van was being chased at high speeds, and that the pursuit seemed to last 
about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Total Confusion' 
</P>
<P>
Inside the van, she said, "there was total confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Chacon, 28, another passenger in the van, said Sunday from her hospital 
bed that she had traveled from her hometown in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost 
state, in search of a job. Chacon, a single parent of two boys, ages 8 and 1, 
said her job as a restaurant helper was not enough to make ends meet. She said 
she was headed for Los Angeles, where she had friends who had promised she 
could find higher-paying work. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wanted to work here for a few months and then return home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Chacon and Ayala said the addresses and telephone numbers of their Los 
Angeles friends were among the personal belongings they lost in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said she had been carrying a reddish suitcase that had, besides the 
address, her last $65 in cash, one pair of trousers, three blouses, a pair of 
shoes and a jacket. Ayala said she lost her purse, which she said contained 
about $100 in cash and photographs of her family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trauma Victims' 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials were not available for comment late Sunday about the 
whereabouts of the van passengers' belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Still hospitalized Sunday were Zheng Kang-Xin, 32, and an unidentified 
17-year-old Latino man, both of whom were reported in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
Those not still hospitalized Sunday had apparently been released and not taken 
into custody by the Border Patrol. Gregg said it is INS policy not to try to 
determine the citizenship status of an accident victim; those injured Saturday 
night, therefore, were never questioned about their nationality. 
</P>
<P>
"Apprehension was never an issue," Gregg said. "We treat them as trauma 
victims. We don't know if they were legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
If, he said, "the hospital or another agency calls about those people, we will 
pursue it. But for now, we consider them legal." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, San Clemente officials have been critical of the Border 
Patrol's policy of chasing people suspected of being illegal aliens, 
particularly when the pursuits cross city streets. Saturday's chase remained on 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Its outcome did not surprise some, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this happens quite often when the Border Patrol initiates such 
pursuits," said San Clemente Police Sgt. Neil Murray. "Those involved, 
especially those being transported, are scared and frightened about the 
unknown, and when a pursuit begins, they panic. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably happens more than we know."

<P>
VACCINES TO SHIELD PET BIRDS FROM 2 DEADLY AILMENTS HAILED BY VETS AS 
PREVENTIVE-MEDICINE BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The first vaccines designed to shield exotic pet birds from two fatal viruses 
went on the market last week, with county veterinarians hailing them as 
representing a breakthrough in avian medicine akin to the human polio 
inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there was no immunization for exotic birds, even though the viruses 
responsible for Pacheco's disease and Psittacine pox kill thousands of 
parakeets, parrots, macaws and related species each year, leaving thousands of 
pet owners heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
Avian veterinarian Larry Nemetz, a bird specialist whose Santa Ana clinic was 
among the first to use the vaccines this week, described them as "a medical 
breakthrough in the bird market." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first recipient at Nemetz's clinic was a scarlet macaw named 
Alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
The large bird sidled to the far edge of the examining table, but Nemetz was 
too quick. Deftly, he swaddled the bird in an orange towel, stroked its head 
and plunged first one hypodermic into a feathered breast, then another. 
</P>
<P>
Alfalfa screeched. But it was over quickly, as Nemetz released the immunized 
bird to owner Patti Brittain. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor baby," Brittain cooed. "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Alfalfa was lucky: It was one of the first pet birds in the country 
to be vaccinated against Pacheco's and pox. 
</P>
<P>
A New England firm, Maine Biologic Laboratories, has had Department of 
Agriculture approval since last winter to market the vaccines, but the company 
-- accustomed to developing drugs for chickens and turkeys but not exotic birds 
-- only recently asked a 
</P>
<P>
veterinary business to distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
That firm, California Avian Laboratory, made its initial shipments of vaccine 
last week. And Nemetz, who runs the Bird In-House Rehabilitation and Diagnostic 
Clinic in Santa Ana, was among the first to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Rosskopf, an avian veterinarian from Fountain Valley, also ordered 
the vaccines. "We've been waiting for his kind of thing for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There have long been immunizations for poultry as well as vaccines for dogs and 
cats -- but none for pet birds, noted Dr. Susan Wells, a zoo veterinarian in 
New Orleans who is president of the 2,000-member Assn. of Avian Veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, she said, manufacturers have not considered the bird market a 
lucrative one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2.5 Birds Per Home 
</P>
<P>
But recently that has changed. A 1987 survey by the American Veterinary Medical 
Assn. estimated that 5 million U.S. households have pet birds, with an average 
of 2.5 birds in those homes. 
</P>
<P>
Avian vets say those figures vastly understate the count. "A lot of us believe 
there are 50 million pet birds," many of them in Southern California, said Dr. 
Alan M. Fudge, president of California Avian Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Fudge and other doctors said the vaccines mark a new era in avian medicine. 
They could prevent outbreaks of pox and Pacheco's when imported birds are in 
quarantine or in pet stores, and the vaccines offer some assurance to bird 
owners that their pets will stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Maine Biologic worked on vaccines for poultry for 32 years but 
ventured into exotic birds just two years ago at the request of importers, said 
Dr. Kenneth Eslen, the company's president. In a normal shipment of 500 
blue-front Amazon parrots that might retail for $1,000 apiece, "it's not 
unusual to lose 30% to 50%" to pox in the quarantine pens, Eslen said. 
</P>
<P>
But the vaccines, made up of dead virus cells, finally offer protection, Eslen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco's, named after the Brazilian veterinarian who discovered it in the 
1930s, is a highly contagious disease caused by a herpes virus that destroys 
the liver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yellow Droppings 
</P>
<P>
It moves so rapidly that often there are few symptoms -- ruffled feathers or 
yellow droppings. But sometimes, Nemetz said, "The bird says 'Good morning,' 
falls off the perch and dies." 
</P>
<P>
The disease can sometimes be treated with the drug cyclovir, which is also used 
to treat human herpes, Rosskopf said, "but it's so devastating that by the time 
you figure out they have it, they're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he said, he diagnoses it after death. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Psittacine pox -- which affects birds in the parrot family -- is 
characterized by lesions around the eyes, but these can spread to the throat 
and internal organs, causing death. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets into an air pipe, the bird just suffocates," Nemetz said. "There 
is no cure. The vet just says, 'I'm sorry. This is the disease.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preventive Medicine at Last 
</P>
<P>
But now, Nemetz and other avian veterinarians said, they can practice 
preventive medicine. Nemetz has telephoned some bird owners, letting them know 
about the vaccines, which he offers at about $18 for both shots. Each vaccine 
also requires a follow-up shot within eight weeks and an annual booster. 
</P>
<P>
Nemetz has also told pet store owners that he will inoculate their birds and 
give them a certificate of vaccination that the birds' new owners can have. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the reaction has been positive. Shelly Pollin, owner of Bird and Board, 
a store in Orange, said she will be vaccinating all her birds and, starting 
early next year, will demand that owners of all boarded birds show proof of 
vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
The new vaccines "are a relief," she said: "I have no experience with Pacheco's 
or pox -- luckily. But I know of people who have. It can be very deadly. It can 
spread quickly," wiping out a dealer's entire stock. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Nemetz's clinic, he vaccinated Alfalfa's companions, a 
green-winged macaw named Buckwheat and a blue-and-gold macaw named Sparky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nibbled Her Ear 
</P>
<P>
After the injections, they ruffled their feathers, strutted a bit on the 
examining table, then hopped over to Brittain to perch on her shoulder and 
nibble her ear. 
</P>
<P>
Brittain said she doubts that she will get another bird, so her three macaws 
will probably not be exposed to disease that way. 
</P>
<P>
But, she noted, her family often takes the birds to the beach, and she would 
not want to risk their health. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are like her children, Brittain said. "And I'm an overanxious mother. 
I wouldn't want to take a chance. . . . Like with children, the minute there's 
something new, I want it. I want the best."

BUSINESSES EVACUATED AFTER AMMONIA LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
An ammonia leak at a La Habra grocery warehouse Sunday night sent a cloud of 
noxious fumes drifting about half a mile over the area, prompting the 
evacuation of a supermarket and some nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The leak was reported at 7:33 p.m. in an Alpha Beta warehouse at 1111 S. Harbor 
Blvd. A Lucky supermarket, two restaurants and a gas station, all situated 
across the street and downwind of the leak and all in Fullerton, were 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Imperial Highway was 
closed. Authorities for a time were considering further evacuations as easterly 
winds carried the ammonia cloud toward Brea. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ended when the cloud dissipated and the ammonia finally stopped 
leaking about 9:25 p.m., La Habra Police Capt. John Rees said. The leak was 
traced to a refrigeration unit in the warehouse, but its cause was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Although no injuries were reported, some of the estimated 100 shoppers 
evacuated from the Lucky supermarket reported suffering headaches and burning 
throats. The store, normally open 24 hours, was ordered evacuated about 8:20 
p.m. by Fullerton police. 
</P>
<P>
"You could smell it inside the store," Lucky stock clerk Pat Taylor said. "It 
was getting worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
Also evacuated were Black Angus and El Torito restaurants and a Chevron 
station. About 8:30 p.m., a frantic attendant at the station said: "I see an 
emergency. They said we have to close down." 
</P>
<P>
Even businesses not ordered evacuated were affected by the leak. "It was 
horrible," Alicia Campos, assistant manager of the El Pollo Loco restaurant at 
the south end of the Lucky shopping center, said of the odor. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, she said, told her the restaurant could remain open "as long as 
we stay indoors." But the point was moot, she said; firefighters had closed off 
the streets, and there were no customers in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st Reported as Smoke 
</P>
<P>
The leak, first reported as smoke, was reported coming from the Alpha Beta 
building. La Habra Patrolman Michael Mitchell, one of the first on the scene, 
said he knew right away that it was not smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"You could smell" the ammonia "as soon as you came around the corner," Mitchell 
said. "The longer you breathe it, the worse it is. Once you smell it, you 
remember it for life." 
</P>
<P>
Ammonia is a colorless, pungent gas that is toxic if inhaled and that, in small 
quantities, causes eye and respiratory irritation. It can be fatal in large 
concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra authorities quickly called for assistance from fire and police 
departments in Fullerton and Brea, since the wind was carrying the ammonia 
cloud toward those cities. They also summoned the Anaheim Fire Department, 
which dispatched its Hazardous Materials Unit to the scene, an action covered 
under a contract with the city of La Habra that was renegotiated just last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to La Habra firefighter Andrew Munoz, fire officials concentrated on 
dissipating the ammonia fumes with water while the hazardous materials 
investigators worked to stop the leak. To stop it, they first shut down all 
power to the building, then sent an Alpha Beta repairman inside to ascertain 
its source. 
</P>
<P>
The leak finally stopped of its own accord, however, when the source of ammonia 
simply ran out, Rees said. 
</P>
<P>
As the fire crews worked, police manned the roadblocks that had been set up 
about half a mile in each direction from the Harbor-Imperial intersection.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: COLLECTOR OF UNIFORMS GLEANS INSIGHT INTO TAPESTRY OF 
THE PAST

Jeffrey A. Sharp's monthly military uniform swap meet at the Sequoia Athletic 
Club in Buena Park is more of a history lesson to him than a moneymaking 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "The show consistently has lost money and each year I have to scale it 
down," said Sharp, 25, who said he owns about 450 uniforms, most of them 
hanging in rented storage bins. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have a lot of fun, and each time I hold a show, I learn something more 
about the uniforms and how they figured in history," said the self-employed 
Anaheim gardener, who specializes in maintaining athletic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these days I'm gonna meet one of the people who wore one of these 
uniforms and find out what his life was like in the war." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp is also learning that the youth of today are not all that interested in 
uniforms, even if they belonged to their fathers or grandfathers. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of ex-military guys at the swap meet who want to sell their old 
uniforms because they want to get it into the hands of someone who would 
appreciate them," said Sharp, who served six years in the Navy Reserve. "They 
tell me their sons (couldn't) care less about the uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
And Sharp feels that's tragic. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like the war and the holocaust which comes from the war should not be 
forgotten," he said. "The day you forget it is the day it will begin again." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp said an estimated 6 million World War II servicemen will soon be retiring 
from their civilian jobs. "And they want to make sure someone has a positive 
feeling for their uniforms because their own sons don't." 
</P>
<P>
He is often called by teachers to give talks to high school students about the 
history behind his collection of uniforms, medals, patches, campaign ribbons 
and military hats. He has a British military feather hat that is 125 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give talks to elementary school kids because I don't think they can 
understand the Holocaust and that's part of what I spell out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether the feeling about the Vietnam War had anything to do with 
the lack of interest in the uniforms by young people." 
</P>
<P>
But he knows about the uniforms and their history, including those from other 
countries such as his collection of British uniforms from the Victorian Era, 
but he said German uniforms provoke some concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever an article is written about uniforms that include those worn by the 
Germans in World War II, it seems to me the writers think of us as a bunch of 
Nazis," Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors favor German uniforms because they were made of good quality cloth 
and were the best looking, he explained. "We're collectors, not Nazis," he said 
of the estimated 1,800 uniform hobbyists in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
"We don't even allow guns to be sold at the swap meet." 
</P>
<P>
Besides uniforms, he has a passion for baseball. "I played baseball all my life 
and I just love the game," said Sharp, the current president of the Southern 
California Amateur Baseball League. 
</P>
<P>
However, collecting is first. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to collect things because I just like to collect," he said. "Everyone 
is a collector. When you turn 18, you start to collect and then spend the rest 
of your life obtaining things." 
</P>
<P>
And that includes bills, he added.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SHOOTING AND ACCIDENT 1 BLOCK APART INJURE 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was shot in the back in a drive-by shooting in Santa Ana late Sunday 
night, then minutes later four people were injured -- one critically -- in a 
traffic accident 300 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
The drive-by shooting was reported at 9:44 p.m. at the corner of West Edinger 
Avenue and Bristol Street. An unidentified man was shot by someone in a white 
car going south on Bristol, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Bob Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Police en route to that attack discovered the traffic accident at 9:59 p.m. at 
the corner of Bristol and St. Andrew Place, just one block south of the 
shooting scene. The crash, apparently unrelated to the shooting, involved at 
least one motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were sent to both scenes. A Lifeflight helicopter was dispatched to 
transport victims to area trauma centers. No other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, two people were killed in gang violence in Santa Ana: a 
4-year-old and a teen-ager. Six others were wounded.

ANAHEIM SIMPLIFIES RECYCLING IN PILOT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Ruth Wilcox heard earlier this year that Anaheim was starting a 
recycling program, she has been saving her cans and newspapers. Now, instead of 
having her recyclables gathering dust in the garage, the 77-year-old Wilcox 
will be able to dump them into a 110-gallon can and know the papers and cans 
won't be going to waste. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," Wilcox said. "I'm a saver, you know. I just hated to 
throw away all those newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wilcox joins about 11,000 other Anaheim households in the start of a 
pilot program designed to appeal to the frustrated recycler. People generally 
think recycling is a good idea, but they quickly tire of sorting trash into 
three or four containers for aluminum, glass, plastic and newspapers, said Ric 
Collett, director of recycling for Anaheim Disposal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
So in Anaheim, there will be just two cans to deal with: one for recyclables 
and one for the rest of the trash. The sorting will be done by workers of the 
disposal company. 
</P>
<P>
"Research does say the simpler you can make it, the more participation you 
get," Collett said. 
</P>
<P>
If the yearlong test program is successful, recycling will gradually spread to 
the rest of Anaheim's 234,000 residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Irvine has been the only Orange County city with a recycling system. 
Irvine's two-year-old program uses the multicontainer approach to serve 26,000 
households, and has a participation rate of about 71%, according to city 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
But due to a combination of environmental concerns and the increasing cost of 
landfill fees, recycling programs are on their way to a number of Orange County 
cities this fall. In November, the cities of Brea and Laguna Beach are 
scheduled to begin curb-side recycling programs, and Costa Mesa is starting a 
program in which residents don't have to do any sorting. The city Sanitation 
District is taking the unsorted trash of Costa Mesa's 91,900 residents to a 
processing center where the recyclables and nonrecyclables will be separated. 
</P>
<P>
State lawmakers also turned up the heat on the recycling issue recently by 
passing a bill requiring all California cities to reduce by half the amount of 
solid waste being taken to landfills before the year 2000. The measure now 
awaits the signature of Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for much of this concern occurred in 1987, Collett believes, when 
there was widespread media coverage of a Long Island garbage barge that roamed 
for more than five months -- traveling 5,000 miles -- in search of a dump. 
</P>
<P>
"It really woke a lot of people up," Collett said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, people such as Anaheim resident Mike Blackwell are familiar with 
the problems of solid waste disposal and receptive to idea of recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," Blackwell said, looking at his newly delivered trash cans for 
recycling. "We've been expecting it." 
</P>
<P>
To pay for the program, the city generated $2.7 million, in part through a 
citywide garbage rate increase. The monthly household garbage fee was raised in 
March to $7.03 from $6.11. 
</P>
<P>
But only 27 cents of the increase will go toward recycling. The balance will 
cover recent increases in landfill dumping fees, which are up 130% since the 
start of the year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure the recycling program touches a cross section of city residents, 
officials selected households along five different trash routes. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Anaheim Disposal began sending several letters to each 
household taking part in the program and conducting community meetings to 
explain how the procedure will work. 
</P>
<P>
The trash company has provided each participating household with two 110-gallon 
cans, one black and one green. Nonrecyclable trash, to be placed in the black 
can, will continue to be collected once a week on regular pickup days. 
</P>
<P>
The recyclables in the green can will be picked up every other week on garbage 
days by a truck trailing behind the regular garbage truck. Trash hauling under 
the recycling program will also take on a new look in Anaheim because newly 
purchased automated garbage trucks will reach out two robotic arms to lift the 
trash cans off the curb and empty them into the bins of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Collett said some residents were worried about the size of the new trash cans, 
which stand 41 inches tall and are 31 1/2 inches in diameter. But the cans, 
with built-in wheels, are designed to be tipped back and easily moved around, 
Collett said. For those residents still unable to manage, however, Anaheim 
Disposal will swap the b110-gallon size for a 60-gallon container, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After persuading people to begin sorting their trash, the next step is to teach 
them about the variety of materials than can be recycled, said Rita Tagge, 
recycling coordinator for Anaheim Disposal. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, glass recycling is not limited to beer bottles, she said. Any 
glass container, from peanut butter jars to vinegar bottles, can be recycled. 
And besides newspapers, other paper products such as magazines, notebook paper, 
telephone books, cereal boxes and even junk mail can go into the recyclable 
can. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to clean it, they don't have to take the labels off," Tagge 
said. "They can throw it all into one can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 11,000 Anaheim households begin a curbside recycling program that 
is unique because it doesn't require them to sort trash before tossing it. The 
city will provide residents with two 110-gallon cans: one for recyclables and 
one for other discards. 
</P>
<P>
Question -- So how much recyclable garbage does Anaheim generate each year? 
</P>
<P>
Answer -- If placed end to end, it would stretch the 24 miles from Anaheim to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cardboard: 841 tons 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper: 7,685 tons 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum cans: 492 tons 
</P>
<P>
Mixed paper waste: 8,035 tons 
</P>
<P>
Glass: 10,655 tons 
</P>
<P>
Question -- So what's in a typical American household's garbage can? 
</P>
<P>
Answer -- According to a federal report prepared by Franklin Associates, this: 
</P>
<P>
paper and paperboard: 42.1% 
</P>
<P>
food and yard waste: 23.4% 
</P>
<P>
glass: 9.4% 
</P>
<P>
metals: 9.2% 
</P>
<P>
plastics: 6.5% 
</P>
<P>
other: 9.4%.

<P>
Covering state government has more than its share of dull moments. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you find yourself in mind-numbing committee meetings, forced to 
perfect the fine art of cuticle analysis until the lawmakers get around to an 
important issue affecting Orange County. Then you scribble away furiously to 
get down all the nuances of the animated debate, only to slump despondently in 
your chair when they vote to put everything off. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the end of the legislative session in mid-September, when 
lawmakers must put up or shut up before they pack their bags and leave town for 
the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the deadline was midnight of Sept. 15 for a bill to be passed by 
both houses of the Legislature. All those (and there were a great many) not 
passed by that time would be considered dead or held in abeyance until next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of pressure -- combined with an overindulgence in caffeine, lack of 
sleep, the fear of failure and the exuberance of politics -- prompted 
legislators during the days leading up to their deadline to engage in the kind 
of antics that more than compensate for the boring times. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for instance, there was the momentous showdown on whether the 
Republicans or the Democrats would control the large shutters on the windows in 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, who sit on the side of the chamber with an inside wall, wanted 
to record the crucial closing minutes of the Legislature on videotape. The only 
problem was that the late-afternoon sunlight coming through the windows near 
the Republicans -- and, specifically, behind the press desk occupied by The 
Times -- was ruining the cinematographic effect. 
</P>
<P>
So one Democratic lawmaker came over into enemy territory to close up the 
shutters, shoving this reporter aside in his zeal to achieve an artistic 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had he left, however, than the Republicans launched a counterattack, 
sending Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) to fling open the shutters 
and let the sunshine back into state government. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want their pictures of us coming out," explained the politically 
astute Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
There were more theatrics later that evening as the Assembly, charging ahead in 
overdrive, took up a number of bills in quick succession. 
</P>
<P>
A legislator stood up to support a measure, beginning a sentence with, "I agree 
with (Assemblyman) Steve Peace. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Whereupon Peace (D-La Mesa), considered something of a maverick, threw up his 
hands in mock shock, fell backside first to the floor and played dead for two 
minutes -- with other legislators and reporters being careful to walk around 
his outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
That day in the more temperate Senate chamber -- often referred to as the 
"gentlemen's house" -- tempers were flaring during an unusually emotional 
display over Orange County's jail tax measure. Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) was trying her darndest to get the bill through. Slyly, she took 
advantage of a little-known parliamentary procedure to surprise her opponents 
and move the measure off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who opposed her bill, had put the measure "on 
call" -- essentially a parliamentary holding action used to buy time and maybe 
change a few votes. It is considered a common courtesy in the Senate that the 
legislator who places a bill "on call" also be the one to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not what the rules say. Any senator can "lift" a call, which is 
exactly what Bergeson did shortly after debate on the bill. Before a stunned 
Torres could react, the bill was officially approved and sent along to the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's ploy sparked shouting and foot-stomping by Torres and Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward), who also wanted the measure stalled. Lockyer began yelling 
across the ornate chamber at Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles) for not intervening to stop Bergeson's procedural move. 
</P>
<P>
"David Roberti, you should be ashamed of yourself!" Lockyer shouted. "What is 
happening here?" 
</P>
<P>
"Would you not do that in front of people?" Roberti asked, casting his eyes 
toward nearby staff members and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no stopping Lockyer, who was outraged over the parliamentary 
rulings Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), chair of Senate deliberations, was making 
on the last day of the session. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only way I can get you to respond!" Lockyer raged. "That madman 
(Dills) is going wacko!" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it's anything but dull.

'LA MODE CORNER' TAKES TOLL ON PLAYERS

As each group of golfers came to the 13th hole Sunday at Los Coyotes Country 
Club, they were confronted by a group protesting a labor disagreement with the 
makers of La Mode sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 protesters, members and supporters of the International Ladies' 
Garment Workers Union, yelled and chanted from a street behind the hole, not on 
the course, so they couldn't be removed. The union is asking the LPGA to 
boycott the sportswear company. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Blue, the LPGA commissioner, called it "a distraction to the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a contract with La Mode," he said. "We are a customer of theirs. . . . 
Under the circumstances, our players are doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the players held a different view of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Ritzman, who finished third, called the 13th hole "La Mode Corner," and 
was upset after she three-putted for a bogey on the hole. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if it was hard to concentrate at the hole, Pamela Wright said, "Oh 
sure. We had chances there and missed, and that had to have something to do 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Blue said the tour has had La Mode protesters at two other tournaments this 
season. The protesters also were chanting that they would be in San Jose, the 
tour's next stop. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a dark moment of her round Sunday, Myra Blackwelder still found time to 
brighten someone's day. 
</P>
<P>
After missing a short par putt, she walked off the 16th green only to be 
confronted by a crying toddler with his father. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwelder, a mother of two preschool children who travel with her on tour, 
took about three steps by the crying child, then stopped. 
</P>
<P>
She turned, walked back and gave the child the ball. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, the crying stopped and Blackwelder moved on. 
</P>
<P>
"Works every time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fog set in on Los Coyotes Sunday morning, delaying the start of play for almost 
three hours. 
</P>
<P>
The first twosome, scheduled to tee off at 8:15 a.m., were delayed until 11:12. 
</P>
<P>
The shot of the day came from Alice Ritzman on the par-five, 474-yard ninth 
hole. She was 103 yards from the pin, in the tree line on the right, just 
hoping to get the ball close. 
</P>
<P>
She hit a nine iron that landed about three feet short of the pin and rolled in 
for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"When it went in, I thought this might be my day because that's the kind of 
thing that happens when you win tournaments," Ritzman said. "But not this 
time."

WOODBRIDGE'S DOOLITTLE DISCOVERS INTENSITY SERVES HER WELL IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deanna Doolittle has always wanted to do a lot of things and do them well. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, it's because of her nature -- and not to offset the subliminal 
suggestion in her surname. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very intense," her mother, De Doolittle, said. "That's her personality 
and one of the key words to describe not just her (attitude toward) her 
athletics, but her life." 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle, 17, is captain and outside hitter of Woodbridge High School's girls' 
volleyball team. She leads the team in kills with an average of 19 per match. 
Doolittle is in her third year on the varsity, though she only began playing 
volleyball four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle's intensity was evident early. When she was 7, Doolittle decided to 
try out for a swim team. Her tryout was a 50-meter race, and the coach told 
Doolittle just to swim to the end of the pool and try to win. 
</P>
<P>
"He blew the whistle and well, Deanna had never seen a race before," De said. 
"These kids all did racing dives and she dived to the bottom of the pool. She 
came up, saw everybody was ahead of her and still came within an inch of 
winning. That's an example of how intense she is and how she goes for it." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-9, Doolittle is small for an outside hitter. Even though she is not a 
great leaper, her intensity and intelligence enable her not only to survive, 
but to flourish at her position, Woodbridge Coach Steve Stratos said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids don't have what she has," he said. "She has the killer instinct. 
Coaches call it a lot of different things. I call it the Division-I attitude -- 
if you have that in you, you have a chance of playing Division-I college 
volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
To distinguish her from her younger sister, Erika, who also plays on the 
varsity, teammates call the older Doolittle, "Big Doo," "Doo" or "Dooey." She 
also can be distinguished by her achievements in volleyball and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Doolittle was the only junior to make The Times' all-county 
volleyball team. She led Woodbridge in kills, averaging 5 1/2 a game, 16 per 
match, and most Woodbridge matches went only three games. She averaged seven 
digs, three stuff blocks and four service aces as Woodbridge won a share of the 
Pacific Coast League crown for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle also is a four-year varsity soccer player, an honor student and an 
active sixth-year member of the National Charity League, a volunteer group 
servicing the Irvine community. 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle has been known to volunteer a little more than her time. A 
perfectionist who gets down on herself for playing below her capabilities, she 
has not hesitated to chastise teammates for performing below theirs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she just does it to help the team," said Jill Ramirez, a senior back 
row player and Doolittle's best friend. "I wish everybody were like that, 
really I do. It just pumps everybody up because they are so mad at that person 
they want to do everything right. That's how I feel when she yells at me." 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle said: "I always feel bad if I yell at people. Sometimes it just 
explodes out of my mouth. But I think (my teammates) are getting used to me, so 
it is like in one ear and out the other." 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle says she realizes that high standards and a short temper don't mix, 
and she is working on turning down the intensity -- at least with her 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez has noticed the change. "She doesn't say negative stuff as much as she 
used to, but I think she keeps it all inside," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle diffuses some of her intensity through humor and water skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a house in Lake Havasu, Arizona. . . . whenever I can, I go water 
skiing there," she said. "That totally relaxes me." Stratos also has noticed a 
change in Doolittle. "She has become a lot more mature about the imperfections 
of humanity," he said. "She can accept a lot more easily that she is capable of 
making mistakes, but she is still a perfectionist. That's what makes her so 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Doolittle has been hitting well this season, helping to compensate for the 
graduation of two-time all-league hitter Sharisse Kiino (Princeton) and 
three-time all-league setter Hiromi Murakami, who returned to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But Woodbridge (3-2) wasn't hitting on all cylinders in the Tournament of 
Champions at Edison last weekend. The Warriors, ranked fifth in the Southern 
Section 5-A, lost to Newport Harbor in the opening round and struggled to 
defeat unranked Edison in five games before losing to Capistrano Valley in the 
fifth-place match. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good players and everything and everybody is tall, but I think our 
main problem is desire," Doolittle said. "The last game (against Edison) 
everybody wanted to win and we killed them, 15-5. As soon as we get everyone 
intense, everything will start falling into place." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a job for Doolittle.

SOME COACHES LOOK AT BIG PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It happens every fall Sunday: High school football coaches apologize to their 
wives, their kids and their pets as they hurry off to school for another long, 
rigorous afternoon of . . . 
</P>
<P>
Game films! 
</P>
<P>
Analyzing films or videos of upcoming opponents is a coaching tradition, one 
most often conducted on Sunday afternoons. Coaches and their assistants spend 
hours breaking down game films to better analyze an upcoming opponent's 
strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
An extra edge might be gained this way. But for coaches' wives and families, 
it's another day without dad. 
</P>
<P>
Things are different, however, in the Olympic League, which is made up of 
private, Christian schools. When the Southern Section lifted a ban on filming 
opponents' games two years ago, coaches in the Olympic League voted not to film 
each other's games. Nor do they exchange films for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"As coaches, we want to be involved as much in our programs and be the best we 
can be like anyone else," Orange Lutheran Coach Bob Dowding said. "But because 
Christianity is also one of our beliefs, we feel Sunday is time to spend at 
home. Doing that (analyzing game films) takes away most of your Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whittier Christian Coach Phil Bravo: "We pencil-chalk, go to games and 
scout, but on Sundays, no one works. We stay home with our families. My 
defensive coordinator teaches Sunday school. All my coaches are involved with 
their churches." 
</P>
<P>
So Olympic League coaches never even think about their upcoming opponents on 
Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the temptation's there," Bravo said. "I'm sure the thought crosses 
your mind, but at same time I think the league has great integrity. I respect 
all the coaches, and I'm not even threatened by the thought." 
</P>
<P>
Upset dept.: Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes reflected on his team's 24-21 loss 
to Villa Park Thursday. Los Alamitos had been ranked No. 1 in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"They played harder and they wanted to win more then we did," Barnes said. 
"They deserved to win and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Said Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney: "The kids were real excited, real excited 
(after the victory), but we have a smart, intelligent group here. What we try 
to stress now is the peaks and valleys, so they understand this game doesn't 
mean a whole hell of a lot if we go out and play poor football for the weeks to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
And, for Villa Park (3-0), the weeks to come will feature the return of Ryan 
Smith, a 5-foot-10, 185-pound fullback who has been out since August with a 
broken clavicle. Smith is expected to be back at full strength in about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of upsets: Here's Trabuco Hills Coach Tim Manning on his team's 14-7 
loss to Dana Hills a week ago Saturday, one that ended the Mustangs' seven-game 
winning streak: "I think we got our annual screw-up over with last week. Last 
year, it was Laguna Beach; this year it was Dana Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Dana Hills loss, Trabuco Hills hadn't been beaten since its 9-7 loss 
to Laguna Beach last season. Trabuco Hills went on to win the Division VIII 
title. 
</P>
<P>
On course: Dan Niednagel of Dana Hills and Shelley Taylor of Edison had the 
best times of the day at the Laguna Hills Invitational Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Niednagel, a junior, ran the three-mile course in 15 minutes 19 seconds, and 
Taylor, a sophomore, ran 17:16. 
</P>
<P>
In the team showdown, the Laguna Beach boys, one of the county's upstarts this 
season, won the small-schools race with 78 points. Calvin Christian was second 
with 92 and Woodbridge was third with 97. For the girls, Woodbridge (62 points) 
held off two-time defending state champion Newport Harbor (69) for the small 
schools victory. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sonora Invitational, Richie Lockwood won the 5,000 meter race in the 
day's best time, 15:48, to lead Fountain Valley to the team title. Katella's 
Martha Pinto ran the fastest time for girls in 18:44. 
</P>
<P>
To the victor . . . goes the termites: Orange County has many cross-town 
rivalries, and many feature distinctive trophies going to the winner of the 
annual contests. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor, for example, have the "Harbor Bell." 
Foothill and Tustin have the "Golden Gauntlet." 
</P>
<P>
And Woodbridge, Irvine and University have the Fence Post. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Fence Post Trophy, presented each year by the Irvine Sports Club, goes 
to one of the three Irvine high schools that comes out on top in head-to-head 
football competition. 
</P>
<P>
According to Irvine Sports Club president Bill Ackman, the trophy originated in 
1978 when the club decided to honor the city's best team with something 
reflecting Irvine's ranching heritage. Thus, the Fence Post, which actually 
came from Irvine Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge opened in 1981, so the contest originally was between University and 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The trophy's most distinctive feature? 
</P>
<P>
Termites. Hungry termites -- which have slowly eaten away some of the Fence 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," Ackman said, laughing. "It's complete with termites. It's the 
ugliest trophy. Really! Oh yeah, we're talking very ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that hasn't deterred the teams from fighting for it. 
</P>
<P>
This year's battle for the Fence Post will be decided Friday night, when Irvine 
meets Woodbridge, which has owned the Fence Post for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
If Irvine wins, it will receive the trophy because it beat University last 
Friday. But if Woodbridge, which lost to University Friday, wins, a three-way 
tie will result, the first since 1983. And the trophy will remain on display at 
a local theater. 
</P>
<P>
Pool boys: What does the Edison football team do to get that extra edge? 
</P>
<P>
Three or four times a year, the whole team dives into the Edison swimming pool 
for a workout. For individual players who are injured or sore, pool workouts 
have become a common alternative to on-field conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
According to Charger Coach Dave White, these workouts are no splash in the tub. 
</P>
<P>
"They like (the idea) until they're finished," White said. "Then they realize 
it really wasn't that much fun."

Pablo Yrizar scored three goals in the second quarter as the UC Irvine water 
polo team defeated UC Santa Barbara, 11-6, to win the Air Force tournament 
Sunday in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (9-1), ranked second in the nation, finished the round-robin tournament 
undefeated. Santa Barbara (7-2) led, 3-1, after one quarter but the Anteaters 
outscored the Gauchos, 8-0, during the next two periods. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Skylar Putman led all scorers with four goals. Santa Barbara's Ed 
Weldon had three. 
</P>
<P>
In men's nonleague soccer: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton 2, U.S. International 1 -- Thomas Valentine scored with 
three minutes remaining for the Titans at home. It was Valentine's third goal 
of the season for the Titans (6-1). USIU's James Santini had tied the score on 
a penalty shot two minutes earlier. Travis England scored first for the Titans 
with 15 minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 1, UC San Diego 1 -- San Diego's Wallace Whittier scored with about

PLAZA PROJECT'S SCULPTED TOWER WOULD GIVE L.A. SKYLINE FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN, Times Design Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed design of the Grand Avenue Plaza development downtown by Pacific 
Atlas Development is as distinctive as it is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Encompassing a city block bounded by Seventh, Eighth and Olive streets, and 
Grand Avenue, the design attempts to meld a variety of uses in a variety of 
styles in three stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
One of the uses involves the demolition of two buildings of historic interest 
on Seventh Street, a proposal that is opposed by preservationists and has 
delayed the necessary approvals by the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The most clearly defined elements in the design at present are the proposed 
office tower, at the northeast corner of Grand and Eighth, and a mid-block 
landscaped plaza, which together compose the development's first stage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mid-Block Garden Planned 
</P>
<P>
The tower, as revealed in plans and renderings, is to be a 34-story structure 
clad in a blue-green reflective glass curtain wall that wraps around the 
building. This illusion of enfolded walls is accented on the south facade by a 
four-story setback cut into the upper stories. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Richard Keating of the local office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; 
Merrill, the tower is very much a signature structure in a slick, sculpted late 
Modernist style. In this respect it is similar in spirit to some of the office 
buildings that the architect designed when practicing in Dallas and Houston, 
and that mark the skylines there. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the Grand Avenue Plaza tower promises to attract attention and lend an 
architectural flair to the changing downtown Los Angeles skyline. Another boxy, 
boring building in the severe International style it is not. 
</P>
<P>
Promising to be equally distinctive is the proposed mid-block garden plaza, 
designed by the landscape architectural firms of Michael Van Valkenburgh &amp; 
Assoc. and Emmet Wemple &amp; Assoc. The plan generally is what is called a 
soft design, emphasizing a diversity of plantings and a minimum of furnishings. 
A free-standing restaurant edges Grand Avenue. Particularly engaging is a 
suggested thick bamboo grove, on the site where another office tower is 
proposed in a distant third stage of the development. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy concerning the project centers on the Seventh Street frontage, 
and the existing Brockman and Coulter building shells, built in 1912 and 1917, 
respectively. The second stage of the Pacific Atlas proposal calls for a 
500-room luxury hotel on the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Strip 
</P>
<P>
The 13-story Renaissance Revival styled Brockman building, with its ornate 
terra cotta cornice and detailing, and the more modest four story Coulter 
Building, distinguished by a curved corner bay, together hint of a time when 
Seventh Street was a prime retail district. Though neither of the structures 
individually is of landmark quality, their massing, scale and detailing do work 
in concert with other dated buildings along the street, forming a unique 
historic strip. A walk there is a featured tour titled "Seventh Street: Mecca 
for Merchants," conducted by the Los Angeles Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have indicated that despite their ages and structural problems it is 
possible to recycle the Brockman and Coulter buildings as a hotel, a position 
being urged by the Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
However, the effort would entail costly construction problems Pacific Atlas 
clearly prefers to avoid. As an alternative, it has proposed a new hotel be 
designed in the spirit of the old buildings, respecting the street's 150-foot 
cornice height limit and reflecting the massing, texture and tone of the 
neighboring historic structures. In addition, the ground floor would be lined 
with retail shops to help animate the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Atlas said the new hotel has not yet been designed, but it did show a 
rendering of what the Seventh Street facade might look like. The rendering, 
though somewhat out of scale and sketchily detailed, hinted at a 
sympathetically massed and warmly faced and detailed structure. Renderings do 
tend to present idealized scenes.

Bank Suspends Executives in U.S.: Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, at the 
center of a storm over $3 billion in unauthorized loans to Iraq, has suspended 
nine U.S.-based executives and obtained emergency funding, bank officials said. 
State-owned BNL, Italy's largest bank, has said responsibility for the Iraqi 
loans, which were not sanctioned by BNL senior management, rested entirely with 
its Atlanta branch, which arranged them. On Friday it announced that nine of 
the 20 executives at the branch had been suspended until inquiries were 
completed.

Fixed-Rate Mortgages Dip: Fixed-rate home mortgages are averaging 10.03%, 
according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That 
rate was down from 10.05% the previous week. On one-year adjustable rate 
mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 8.70%, up from 8.68% 
the previous week, Freddie Mac said.

U.S. SAYS IT CAN'T BALANCE WORLD TRADE ALONE

The United States warned Sunday that it cannot reduce its outsized trade 
imbalances on its own, and called on West Germany and Japan to step up their 
efforts to trim their trade surpluses, which are the mirror image of America's 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the policy-setting Interim Committee of the International 
Monetary Fund, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady reiterated American 
calls for the two trading partners to spur more demand at home and open up 
their economies to more U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States cannot solve the world's problems alone," Brady told the 
closed meeting, according to a portion of his remarks that was made public by 
the Treasury. "We cannot reduce our external deficit unless surpluses elsewhere 
decline." 
</P>
<P>
He also repeated warnings by finance ministers of the United States and its 
major economic allies that the dollar's value has risen too far. And he vowed 
new joint action by the allies in the foreign exchange markets to help keep the 
dollar in check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Intervention 
</P>
<P>
Brady's remarks came as the Group of Seven, as the finance ministers' group is 
known, made preparations for what is expected to be massive intervention in the 
markets today as currency traders try to test the resolve of the industrial 
countries' central banks. In addition to the United States, the group includes 
Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The seven warned in a communique on Saturday that any further increase in the 
value of the greenback could hurt the world economy. The ministers are worried 
that if the dollar rises any more it could reverse recent progress in reducing 
the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brady and the finance ministers of West Germany and Japan joined in 
rejecting a plea by developing countries to approve a new issue of "special 
drawing rights" -- artificial reserve assets that developing countries want 
used to provide added aid. 
</P>
<P>
Brady and finance ministers Theo Waigel of West Germany and Ryuarto Hashimoto 
of Japan all argued that Third World countries had not made a convincing case 
that more SDRs were needed. They also declined to increase the maximum limits 
for IMF borrowing by poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF and its sister organization, the 152-country World Bank, are scheduled 
to begin four-day-long annual meetings here today, with the major debate over 
whether to grant an IMF request for a doubling of its lending resources. 
</P>
<P>
The United States still opposes any such move, contending that the IMF still 
must define more fully what its role will be in the next decade. Most other 
industrial countries have said they will back a small increase in IMF 
resources, but not the doubling that the IMF would like. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development Sunday, the Group of 10, which comprises finance 
ministers of 11 large industrial countries, pledged to try to resolve the 
conflict in lending resources and bring the issue to a vote by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The group also underscored Brady's assertion that the industrialized countries 
need to do more to help trim back huge global trade imbalances. But the 
ministers stopped short of admonishing West Germany and Japan on what to do.

ELDERS POSTS 5% DECLINE IN ANNUAL PROFIT

<P>
The giant Australian conglomerate Elders IXL reported a 5% fall in annual 
profit despite an increased thirst for its Foster's Lager. 
</P>
<P>
Grain trading mistakes and bad debts in its finance division eroded profits. 
"We made a series of wrong judgments, but we're not likely to do that again," 
Elders Agribusiness managing director Michael Nugent said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a satisfactory result from a very frustrating year," Chairman John 
Elliott said after the company announced a $503-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the British government's decision to block his takeover of Scottish 
and Newcastle Breweries for Elders not beating last year's bumper 
$527.35-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
Elders' sales of $13.6 billion were 15% higher than the previous year and made 
the company Australia's largest in revenue terms. 
</P>
<P>
British anti-monopolies agencies in March stopped Elders' $2.5-billion bid for 
the Edinburgh brewer, trapping Elliott with a 23.6% stake. The interest bill on 
that holding cut $41.7 million from Elders' profit and Elliott said it had also 
frustrated his plans to use Scottish and Newcastle as a springboard to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very clear European strategy of centering the brewing business in 
Britain, but we have been prevented from doing that," Elliott said, adding that 
Elders was looking elsewhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the frustrations in Europe, Elders' key label Foster's increased 
worldwide sales by 17%, Elliott said. Profit from beer rose 23% to $408 
million.

</P>
<P>
ASIA'S AIRLINES WILL NEED TO DOUBLE THEIR FLEETS TO MEET PASSENGER DEMAND BY 
2000. BUT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN UNLESS AIRSPACE AND AIRPORT CONGESTION IS 
ALLEVIATED.

<P>
Airport congestion in Asia has been greatly underestimated in many forecasts of 
air traffic to the year 2000 and is likely to be the biggest obstacle to 
airline growth, according to a study of regional air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
While worldwide supply of wide-bodied aircraft must grow 45% during the period 
to meet demand, Asia's airlines will need to double their fleets if they are to 
accommodate the region's growth and the recently acquired passion in Japan for 
foreign travel. But such growth will not be possible unless the problems of 
airspace and airport congestion are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The study was compiled by the Manila-based Orient Airline Assn., which 
represents 14 regional airlines, including Japan Air Lines, Qantas, All Nippon, 
Cathay Pacific, Thai, Korean Air and Philippine Airlines, which together 
accounted for 40% of the world airline operating profits in 1988. It draws on 
studies from member airlines, the regional airports and projections from 
Boeing, Airbus Industries and McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
It confirms that the biggest bottlenecks are likely to remain Tokyo's Narita, 
Hong Kong's Kaitak and Sydney's Kingsford Smith airports and the airspace in 
general around Japan. These airport authorities respectively forecast 7%, 5.7% 
and 8% annual growth in passenger departures by 2000. Actual growth rates in 
1988, however, were 27.1% for Narita, 20.4% for Kaitak and 15.7% for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
Even given what the Orient Airline Assn. calls these "low to medium scenario" 
growth patterns, Osaka and Narita airports will handle more than 24 million 
departures by the year 2000, compared to 9.5 million in 1988; Kaitak 16 
million, compared to 7.7 million, and Sydney 37 million domestic and 
international departures, compared to 13.3 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much More Cargo 
</P>
<P>
A more realistic scenario, according to the Orient Airline Assn. study, is a 9% 
to 9.5% annual growth in passenger traffic for the region as a whole -- even 
after taking into account some loss of momentum as a result of the economic and 
political turmoil in China. This translates into about 185 million departures a 
year at the turn of the new century, compared to 66.5 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cargo freight, handling of which is not considered such a problem by most 
airport authorities, will grow at most to 14 million tons from 3.3 million tons 
a year by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Current airline expansion plans will not, according to the Orient Airline 
Assn., meet these demand projections. Michael Hewitt, the OAA 
secretary-general, believes that new orders will increase until 1992 and that 
as many as 100 more wide-bodied aircraft will be ordered regionally in addition 
to orders already placed. The OAA members have 583 aircraft, two-thirds of 
which are already wide-bodied designs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the current airport congestion problems are being addressed. The 
Australian government has decided, subject to an environmental impact study, to 
build an extra runway at Kingsford Smith. The downside of this hard-won victory 
for planners is that a decision to build what is the long-term solution, a new 
airport, may now be further off. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the governor will announce in October the location of a new 
airport -- probably at Chek Lap Kok -- which will be completed by 1997. Extra 
aprons are planned at Kaitak, but estimates suggest that the recently expanded 
airport will still reach capacity by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, what should have been the second half of the Narita airport complex 
remains unbuilt amid continued resistance from a handful of Japanese farmers 
and persistent harassment of officials by environmental pressure groups. 
Pushing Honeida into Tokyo Bay mainly for domestic traffic will help only 
partly. Development of Kansei, a new airport in Osaka Bay, may be more 
beneficial when it comes into operation in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restrictions Hurt 
</P>
<P>
Some hope is also offered by more advanced aircraft technology as more longer 
haul jets from the United States are able to fly past Tokyo to other Asian 
capitals. This will allow U.S. airlines such as American, Continental and Delta 
to develop the kind of "hub and spoke" operations from Kimpo airport in Seoul, 
South Korea, for example, that Northwest and United have successfully built out 
of Narita. 
</P>
<P>
This could ease pressure on one of the most serious congestion points in the 
air corridor east of Narita through which many westbound transpacific flights 
must pass. But the real bottleneck around Japan is unlikely to be removed until 
Japan's military lifts restrictions on civilian flights over the Sea of Japan, 
to the west of the archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt believes that less tangible pressures are developing on Asia's airports. 
Deregulation and liberalization in the United States, developing in Europe and 
coming in some form next year to Australia, will not pass Asia by. In the wake 
of additional flexibility and perhaps less reliance on bilateral carrier 
arrangements will be cheaper fares and increased demand to travel. 
</P>
<P>
The Orient Airline Assn. report offers no solutions other than that more 
hotels, airports and larger fleets need to be built to accommodate the region's 
changing travel tastes. It implies, however, that if governments are to meet 
the challenge, they will have to debate historically prickly issues. They will 
have to raise the question again -- in Sydney and Hong Kong, for example -- of 
lifting night flying curfews, and they will have to combat the altogether 
tougher 15-year opposition to new facilities at Narita in Tokyo.

MARKETING COLLEGE SOUVENIRS HAS BECOME A BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS.

<P>
University of Southern California fans can buy a Trojan mailbox to display 
outside their homes. On the golf course, they can drive Titleist balls in 
cardinal and gold. 
</P>
<P>
Across town at the University of California, Los Angeles, there are 85 styles 
of UCLA sweat shirts and 100 different T-shirts on sale at the student store 
alone. Another 100 to 200 different shirts and sweat shirts are on sale at 
stores off campus. Someone even sought permission once to sell an official 
Bruin dog food but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the thousands of products and would-be products pitched and 
marketed each year in the billion-dollar business of selling official college 
souvenirs, clothing and accessories. Buoyed by the explosion in televised 
sports in the 1970s and 1980s, colleges have found that their names and mascots 
are known from Champaign, Ill., to Tokyo and worth millions in sales of shirts, 
sweat shirts, baby bottles, toothbrush holders, key chains and fishing tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"We take people from the cradle to the grave," said Anne H. Chasser, licensing 
program director at Ohio State University and president of the Assn. of 
Collegiate Licensing Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges nearly do. They license baby bottles and baby shoes. And at the 
University of Iowa, someone recently pitched the idea of selling an official 
Hawkeye tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
More unusual was the official Nittany Lion plunger turned down by Penn State 
University. It would have featured the college's name written on a wooden 
handle and the name of its archrival, the University of Pittsburgh, on the 
rubber suction cup. 
</P>
<P>
But those are the quirky products. Most of the sales are in clothing, and the 
market is huge. Licensing professionals estimate that nearly $3 billion a year 
in professional and college licensed products are sold. Of that, university 
officials who license products believe that about $1 billion of it is spent on 
college-related merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Fall is to the sellers of the college merchandise what Christmas is to 
department stores. Football season, combined with the return of students to 
campus from summer vacation, accounts for as much as 60% to 70% of the sales 
for some schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's football that drives this whole thing," said Dickie Van Meter, 
administrator at the University of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
For colleges, money from licensed products has been an unexpected windfall that 
experts estimate could total $50 million to $75 million in royalties this year 
for schools. Manufacturers typically pay schools 6.5% to 8% of the wholesale 
price of the goods sold, with most universities getting 7.5%. Licensing 
revenues, virtually nil 10 years ago, are growing at double-digit rates for 
most schools. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, one of the nation's early leaders in licensing products, royalties 
bring about $750,000, including money from some $6 million in products sold 
wholesale each year to retailers in Japan. USC takes in about $300,000 a year 
in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders in royalty income are believed to be national football champion 
Notre Dame and National Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball champion Michigan. 
Both receive about $1 million a year in royalties. Michigan, which won both the 
Rose Bowl and basketball championship this year, may bring in as much as $1.5 
million in royalties this year, said Michigan Assistant Athletic Director Will 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign markets are proving lucrative as well. Canada is becoming a major 
market for U.S. collegiate products, because Canadians are avid watchers of 
American televised sports. 
</P>
<P>
This month, UCLA's international licensing administrator, Jack Revoyr, was in 
Tokyo and Osaka working on marketing programs in Japan, where UCLA-related 
materials are popular. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the appeal and charm of Los Angeles," Revoyr said. 
</P>
<P>
The licensing money goes to scholarships, building programs, athletic 
department budgets or general funds, which administrators say has helped 
diffuse early criticism that licensing programs might exploit the names of 
schools. The money is much needed, schools say, in the wake of budget 
tightening and such factors as the federal Title IX act, which requires that 
women athletes be offered the same athletic opportunities that historically are 
afforded men. 
</P>
<P>
At many of the largest schools, more than 500 separate companies have 
permission to make and sell products using school names and mascots. In 
addition, the NCAA has its own program for such events as the Final Four 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The largest schools have full-time licensing administrators with staffs that 
seek new markets, police the use of their symbols and names and retain lawyers 
to litigate when they detect pirating by unauthorized sellers. More than 100 
schools use two related licensing services, Inter Collegiate Enterprises in 
Atlanta and its sister company, Collegiate Concepts Inc. in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NCAA has an active licensing program that sells thousands of 
dollars during such events as the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, most colleges stumbled into the business. 
</P>
<P>
Souvenirs have been sold for years, and schools received nothing. Most did not 
even apply for trademarks for their names, mascots and insignia until as the 
late 1970s or early 1980. When they did, it was usually for protection and 
prompted by the sale of cheap or tasteless products. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, for example, discovered the potential of university-related products 
in the 1970s when it used to offer coffee mugs to fans in mass mailings to sell 
tickets to athletic events. But the university, Perry said, first began taking 
a major interest in licensing and enforcing its rights to its name when it 
discovered a man selling posters with portraits of past coaches that had been 
printed in Michigan football programs. 
</P>
<P>
Court decisions have since upheld the right of schools to control the use of 
their names, insignias and mascots, although they still often must actively 
enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA went to court in Columbus, Ohio, two years ago to stop a chain of clothing 
stores from infringing on its trademarks by selling unauthorized UCLA 
materials. Elizabeth Kennedy, trademark licensing manager at USC, said the 
university frequently has problems with unauthorized merchandise sold at flea 
markets or by people who set up stands near the Coliseum on the days of 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
Getting authorization to sell a product is not difficult, licensing 
administrators say, as long as it is well made and in good taste. Unlike 
professional sports programs, which carefully limit the number of licenses 
products, universities often feel a public relations obligation to people in 
nearby communities and to alumni who want to sell products. 
</P>
<P>
Revoyr, UCLA's licensing chief, said the school has a four-person committee 
that reviews products submitted to the school. He said four out of 10 products 
are turned down, usually because they are of inferior quality. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges also are wary of food, beverages or personal-care products both for 
image reasons and because they might face liability problems if someone were 
hurt using a product. As a result, nearly all have turned down beer named after 
their schools. Colleges also require vendors to take out insurance coverage 
protecting the university and to sign contracts that relieve schools of 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing executives contend that, despite the number of products available, 
they do not fear saturation. Retailers, they argue, like college merchandise in 
part because they have been stuck with unsuccessful licensed products from fads 
or from movies that bombed. With college products, they note, demand is steady 
each year as students graduate and new ones enter schools.

MEMO: RAH RAH ROYALTIES

How much is a national championship worth? 
</P>
<P>
Licensing administrators at colleges estimate that a national football or 
basketball championship can be worth as much as $200,000 to $400,000 in 
additional royalties from product sales. 
</P>
<P>
That probably explains why the two sales leaders are believed to be Notre Dame, 
the reigning national champion in football, and Michigan, the Rose Bowl and 
NCAA basketball winner. Both schools take in about $1 million a year in 
licensing revenue, although Michigan officials believe that they may reap as 
much as $1.5 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Schools that are among the revenue leaders are often in states such as Iowa, 
Nebraska or Oklahoma, which don't have professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
Markets for schools vary considerably. At the University of Iowa, which 
receives about $500,000 in royalties a year, officials say sales of 
university-related products are spread throughout the state and that the 
largest market is probably Iowans who are simply fans, not alumni or students. 
</P>
<P>
At Michigan, by contrast, officials say 80% of university-related products are 
sold to alumni. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, schools have seen growth in sales to "subway alumni," slang 
for people who never attended their school but who became fans watching teams 
play on television. The number of subway alumni has grown considerably with the 
growth of cable television stations such as sports channel ESPN and satellite 
super stations. 
</P>
<P>
USC officials believe that the school's royalties suffer from competition from 
so many local professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
Piracy is a constant problem for licensing administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA doubles its enforcement efforts during the week of its "Final Four" 
championship basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, officials found someone was selling T-shirts featuring the profile of a 
Trojan warrior that appears on the side of the football team's helmets. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't the official Trojan symbol used for T-shirts. The licensed 
Trojan symbol for shirts shows a warrior with tapered plume on his helmet that 
hangs down the back of his neck, somewhat resembling the tail of a Davy 
Crockett-style coonskin cap. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the warrior gracing the football team's helmet has plume that 
stops at his neck. USC trademark licensing manager Elizabeth Kennedy said some 
believe that warrior is actually wearing a Spartan helmet. Experts in ancient 
armor could not be reached for a definitive answer. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges undoubtedly regret taking so long to get into the licensing business. 
For years, they received no money from sales of products. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about it, administrators are at a loss to explain, except that no 
one really thought about it years ago or saw the potential. Now schools even 
have a trade association, the 3-year-old Assn. of College Licensing 
Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is credited with being the first to start a licensing program in 1973, 
followed by such schools as Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State. Ivy League 
schools, with the exception of Princeton, have been the slowest at developing 
programs, licensing officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Stuffed mascots have proved lucrative at some schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State sells "Brutus Buckeye" dolls. The biggest seller is said to be the 
University of Florida's "Albert," a cartoon-like alligator. JAMES BATES

NETHERLANDS PLANS ELABORATE TRIBUTE FOR VAN GOGH ANNIVERSARY

<P>
Arranging the biggest-ever exhibition of Vincent van Gogh's paintings is taking 
on the complexity of a military operation. The plans include special 
precautions for transporting paintings from abroad, new security systems and 
huge sums of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition next year to mark the 100th anniversary of the death of the 
tormented Dutch genius who committed suicide in France in 1890 will fill two 
museums and bring together, perhaps for the last time, some of Van Gogh's most 
famous paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the exhibition, operas, films and theater productions will be staged 
to celebrate the painter, who blossomed from youthful artistic somberness into 
an unrivaled master of color and light. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch are budgeting $12.5 million for the anniversary celebrations and plan 
to bring in some 40 oil paintings and 120 sketches from abroad to supplement 
their own vast collections. 
</P>
<P>
Each painting from abroad will be wrapped in temperature-controlled packaging 
and each will be accompanied by an expert who must give written reports on the 
condition of the work before and after it travels. 
</P>
<P>
New electronic security systems have been put into the museums and more guards 
hired. Three Van Gogh's were stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the 
Netherlands in December of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The works from abroad, coming from as far afield as Moscow's Pushkin Museum and 
New York's Museum of Modern Art, have been insured for a total of $3 billion -- 
believed to be the highest ever coverage to be taken out for an art exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sold only one painting in his lifetime, Van Gogh's works today are 
among the most valuable in the world, fetching many millions of dollars at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands already houses the world's two largest collection of his works 
-- at Amsterdam's Vincent Van Gogh Museum and at the smaller Kroeller-Mueller 
Museum in the eastern Hoge Veluwe National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the exhibit is to show works Van Gogh himself considered his 
best," said Frits Becht, managing director of the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation, 
which has been busy for two years organizing events. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh Museum will be filled with some 120 oil paintings while the 
Kroeller-Mueller Museum will house 250 drawings in a joint exhibition from 
March 30 -- Van Gogh's birthday -- to July 29, the anniversary of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not only the largest exhibit ever of his work, but it is probably the 
last time these works will be brought together, because it is complicated to 
bring them together and traveling is not good for paintings," said Becht. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will include such famous works as "The Weaver," "The Potato 
Eaters," "The Sower," "Sunflowers," "The Night Cafe" and "The Yellow House." 
</P>
<P>
No more than 1,000 people will be allowed into each museum at a time to prevent 
too much humidity -- from humans and their clothing -- from harming the 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Becht expects some 1.4 million people, many of them from abroad, will 
see the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The high insurance is because Van Gogh's works have sold for record prices in 
recent years. His "Irises" fetched $53.9 million in November 1987, the highest 
price ever paid for a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The centenary will also offer a chance to explore the artist through dramatic 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Two operas -- one by Finnish composer Einojuhani Routavaara and another by 
Dutchman Jan van Vlijmen -- will focus on the painter, whose private life seems 
to have captured unparalleled public interest.

'LANDSCAPE AS THOUGHT' IS A NON-TRADITIONAL VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gorgeous landscape photographs sell glossy calendars and whet the appetites of 
armchair travelers. Beautiful vistas have motivated generations of landscape 
painters. But many contemporary artists no longer want to treat landscape as 
just another pretty face. 
</P>
<P>
These artists find their inspiration in a specific environmental, metaphysical 
or psychological approach to landscape. Their work is not necessarily "pretty" 
-- although it can be -- and, like most significant contemporary art, it 
requires the viewer to do more than passively stare and admire. 
</P>
<P>
"Landscape as Thought," at Cal State Fullerton's Main Art Gallery (through Oct. 
11), offers an introduction to such non-traditional treatments of landscape 
with two distinctly different bodies of work by Lita Albuquerque and Richard 
Misrach. Albuquerque creates quasi-mystical pieces in nature or gallery 
settings; Misrach photographs evidence of the damage people have levied on 
once-pristine tracts of desert. Both artists' work is superficially attractive 
-- sometimes too attractive -- but it is meant as a serious treatment of the 
complex relationship of human beings to the land they inhabit. 
</P>
<P>
When Albuquerque works directly in nature, she usually makes cuts in the earth 
-- geometric shapes or human silhouettes -- and fills them with powdered blue, 
red and yellow pigment. On a Malibu cliff she has "drawn" a perpendicular blue 
line that joins with the ocean. In other works, colored pigments locate the 
shadows of such different objects as the moon and the tip of the Washington 
Monument. 
</P>
<P>
In another piece, she sprinkled pigment on a group of rocks in the Mojave 
Desert that she had arranged like constellations. Still another piece involved 
a group of white-clad people, dancing under her direction, who produced a huge 
red-and-blue earth "drawing" of circles and a spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Some viewers have found great poetry and presence in these pieces (represented 
in the exhibit with color photographs). Albuquerque says they are "about the 
place where inner and outer worlds meet." Linked in a general way to ancient 
ritual practices, these activities also reflect the artist's eccentric 
dream-images and speculative fancies. 
</P>
<P>
Very much the New-Age mystic, she is fascinated by both astronomy and alchemy. 
One habit of hers -- which she says she performs "at least 10 times a day" -- 
is to visualize the Earth from a great distance, as if traveling down through 
the galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
As Jan Butterfield's catalogue essay relates, Albuquerque was utterly 
devastated after she had to move from an ocean-view studio to another one in 
Los Angeles. Eventually she came to see that her obsession with the horizon 
line was connected to her childhood in Tunisia. Fixed points of the earth were 
the main constants in her life then, as her parents were pursuing their lives 
at geographical and emotional removes. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that her art stems from genuine feelings. But for this 
viewer, the hokey tone of her metaphysical beliefs and the materials she 
chooses to use are major stumbling blocks. As someone who loathes the numbing 
quality of New-Age music and edges away from people who start talking about 
higher states of consciousness, I fail to find the meaning in her work. And 
even if the colors of pigment she employs are historically associated with 
alchemy, as Butterfield writes, that's not the connection a viewer is likely to 
make in this era of seductive advertising and conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The color-dusted rocks -- which Albuquerque exhibited last year at a Los 
Angeles gallery -- look too much like chichi window dressing; the earth 
drawings don't (in photographs, at least) resonate with the authority and power 
of earthworks by such artists as the late Ana Mendieta. Albuquerque's work 
seems to be asking us to play make-believe against our wills, pretending things 
we don't feel. 
</P>
<P>
Her gallery installation at Cal State Fullerton, "Spheres of Influence/Sphere 
of Influences," consists of nine tall, rectangular, carefully lit pieces of 
corrugated cardboard covered with gold leaf that lean out from the walls. In 
the center of the room is a pale, round, porous rock. Lined up with the rock 
like a planet in orbit is a small gold ball. 
</P>
<P>
These objects set up various shadow patterns that variously impinge on one 
another. The title of the work seems to refer both to that visible fact and to 
the unseen forces that objects in space exert on one another. But the whole 
thing seems at once too pedantic and too glitzy to make a serious point about 
anything, let alone the laws of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Misrach's early strobe-lit color work from the late '70s introduced lush 
visions of tropical foliage glowing against the night sky. His work in this 
exhibit is at once completely different in theme and oddly similar in its sense 
of quiet, stillness and dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that "there is no neutral landscape" -- as he says in the 
audio-visual introduction to the exhibit -- Misrach has since turned his 
attention to terrains in which the human presence has profoundly changed the 
course of nature. Although we may think of the desert as a vast, empty tract of 
land, Misrach brings us up to date with images of dirt-bike tracks, the 
sand-covered carcasses of animals that apparently were victims of nuclear 
testing, discarded beer bottles poking up like carbuncles, goof-offs pointing 
guns at each other, graffiti and raging fires. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these images are quite beautiful -- especially the fires, which drop 
gauzy veils of smoke over the landscape and add flickering orange accents to 
the desert's muted colors. Views of the Salton Sea -- an ancient dried-out lake 
in California that was flooded by an ill-managed irrigation project -- have a 
dreamy, bleached-out look, as if time had been suspended. Often, even the 
derelict signs of an earlier human presence -- TV antennas, clotheslines, gas 
pumps -- have an abstract beauty, like so many graceful vertical brush strokes 
made by a master Chinese painter. 
</P>
<P>
Without the images presenting out-and-out desecration -- such as the use of a 
graffiti Crucifixion scene for target practice -- Misrach's message might be 
too subtle for the average viewer. But the fascination of this work lies 
precisely in the tension between the passive loveliness of certain of the 
images and the artist passions about the environment. It is one thing to make 
"political" art that shouts a message loud and clear. It is another to make art 
that lures the viewer with a surface of odd, dreamy beauty and waits for pained 
recognition to sink in. By the time you realize what you're looking at, your 
guard is down and you've been charmed into attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landscape as Thought" remains through Oct. 11 at Cal State Fullerton's Main 
Art Gallery. Hours are noon to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday 
(closed Saturday). Admission is free. Information: (714) 773-2037.

ROVA SAXOPHONE QUARTET IN UCI SYMPOSIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final concert of the UC Irvine's all-day Electronic Music Symposium was a 
performance of Alvin Curran's "Electronic Rags II" on Saturday night. This not 
inconsiderable feat was ably accomplished by the avant-garde saxophone quartet 
ROVA, with frequent associate Scot Gresham-Lancaster joining the composer at 
the computer controls. 
</P>
<P>
The work consists of 30 three-minute miniatures that combine a small measure of 
improvisation with written music and electronically generated sound. Performers 
may opt for the entire set, or may create abbreviated versions. On this 
occasion, held at the Nelson Research Center in a remote corner of the Irvine 
campus, the duration was 75 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Those minutes did not pass quickly. Yet lack of variety was not to blame. The 
quartet -- John Raskin, Larry Ochs, Steve Adams, and Bruce Ackley -- indulged 
in staccato squawks. They bravely bent pitches. They united for frantic 
screaming sessions. They separated for mournful, jazz-influenced solos. 
</P>
<P>
Behind ROVA's acrobatics, the electronics gave intimate response prompted by a 
computer program that interfaced with the saxophone score. 
</P>
<P>
Electronics offer infinite possibilities, most of which seemed to have come to 
fruition Saturday night. The electronic background was chimes. It was a 
steaming boiler to the quartet's open railroad-imitating intervals. It was the 
whole railroad. There were male and female voices that spoke or sang 
unintelligibly. There were eerie Spielberg-type sound effects and an array of 
peculiarly electronic sounds all aptly related to the amplified acoustic 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with all this activity, a sizable portion of the audience of 85 
abandoned their posts, though one would assume they did not wander mistakenly 
or uninitiated into an out-of-the-way electronic music symposium. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining stalwarts squirmed, scratched and looked generally glassy-eyed 
(when they weren't looking surreptitiously at their watches). The problem was 
that this humming hive of activity produced a sticky sameness. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the most effective moments of the work were the instants of 
silence juxtaposed against a sea of sound. Indeed, silence is an important 
component in all music, but how often does one yearn for the relief that only 
absolute quiet can provide? 
</P>
<P>
And what was the fitting conclusion of Curran's tour de force? It stopped. 
After 75 minutes, the members of ROVA -- whose appearance had been sponsored by 
the Newport Harbor Art Museum as the beginning of its 1989-90 concert season -- 
simply stopped, graciously shook the composer's hand and thanked their weary 
audience.

THE 2 LIVE CREW: BANAL, WITLESS RAUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mix a little raunch with a bit of wit, as everybody from Cole Porter to Prince 
has done at some point, and you've got a formula for pop that's lively, and 
maybe even healthily, artfully shocking. 
</P>
<P>
Take away the wit, and turn the raunch into drooling pornography, and you've 
got the formula for the banal, embarrassing exercise that The 2 Live Crew 
perpetrated Saturday night at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. Imagine a bunch 
of smirking, priapic frat boys throwing a party where the entertainment is 
grainy stag films and the brainless bump and grind of nearly naked female 
hirelings. There you have it, except that this Miami-based crew substituted its 
own cesspool rhymes for the nudie movies. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the half-filled house stood with their arms folded, perhaps wondering 
whether they should feel a little ashamed, while others slurped it up like 
hooting refugees from Morton Downey Jr.'s studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
The slimiest moves in this 45-minute excrescence were the transformation of 
Manfred Mann's "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" and the Kinks' "All Day and All of the 
Night" into dirty doggerel sing-alongs. The 2 Live Crew also treated its crowd 
to a heaping side order of homophobia. And yes, it's always edifying to hear 
women repeatedly referred to by that dehumanizing word, "bitch." 
</P>
<P>
Crew leader Luther Campbell is nicknamed Luke Skyywalker, but Larry Flyynt 
would be more appropriate. Like the Hustler magazine porn baron, Campbell knows 
that there is big money in pandering to the baser instincts. The Two Live 
Crew's first two albums went gold, and the current one, "As Nasty as They Wanna 
Be," is in the Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
The less said about this tax on the First Amendment, the better. Lenny Bruce 
died for somebody's sins, but not these. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed EPMD (Erick and Parrish Making Dollars) is one of rap's biggest 
dollar-makers right now with a No. 1 album on the black music chart, but its 
ill-planned 30-minute set had no form or momentum, and it was further hampered 
by the rappers' poor diction. The group managed flickers of interest -- most of 
them having to do with a duo of hot hip-hop dancers who accompanied the stocky 
New York rappers, Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Breeze, a new rap singer from Los Angeles, didn't offer anything fresh in a 
tepidly received set. Enjoyable dance routines were the highlights of brief 
appearances by a couple of unheralded Los Angeles acts, Throw Down Twins and 
Superb &amp; the Tribe.

<P>
The government today unveiled a $750-billion budget that cuts military spending 
by 8.3% and increases financing for social needs, reflecting the Soviet Union's 
shifting priorities under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov said the government is planning to cut the 
$192-billion deficit in half by raising $83 billion in new revenues and 
trimming expenditures by $10.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
He told the opening of the fall session of the Supreme Soviet legislature that 
military spending could be cut because the Soviet Union's "realistic and 
constructive foreign policy" had led to an improvement in international 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directive From Parliament 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cut military spending from $119 billion to $109 billion is in 
keeping with a directive from the Congress of People's Deputies parliament to 
cut military spending by 14% by 1991, Pavlov said. 
</P>
<P>
Military research alone will be cut by $3.4 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the 1990 budget is of an "emergency character" because of the 
deficit that has spun out of control as the country's economic situation 
worsens. The budget deficit is only the second the Soviet government has 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the government is planning to raise pensions for 60 
million retirees by an average of 15% and reorient the Soviet economy toward 
fulfilling social needs. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlov did not immediately say how the government will raise the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet that the government will 
take firm steps to settle the ethnic dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenia 
and Azerbaijan cannot end it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he was giving the leaders of the two Transcaucasian republics 
two days to help bring an end to a month-old economic blockade of Armenia by 
Azerbaijani workers opposing Armenian claims to the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, if necessary, concrete measures must be taken," he said, without giving 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
19-Month Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Azerbaijan, two neighboring southern Soviet republics, have been 
locked in a bitter 19-month dispute over control of the enclave. About 100 
people have died in the ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The economic blockade of mainly Christian Armenia, which receives more than 80% 
of its food and fuel via predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan, has left shelves bare 
and industry at a virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, Gorbachev approved a request by Igor Shamshev, a deputy from 
Yaroslavl, to charge a group of deputies with the task of investigating an 
apparent move by Pravda last week to discredit former Moscow Party leader Boris 
Yeltsin. Pravda reprinted an article by an Italian newspaper La Repubblica that 
portrayed Yeltsin as hard-drinking and a spendthrift during his recent U.S. 
lecture tour.

The Arab League's Lebanon peace negotiator narrowly escaped shelling that hit 
his hotel in a village near Beirut today in the first serious breach of the 
fragile two-day cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
But the brief shelling barrage in hills to the east of Beirut failed to deter 
the thousands of citizens streaming back to the war-ravaged capital in holiday 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
Arab League peace negotiator Lakhdar Ibrahimi was awakened by the shell blasts 
that shook his hotel room in the village of Beit Meri and immediately contacted 
officials to stop the firing, security sources reported. 
</P>
<P>
Christian military sources said 120 shells and mortar bombs hit the mountain 
villages of Beit Meri, Mansouriyeh and Ain Saadeh. Christian and Muslim sources 
each claimed that the other side was responsible for the shelling.

GAS LEAK CLOSES LA HABRA SCHOOL

<P>
La Habra High School students got an unexpected holiday today after a 
maintenance worker failed to close a valve while changing a chlorine gas bottle 
on a swimming pool filter, causing toxic gas to seep onto the school grounds 
about 6:50 a.m., said a Fullerton Union School District spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
School was canceled and La Habra's 1,580 students and 120 teachers, 
administrators and staff were sent home as they arrived for classes this 
morning. Nearby residents were not evacuated because the pool is in the middle 
of the campus, La Habra Fire Capt. Jack Johnson said. By the time the fumes 
reached the edge of the campus, Johnson said, the chlorine had dissipated and 
was no longer dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very fortunate it happened a half-hour prior to the opening of school," 
said La Habra High Principal Tom Triggs. Doug Bentley, a school maintenance 
worker, was overcome by the chlorine gas -- routinely used instead of liquid 
chlorine in large swimming pools -- and was treated at Friendly Hills Medical 
Center in La Habra and released, said La Habra police Capt. John Rees. 
</P>
<P>
The school is expected to be open Tuesday.

IMPACT OF OIL DRILLING PAINTED AS DISMAL; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY OF OFFSHORE WELLS PREDICTS AT LEAST ONE MAJOR ACCIDENT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tanker traffic off California would increase 41% if a federal moratorium on oil 
drilling is lifted and at least one major accident would result, according to a 
study conducted for six coastal counties stretching from Sonoma to Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusions are rather grim," San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto said 
of the report released today. In a statement, Alioto said the counties "wanted 
an independent assessment of the impacts from offshore oil drilling." 
</P>
<P>
The $95,000 study -- done for Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa 
Cruz and Monterey counties -- claimed that oil exploration would be centered 
near wildlife areas such as Ano Nuevo State Preserve, a principal breeding area 
for elephant seals. 
</P>
<P>
Oil-drilling platforms would be as big as two football fields and capable of 
supporting up to 50 wells, the study said, adding that 100,000 tons of 
contaminated waste would spill onto the ocean floor over the 15- to 20-year 
life of the wells. 
</P>
<P>
The report also predicted that as many as five processing ships would be 
permanently anchored along the coast to handle the oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
It forecast at least four major incidents from offshore drilling, including at 
least one tanker accident and one platform leak of 100,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very careful not to exaggerate the risks," said Warner Chabot, the 
environmental planning consultant for the regional studies consortium formed by 
the six counties. "We retained the same geologists and the same consultants who 
prepare studies for the oil industry." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the oil industry insisted exploration can be done in an 
environmentally safe manner. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Larry Shushan, a spokesman for Chevron, "there aren't very many 
places that haven't been explored." 
</P>
<P>
The counties would be affected by offshore oil operations in an area known as 
Lease Sale 119. The U.S. Department of Interior has been trying to hold Lease 
Sale 119 for years. The sale was originally scheduled in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Two other proposed lease sales off the California coast -- one from Mendocino 
County north to the Oregon border, the other from Monterey County to the 
Mexican border -- have been shelved indefinitely.

Classrooms in nearly every Utah school district are empty today as teachers 
stage a one-day strike to protest low pay, overcrowded classrooms and 
inadequate supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout, the largest by educators in Utah in a quarter century, involve 
nearly 20,000 teachers and affect 450,000 students in 800 schools, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout was incited by anger over the Legislature's decision in a special 
session last week to give Utahns a $38.4-million tax rebate, and not to 
allocate money to education from a $94-million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' pay in Utah ranks 43rd in the nation, $4,500 less than the average 
national salary of $29,400, the association said.

After more than 400 liftoffs, NASA launched its last unmanned space rocket from 
this spaceport today, propelling a $125-million Navy communications satellite 
into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-year era ended when an Atlas-Centaur rocket blazed away from the pad at 
4:56 a.m. and hoisted a 5,100-pound payload intended to link land, sea and air 
forces around the globe with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Command 
Authority and the President's military command network. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning in the area held up the launch for 44 minutes, and the Atlas-Centaur 
lifted off with just one minute remaining in a favorable 45-minute launch 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Today's launch was delayed more than two years because of a 1987 launch pad 
accident that severely damaged the rocket's Centaur stage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Rocket Left 
</P>
<P>
The space agency has one unmanned rocket left -- a Delta that is to loft a 
scientific satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in November. 
</P>
<P>
But today's flight is the last from Cape Canaveral, where the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration got its start and where it has launched 
nearly all its rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always sad to see the end of an era," said James L. Womack, NASA's 
director of expendable launch vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we have done have been 
fabulous," said Joseph Mahon, the agency's assistant administrator for space 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
With the launch, NASA's only remaining launch vehicle here is the manned space 
shuttle.

The former husband of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan today challenged the 
constitutionality of a law designed to free his former wife after 25 months 
behind bars for concealing their daughter in a bitter custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan remained in jail, awaiting action on a weekend request filed by her 
lawyers that she be freed. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Morgan's former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, claim the legislation, 
which President Bush signed Saturday, infringed on the powers of the local 
courts. The attorney, Elaine Mittleman, also said the bill violated Foretich's 
rights and those of the couple's daughter, Hilary, 7. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan has been in jail rather than produce the child for a court-ordered visit 
with Foretich, claiming he had sexually abused Hilary. Foretich denies the 
allegation.

Stock prices posted a broad loss today as the dollar fell in foreign exchange 
and interest rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell after finance ministers from the leading industrialized nations 
Saturday issued their sternest warning yet that they believed the U.S. currency 
was too high and threatened world economic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 22.42 points to a five-week low 
of 2,659.19. 
</P>

Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 5 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 435 up, 1,018 down and 498 unchanged.

<P>
Big Board volume totaled 121.13 million shares, down from 133.35 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.45 to 191.28. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that dampened interest in stocks at a time when many investors 
were already concerned that the market was due for a "correction" after its 
sharp rise over the first eight months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said that computer-driven program trading was also partly responsible 
for the steepness of the decline, which took place in thin trading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Down 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading today in response to the concerted attack on 
the dollar by central banks of the seven major industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 15/32 point, or about $4.70 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased to 
8.23% from 8.19% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Finance officials from the Group of Seven nations met in Washington on Saturday 
and agreed that the dollar should not rise from current levels. They followed 
up on that communique by selling dollars from their reserves today. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell about 1/4 point and long-term 
issues were down roughly 1/2 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index was unavailable because of 
computer problems at the source.

COORS TO BUY MOST OF STROH FOR $425 MILLION

Coors Brewing Co. said today it has agreed to pay $425 million to acquire most 
of Stroh Brewing Co., the nation's third-largest brewer. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will give Coors, which has been the fourth-largest brewing company, 
ownership of such venerable brands as Stroh's, Schlitz and Schaefer, and 
continues a drive begun in the early 1980s to expand Coors from a regional to a 
national brewer. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Coors, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Coors Brewing 
Co., said the acquisition will provide Coors "with a real opportunity to 
achieve our vision of becoming a major, long-term factor in the U.S. brewing 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Coors Brewing Co. is a unit of the Adolph Coors Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit-based Stroh has been looking for potential partners since February 
and announced Aug. 31 it was laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar employees 
nationwide. The 139-year-old company had been suffering financial troubles 
since it went national by acquiring Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh was unable to make inroads on the growth of Anheuser Busch, which 
dominates the industry with a 41% share of the national beer market, far ahead 
of Miller's 21% and Stroh's 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Stroh's, Schlitz and Schaefer, the agreement will allow Coors to 
acquire Signature, Old Milwaukee, Red Bull, Silver Thunder and St. Barts, as 
well as the licensing rights to Piels and Augsburger. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition also includes plants in St. Paul, Minn.; Tampa, Fla.; 
Winston-Salem, N.C.; Longview, Tex.; and Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh said it will keep breweries in Van Nuys, Calif., and Memphis, Tenn. In 
its announcement, Coors said it will pay $425 million for the Stroh assets, and 
part of that price will include the assumption of certain long-term debt and 
other selected liabilities. It was not immediately known how much debt is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is subject to approval by the boards of directors of both 
companies.

Sales of existing homes rose 3.3% in August to the highest level in six months 
as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage rates, a real estate group reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units in August, up from 
July's revised 3.33 million units. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes fell steadily from last December until June, when they 
recorded their first increase of the year and the largest advance since 
December, 1986. But they dipped again in July, down 0.9% from the June gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported last Friday that fixed-rate home 
mortgages were currently averaging 10.03%, down from their peak rate of 11.22% 
last March. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a home fell $1,800 to $94,900 in August, down 1.9% from 
July.

University of Missouri veteran basketball Coach Norm Stewart, who missed a 
third of last season after surgery for colon cancer, has been given the final 
OK by his doctor to return to coaching this season. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart underwent extensive tests last week at Columbia Regional Hospital that 
showed his body was free of cancer and the seven ulcers that plagued him in 
February, according to his personal physician Jay Ward. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we did went extremely well," Ward said. "It was great." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, whose collapse on an airplane Feb. 9 triggered the discovery of 
cancer, has regained almost all of the weight he lost during his recovery, Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the tests completed last week were more thorough than the occasional 
checkups Stewart had during the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 54, will begin his 23rd season at Missouri Nov. 17 when the Tigers 
host the Brazilian national team. His record is 429-225.

'POOR SPORTSMEN': U.S. BLASTED IN NEW ZEALAND

Most New Zealanders consider Americans "poor sportsmen" and favor launching a 
new international yachting event to replace the America's Cup, government 
minister Mike Moore said today. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, whose portfolio includes America's Cup affairs, said he had received a 
number of letters from New Zealanders keen to see yachting's most famous trophy 
replaced by a new sailing event. 
</P>
<P>
He said that might eventually happen, adding that he does not believe the idea 
should be officially explored until a long-running court dispute between the 
San Diego Yacht Club and New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club has been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"There is another court round to go, one more chance for the American court 
system to uphold the view that sports people should meet on equal terms," Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of Kiwis find the prospect of yet another court round a bit 
disappointing. But, on the other hand, I don't think they'd support our players 
walking off the field before the game is over." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he doesn't agree that all Americans should be labeled poor sports, 
despite a New York appellate court ruling last week saying there are no 
constraints on the America's Cup defender's vessel. That ruling reversed an 
earlier decision in favor of New Zealand.

The Bucks said today that Coach Del Harris, whose contract was to have expired 
at the end of the 1989-90 season, has been signed to a contract through the 
1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball Assn. team also said that Harris will assume the title 
of vice president of basketball operations in addition to being head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Del has done an outstanding job, and we wish to recognize that achievement by 
securing his services for the future," Bucks President Herb Kohl said. "His 
teams the past two seasons have been aggressive, well-prepared and exciting. We 
look forward to the 1989-90 season and beyond with optimism." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks have compiled a 91-73 record in two seasons under Harris, who 
previously was coach at Houston from 1979 to 1983. Milwaukee was 49-33 last 
season.

SHOE-WIELDING MOM BARRED FROM BOUTS

<P>
The shoe-wielding mom of British boxer Tony Wilson has been barred by her son 
from throwing any more knockout blows. 
</P>
<P>
Minna Wilson, who burst into the ring last week and whacked her son's opponent 
over the head with one of her high-heeled shoes, has been told to keep away 
from future fights. 
</P>
<P>
"I've banned her from watching me again," Wilson, a light heavyweight, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Under Way 
</P>
<P>
British boxing officials are investigating how Wilson, 62, managed to clamber 
over rows of spectators, squeeze past security officials into the ring and end 
her son's bout in round three by clouting Steve McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Thursday at the Guildhall in Southampton. Wilson and 
McCarthy were fighting for the right to stay in contention for a shot at the 
British light- heavyweight title, held by Tom Collins. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy had knocked down Wilson and had him pinned against the ropes when he 
felt the full force of Minna Wilson's shoe. The blow opened a gaping wound that 
required hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The referee's decision to award the fight to Wilson after McCarthy refused to 
return to the ring sparked an uproar among the crowd of about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he could not understand why his mother intervened after peacefully 
watching him fight numerous times since he was 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know why it happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His mother was unavailable for comment. She was said to be "relaxing at home." 
</P>
<P>
But her actions were defended by Wilson's manager, Jimmy Tibbs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shouldn't Be Ashamed' 
</P>
<P>
"She's been quoted in the paper as saying she is ashamed, but she shouldn't be 
ashamed," Tibbs said. "She's done what any mum would do under the 
circumstances. She just blacked out. She didn't know what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
The British Boxing Board of Control declared the fight a no-contest and ordered 
a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Minna Wilson will not be there, but Tibbs wishes she could trade 
punches legally, just like her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to sign her up, but the (British) Board won't grant me a license," 
Tibbs said with a smile.
