METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER ACCUSED OF BILKING CLIENTS RESIGNS 
FROM BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood attorney accused of bilking clients of at least $15,000 has 
resigned from the California State Bar after being hit with two separate 
misconduct cases involving a 22 complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Derl G. Brown's resignation as an attorney was accepted last month by the state 
Supreme Court "without prejudice," said bar spokeswoman Susan Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Brown may seek reinstatement to the bar in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Brown neither admitted nor denied the allegations against him, but his 
resignation closes the case as far as the State Bar is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Brown did not return messages left on his answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the two cases were filed with the state bar against Brown on Nov. 
15, 1989, and on March 12, 1990. The bar also filed counts against Brown for 
his failure to cooperate with the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints against Brown were filed by clients who said he accepted 
fees ranging from $250 to $3,600 but failed to perform any services.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has been pounding the pavement in Europe, trying to recruit 
tourists. A panel here is trying to figure out why the L.A. Convention Center 
can't attract more business, especially with its giant sign. 
</P>
<P>
We at Only in L.A. believe the problem is that these serious folks have failed 
to exploit the possibilities of offbeat tours such as: "The Seven Wonders of 
the Civic Center." Certainly, no one could resist: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Corporate Head," Terry Allen's sculpture of a businessman outside the 
Citicorp building at 7th and Figueroa streets. Here's a guy who really buries 
himself in his work. 
</P>
<P>
2. The mysterious formation of upside-down obelisks topped by upside-down cones 
in front of the Grand Promenade building on Bunker Hill. The work of 
extraterrestrials? 
</P>
<P>
3. The pint-sized Christopher Columbus statue in the County Mall, which 
officials ordered to be constructed so that it was shorter than George 
Washington's nearby statue. 
</P>
<P>
4. The temporary -- we hope -- wooden intersections near Metro Rail 
construction sites, such as the 5th and Hill streets crossing. Step back into 
the 19th Century! That's progress. 
</P>
<P>
5. The Fred Harvey restaurant, preserved as though in a time capsule at Union 
Station, with its arched ceilings, leather banquettes and multicolored tiles, 
not to mention black marble sinks in the "Powder Room." The cafe awaits an 
entrepreneur to reopen it. 
</P>
<P>
6. The curvaceous Coca-Cola Bottling Co. plant, disguised as a ship at 1334 S. 
Central Ave. The half-century-old Streamline Moderne building is equipped with 
porthole windows, ship doors and a captain's bridge. Has any employee ever put 
a note in a bottle and thrown it overboard? 
</P>
<P>
7. The Pac Bell map sculpture on Grand Avenue. We mentioned a while back that 
it shows South America west of L.A. Several readers pointed out that Australia 
is upside-down. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, still to come, Epicenter, the earthquake-theme restaurant at 
2nd and Hill: L.A.'s Eighth Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
A true, must-miss event: 
</P>
<P>
You won't have to worry about getting a rubber-chicken dinner at the Santa 
Clarita Civic Assn.'s coming fund-raiser. "You won't have to buy a new outfit, 
or go out," adds the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
You do nothing, in fact, but send money. The group, which is active in local 
politics, sends you a tea bag and a bookmark in return. 
</P>
<P>
It's called "Evening at Home" and billed as the Santa Clarita Valley's 
"first-ever non-event." First intentional non-event? 
</P>
<P>
Ex-reporter Cliff Dektar noticed that a bit of old L.A. is disappearing, the 
Yellow Cab headquarters at 3rd and Lucas streets. "Back in the '30s and '40s," 
Dektar recalled, "when Yellow Cab was the only cab company in town, the phone 
number was easy to remember -- MAdison 1-2-3-4." 
</P>
<P>
A monument of sorts to the company survives across the street -- the Taxi Bar. 
</P>
<P>
California Lawyer magazine reports that a Hollywood barrister has caught the 
attention of State Bar investigators as well as Parker Brothers, owners of the 
Monopoly game. He's been handing out business cards decorated with a 
Monopoly-type "Get Out of Jail Free" insignia. He had better watch out or he'll 
be back on Baltic Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The slogan calls to mind the motto of Van Nuys bail bondsman Art (The Golden 
Boy) Aragon, a local boxing favorite in the '50s. Aragon's guarantee these days 
is: 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get you out, if it takes 10 years." 
</P>
<P>

Lockheed Corp. was founded by brothers Allan and Malcolm Loughead, who used a 
phonetic spelling of their name to avoid potential mispronunciations such as 
"Lug-head."

SUNSHINE LANDFILL CRITICS WANT TRASH SENT BY RAIL TO DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
GARBAGE: THE ACTIVISTS CALL FOR TRANSFER STATIONS IN CHATSWORTH, SYLMAR, VAN 
NUYS, CANOGA PARK AND BURBANK-SUN VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of the proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill on Monday 
unveiled their own plan for disposing of the region's trash: shipping it by 
rail to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The plan outlined by San Fernando Valley homeowners and activists called for 
closing city and county landfills, recycling as much trash as possible and 
sending the rest to an unspecified new dump in the desert. Transfer stations 
where trash would be loaded from trucks onto rail cars could be located in 
Chatsworth, Sylmar, Van Nuys, Canoga Park and Burbank-Sun Valley along existing 
rail lines, suggested Michael Ormsby, who led a press conference organized by 
the North Valley Coalition and Friends of Sunshine Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But a railroad company executive who attended the briefing at a Granada Hills 
restaurant said such a plan would not work unless the traditional "not in my 
back yard" fears of Valley homeowners can be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless there's public support for transfer stations, this is not going to be a 
reality," said John Spisak, president of SP Environmental Systems Inc. in 
Sacramento, a sister company of the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
Spisak added that his company and other private concerns were eager to develop 
remote, "rail-haul" dumps but feared precisely the kind of backlash that has 
stalled expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill's owner, Browning-Ferris Industries, wants to expand its 230 acres 
already in operation into an additional 542 acres of unincorporated county 
land. The proposal is scheduled for discussion Thursday by the Regional 
Planning Commission, which delayed voting on it at the July 25 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion proposal, which has been pending for five years, needs several 
county approvals, including a permit to cut down an estimated 6,000 oak trees, 
said supervising regional planner Richard Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
The site is classified as a significant ecological area in the county General 
Plan, which would have to be amended to allow the dump's expansion, he said. 
Frazier said the county is already considering a rail-haul system of disposing 
trash, among other trash-disposal plans, but was not ready to entirely give up 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ormsby and about 30 other homeowners and self-proclaimed 
environmentalists said they would resolutely oppose landfills in Sunshine 
Canyon and other ecologically sensitive canyons. "I see them falling like a 
deck of cards if we don't do something fast," said Ormsby.

PANEL OKS FRYMAN CANYON PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE VOTE BY THE PARKS COMMISSION IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL CITY HALL 
ACTION TO IMPLEMENT A DEAL TO BUY THE LAND FROM DEVELOPER FRED SAHADI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city parks commissioners Monday voted 5 to 0 to recommend spending 
$1.2 million to help purchase 63-acre Fryman Canyon after Councilman Michael 
Woo called the price tag "an excellent bargain" for parkland "so close to the 
heart of the city." 
</P>
<P>
The vote was the first official action at City Hall to implement a deal 
negotiated by Woo and Mayor Tom Bradley to buy the canyon for $10.9 million 
from developer Fred Sahadi, who otherwise plans to build 26 luxury residences 
on the woodsy, steep-sloped property in Studio City, the center of a spirited 
tug of war between the developer and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The expenditure endorsed by the members of the Recreation and Parks Commission, 
all Bradley appointees, is also subject to review by the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The next major test of the Bradley-Woo plan will come at a meeting Monday of 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the state agency that is the other 
major partner in the deal to buy Fryman Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley-Woo deal envisions the conservancy contributing $8.7 million toward 
the purchase price of Fryman Canyon, the city, $1.96 million and private 
contributors, $240,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state parks agency two months ago voted to kick in up to $8.7 
million, it agreed to do so only if state appraisers valued the property at 
$10.7 million -- which they have not done. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the maximum state valuation of the property has been $8.7 million, and 
conservancy chief Joseph T. Edmiston has said he has doubts about the legality 
and propriety of the city and the parks agency paying anything in excess of a 
government-appraised amount. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such reservations, the conservancy is set to debate a proposal at its 
next meeting to spend $8.7 million on Fryman "without further appraisal." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to approving the $1.2 million, the City Council also must rescind a 
plan to spend $719,000 on a park project in Temescal Canyon in the Pacific 
Palisades, switching the funds to the Fryman purchase to complete its 
contribution of $1.96 million. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the Palisades, has agreed to this 
plan, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote requires at least temporarily stripping the city's Runyon Canyon 
Acquisition Trust Fund of all its money and putting on hold for an indefinite 
period construction of a ranger interpretive center and amphitheater for nature 
classes for children at Runyon Canyon Park in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said there were "no absolute guarantees" that the trust account would be 
replenished -- a point that Commissioner Richard Riordan, an attorney, said was 
troubling to him. 
</P>
<P>
The Runyon Canyon fund was set up by the city and the conservancy to make land 
buys and capital improvements at the 133-acre park. The money may be used for 
non-Runyon Canyon purposes with the approval of the commission, the council and 
the Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said he was concerned about the "policy" decision to spend scarce parks 
dollars on an unimproved park in a well-to-do area of Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
The decision may deprive inner city residents of park services, complained 
Riordan, who also said he was bothered that children might be the losers if the 
Runyon Canyon improvements are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
But Woo argued that Fryman Canyon is actually centrally located enough to be 
accessible to inner city parks users, and he pledged to work diligently to get 
the Runyon Canyon funds replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Dean Pregerson and J. Stanley Sanders also made the commission's 
support of the plan conditional upon the conservancy agreeing to operate the 
Fryman Canyon park in accordance with city recreational policies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bradley-Woo plan, the conservancy would actually own the land.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN SLAYING OF BANK PATRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last of four men accused of killing a man at a Northridge automated teller 
machine last year pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Louis Mares, 22, of Granada Hills faces 15 years to life in state prison 
for the March 21, 1989, shooting death of 29-year-old Aslam Hasham, who was 
robbed and gunned down after he withdrew money from the automatic teller 
machine at Tampa Avenue and Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
Mares also pleaded guilty to one count of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Mares was the lookout for three friends who also were 
responsible for similar holdups elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Elisaia Reupena, 28, of Sherman Oaks and Steven B. Rice, 20, of Granada Hills 
were sentenced last year to life in prison after they pleaded guilty to 
Hasham's slaying and to charges of robbery and kidnaping in two other ATM 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Reupena shot Hasham as the victim struggled with his attackers, but Reupena was 
shot in the leg during the struggle. His subsequent arrest at a Torrance 
hospital led to the other three defendants. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-year-old youth -- 17 at the time of the slaying -- was sent to the 
California Youth Authority after he admitted playing a role in the shooting and 
the two other ATM crimes. He can be held in the Youth Authority until he is 25. 
</P>
<P>
Mares was scheduled to stand trial on a first-degree murder charge and could 
have faced the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Richman said prosecutors allowed Mares to plead to the 
lesser charge because he had no prior criminal record, was not involved in the 
other crimes and served only as a lookout during the attack on Hasham. 
</P>
<P>
He will be sentenced Nov. 19 in San Fernando Superior Court.

<P>
Drawing an analogy between prostitutes in Tokyo and blacks in America is 
ridiculous. Yet a Japanese cabinet official did that recently, in a most 
insulting manner. 
</P>
<P>
After a police roundup of foreign prostitutes over the weekend, Justice 
Minister Seiroku Kajiyama likened their presence in the Shinjuku district to 
black Americans who move into white neighborhoods and "ruin the atmosphere." He 
said: "It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because blacks move 
in, and whites are forced out." The Justice Ministry later issued a clarifying 
statement but did not apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama's slur reflects an insular view of the world despite a program of 
"internationalization" and Japan's business interests overseas. He is the 
latest official -- others included former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and 
Liberal Democratic Party official Michio Watanabe -- to make disparaging 
remarks about blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, Japan's embrace of Western ways apparently is superficial -- designer 
goods and hamburgers. Tokyo may have difficulty understanding the tapestry of 
America's diversity, but it should know better given the many Japanese tourists 
and businessmen who visit America. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we see the distressing popularity of best-selling books with 
anti-Semitic themes and continuing discrimination against Koreans in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have long extolled their homogeneous culture, but it's also an 
excuse. Tokyo needs some lessons in sensitivity before "internationalization" 
is genuine.

RAISE FEES, INSPECT MORE POOLS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ABSURDITY OF FAILING TO MONITOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California has come to be known as the land of swimming pools; the 
image calls to mind crystal clear, elliptical back-yard pools with water 
glistening under year-round sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sun doesn't always shine here, and lots of pools in Los Angeles 
County contain anything but glistening clear water. Too many have become 
so-called "dark" pools, overgrown with algae that spreads over the surface like 
a blanket of muck. Bacteria breed there, setting up the potential for 
widespread infection and increasing the chances of drownings. 
</P>
<P>
Such conditions persist because there are not enough inspectors. The county, 
which is in charge of inspecting its 16,700 public pools and spas, has only 
eight people to do the job. That's the same number the county had 20 years ago, 
when there were half as many pools in parks, schools, hotels, health clubs, 
apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Times writer Tracey Kaplan reported that 41% of the pools in the county have 
not been inspected for at least three years; almost 5,000 pools have not been 
inspected for at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast that dismal record with Orange County, where each of its 6,400 public 
pools and spas were inspected three times last year. 
</P>
<P>
The main difference between the Los Angeles inspection program and Orange 
County's? Money. Pool operators in both counties pay an annual fee for 
inspections. Los Angeles' fees just went up this year to $104. Orange County 
charges a fee of $179. So Orange County -- with less than half the number of 
pools and spas -- has six times the number of inspectors, 48, as does Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles health officials have asked for more inspectors, but the Board of 
Supervisors has been reluctant to further raise the fees paid by pool operators 
who would pay the increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
But considering the major problems invited by poor upkeep of pools -- 
widespread parasitic illness, eye infections, drownings and lawsuits -- county 
public pool operators can either pay a few dollars now for prevention or pay 
big later. The board should opt for prevention.

In his column, Lofton admits that humans are pillaging, plundering and

Recently, as I drove past my old Lincoln Savings branch, my mind wandered back 
to the days when I enjoyed just stopping by to view Abraham Lincoln relics on 
display in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, it gave me a feeling of confidence to know that my savings were in the 
hands of those who revered the principles of honest dealings so closely 
identified with Honest Abe. 
</P>
<P>
Now the place looks shabby and my vision of the care-worn face of Lincoln faded 
for a moment only to be replaced by the figures of Keating and Cranston. Of 
such experiences cynics are created and innocence is lost.

LOFTON ON MORAL INSANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Lofton ("Craziness Among the Highest Order," Commentary, Sept. 14) wants 
to know why so many people concern themselves with the quality of life other 
than human, and states: "If anybody out there in the asylum thinks he or she 
has a lucid rationale for all of this moral madness, I'd love to hear it." OK. 
</P>
<P>
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. 
</P>
<P>
Life is life. What relates all (living) things is the fact that they live, not 
what they do with that life. The real "craziness" is the belief that any life 
form is greater or lesser than any other life form. 
</P>
<P>
By overtaxing our big brains we have stepped away from the arena of life and 
stand looking in. Mankind is more pitiful than precious in its attempts to 
reduce "life" to a set of rules no "sane" organism given a brain would adhere 
to. Trying to figure life out is not the point. Just being there in it should 
be enough.

LOFTON ON MORAL INSANITY

<P>
Oh, I get it. A tossed salad commentary! Just throw up a half a dozen serious 
subjects, i.e., abortion, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, women murdered in 
the workplace, etc. (whose potential for serious debate could fill columns) and 
see where they land on a piece of paper. 
</P>
<P>
Add a pinch of paranoia; a dash of Republican rhetoric; a couple of cups of 
right-wing catch phrases and toss it all in a big bowl of hot air and top it 
off with a nice dressing of "moral insanity" (whatever that means) and voila! A 
tossed salad to exceptional hyperbole.

Hey, John, you can take your aluminum foil chef's hat off now. The CIA is no

$5-MILLION BAIL FOR KEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Keating Indicted for Fraud, Jailed," front page, Sept. 19: 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr. got $5-million bail and went to jail with most folks 
cheering that this "greedy" man got what he deserved. Why was bail set so high 
for a person unlikely to flee? To be sure he was punished for being accused of 
this crime. 
</P>
<P>
When this happens to an important man like Keating it makes headlines. When it 
happens to average, middle-class citizens, they rot in jail. We are supposed to 
be innocent until proven guilty and this trend of the courts to incarcerate 
first to be sure of punishment seems a risky course for a "free" society. 
</P>
<P>
The media played this case as an evil, greedy man taking advantage of poor, 
honest people. When W.C. Fields said "You can't cheat an honest man," he might 
have been thinking of this case. Why did these "victims" buy these bonds? 
Because they were greedy and wanted the higher interest promised. They wanted 
to believe that risk did not go with return. It always does. As a personal 
finance teacher I try to convince my students that there is never a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Do not exonerate the person who defrauds; but remember why the victims were 
easy pickings -- their own greed!

KILLING KUWAIT: BRUTAL IRAQIZATION; 
</P>
<P>
IF SADDAM WITHDRAWS, WHAT'LL HE LEAVE BEHIND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relentlessly, pitilessly, Iraq is moving to enforce its imperialistic claim 
that Kuwait has ceased to exist as a sovereign state. By acting with methodical 
brutality to destroy Kuwait's social, political and economic foundations, Iraq 
is seeking to make it impossible to restore the conditions that existed before 
Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The latest step in Iraqization has come with the decree that Kuwaiti dinars 
will no longer be recognized as legitimate currency. Kuwaitis and resident 
foreigners have been given just a few days to turn in their money for Iraqi 
dinars, an exchange that will effectively slash the value of private savings by 
two-thirds. This confiscatory measure continues the pillage that began when 
Iraq, immediately after its invasion, looted Kuwait's banks and unilaterally 
canceled the billions of dollars in debts Iraq owes. 
</P>
<P>
Only a very rapid international response to freeze Kuwait's overseas liquid 
assets prevented Iraq from transferring to itself even more billions in Kuwaiti 
cash and securities. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts at politicide -- at the wiping out of an entire country -- are not new. 
Three times in the late 18th Century, for example, Poland's neighbors conspired 
to partition the country and literally remove it from the map of Europe. In our 
own time, the Soviet Union acted to destroy the independence of Estonia, Latvia 
and Lithuania. Iraq alleges that Kuwait is simply one of its former provinces, 
ripped from the motherland by British imperialism. That claim is historically 
untrue and politically insupportable. 
</P>
<P>
Imperialism, as it happens, played a big part in creating the present-day 
boundaries of many countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East 
and, yes, North America. But the argument that imperially created borders are 
invalid -- because a powerful neighboring country says they are -- is a 
prescription for international anarchy. Kuwait's national independence has in 
any event long been recognized by scores of countries and by the United 
Nations. In no way can Iraq's aggression be justified simply as an effort to 
regain what is legitimately its own. 
</P>
<P>
But while the United Nations passes more condemnatory resolutions and 
international economic sanctions increase the costs to Iraq of its aggression, 
the process of reshaping Kuwait into just another Iraqi province goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Native Kuwaiti citizens made up only about 40% of the country's pre-invasion 
population of 1.7 million. Now, no more than 250,000 of them are believed to 
remain in the country. The places of those who have fled or been forced out are 
reportedly being filled by Iraqis and Palestinians. At the same time, Kuwaiti 
sources say, the country's vital records, even the very names of its streets, 
are being systematically eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, sooner or later, will probably be forced to withdraw its occupying army 
from Kuwait. But the ruthless measures it is taking now almost surely mean that 
it will leave behind conditions of administrative, economic and demographic 
chaos. To that degree, one aim of Saddam Hussein's aggression will have been 
achieved.

THE COLD WAR ENDED AND ERASED IN THE PROCESS THE SCHEME OF REGIONAL RELATIONS. 
A UNIFIED KOREA COULD BE THE KEY TO A COHESIVE NEW FRAMEWORK.

<P>
The Cold War ended with the dismantling of Soviet military-political alliances. 
In its wake, America's network of alliance systems worldwide has also begun to 
unravel. While the end of the Cold War can only be welcomed, the post-Cold War 
era has not yet fully begun. Even in Europe where a new structure of security 
is being built upon the foundations provided by the Helsinki process, concerns 
remain about the durability of the new order. If questions about stability 
still remain in Europe, then such questions apply even more broadly to East 
Asia, the next region in line to undergo the transition out of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the heat of superpower confrontation in East Asia has already 
diminished to a considerable extent, which in turn will inevitably lead to a 
fundamental restructuring of existing arrangements. We already see the first 
manifestations of this process in the improvement of Soviet and American 
relations with former adversaries in the region. Moscow has normalized 
relations with Beijing and will soon do the same with Seoul, and in time, with 
Tokyo. The United States has started a dialogue with Vietnam and is ready to 
see a resolution to the conflict in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The two superpowers also face the daunting task for redefining their alliance 
relations in the region. Moscow has reduced its presence in Vietnam, and now 
confronts the need to fundamentally reorder its relationship with North Korea. 
Washington must also contemplate a new set of relations with its regional 
allies such as Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the unfolding dynamic in East Asia is a healthy one. However, 
there is at the moment no alternative framework capable of providing new 
sources of cohesion among the various countries within it. Without such a 
framework, continued erosion of the present system can create new sources of 
tension, even as it removes Cold War-inspired ones. For example, a 
Soviet-Japanese resolution of the Northern Territories (Kuril Islands) issue 
will remove the basis for the U.S. military presence in Japan, and thereby 
undermine one of the central pillars upon which postwar Tokyo-Washington 
relations have been built. Inevitably, other dimensions of the bilateral 
relationship between these two countries will also be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, if North-South Korean talks proceed smoothly, calls for removal of 
U.S. troops from Korea will also grow. Uncertainties arising from erosion of 
U.S.-led alliances, however, pale in comparison to the unpredictability 
inherent in any comprehensive change of Soviet regional policy. For example, 
reduced Soviet support could lead the North Koreans to initiate reforms of 
their own or, by raising their frustration to extreme levels, trigger vengeful 
and destructive actions. 
</P>
<P>
If the postwar military alliance net works that the United States and the 
Soviet Union forged with various East Asian states become increasingly less 
relevant, what sort of post-Cold War arrangement can we envision that would 
ensure both cohesion and continued progress for the region? Who is to provide 
leadership in creating a post-Cold War order in East Asia? Conventional wisdom 
has long held that a multilateral arrangement for regional security and 
cooperation is not feasible. This line of reasoning, however, resulted from the 
fact that no agreement could be expected among the powers so long as Cold War 
tensions remained. In such a confrontational environment, moreover, no state 
could be accorded legitimacy to initiate steps toward building such a 
framework. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, questions remain about future structure and leadership for the region. 
The United States may wish to hold onto its pre-eminent regional position, but 
its growing reluctance to underwrite the costs of leadership suggests that it 
cannot retain its current position over the longer term. Japan clearly 
possesses the economic and financial wherewithal sure to be required for such 
leadership. Unfortunately, few in the region would like to see an increase in 
Japan's political clout alongside its already preponderant economic role. The 
Soviet Union is clearly in no position to assume leadership. China certainly is 
not up to the task, either. 
</P>
<P>
Some have been tempted to argue for a condominium of sorts between the United 
States and Japan, with the former providing the larger balance of political 
leadership while the latter takes a relatively bigger role in economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
Such thinking, however, is seriously deficient. Neither Beijing nor Moscow is 
likely to view the emergence of such an arrangement favorably. It is not clear 
that other countries in the region would fully welcome it, either. Also, such 
thinking seeks to preserve the status quo at a time when farsighted policies 
are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Taking all this into account, let's consider the international role for a 
unified, democratic and economically strong Korea. There are several reasons 
why this new nation could have the necessary legitimacy to initiate steps 
toward the creation of a post-Cold War multilateral arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
In marked contrast to the other powers in the region, Korea does not have a 
history of external aggression or interference. A unified Korea would still be 
in no position to seek dominance in Asia. Also, having long endured the 
consequences of superpower machinations, Korea would have a genuine interest in 
seeing a stable arrangement worked out that will balance the interests of the 
big as well as the smaller states in the region. Finally, though it will be in 
no position to have hegemonic ambitions, a unified Korea will not be an 
insignificant regional power. With a combined population of 64 million, 
enhanced economic and political power and cultural affinity with most of the 
actors in the region, Korea's voice would be respected but not feared. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Korea, divided as a result of confrontation between the major 
powers, cannot be united without mutual cooperation. In turn, this Korean state 
will be in a unique position and have a vital interest in ensuring that the 
momentum created by unification leads to a broader effort toward the creation 
of a regional, multilateral framework. 
</P>
<P>
Such a future is possible but not inevitable. Several developments could 
undermine it. A resumption of hostile conflict between the two Koreas would end 
all prospects for unification. Another negative outcome could result from the 
superpowers' attempt to use the reunification process for short-term gains. For 
instance, if Moscow sought to use Korea as a lever against Japan, or if the 
United States sought to prolong division in order to retain the basis for its 
military presence in the region, then neither unification nor a regionwide 
framework is likely. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum the major powers must recognize and work to prevent the outbreak 
of armed hostilities on the peninsula. Even more important, they must not 
perceive the end of division in Korea as merely the removal of one hot spot 
among many in the world. They must see Korea's unification as a key to opening 
the way to the creation of a new order in East Asia.

POLICE LINK TO MISSING WOMAN IS INVESTIGATED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HOMICIDE TASK FORCE HAS SEARCHED THE PROPERTY OF A SERGEANT, SEEKING 
CLUES TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A PROSTITUTE AND FRIEND OF DONNA GENTILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force is investigating the relationship between 
San Diego police officers and a prostitute who disappeared four years ago, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Schons, a deputy state attorney general and task force member, confirmed 
Monday that the disappearance of Cynthia Maine has been included as part of a 
broad investigation of the murders of 43 women, mostly prostitutes, over a 
five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, task force investigators searched the home, desk, car and locker of 
a San Diego police sergeant, looking for photographs tying Maine to several 
police officers and to slain prostitute Donna Gentile, according to a source 
familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The source told The Times that Maine, the daughter of former San Diego Police 
Officer Kenneth Maine, was a close friend of Gentile, whose death in 1985 was 
the first prostitute murder in the series. 
</P>
<P>
The homicide task force, composed of investigators from the San Diego County 
district attorney's office, the San Diego Police Department, the county 
Sheriff's Department and the state attorney general's office, has been 
investigating whether San Diego police officers killed Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference early this month, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis, the 
task force spokeswoman, said the attorney general's office would be looking at 
police misconduct based on information that "more than one officer was involved 
with Donna Gentile." 
</P>
<P>
Just before she was killed, Gentile testified against two officers, one of whom 
was fired and the other demoted. Four months before her death, she predicted in 
a tape-recorded conversation that she might be harmed by "someone in uniform 
with a badge." 
</P>
<P>
Schons and other task force officials refused to comment on any details of the 
investigation of Maine's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Maine was the daughter of Kenneth Maine, who served on the force from 1967 to 
1973. Kenneth Maine, who has since died, was sentenced to 18 months in federal 
prison and fined $5,000 in 1979 for his role in the scandal of a financial 
company operated by San Diego financier Joseph Bello. 
</P>
<P>
Maine was indicted on 35 counts that charged he and Bello with bilking 1,200 
investors out of about $20 million through MB Financial, an allegedly phony 
insurance investment scheme. Bello was sentenced to seven years in federal 
prison, but served only about 40 months before he was released. 
</P>
<P>
The homicide task force is split into three areas: One branch is focusing 
solely on Gentile; another is investigating the other 42 murders; the third is 
looking at possible police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Gentile's death long has bothered top police officials, particularly Chief Bob 
Burgreen, who detached Norm Stamper, his second in command, to personally 
supervise the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no slaying in this city that has bothered me more than the murder of 
Donna Gentile," Burgreen said in a June interview with The Times. "And, if 
indeed a police officer was involved in murder, I want him arrested and I want 
him put behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
Gentile's nude and battered body was discovered east of Sunrise Highway in East 
County, her mouth stuffed with gravel, which some investigators interpreted to 
mean she had been killed in retaliation for her testimony at a police civil 
service hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Maine disappeared in 1986. A source said the task force has been 
investigating her disappearance "for about a year." 
</P>
<P>
But the source said investigators just last week searched a police sergeant's 
home for evidence linking Maine to several officers. 
</P>
<P>
Four months before Gentile's death, Gentile tape-recorded a message while 
sitting in the Las Colinas women's jail, where she was taken after being 
convicted of soliciting for prostitution. When her body was found and 
identified, her attorney released the tape to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"In case I disappear, I want my lawyer to give this to the press," she said on 
the tape. "I have no intention of disappearing or going out of town without 
letting my lawyer know first. Because of the publicity that I have given a 
police scandal, this is the reason why I'm making this. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I feel someone in a uniform with a badge can still be a serious criminal." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in June that police officers were expecting criminal 
prosecutions against the department. One source said he was told to expect 
"some indictments soon against some rather high-ranking San Diego police 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Richard A. Serrano contributed to this report.

RADKE SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending but still not resolving a puzzling case, a San Diego Superior Court 
judge sentenced Mark Alan Radke on Monday to the maximum term possible -- 25 
years to life in prison -- for the brutal 1988 killing of Mira Mesa teen-ager 
Jeffrey Rudiger. 
</P>
<P>
Judge J. Richard Haden said that nothing less than the maximum would do for 
Radke, convicted in August of first-degree murder in the death of Rudiger, 
because of the "unspeakable brutality of the crime." Radke -- who was married 
Saturday -- will be eligible for parole in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rudiger, a junior at Mira Mesa High School, disappeared after work on the night 
of Jan. 21, 1988. His beaten body was found the next day in a Scripps Ranch 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
But Haden, as well as the lawyers in the case, said that even the harsh term 
did not fully close the case because it still is not known whether Radke -- or 
a mystery accomplice -- wielded the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was firmly convinced Radke was guilty of murder. But he said, 
"No one except Mr. Radke knows what happened that night." 
</P>
<P>
Radke, however, did not speak a word at the sentencing hearing. He did not 
testify in his behalf at the trial. And he did not talk about the crime when he 
was interviewed by probation officers recommending sentencing options to Haden, 
defense lawyer Douglas C. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
If Radke had spoken Monday before Haden, his comments would have been "more 
academic than practical," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said later Monday that he already had filed an appeal and was hopeful 
"more facts will come out that will prove (Radke) was not the killer." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Rudiger's sister, Kelly, 23, who has served as a spokeswoman for the 
Rudiger family and who has become an ardent advocate for victims' rights, said 
after the sentencing that she "felt a little bit of relief." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that she wanted Haden to "share the true meaning and feeling of 
victimization," Kelly Rudiger had urged the judge to impose the maximum term. 
She told him at the hearing that his decision "will never bring Jeffrey back to 
us, but a full life term sentence to the individual who stole Jeffrey from us 
will at least restore our faith in the law." 
</P>
<P>
Radke's mother, Virginia Radke, said she remains convinced that her son is 
innocent. His father, Elmer Radke, said prosecutors had "conned the jury into 
thinking there were two or more people. Why aren't they out looking for the 
other people?" 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Radke on Aug. 14 of first-degree murder. But it could not 
decide a second count that alleged Radke used a deadly weapon in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel G. Lamborn has said the jury's indecision meant at 
least some jurors believed a second person may have hit Rudiger repeatedly with 
the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Ray Sievers, 51, of Poway, attended the sentencing hearing and said the 
jury deadlocked, 10-2 for conviction, on the second count. "I don't know if any 
of us were sure there was more than one person," Sievers said. "But (Radke) was 
definitely one." 
</P>
<P>
Lamborn said Monday that if police had "some leads as to some second person, 
we'd pursue it. Our only hope is that some day (Radke) will come forward with 
information." 
</P>
<P>
Although the beginning of the case was delayed for months with legal 
maneuvering over whether most of the evidence was legally obtained, prosecutors 
first mentioned the possibility of an accomplice when the trial began last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Rudiger was found dressed only in underwear and a T-shirt. He was wearing 
handcuffs, had been bludgeoned on the head with a blunt object and had cuts on 
his body. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said at the trial that it appeared Rudiger was hit 26 times with a tire 
iron or similar object. 
</P>
<P>
Radke, now 24, was arrested after Rudiger's friends told police that he and 
Radke were working together on a secret project. Radke and Rudiger had worked 
together at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Scripps Ranch, near where Rudiger's 
body was found. 
</P>
<P>
Before the case made it to trial, it generated three separate appeals over 
whether police had acted properly in detaining Radke for questioning after a 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a state appellate court ruled that police were overzealous and 
had violated Radke's constitutional rights by placing him in handcuffs and 
drawing a revolver. That decision appeared to make virtually all evidence in 
the case off-limits to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
But in September, 1989, San Diego Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes ruled that 
officers had probable cause -- or a "strong suspicion" -- to arrest Radke 
before they ever saw him. A state appellate court upheld that ruling in 
January, meaning all the evidence that officers later found was obtained 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
Blood spots that matched Rudiger's blood type were found in Radke's car trunk, 
in the wheel wells of his recently cleaned car and on his jacket, Lamborn said 
at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lamborn also said blood spattering indicated one person held Rudiger's legs 
while another held his head. He said that Rudiger's body had been dragged twice 
-- once a distance of 70 to 80 feet -- by two people. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutor also said a motive remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony at the trial, Rudiger told friends that he had received 
wine coolers for taking part in the first part of the purported project. But in 
an interview with police that was taped and played at the trial, Radke said he 
knew nothing about a "project" or "mission." 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing hearing concluded, Brown disclosed that Radke had married 
Lee Wilson, a longtime family friend, on Saturday. "I guess they're just in 
love and that was the time they could do it, while he was still here," Brown 
said.

POLICE ARREST 'PASSBOOK BANDIT' SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of being the "passbook bandit" who robbed 23 area banks this 
summer was arrested Monday by the FBI and San Diego police after he allegedly 
robbed another bank earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Christopher Mejia, 39, was being held in the federal Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in connection with the robbery spree that began Aug. 7, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mejia has been charged with the Sept. 4 robbery of a Union Bank branch in 
National City and is a "very prime suspect" in the other robberies, said Joseph 
C. Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI office in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After Mejia's photograph appeared in a local paper, the FBI and police received 
tips from the public that led them to target Mejia as a suspect in early 
September, said FBI Agent Jack Kelly, coordinator of the bureau's bank robbery 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
A federal warrant was issued Sept. 18 for Mejia's arrest, but authorities did 
not track him down until 11:30 a.m. Monday, about an hour after the Great 
American Bank at 5565 Lake Murray Blvd. in San Diego was robbed of an 
undetermined amount of cash, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mejia, a Phoenix, Ariz., native who was living as a transient in San Diego, was 
not armed when he was arrested as he drove near 28th and Market streets, 
Johnson said. He has no convictions for bank robbery, Kelly said. He was to be 
arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The passbook bandit, so called because his demand notes for money were always 
handed to tellers inside a bank passbook, stole nearly $30,000 from banks and 
savings and loan institutions, making him the third most prolific bank robber 
in San Diego in the past two decades, Kelly said. Greg Pearson, who was 
convicted of robbing 27 banks in 1987, and David Kelley, sent to federal prison 
for robbing 24 banks in 1988, hold the local record for most banks robbed, 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The passbook bandit used notes to tell the tellers he was armed, and a handgun 
was seen three times during the robberies, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the investigation is continuing.

OCEANSIDE WOMAN KILLED IN CHAIN-REACTION CRASH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving car attempting to avoid stopped traffic along Interstate 5 near 
the U.S. immigration checkpoint at San Onofre rammed into the rear of another 
car early Monday, triggering a chain-reaction crash that left one person dead, 
two injured and northbound traffic backed up for several miles, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Jane Meyer, 22, of Oceanside died after the collision. She was on her 
way to work when her car was hit from behind at 6:40 a.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's vehicle was rear-ended by a sports car driven by Gregory Morgan, a 
Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton, according to Officer Allen Wilkerson, 
spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
No charges had been filed late Monday. The CHP was continuing its 
investigation. Meyer's and Morgan's cars were totaled. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson would not estimate the speed of Morgan's car at the time of the crash 
but said it was traveling at a "high rate of speed." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan suffered minor injuries and was taken to Camp Pendleton Naval Hospital, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 1 mile south of the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint, 
which was in operation at the time, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer was declared dead at the scene at 7:31 a.m., the medical examiner's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CHP account, Morgan was driving his car in the right-hand lane 
when he came upon stopped traffic awaiting inspection at the immigration 
checkpoint, which is situated along northbound I-5 north of Oceanside. Morgan's 
vehicle swerved into the left lane, the CHP said, eventually crashing into the 
rear of the car driven by Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's car was pushed forward into a third vehicle and stopped after colliding 
with the cable barrier in the center median, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Holts, 46, of Oceanside, a passenger in the third vehicle, was taken 
to Good Samaritan Hospital in San Clemente for observation with slight 
injuries, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
After rear-ending Meyer's car, Morgan's vehicle swerved back to the right lane, 
where it struck a tractor-trailer before stopping. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was backed up for several miles miles along the northbound lanes of 
I-5, south of the checkpoint, delaying the heavy rush-hour traffic headed for 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
All northbound traffic was stopped for at least 10 minutes as a Life Flight 
helicopter landed on the northbound lanes of the freeway.

others injured. Motorists, left, gather on the median following the collision.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido man convicted of conspiring to import exotic birds protected under 
U.S. law was sentenced Monday to almost two years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Keith Daye, 41, who owns a pet store in Long Beach, also was ordered to 
pay $12,000 to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service as restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Daye's 21-month term was suggested by Assistant U.S. Atty. Cynthia Millsaps. 
His attorney, Michael McCabe, urged a lesser sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Daye could have received five years in prison for his guilty plea entered Feb. 
15 to the felony charge and a $250,000 fine, said Millsaps. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving allowed Daye to remain free on a 
$250,000 personal surety bond until Nov. 19, when he is to begin his term. 
</P>
<P>
Daye's wife, Jane Daye, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation on Feb. 16 of 
aiding and abetting transportation of protected wildlife into this country. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Daye has been placed on one year probation, with no jail or fine imposed 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were among 10 others indicted by a federal grand jury on May 31, 
1989, on charges they participated in an international smuggling ring to bring 
exotic parrots and rare birds into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Millsaps said most of the other co-defendants, who lived out of state, had 
already been sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
The birds involved in this case included black palm cockatoos, worth as much as 
$10,000 each and hyacinth macaws, valued at $8,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The method the smugglers used kept the birds from being examined or going 
through the Department of Agriculture's quarantine process. Various diseases, 
such as Newscastle disease, carried by uninspected birds often kill other 
birds.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
IN SEARCH OF THE STEALTH SENATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where was Wadie? That's the question 40th District voters should be asking 
themselves about state Sen. Deddeh's attendance record during the past 
legislative session -- and the final, crucial week in particular. 
</P>
<P>
A computer analysis shows that Deddeh (D-Bonita) missed 43% of the Senate's 
votes, an absentee rate surpassed only by a Los Angeles senator hospitalized 
for alcoholism and a heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly disturbing, however, was Deddeh's decision to miss the last, 
hectic week of the session, when landmark oil-spill legislation was passed, 
$3.6 billion in bonds were put on the November ballot and a bill requiring 
earthquake insurance for state homeowners was finalized. Deddeh spent the week 
at home, entertaining relatives in the days before his only son's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Then he compounded that misjudgment with this remark to a Times reporter: "The 
bills that were before us -- nothing was crucial, nothing was important," 
Deddeh said. "As far as I was concerned, if those bills were not passed at all, 
the state would probably be better off for it." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh is dead wrong in that assessment. His statement that he was ready to fly 
to Sacramento on a moment's notice, if needed to break a deadlock, is proof. 
Moreover, South Bay and San Diego voters didn't elect the 24-year incumbent to 
stay home as the Legislature cast more than 800 end-of-session votes. He should 
have been in Sacramento attending to statewide and local issues. 
</P>
<P>
The computer tally of Deddeh's votes somewhat exaggerates his absences. For 
example, it makes no allowances for conflicting committee meetings that force 
legislators to miss some votes. But Deddeh's 43% absence rate is almost three 
times the Senate average. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his colleagues in the San Diego delegation achieved considerably better 
attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
As Deddeh goes through a reelection campaign this fall, he should explain his 
actions to constituents casting their votes this November.

CITIES MISUSE CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is interesting to see that the release of preliminary census figures brings 
protests from communities that profit by having higher numbers. It is much like 
a political rally in which police estimate crowd size at 20,000 while the 
candidate claims 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a population in excess of 240 million, it does not seem possible to count 
every individual. As a temporary census employee, I can attest that great 
effort was expended to get an accurate count. 
</P>
<P>
However, a certain percentage of forms were not returned. Another segment 
showed a lack of understanding of the questions, while a third group felt that 
even the short form was too intrusive and returned the forms with "none of your 
business" scrawled across them. Workers made follow-up efforts, but not every 
effort was successful. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the count of homeless was inaccurate, but which community should be 
credited with the ones who were identified? With police and community leaders 
driving them from Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and other areas, do those communities 
now claim the numbers for fiscal reasons? Costa Mesa most notably has tried to 
prevent this group from seeking employment or even receiving help from private 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, do these same communities ask for a count of those people in order 
to receive more funding? Perhaps their purpose is to use the funding for more 
police to harass these underclasses of society.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SMOKE GETS IN THEIR EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's mounting evidence that smoke inhaled from others' smoking is a serious 
health hazard. And there's no doubt we would all be better off if no one 
smoked. But some people persist. That's why most work sites now designate areas 
for smokers well away from nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
But a new anti-smoking policy supported by a majority of the board members of 
Ocean View School District in Huntington Beach -- similar to one adopted by the 
Los Angeles Unified School District -- is unenforceable and may inadvertently 
send the wrong message to students. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren, of course, have long been prohibited from smoking on campus. 
Most schools have designated smoking areas for staff, usually well away from 
students. Ocean View's new policy would ban smoking for staff and visitors on 
all district property. 
</P>
<P>
At school, where young opinions are formed, the symbolism of an act is nearly 
as important as the act itself. No doubt the board doesn't want to sanction 
smoking by providing adult role models for students to copy. 
</P>
<P>
But what message will children get when a rule is repeatedly broken? Or what 
about the teacher who takes a smoking break just outside of a school fence -- 
perhaps in full view of the children? Can the school district force everyone in 
its environs to quit smoking simply by fiat? Or will it simply force them to 
sneak around to do it? 
</P>
<P>
The district's intent is honorable: Smoking must be discouraged and nonsmokers 
must be protected from inhaling others' smoke. That's a good argument for 
banning smoking in enclosed public spaces and setting up designated smoking 
areas. But, if it wants to adopt a strict no-smoking policy, Ocean View would 
do better to follow the example of Fountain Valley School District -- forbid 
smoking in school buildings but allow it in outdoor areas outside the view of 
students. 
</P>
<P>
School districts shouldn't mandate inflexible rules that are bound to be 
broken. That sets a bad example for children.

All in the Family: "Roots" author Alex Haley was the guest of honor during the 
weekend at the first Black Family Reunion staged in his hometown of Memphis, 
Tenn. Attended by an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people, the celebration ended 
Sunday with services at area churches. "This reunion celebration feels to me 
like a great big church supper," Haley said. "We don't know each other as well

Lighten Up: Baltimore contractor Donald E. Keister, 30, is white but he wants 
some of the city contracts set aside for minorities. While city officials grant 
that Keister certainly is in the minority, they have rejected his demands. At 
his 640-pound weight, the contractor maintains he is a minority of one but 
officials say the preference law was to help women and members of races who

The Dark Side: Actress Marriette Hartley's autobiography belies her sunny 
image. In the book, Hartley, 50, talks about her father's suicide, her own 
suicide attempt at 15, her days as a battered wife and her own alcoholism. 
Hartley was 23 when her father killed himself, but she and her mother 
"pretended that nothing had happened." Years of drinking and binge-eating 
followed. "I'd drunkenly squat in front of an open refrigerator, an open 
cupboard, drinking vodka and eating everything, including Purina Cat Chow," she 
writes. After psychotherapy and support groups, Hartley says she's able to face 
her problems, although "when I talk about the past, my knees shake."

Expert Witness: Clarence Brandley, who says he's proof of the power of prayer, 
made his preaching debut Sunday night at his family's Baptist church in 
Houston. Brandley, 38, was released from death row after nine years Jan. 23 
when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed his 1980 murder conviction. 
Brandley preached from Acts 12:5: "So Peter was kept in prison but earnest 
prayer for him was made to God by the church."

A dozen buildings, including the gas station where the soldier was stoned to 
death, were destroyed before a Supreme Court restraining order halted 
demolition, Arab reports and U.N. officials said. Farayeh Abu Meddin, chairman

BYE, BYE LOVE: RAMS CAN USE THE WEEK OFF BEFORE BENGALS; 
</P>
<P>
DEAR NFL SCHEDULE MAKER: THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOUR FRIEND, JOHN ROBINSON 
</P>

After three frustrating weeks, the Rams are very pleased to be able to avoid 
playing a game for almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other seasons, the Rams probably would have thought a bye this early to be an 
inconsiderate interference with momentum, an unnecessary hindrance on the road 
to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with players still recovering from long holdouts or injuries, and 
with the team looking it, the bye in the fourth week of the season looks as 
sweet as a candy cane at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
So Monday, as he picked through the rubble of Sunday's 27-21 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles, Coach John Robinson found his greatest solace in the 
knowledge that his 1-2 team absolutely has no chance of losing next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to deal with the problems we have, and an extra week to deal 
with them, I think, is certainly good for us," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray, who missed the first three games with a knee 
injury, is eligible and expected to leave the injured-reserve list for the 
Rams' next game, Oct. 7 against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
And tailback Cleveland Gary, who missed most of the exhibition season with a 
back injury and has carried the ball only 12 times this year, could use this 
extra week of practice to grab the starting job, as the Rams have been hoping 
he would. 
</P>
<P>
"You want the pain to go away," Robinson said, acknowledging it is the natural 
reaction after a loss to want to play again right away. "I mean, you're in 
pain, you're hurt. It's just not fun. You're anxious to rid yourself of the 
pain, to get back out and prove yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"But the problems that we have are problems that must be dealt with in a 
specific manner on the practice field." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were beaten up by the previously winless Eagles Sunday, bullied 
physically on offense and bedazzled on defense by Eagle quarterback Randall 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' once-proud ground attack gained a measly 35 yards in 15 carries, and 
the defense that last year befuddled the Eagles in the wild-card game 
surrendered 405 yards this time. 
</P>
<P>
"When the schedule came out, I didn't like that the bye was so early," tackle 
Jackie Slater said. "But now I think it's coming at a perfect time. This is 
probably what we need." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Robinson why his defense, which gave up 25 first downs Sunday, should 
be any better in two weeks, and he rattles off the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"If you start at one outside linebacker, Kevin Greene has just been here for 
(slightly more than two weeks after a holdout)," Robinson said. "We got one 
defensive end, Doug Reed, who's just been here two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The nose man (Alvin Wright) missed most of training camp (because of a minor 
injury). . . . (Fred Strickland) missed most of training camp (with an injury). 
The three young defensive linemen (Brian Smith, Bill Hawkins and Mike Piel) are 
all playing hurt, (safety Michael) Stewart has missed all of training camp 
(after holding out). (Cornerback) Mickey Sutton wasn't here until last week 
(when he was picked up on waivers). 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Gray is out of action and not playing. (Cornerback) Darryl Henley is out 
of action and not playing. (Inside linebacker) Larry Kelm is out of action and 
not playing (because of a knee injury). 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the reasons. Those things all indicate to me that these people can 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the Rams hope that a healthy, practice-tested Gary can energize a 
running attack that has been nothing to fear so far. Neither Curt Warner nor 
Gaston Green has been able to gain big yardage.

CHANG STORMS BACK, BRINGS DAVIS CUP FINALS TO THE U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: TRAILING TWO SETS TO ONE WHEN PLAY WAS POSTPONED, HE USES BROTHERLY 
ADVICE TO DOMINATE AUSTRIAN.

The Danube is blue again. The city of Freud is depressed. In a 94-minute 
Requiem with Stringed Instrument that was worthy of Mozart, American Michael 
Chang destroyed the hopes of Austria with a come-from-behind triumph over Horst 
Skoff to carry the United States into its first Davis Cup final since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing two sets to one when play was called because of darkness Sunday, 
Chang returned Monday to sweep aside the hard-hitting Austrian in the remaining 
two sets, 3-6, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, coming on the heels of teammate Andre Agassi's loss in straight 
sets Sunday to Austrian star Thomas Muster, gave the Americans a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant on Sunday with a strong forehand, Skoff had few opportunities Monday 
despite the backing of a crowd of 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a different Michael Chang and a different Horst Skoff out there today," 
said Tom Gorman, savoring his first chance to appear in the Davis Cup final 
since he became captain of the U.S. team five years ago. "I feel terrific. I 
feel fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who said he telephoned his brother in California for advice before play 
resumed Monday, confused Skoff with an accurate kick-serve to the Austrian's 
backhand. 
</P>
<P>
Resurrecting the tactic he used against Ivan Lendl to pull off a stunning 
come-from-behind victory in the fourth round of the 1989 French Open, Chang 
moved close to the service line to intimidate his opponent and jumped on 
Skoff's second serve for several winners. He also directed a relentless attack 
against Skoff's weak backhand, drilling winners down the line when the Austrian 
attempted to run around the ball to hit forehands. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, all four Americans played a role in the U.S. victory. Agassi and 
Chang beat Skoff in singles matches. Doubles specialists Jim Pugh and Rick 
Leach beat the Austrian team of Muster and Alex Antonitsch. 
</P>
<P>
In the final, the United States will play host to Australia at St. Petersburg, 
Fla., Nov. 30-Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's victory enhanced Chang's reputation as a tough player to beat in 
matches that go five sets. The 18-year-old has won the last seven five-setters 
he has played, including that 1989 match against Lendl when Chang had to 
overcome cramps late in the match. Chang's last loss in five sets was in the 
1987 U.S. Open against Nduka Odizor of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
But one point before he finished off Skoff with a crisp cross-court service 
return for a winner, Chang suffered leg cramps, more from the tension than from 
the court-side temperature of 58 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Had the match gone on, even for one more game, Chang said he was not sure he 
could have finished. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been difficult to go on because of the intensity of the crowd 
and the cold," he said. "I started to tighten up a lot . . . If I had lost that 
game I don't know what would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Chang said a call to his brother, Carl, early Monday morning helped him devise 
an effective strategy against Skoff. 
</P>
<P>
"He talked to me about when I was losing points, when I was getting in 
trouble," Chang said. "I applied it today and it worked well." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to compare his victory here to the one two years ago against Lendl in 
Paris, Chang smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually when you win a match that dramatic, usually the crowd roars. Here you 
win the match and everybody is quiet. I was a little awed." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, normally reticent Viennese stopped Americans on the street 
to predict an Austrian triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see that Austria is not just a little point on the map," said travel 
agent Karl Horna, 27, in one such encounter. "It is a big tennis country." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps feeling the weight of these failed national ambitions, particularly 
after teammate and rival Muster had won both his singles matches, Skoff was 
subdued when he talked to reporters after his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael beat me in the most important match in my tennis life," he said. "I 
have lost not only for me. I've lost for Austria."

JIM MURRAY: PUNCHING HOLES IN NO-ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Open letter to NFL coaches: 
</P>
<P>
Dear Sirs, 
</P>
<P>
Stop me if you've heard this. Don't say, "Uh-oh, here he comes again with his 
dumb recommendations." But will you do me a favor? Will you take that nickel or 
dime defense you put so much faith in, bag it, and drop it in the Los Angeles 
River? And hold it under till it's gone? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, I know. I can hear you sighing right now and see you looking at me 
pityingly. I've seen that look, the one that says, "Look, creep, why don't you 
stick to adverbs and adjectives? You just don't understand football." 
</P>
<P>
What's to understand? You don't have to be a Phi Beta Kappa to add up 
touchdowns. That "soft zone" is going to put Joe Montana in the Hall of Fame. 
Also, probably, John Elway and Phil Simms. Oh, I know. Coaches from George 
Allen to John Robinson have been enamored of that five-and-10-cent store 
defense. You know, the one where you peel back as many as seven or nine 
defenders on pass plays, the theory being that no one can complete a pass 
through that forest of defenders. The Maginot Line theory. 
</P>
<P>
I know you say the public doesn't get the whole picture. 
</P>
<P>
But I see, game after game, where your method doesn't work. It kind of reminds 
me of some years ago when a colleague of mine was covering the missile beat for 
a national magazine. It was before Star Wars but it was when the government was 
trying to perfect an antiballistic-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
"What are its chances?" I asked my co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
He sighed. "Well," he said, "think of it as you in a pitch-dark hallway and 
someone is throwing needles at you and you have to throw needles back at them 
that will meet those needles head-on in midair and knock them down." 
</P>
<P>
Forgive me, but I have to think that's what you guys are trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Ram game Sunday. Before the game, the coach said he was going to try 
to neutralize the Philadelphia quarterback, Randall Cunningham, with a soft 
zone. English translation: no rush. 
</P>
<P>
Well, personally, I couldn't look. I happen to think the soft zone should be 
called the twilight zone. You remember what happened. With 1:50 to play in the 
first half, the Philadelphia quarterback got the ball on his own 32 and went 
through the Ram soft zone like a knife through hot butter. In fact, there were 
still 34 seconds to play after the Eagles had scored. 
</P>
<P>
It happens all the time. It happens too often to be coincidence. It is an 
absolute indictment of the "prevent" or "nickel" defense. The so-called 
"two-minute offense" is really the two-minute defense. It requires the absolute 
cooperation of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Recall with me the night the New Orleans Saints had rushed the pants off the 
49ers' Joe Montana for 58 minutes 10 seconds. Suddenly, with 1:50 to go and 
Montana with the ball in his own territory, they changed strategy. I remember 
thinking at the time, "Oh, my God, they've peeled back! Montana will kill 
them!" 
</P>
<P>
He did. All Montana needed was a field goal. Duck soup for him. He just stood 
there, licking his lips. In about three plays he was in field goal range, and 
the 49ers won. 
</P>
<P>
I get cynical watching two teams struggle manfully all night to put nine points 
or so on the board and then, all of a sudden, scores are flying around like 
popcorn in the final two minutes. There has to be a reason. The quarterback 
didn't suddenly get better with two minutes to go. The defense just got worse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to everything else, the nickel-dime defense makes it easier to run 
on. Recall Cunningham in that drive before the half Sunday, looking over the 
line of scrimmage, seeing no one open but nobody but the pathetic pass rush in 
front of him. And he took off and ran 27 yards before backpedaling defenders 
could put on the brakes and come up and get him. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's Law is, a quarterback without a limp can help himself to 10 or 15 
yards in an obvious passing situation any time he wants. 
</P>
<P>
I can recall the late Red Sanders, as good a coach as I have ever known, on the 
subject of pass defense. "No quarterback can throw the ball successfully flat 
on his back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' tactic was no soft zone but rather a hard rush he used to call Omaha 
-- a whole line coming in like cops raiding a crap game. It worked. Ask John 
Brodie, who was with Stanford at the time. John still has grass stains on his 
backside from that one. 
</P>
<P>
I remember John Unitas once telling me he figured he had 3.5 seconds to get rid 
of the ball on a pass play. That was in those days. They had a pass rush in 
those days. I recall Dutch Van Brocklin when he was coach of the Vikings, after 
a trying afternoon trying to cope with the Rams' front four. Dutch came into 
the locker room, muttering darkly, "They better never lose that pass rush." 
</P>
<P>
They don't have pass rushes today. They just kind of send a token force. No 
more Fearsome Foursomes. They're Tentative Threesomes today. Quarterbacks get 
five, 10, 15 seconds to throw today. You give John Elway or Joe Montana -- or 
even Randall Cunningham -- 10 seconds and he'll throw it through a keyhole for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
As I say, I don't know whether I should bother to wise you guys up. Football 
games are a lot more fun and excitement this way. A touchdown lead with a 
minute to play doesn't mean a thing. 
</P>
<P>
I realize I have a lot of chutzpah trying to tell professionals how to run 
their business. I just feel it's my civic duty. You're right, I don't know how 
a zone defense works. All I know is, it doesn't.

PARRISH'S HOME RUN BEATS RYAN

Lance Parrish said the best thing about batting against Nolan Ryan on Monday 
night was seeing a lot of fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
Those fastballs accounted for 11 strikeouts, but Parrish got a good look at one 
in the seventh inning and hit a two-run homer that helped the Angels beat Ryan 
and the Texas Rangers, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"If you swing enough times you can catch up to it," Parrish said of Ryan's 
fastball. "I felt like I was on his fastball. I felt sooner or later I'd catch 
up to one. I didn't hit it good, but it got out." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan held the Angels hitless for 5 2/3 innings and lost despite pitching a 
four-hitter. The 43-year-old Ryan (13-8) took over the major league strikeout 
lead with 221 but was beaten by Mark Langston (10-16), who gave up four hits in 
8 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan struck out Brian Downing and Dave Winfield to start the seventh but walked 
Lee Stevens, who stole second before Parrish hit his 22nd home run on a 2-2 
pitch. Ryan has yielded only 12 runs in his last six starts but is 1-1 over 
that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolie was overpowering," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Fortunately, Mark did 
a tremendous job of getting out of a bases-loaded situation (in the fourth) and 
Devon White made a super catch in the fifth (leaping against the wall to pull 
down Ruben Sierra's drive with a man on first). I thought that ball was 10 rows 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, 5-1 in his past eight starts in a season to forget, struck out eight 
and walked seven. He left after Rafael Palmeiro hit his 14th home run with one 
out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey yielded a hit and a walk before nailing down his 24th save and 
66th of his career, a club record. Dave LaRoche held the old mark of 65.

<P>
Coach John Robinson was still livid about an officials' decision that took a 
pass-interference call away from the Rams in the second quarter of their 27-21 
loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
On a third-down play from the 50-yard line, Ram receiver Derrick Faison broke 
past linebacker Seth Joyner over the deep middle of the field, but was bumped 
by free safety Wes Hopkins when the ball came to him. 
</P>
<P>
The official closest to the play threw a flag, but after a conference the 
officials decided that the pass was uncatchable. 
</P>
<P>
"(It) was a big play that was an absolute terrible call by the officials," 
Robinson said. "They called the play, then they decided that they weren't sure 
it was interference, then they decided not to call it. The film clearly 
indicates pass interference." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said kicker Mike Lansford, who suffered a strained lower calf muscle 
in his right leg against Tampa Bay, probably will be 100% for the Rams' next 
game, Oct. 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals. Lansford handled the place-kicking 
duties Sunday, but the Rams signed John Carney last week to kick off. TIM

<P>
The Raiders placed rookie cornerback Garry Lewis on four-week injured reserve 
Monday because of a broken collarbone suffered during Sunday's 20-3 victory 
over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who won the starting job from Terry McDaniel, will be replaced on the 
roster by safety Vann McElroy, whose two-week roster exemption for signing late 
ended Monday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell said McDaniel will replace Lewis at left corner. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said linebacker Aaron Wallace's shoulder bruise is not serious and that 
he will probably play against Chicago Sunday. . . . Shell said he planned to 
play Greg Bell in the second quarter Sunday but changed his mind because the 
Raiders' offense had the ball for only 17 plays in the half. "I was planning on 
using both (Bell and Marcus Allen) in the first half," Shell said. "It didn't 
work out that way, so we started the second half with Greg. Marcus started the 
game." CHRIS DUFRESNE

The Buffalo Bills' Thurman Thomas, running through the kinds of holes tailbacks 
usually only dream of, rushed for 214 yards Monday night in a 30-7 victory over 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' best rushing total as a pro compares to the NFL record of 275 yards by 
Walter Payton in 1977 and the Bill mark of 273 by O.J. Simpson in 1976. Thomas 
averaged nearly 12 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of it as an individual effort," Thomas said. "It truly was team 
play. The offense came out with fire in their eyes, and they just knocked huge 
holes in the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had several big games as an All-American at Oklahoma State, where he 
preceded Barry Sanders as the star running back. This was different. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought in the NFL I would be 20 yards downfield without ever being 
touched, just me and a safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill tackle Howard Ballard: "We didn't really expect it to be that easy. 
We just blew them out." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (2-1) wanted to show they are not the same bickering outfit that 
struggled to win the AFC East championship last year. The Jets (1-2) sought to 
show they are a playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bills who were convincing in moving back into first place in the AFC 
East, where they stood for 33 weeks before a 30-7 loss at Miami last week. 
After that game, star defensive end Bruce Smith was fined for shouting at Coach 
Marv Levy on the sidelines when Levy removed six starters with seven minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jet Coach Bruce Coslet: "No team should really be allowed to manhandle us 
like that. They dominated the line of scrimmage. We have to play very well to 
have a chance against a playoff team like Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
Was it a step backward for the Jets? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably," Coslet said. "But I'm not concerned about the psyche. This is not 
last year's team. We have a lot of confidence. We stubbed our toe." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills took a 20-7 halftime lead after Thomas ran for 146 yards in 10 
carries, two yards short of his career high for a full game, against Miami last 
season. Buffalo had 305 yards and the Jets 87 in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We established just what we wanted to do in the first half," Buffalo 
quarterback Jim Kelly said. "We took it from there." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get any better for New York in the second half. Thomas keyed an 
85-yard, nine-play drive with 56 yards rushing, including a 34-yard burst on a 
quick-opener. Scott Norwood's 27-yard field goal made the score 23-7 and Keith 
McKeller caught a six-yard touchdown pass from Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets had gone 13 consecutive quarters without a touchdown against Buffalo 
before scoring 4:59 into the game on Brad Baxter's one-yard run. Their last 
touchdown against the Bills was scored Oct. 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jet wide receiver Al Toon had two receptions before being sidelined because of 
a bruised back. He has caught a pass in 65 consecutive games.

Even though UCLA lost to Michigan, 38-15, Saturday, quarterback Tommy Maddox 
had some impressive statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The redshirt freshman, starting for the first time, completed 26 of 47 passes 
for 353 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The yardage was the second-highest total in UCLA history, behind Steve Bono's 
399 yards passing against Brigham Young in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA wide receiver Scott Miller, linebacker Rocen Keeton and defensive tackle 
Brian Kelly, all injured, aren't expected to play Saturday against Washington 
State, although there is a possibility that Miller might play. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said that wide receiver Paul Richardson is still 
bothered by an ankle injury. However, strong safety Matt Darby, who missed the 
Michigan game with a shoulder injury, and nose guard Garrett Greedy, who has 
also been injured, are expected to play. MAL FLORENCE

A former Tiger Stadium locker-room attendant struck out with a scheme to sell 
Dave Winfield's bats, Lance Parrish's jerseys and other baseball items as 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Cox, 17, was arraigned in 36th District Court in Detroit on a larceny 
charge after being apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme came to light when Parrish asked for his backup jersey Aug. 22 
during a game between the Tigers and the Angels. When the Angels' equipment 
manager went to the locker room to get it, he found that Parrish's and 
Winfield's equipment bags had been raided, court documents said.

POELLOT HAS INSIDE ON JAPANESE EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent purchase of the Pebble Beach golf courses and other Monterey 
Peninsula properties, for between $800 million and $1 billion, is the latest in 
a string of acquisitions of California golfing facilities by Japanese 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as no surprise to J. Michael Poellot. 
</P>
<P>
A golf course architect who has been designing and building courses in Japan 
for 20 years, Poellot is in a unique position to reflect on what led to the 
Japanese influx in California golf. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions are considerable. The Monterey purchase includes the Spyglass 
Hill, Spanish Bay and Del Monte courses as well as the famed Pebble Beach Golf 
Links and the 17-Mile Drive. That follows purchases of Riviera, the crown jewel 
of Southern California courses; La Costa, one of the world's premier resort 
courses; Valencia, a renowned public course that was turned private; Sierra La 
Verne, a refreshing San Gabriel Valley facility that also became private, and 
perhaps 15 others during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Poellot has seen firsthand the growth of the sport in Japan, watching it become 
a national passion that has prompted the wealthy to expand their golfing 
horizons to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"To better understand the reasons behind the Japanese influx here, you need to 
know more about what it is like over there," says Poellot, who is from 
Saratoga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, to build a course in Japan, where what little available land is 
mountainous and ill-suited for anything else, the costs range upward of $50 
million, to as high as $250 million, just for course construction. That does 
not include the clubhouse. Expenses are 10 times what they are here. 
</P>
<P>
"Courses in Japan are 99% private, and memberships cost from $500,000 to $2.5 
million. A round of golf on a public course, if you can get a starting time, is 
$200 to $300. Driving ranges are as busy as a municipal course in Los Angeles 
is on a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"So, what Californians perceive to be outlandish prices paid by Japanese to 
obtain courses here are considered bargains in Japan. Riviera, for instance, 
went for a little more than $108 million, cheap in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The point was emphasized in a recent Golf magazine article in which a member of 
Augusta National, home of the Masters, was quoted as telling a Japanese 
investor that "you couldn't buy Augusta National for $500 million," to which 
the would-be purchaser said the price was acceptable. However, like the 
reported $300-million bid for the Bel-Air Country Club, it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Another consideration, says Poellot, is ego. 
</P>
<P>
"The passion for golf over there is so intense it is hard to explain, and there 
can be no higher status symbol for a business executive than to have a portrait 
-- not of his family or the founding father of the business -- but of Riviera 
Country Club hanging over his desk. Wealthy Europeans may lean toward 
Rembrandts or Van Goghs. The Japanese lean toward prestige golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
"And, the bottom line is that they have so much money to spend buying golf 
courses that they are like kids in a candy store with a fistful of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Poellot, a graduate of the Robert Trent Jones Jr. school of golf architecture, 
has returned home to design courses in this country. One, approaching the 
production stage, will be located in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past decade or so, American golf architecture has been dominated by a 
handful of architects -- (Pete) Dye, (Jack) Nicklaus, (George and Tom) Fazio, 
the Joneses and a few others -- and unfortunately they have ended up competing 
with one another to create the ultimate expression of egos, such as sand traps 
that look like mermaids or the state of Texas, thousands of railroad ties, 
trademarks that have drawn away from the traditional look of a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to more meet the demands of the existing golf population, the vast 
majority of whom are not talented enough for the monster, or tricked-up, 
courses being built by the cult designers." 
</P>
<P>
What Poellot has in mind, perhaps, is something that will eventually be 
purchased by the Japanese for their high handicap golfers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

qualified with a 346-yard drive that won the district finals at Albuquerque, 
N.M., and James won at Tumwater, Wash., with a 348-yard drive. Gorton was 
exempt from qualifying because he was 1987 champion. 
</P>
<P>

A private jet crashed as the pilot attempted to land in a heavy fog Monday 
morning at a municipal airport, killing all four people aboard, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the occupants were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine Cessna Citation, registered to a helicopter company in Newport, 
Ore., had taken off from Van Nuys Airport. It crashed at 7:03 a.m. in a field 
about three miles northwest of the San Luis Obispo Airport, Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the crash, the pilot reported that the craft had passed the 
airport's outer marker and was headed for a landing. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Sgt. Leon Cole said four people were confirmed 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers spent several hours looking for a fifth person originally reported to 
be aboard. It was later determined that the person did not board the plane, 
Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
Wreckage from the Citation, a jet that can carry as many as a dozen people, was 
strewn over a wide area east of Madonna Road. Firefighters put out several spot 
fires that erupted in some parts of the wreckage.

LUNGREN TARGETS MINORITIES WITH NEW TV AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying he will not concede the minority vote, Dan Lungren, Republican candidate 
for state attorney general, Monday began targeting black and Latino voters with 
a message that he intends to deliver in an unusual way: via cable and 
Spanish-language television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, surrounded by 25 Asian, Eastern European, Latino and black 
Californians who have created ethnic coalitions to support his candidacy, 
unveiled an anti-crime ad at a Los Angeles press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're black or Hispanic you're a lot more likely to be the victim of a 
violent crime than the rest of the population -- and the odds aren't so great 
for them either," the narrator of the 30-second spot states. "Dan Lungren has 
done something about the problems of drugs and crime, that's why he's running 
for attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
By using less expensive cable broadcasts and Latino stations rather than major 
commercial television outlets, Lungren not only saves money in his financially 
strapped campaign but can more specifically target voters by directing the 
message to selective communities. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he did not want to divulge his strategy, Lungren refused to disclose 
where and when the ads would air, or the cost of the effort. Lungren's most 
recent financial disclosure indicated that his campaign had $217,000, but he 
has since spent nearly that much buying television time for an earlier ad. 
</P>
<P>
With its message of concern for minority groups, the commercial may counter 
ethnic opposition that first surfaced two years ago when Gov. George Deukmejian 
sought unsuccessfully to appoint Lungren as state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
At hearings that preceded the state Senate's vote to reject Lungren, a 
coalition of ethnic, environmental and women's groups testified against the 
former five-term congressman, citing his staunchly conservative political 
philosophy. The coalition, whose members spoke out on issues such as Lungren's 
opposition to reparations for Japanese-Americans interned during World War II, 
was re-formed last week to fight Lungren's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said Monday that his ad demonstrates that he will not concede the 
minority vote, which traditionally favors Democrats. "Kids can't go in safety 
from their homes to high school . . . or grade school without fear of being 
killed," said Lungren, who helped win passage of several tough anti-crime bills 
while in Congress. "I want to make a difference on crimes and drugs and gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lungren's Democratic rival, 10-year San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo 
Smith, flanked by several deputy attorneys general, sought to draw attention 
Monday to Lungren's lack of prosecutorial experience. Meeting with reporters at 
the offices of a legal placement firm, Smith, who has served 26 years as a 
deputy attorney general, asserted that Lungren, a practicing civil attorney, 
would "barely qualify for an entry level job" in the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren has countered that his experience on the House Judiciary Committee gave 
him significant insight into the problems of the criminal justice system. 
Moreover, he cited Robert F. Kennedy and Deukmejian as two non-prosecutors who 
provided exemplary service as U.S. attorney general and state attorney general, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Chatten-Brown, head of the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
environmental crimes unit, who joined Smith, said that Lungren's congressional 
record shows that he would be "destructive to the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has yet to air a television ad, concluded his "Dan Lungren Career 
Seminar" by hoisting a large red stamp bearing the word "rejected" toward a 
pair of resumes of Lungren and himself. He appeared ready to stamp his own, 
until campaign advisers yelled out frantically to warn him of his impending 
mistake.

CRITICS SAY ANTI-TAX MEASURE IS SHILL FOR LIQUOR TRADE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of public interest groups launched a campaign to defeat Proposition 
136 Monday, claiming the anti-tax measure is a "rum-soaked fraud" perpetrated 
by the alcohol industry to protect it and other special interests from tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The groups said the measure's prime sponsor, Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn., is 
promoting Proposition 136 as an outgrowth of the taxpayer revolts of the late 
1970s. In reality, the opponents said, it is the result of an "unholy alliance" 
between the organization and liquor interests whose purpose is to 
disenfranchise voters. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would do that, they said, by requiring that no special tax 
increases go into effect without approval by two-thirds of the voters, thereby 
giving a minority the chance to overrule wishes of the majority. Special taxes 
are those whose revenues are designated for specific purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The caustic rhetoric came from five public interest groups -- League of Women 
Voters, California League of Cities, Common Cause of California, California 
Parent-Teacher Assn. and California Tax Reform Assn. -- as they opened an 
admittedly under-financed campaign to defeat the measure on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by anti-tax groups and backed by $2 million from alcoholic beverage 
interests, Proposition 136 establishes the two-thirds rule for special taxes 
and mandates that no local taxes can be passed without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
In a new feature of the initiative process, Proposition 136 goes into effect 
almost immediately, meaning if it is approved, the two-thirds rule will apply 
to other measures on the same ballot, including Proposition 134, an initiative 
that would substantially increase taxes on beer, wine and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ballot virus," said Lenny Goldberg, executive director of the 
California Tax Reform Assn. "Proposition 134 is what it takes aim at . . . but 
it could also knock out 133 and 129." Proposition 129 raises taxes to fight 
crime and Proposition 133 raises taxes for drug enforcement and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Fox, president of the Jarvis organization, acknowledged that alcohol 
interests have contributed "big dollars" to the measure in the hope that it 
would nullify Proposition 134, if that initiative gets a majority but not a 
two-thirds vote. He said the industry has never been the driving force behind 
the proposal originally designed to stop local officials from raising any tax 
without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
He said the measure was broadened when anti-tax groups learned several 
initiatives were being circulated that would raise taxes on specific products 
and earmark the revenue for specific programs. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said each election year, beginning in 1988 when tobacco taxes were 
increased by Proposition 99, public interest groups have been trying to raise 
the tax base by "picking off one industry at a time and one group of 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking fairness I would ask them, 'Is it fair for people who don't 
smoke to raise taxes on smokers or people who don't drink to raise taxes on 
drinkers or people who don't read newspapers to raise taxes on newspapers?' " 
Fox said. "We are trying to prevent the earmarking, which is a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Mem Levin of the League of Women Voters said her organization planned a 
"massive alert effort" because it considered the methods Proposition 136 
suggests for eliminating earmarking as "undemocratic and underhanded." 
</P>
<P>
She said the proposal allows "one-third plus one" of the voters to defeat 
wishes of the majority. Under Proposition 136, she said, even if a special tax 
got a substantial vote it could lose if it did not get a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) and League of Cities President Don Beninghoven 
said they were opposing the measure because it would hamstring local 
governments by denying city councils and county boards the few sources for new 
taxes they have left. For example Davis said it would require a two-thirds vote 
on any local sales tax measure to raise more money for jails. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rum-soaked fraud trying to keep Californians from operating their 
governments in an effective fashion and it's a selfish, last desperate attempt 
on the part of the booze industry to make millions of dollars of profit and 
evade their responsibility to support government," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said local officials could raise taxes for general purposes as long as they 
got voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that governments see a lot of problems they would like to resolve and 
they are always looking at one side -- how much money they need to (solve) 
these problems," Fox said. "They don't look to the other side -- how much can 
people afford to pay."

POLICE CHIEF HOSPITALIZED AFTER COLLAPSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens collapsed and was rushed to a hospital Sunday 
night after his heart apparently stopped beating, Owens' physician said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, 59, was in serious condition in the Cardiac Care Unit at St. John's 
Regional Medical Center, said Dr. S.N. Charles Cho, who described Owens as 
"comfortable and alert." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Owens was still undergoing tests to determine the exact cause 
of the blackout, but a temporary pacemaker was inserted. Cho said the chief may 
get a permanent pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, who celebrated his 20th anniversary with the Oxnard Police Department in 
February, was "back to his old self and joking," Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens collapsed Sunday night, several hours after he returned from a three-day 
conference in San Diego with his wife, Linda, whom he married only six weeks 
ago, said William Cady, assistant chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to go up and go to bed and he just collapsed," Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
When paramedics arrived at 8:20 p.m., Owens' heart was beating only 20 times 
per minute, compared to the normal 60 to 80 beats per minute, Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
Cho said it appeared that a cold virus that had bothered Owens for the past 
week infected and inflamed his heart muscle, causing it to cease functioning 
correctly. When the heart stopped beating momentarily, Owens collapsed, Cho 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens has a condition that affects the electrical impulses in the heart, Cho 
said. The condition was discovered by a routine electrocardiogram in 1975 but 
has never been a problem, Cho said. He said he did not believe the electrical 
problem and the collapse are related. 
</P>
<P>
Owens should be able to return to part-time duty about a week after he returns 
home, Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens is an athletic man who often plays in racquetball tournaments and is in 
"excellent shape physically," Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the chief's hospitalization came as a surprise in the department. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's a little shocked because he's happy-go-lucky and a real feel-good 
person," Cady said.

$1.3 MILLION IN FEES COLLECTED BY SCHOOLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Unified School District collected more than $1.3 million in fees 
from developers last year, according to a district report made public for the 
first time under a new state law. 
</P>
<P>
The sum included more than $1 million collected for new residential buildings 
in the city, which totaled 880 last year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Fees totaling $107,217 were also paid for additions to existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the fees, more than $133,000, was paid for new commercial 
developments. The district waived fees of $46,154 for several businesses exempt 
under the law. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that developers be charged for new construction in 
high-growth areas to help provide classroom space at local schools. The law was 
amended last year to require school districts and other agencies to report the 
fees annually. 
</P>
<P>
The district receives $1.50 for each square foot of new residential 
construction and 25 cents per square foot of new commercial construction. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fees have been part of the district's budget for several years, 
"this is the first time we've been required to make an actual report to the 
board on it and make it available to the public," said Jean Rudolph, 
administrative assistant for business services. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

COUNCIL CONSIDERS FIRE SPRINKLER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council is scheduled to consider an ordinance today that would 
require installation of automatic fire sprinklers in every new building and in 
every building undergoing major modifications. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, proposed by Fire Chief Richard Smith, has won the support of the 
Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Similar ordinances have been adopted in 37 other cities in California, 
including Napa, Anaheim, Burbank, Glendale and San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance affects commercial and residential buildings. Major modification 
is defined as an addition or alteration that exceeds 60% of the structure's 
replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Maulhardt, spokesman for the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, said that 
members of the chamber are planning to voice support for the ordinance when it 
comes before the council for review. 
</P>
<P>
City law now requires automatic sprinklers only in structures with more than 
5,000 square feet or that are taller than 35 feet. HUGO MARTIN

WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Oxnard today will consider a water conservation ordinance that bans 
water-wasting practices like hosing off driveways and would levy fines or cut 
off water service for repeat violators. 
</P>
<P>
Although Oxnard has a direct waterline from the state water project, city 
officials said the ordinance is proposed to avoid future shortages as the 
drought in Southern California enters its fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would also prohibit watering lawns between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., 
prohibit allowing water to run onto streets and sidewalks, and prohibit serving 
water at restaurants unless requested by a customer. It would ban carwashes 
that do not recycle water, decorative fountains that do not recycle, and broken 
or damaged water fixtures that are not repaired within a reasonable amount of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
After the first offense, city officials will warn violators. A second offense 
within 12 months will result in a fine equal to 25% of the most recent utility 
bill or $25, whichever is higher. A third offense within 12 months will result 
in a fine equal to 50% of the most recent bill or $50, whichever is higher. 
</P>
<P>
If a fourth violation occurs, the city will install a water restriction device 
on the violator's waterline. 
</P>
<P>
The city could cut off water services if a person violates the ordinance more 
than four times within 12 months. HUGO MARTIN

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BUTTONS MAY HELP SAVE RAIN FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A natural button that the U.S. garment industry discarded for plastic ones in 
the 1940s is being re-employed by Patagonia Inc. as part of a campaign to save 
Ecuadorean rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Conservation International, Patagonia will buy an 
estimated 4 million ivory-like buttons a year. 
</P>
<P>
They are made from the fruit of the tagua palm harvested by residents of Comuna 
Rio Santiago in northwestern Ecuador and will be finished in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving money to causes is easy, nothing more than writing a check," Patagonia 
spokesman Kevin Sweeney said. "Changing the nature of the products you use is a 
lot tougher challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia and Smith and Hawken, a Mill Valley garden products and clothing 
manufacturer in Northern California, signed licensing agreements with 
Conservation International, a Washington-based environmental group. Smith and 
Hawken, like Patagonia, donates 10% of its pretax profits to environmental 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
By harvesting the chestnut-like fruit of the tagua palm, villagers living on 
the western slopes of the Andes will be relieved of the economic pressure to 
clear the forests for agriculture, said Mark Plotkin, vice president of 
Conservation International. The group is trying to save a 245,000-acre area in 
Ecuador's Esmeraldas province. 
</P>
<P>
Tagua buttons, which can be dyed or used in their natural off-white color, 
accounted for 20% of the American market before plastic buttons, Plotkin said. 
They are still used on high-fashion garments in Japan and Italy. CHRISTOPHER

2 ROBBERS FOILED TRYING TO OPEN GAS STATION SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley gas station manager was bound and held at gunpoint Monday in a 
robbery attempt that was foiled by an electronic counter safe, a Simi Valley 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Vijaykumar Kardani, manager of the Thrifty station at 2211 Tapo St., said two 
men entered the station's mini-market around 8:30 a.m. while he was doing 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he recalled seeing the pair at the station earlier Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One man asked Kardani where he could find a certain candy bar, then shoved the 
barrel of a handgun into the manager's chest after he came out from behind the 
counter, Kardani said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'I've killed a lot of people, so do you want to live or do you 
want to die?"' Kardani said. "My life was in front of me. I told him to take 
whatever he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Kardani said the gunman bound his hands behind his back with duct tape and put 
him in a bathroom. He kept the gun trained on the manager while his partner 
attempted to open the safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Two customers came in and the other guy must have gotten confused what to do," 
Kardani said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Neal Rein said the thieves took a key from the manager but lacked another 
key needed to open the safe. The men, in their 20s, fled in a late-model, 
light-blue BMW 735i. Customers then freed Kardani and called the police. 
</P>
<P>
"They must have been targeting the safe," Kardani said, "because there was 
about $100 in the cash register they left behind."

TOO LATE FOR PADRES TO PROVE ANYTHING; 
</P>

BASEBALL: AFTER 3-1 LOSS TO GIANTS, OUTFIELDERS LYNN, ABNER AND JACKSON REALIZE 
THEY'RE TOO BANGED UP TO IMPRESS ANYBODY. MAYBE NEXT YEAR.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Lynn was lying in the training room Monday night with his groin heavily 
bandaged, and an ice pack resting on top. Shawn Abner was limping in the 
clubhouse, with his left hamstring bandaged. Darrin Jackson was sitting in 
front of his locker, icing his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three outfielders opened the season believing that they'd win a job 
in the Padre starting lineup. Each of the three outfielders believe the Padres 
made a mistake by not giving them a starting job. Each of the three, banged up 
and bruised, say it's too late, now. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, losing once again Monday, 3-1 to the San Francisco Giants in front 
of 9,922 at Candlestick Park, certainly have no playoff aspirations preventing 
them from using these final games for an open tryout in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
They've lost six consecutive games, while being outscored 41-14, and have the 
fourth-worst record in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"I really would like to them play, just to get a real good look at them," said 
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that at a time when each could show off their talents, trying to 
prove to Riddoch that they deserve to be in the picture for 1991, they're going 
down quicker than the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn became the latest casualty Monday when he suffered a strained groin, and, 
like Abner (strained left hamstring), is expected to be done for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really frustrating right now," said Abner, who's hitting .245 with one 
homer and 15 RBIs. "I thought I could back, but I took one swing today, and I 
realized, no way. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to prove I can play every day. I hate this sitting around for four 
days, play one, and sit again. I just want a chance. I don't even care if they 
give me a month, give me two weeks straight, and I'll show them." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has been injured with a strained ligament in his right shoulder, 
still is able to play, but the shoulder is affecting his play. Riddoch said 
that he's impressed by Jackson's defensive skills, displayed Monday with two 
running catches, but there's a small demand for center fielders who hit .230 
with five RBIs in 87 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to try to kid myself," Jackson said. "It would be real hard for 
me to say this is my chance to prove myself. It's too late for that. I know if 
I get real hot now, or go real cold, it's not going to make much of a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can play. I think I can show them next year that I'm their man. But 
of, course, I've said that the last few years, too." 
</P>
<P>
And if the Padres don't find an outfielder in the off-season, and decide that 
Jackson and Abner can't cut it, they still have Lynn. Riddoch said Monday that 
he'd like to have Lynn, 38, return for next season, but he's actually counting 
on Lynn to be a force on the bench, not start. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can still start," said Lynn, who's batting .241 with six homers and 
23 RBIs. "I thought I was going to get that chance this year, but it just 
didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
It was Lynn who was at the plate in the sixth inning Monday when the Padres 
appeared to be on the verge of a rally. The had runners on first and second 
with one out, and Lynn worked Kelly Downs to a 3-and-2 count. But with a 
hit-and-run, Lynn hit a slow roller to second base. Robbie Thompson charged the 
ball, flipped it to shortstop Mike Benjamin at second, who was upended the 
moment he threw the ball to first. 
</P>
<P>
The throw beat Lynn by a step, marking the first time this season that he 
grounded into a double play, spanning 195 at-bats. It also might have been his 
last step on the basepaths this season. He immediately left the game with a 
groin injury, and Riddoch said it was serious, possibly ending his season. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a costly injury to Lynn, particularly to his wallet. Lynn had just 
begun receiving a $3,000 bonus for each game he plays, and had made $24,000 in 
the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The injury also will delay Lynn's bid for, well, baseball infamy. Lynn, after 
homering for the first time in three months Saturday night, has 306 career home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
The significance, you ask? 
</P>
<P>
He is only one home run shy of tying Greg Luzinski, formerly of the Phillies, 
for the all-time home run lead with players whose last name starts with "L." 
</P>
<P>
"What an honor, huh?," Lynn said. "Well, I guess if you're in this game long 
enough, your name will pop up in all kinds of places." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Lynn could find himself in the midst of some fine company. Some of 
the other illustrious alphabet leaders: Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Orlando 
Cepeda, Joe DiMaggio, Darryl Evans, Nellie Fox, Lou Gehrig, Reggie Jackson, 
Harmon Killebrew, Willie Mays, Mel Ott, Babe Ruth, Mike Schmidt, Ted Williams 
and Carl Yastrzemski. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lynn pales in comparison to most of his peers in the alphabet, he does 
lead six of the players: Monte Irvin (99), Jamie Quirk (39), Frank Thomas 
(286), Willie Upshaw (88), Mickey Vernon (172), Gus Zernial (237). 
</P>
<P>
"Gee," Lynn said, "I didn't realize the Q's would be so low. Maybe once I get 
the lead, I'll change my name to Quest." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's not right to laugh in a season such as this, but when you have a 
season like the Padres, Lynn realizes that humor has a way of disguising the 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations with Padre first baseman Jack Clark have come to a 
screeching halt. The Padres have not had contact with Tom Reich, Clark's agent, 
for at least three weeks. The Padres' last offer to Clark was a one-year deal 
for $2.5 million, and a $2.5 million option. Jack McKeon told Reich that he'd 
get back to him after making the initial offer, but with all of the turmoil in 
the clubhouse of late and McKeon's firing, Reich still is waiting for that 
call. It's highly unlikely now, Clark said, that he would sign a contract with 
the Padres before learning if he will be declared a second-look free agent 
through the collusion rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Syd Thrift, former general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, telephoned the 
Padre offices Monday and threw his name into the general manager race. The 
Padres, according to sources, told Thrift in so many words, 'Don't call us, 
we'll call you." . . . Dick Balderson, Chicago Cubs' director of scouting, who 
was expected to be a possible candidate for the Padres' vacancy, said Monday 
night that he still has not been contacted for an interview. "It's not big 
deal," Balderson said. "I'd like to be considered, but I don't know if it's 
probable, or possible." . . . Dallas Green, formerly of the Cubs and 
Philadelphia Phillies, also said Monday that he has not been contacted. "If I 
had my preference, I'd prefer to go the expansion route, anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Rick Leach joined the Giants for the first time since undergoing 
drug rehabilitation and being suspended for 60 days. "I made a big mistake, and 
I paid a big price for that mistake," Leach said. "I think I'll be a better man 
for it." . . . Keith Matson, one of the general partners of the Padres, took 
the team flight and joined the Padres in San Francisco. . . . Giant Manager 
Roger Craig took one look at the torn-up outfield at Candlestick, thanks to 
Sunday's football game between the 49ers and Atlanta Falcons, and removed right 
fielder Kevin Bass from the lineup. Bass is coming off knee surgery, and Craig 
said that there's no need taking chances at this stage in the season. . . . The 
Padres will play the second game of their three-game series at 7:35 tonight. 
Andy Benes (10-9) and Don Robinson (10-7) are the scheduled starters.

INJURIES MOUNT IN NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mean Season is upon us with gusto. Ankles are turning. Muscles are pulling. 
Limbs are snapping. Miles of tape are being unrolled. Dozens of prognoses are 
being made. General managers are working the phones, finding new players to 
replace those who went down with a pop, a bang, a crunch. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of the National Football League season, there were 99 players 
on the league's injury report last week. Twenty-three different parts of the 
body were listed as damaged, everything from a buttocks to a jaw. (My favorite 
listing? "Head." What, precisely, does that mean? And has anyone asked the man 
to count to 10?) 
</P>
<P>
The numbers will swell this week. It was a tough Sunday. The Washington 
Redskins' quarterback strained his knee. The Minnesota Vikings' quarterback 
injured his thumb. The Indianapolis Colts lost all three of their quarterbacks 
to injury during a game in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The year is young, but already tough. The Denver Broncos don't have much of a 
defense. The Cleveland Browns don't have much of an offense. The Los Angeles 
Rams are flopping almost as miserably as "Ishtar." Injuries are among the 
central aspects of each of those stories. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Mean Season. Blocking, tackling, running and passing determine 
the outcome of every football game, from pee wee to the pros. But in the NFL, 
no part of the game is more important than injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a war of attrition," said George Young, general manager of the New York 
Giants. "The teams that have the most healthy, good players at the end of the 
season tend to be in the hunt. That's the way it is almost every year." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries are a given in the NFL, a fact of life. Most players will need a 
doctor at some point during the season. Teams can only hope that their injuries 
aren't catastrophic, that the wrong players aren't ruined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers have been the NFL's best team the last few years, but 
they also have been among the luckiest. Not one of their essential players has 
lost much time because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
"The 49ers are a very good team, but the healthiest team is going to win," said 
Joe Theismann, who was the Redskins' quarterback until a badly broken leg ended 
his career, and is now an ESPN broadcaster. "We can pretty well guess right now 
who is going to make the playoffs this year. Injuries will be the ultimate 
difference between them." 
</P>
<P>
Already, the impact is significant. The Broncos, for instance, are in some 
trouble. They have lost a starting cornerback and defensive end for the season. 
Both safeties are out right now. "I don't recognize anyone in the huddle," 
linebacker Karl Mecklenburg said. (Author's note: The nation will not mourn if 
the Broncos fail to return to the Super Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings certainly will be diminished without quarterback Wade Wilson. The 
Browns are punchless without their best back, Kevin Mack, who has a broken 
finger. Both teams -- division winners a year ago -- are off to a 1-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, a popular preseason choice for the Super Bowl, also are 1-2, their 
defense staggered by injuries. The home-field advantage in the playoffs, which 
they dearly wanted, may soon be outside their grasp. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it is no coincidence that the Chicago Bears are (a) off to a 
surprising 3-0 start, and (b) one of two teams that didn't list an injury in 
last week's report. (Maybe Mike Ditka warned them that only sissies got hurt.) 
</P>
<P>
Was it always this way? One wouldn't think so. With players constantly getting 
bigger, stronger and faster, it seems only logical that injuries are more of a 
factor now than, say, a decade ago. The collisions are more brutal. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does it help that 15 of the 28 teams play on artificial turf, on which 
risk increases, or that there has been widespread use of steroids, with which 
players develop stronger muscles than their bones can stand. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Dr. John Powell, who runs the National Athletic Injury 
Reporting System, in Iowa City, Iowa, there is hardly a difference at all. "The 
risk pattern in the NFL hasn't changed much in the last decade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Theismann agrees. "It doesn't seem much different from even back when I 
started," he said. "The day I started training camp was the last day I was 
healthy. Injuries are part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Young, "It isn't much worse now. A lot more time is spent now on 
preventing injuries, staying in shape." 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect, this just doesn't seem right. The NFL has always been 
brutal, but never did injuries seem as widespread as they are now, such a 
critical aspect of determining winners and losers. Never did Charles Darwin's 
lesson -- survival of the fittest -- seem so appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Forget what the survey says. The great Green Bay Packer and Pittsburgh Steeler 
teams almost never suffered an injury. The good Baltimore Colt teams almost 
never had to reshuffle their lineup. Years ago, it was news if a team suffered 
more than one major injury in a season. Today, rare is the team that goes 
through a season without a major problem resulting from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Jets lost most of their secondary last year. The New England 
Patriots lost most of their linebackers. Both teams had lousy seasons. Everyone 
else held their breath, hoping the same troubles didn't befall them. They're 
all holding their breath again this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Mean Season has never been meaner.

LUGINBILL SHUFFLES DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of Ty Detmer's 514-yard passing exhibition Saturday -- the most 
passing yards ever allowed by an Aztec defense -- San Diego State Coach Al 
Luginbill has decided to make some personnel changes for Saturday's home game 
against Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
After practice Monday, Luginbill announced these moves: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior Tracey Mao replaces junior Derrick Williams as the starting nickel 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Morey Paul will back up Mao, and Williams moves out of the two-man 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore Robert Griffith will start at dime back, and he will be backed up 
by sophomore Zac Stokes, who has been out with a shoulder injury since the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Marlon Andrews and sophomore Gary Taylor will remain as the starting 
cornerbacks, but sophomore Damon Piere and sophomore Darrell Lewis will now 
play behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Clark Moses, a second-team all-WAC defensive back last year, had 
been playing on the second team, but he has been demoted to the scout team. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries to running backs Tommy Booker and Curtis Butts have left the Aztecs 
with two healthy backs (Kipp Jeffries and T.C. Wright) and have forced 
Luginbill to move H-back Larry Maxey to running back. Butts (neck strain) and 
Booker (ankle) are questionable for Saturday. Luginbill said he does not yet 
know who will start at running back. . . . Freshman linebacker Jamal Duff 
(thigh bruise) is improved and has been listed as questionable. DAVE McKIBBEN

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: NEW ALL-STAR GAME PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, John Shacklett, presiding over a special meeting of the San Diego 
High School Sports Assn., announced his group's intentions to create an 
all-star football game that would rival, if not replace, a game played between 
San Diego and Los Angeles County all-stars last August in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Shacklett, head football coach and athletic director at Morse, said the group 
would like to establish its own game to attract community interest and raise 
revenue that would be returned to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Shacklett and the association said the Southern California College Prep 
All-Star game, played at Mira Mesa High, Aug. 4, accomplished neither. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned with the all-star football game that's being played and 
the people who are promoting it," Shacklett said. 
</P>
<P>
Shacklett said his group's game would include only San Diego County players in 
a division 2-A vs. 3-A format, including top 1-A and eight-man players, and 
would take place shortly after the 1990-1991 school year. He said the 
association is "in the process" of obtaining sanctioning rights and securing 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
When one of the top cross country programs in the state fails to have any 
freshman come out, it is, in Coach Dan Schaitel's words, "unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are reasons for the lack of freshmen with the Poway girls cross 
country team this season, Schaitel said "it's very unusual and very shocking." 
</P>
<P>
Every summer, Poway has a summer cross country program that attracts many 
freshmen. This year, however, renovation of the training facilities restricted 
the coaches from "executing the camp to its fullest potential." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was the program, change in interest or both, two freshmen Schaitel 
expected on the cross country team decided to play tennis, and 11 others chose 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, a couple freshmen did join the team, and Schaitel said he hopes 
to have them ready to compete at the Mount SAC Invitational in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually have a good mixture of ages," Schaitel said. "For a program that's 
traditionally as balanced as ours, it's kind of a rude awakening." 
</P>
<P>
Poway, which has gone to the state meet two of the last three years and ranked 
sixth in the preseason state coaches' poll, is currently being led by sophomore 
Monica Callan, an all-Section pick last year. 
</P>
<P>
Two seniors, Tara Barnhart and Emily Reinys, also are previous all-Section 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans began dual meet competition Friday by defeating Torrey Pines, 22-35. 
</P>
<P>
Although the season is young, it's not premature to predict that the Poway boys 
team will be the first team to win a fourth consecutive San Diego Section cross 
country title. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who finished ninth at the state meet last year, were ranked third 
in the preseason state coaches' poll. In 1988, Poway placed third at the state 
meet and the previous year placed fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Poway returns three all-Section runners with junior Nate Arnold, who placed 
third at the Section meet last season, senior Sean Finn, who placed fourth, and 
senior Spence Shoemake, who finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino and Lincoln, the two 2-A football finalists last year, have combined 
for an 0-7 record. Lincoln hasn't lost its first four games since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino plays at Carlsbad (3-0) in Avocado League opener Friday and Lincoln 
is off. 
</P>
<P>
When Dominique Walltower, a Hoover cornerback, intercepted a pass in Hoover's 
28-0 victory over St. Augustine and ran it back 60 yards for a touchdown on 
Friday, it was the second time he has done just that this season. Walltower 
also has a 72-yard touchdown return among his three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Academics are supposed to come before athletics, but the new Rancho Bernardo 
High played a tennis match and a football game before the school even opened.

MORNING REPORT: 'GOODFELLAS' WRITES OFF 'POSTCARDS'

Gangsters claimed the No. 1 spot at the box office during a sleepy moviegoing 
weekend. The critically admired "GoodFellas," from Warner Bros. and director 
Martin Scorsese, had ticket sales of $6.4 million on 1,070 screens, for a 
per-screen average of $6,168. 
</P>
<P>
The Mafia saga (running time: 145 minutes) starring Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta 
and Joe Pesci pushed "Postcards From the Edge" into second place, but just 
barely. Starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine, Columbia Pictures' 
"Postcards" grossed $6.3 million on 1,322 screens, for $4,765 per-screen -- a 
20% drop. 
</P>
<P>
* After opening the New York Film Festival, "Miller's Crossing," the gangster 
tale by the Coen Brothers, grossed an impressive $28,202 over just two days in 
one N.Y. theater.

KUWAIT SELLS OFF HOLDING

The Kuwaiti government's investment arm on Monday made its first known sale of 
a Kuwaiti holding since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was "purely an investment decision" and wasn't aimed at raising cash, 
said a spokeswoman for the London-based investment arm, the Kuwait Investment 
Office. She wasn't identified, in accordance with British practice. 
</P>
<P>
The investment office sold a 10.1% stake in Mount Charlotte Investments PLC to 
a company controlled by New Zealand financier Ronald A. Brierley for $121 
million, Brierley's company said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait Investment Office has a massive portfolio worth up to an estimated 
$100 billion and includes major stakes in British, West German and Spanish 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kuwait's finance minister, Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah, said at a 
London news conference that Kuwait was managing to make do with its liquid 
assets and if any asset sale was required, "We can handle it with the 
cooperation of central banks in an orderly and responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
Governments have frozen Kuwait's assets to protect them from Iraq, but Ali said 
the governments have allowed exiled Kuwaiti institutions to operate "as freely 
as prudent." 
</P>
<P>
Brierley Investments said it paid $1.36 per share for the 88.8 million shares 
of Mount Charlotte owned by the Kuwait investment office. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase lifted Brierley Investment's Mount Charlotte stake to 39.9% and 
forced the company under British takeover rules to make a bid for all of Mount 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Its offer values all of Mount Charlotte at $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A Mount Charlotte spokeswoman, who also wasn't identified, said the company's 
board of directors would hold an emergency meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mount Charlotte, which owns and operates 100 hotels, had a net profit of $72 
million on sales of $289 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Brierley Investments, quoted on the London, New Zealand and Australian stock 
markets, is an investment company with holdings in a diverse range of 
industries and markets.

THIRD-PARTY MOTHERHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: PREGNANCY IS ALWAYS A LONG AND DIFFICULT WAIT FOR THE EXPECTANT 
PARENTS. WHEN A SURROGATE MOTHER IS INVOLVED, IT'S AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WAIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Wyckoff figured she knew all there was to know about surrogate parenting. 
Shewas a surrogate mother herself nine years ago, an experience that led her to 
found a surrogate brokerage business in San Clemente. Since then, she has 
matched infertile couples with surrogates, completing more than 50 successful 
births. 
</P>
<P>
But then, Wyckoff and her husband, Tom Olivor, wanted their own child. By now 
unable to conceive, they decided to hire an experienced surrogate they knew 
from her company. Suddenly, Wyckoff found herself on the other side, as anxious 
as all her would-be parents at not being able to control the pregnancy of their 
unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea," she said. "Being the couple is so much more difficult than 
being the surrogate." 
</P>
<P>
Olivor, too, said he was on an emotional roller coaster until their surrogate, 
an unmarried Long Beach woman, delivered a healthy baby and they brought him 
home in August. "We took turns going crazy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, an estimated 4,000 babies have been born in surrogate arrangements 
in the United States, about half of them through a handful of programs such as 
Wyckoff's -- the Center for Reproductive Alternatives -- that use the services 
of professionals like lawyers, doctors and psychologists. Most come off without 
a hitch: Fewer than 1% of surrogates change their mind and want to keep the 
child. There are no known cases of a handicapped child born in a surrogate 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Though rare, each contested case represents a contracting couple's worst 
nightmare come true. In the well-publicized Baby M case, New Jersey surrogate 
Mary Beth Whitehead changed her mind and was eventually awarded visitation 
rights. Three years ago, a Chula Vista couple agreed to share custody with 
their Mexican surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
And most recently, Anna Johnson, an Orange County surrogate, sued the couple 
who hired her because they allegedly did not give her sufficient support during 
her pregnancy. However, it is the first contested case in which the surrogate, 
impregnated through in vitro fertilization, has no genetic link to the unborn 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Such cases also spur consideration of public policy for what is becoming an 
increasingly popular alternative means of procreation. 
</P>
<P>
Many states have considered surrogacy legislation, and 16 have passed statutes, 
some providing misdemeanor penalties for engaging in a contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, those states that 
have banned surrogacy or declared contracts unenforceable are: Arizona, 
Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, brokers report an increase in what is known as gestational 
surrogacy, as in the Johnson case. And they report many calls from 
"do-it-yourselfers" -- couples, like the pair who hired Anna Johnson, who have 
found their own surrogate and are seeking further directions on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
To Wyckoff, who runs a relatively small operation -- 10 cases a year -- out of 
her home, such cases also serve to illuminate the pitfalls of unregulated 
surrogacy arrangements made by individuals without the benefit of programs such 
as hers that screen participants for compatibility and supply long-term 
psychological support. 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff first became involved in surrogacy 10 years ago. Married to another 
man, she was the mother of three children and living in the Midwest. She knew a 
couple who were desperately trying to have children but could not. Sympathetic, 
she tried to help them by researching alternatives. Catholics, like herself, 
they rejected surrogacy as immoral. But Wyckoff said: "The more I found out, 
the more I knew this was the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than giving "the gift of life," she said she wanted to give the "gift of 
parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff contacted a doctor in the Midwest who ran the only program she knew of 
at the time and was artificially inseminated. The program required anonymity, 
provided no counseling and did not allow couples or surrogates to select each 
other, she said; they had no say in the matchups. Even her labor was induced, 
and Wyckoff has no idea what happened to the child. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when an infertile couple she had met in the program asked her to help 
them meet a surrogate and make the arrangements, she agreed, and subsequent 
referrals marked the beginning of her business. 
</P>
<P>
She relocated to Newport Beach, after a divorce in 1984 and marriage to Olivor, 
an architect. 
</P>
<P>
After five years, they decided they wanted children of their own. But 
complications from endometriosis, and later an ectopic pregnancy, forced 
Wyckoff to undergo a hysterectomy after which she could not conceive. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, her business was so well established she had repeat customers and 
repeat surrogates. Many of them, like Susie, had become personal friends who 
formed the core social life for Wyckoff, 36, and Olivor, 47. 
</P>
<P>
They had particularly admired Susie, a 28-year-old civilian merchandiser for 
the Navy, for her strength and independence. She had given birth to healthy 
children twice before, once to a son who was adopted independently and once to 
a daughter for a couple in the program. They asked her if she would be 
artificially inseminated again, this time for them. She agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem unusual to us," Olivor said. "In 1980, it was a radical thing 
to do. In 1990, it's not that radical a procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Following the procedure Wyckoff prescribes for her clients, they each obtained 
lawyers, signed contracts stipulating Wyckoff would adopt the child later, and 
attended psychological counseling sessions before the insemination. 
</P>
<P>
Over the duration of the pregnancy and two months after delivery, they will pay 
her about $13,000. In general, the total cost to couples in Wyckoff's program 
ranges from $27,000 to $29,000, with the additional money going to lawyers, 
psychologists and doctors fees and travel expenses. Wyckoff would not disclose 
how much she profits from each case. 
</P>
<P>
During her pregnancy, Susie kept on working, and used the extra money for trips 
and a new car, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff and Olivor said they tried to hide their anxiety from her, in the 
belief that she would produce a calm child if she remained calm herself. 
</P>
<P>
However, Olivor said switching from observer to participant was "emotionally 
wrenching." At one point, Olivor, a fallen-away Catholic like his wife, said he 
was certain a handicapped child would be God's punishment for having been 
involved in surrogacy: "That's how crazy it got." 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff was equally unnerved over the lack of control and often wondered if she 
shouldn't have gone through another program other than her own. For instance, 
there was the question of whether the other surrogates would be jealous that 
the "Mother Superior" had played favorites by choosing one of them, a fear that 
didn't materialize, Wyckoff said. Moreover, there was the nagging feeling that 
she had just been consistently "lucky" in arranging 57 successful births. What 
if this would be the one time something went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff coached Susie during the brief delivery and cut the umbilical cord. She 
and Tom stayed at the hospital overnight and drove her home the next day. They 
stayed half an hour and left with the child. Later they sent a bouquet of 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
For Susie, who does not want to raise children of her own, it was basically a 
job, albeit a special one. "I kept that kind of an attitude," she said. "I 
never got attached to the baby. Never thought, what if he was mine? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are made to be moms, and some of us are made to do this." 
</P>
<P>
She said she will probably be a surrogate for another couple in the program in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had some major hard luck. . . . I've been lucky enough to get pregnant 
the first time, have healthy 8-pound babies, lots of hair. Good babies." 
</P>
<P>
Indirectly, she's also doing it for Wyckoff, whom she considers almost like a 
sister. "I see how Kathy feels the more time she spends with a couple and 
there's no baby. I know I could step in and say, 'OK, I don't mind being 
pregnant,' and everybody would be happy. Then that look would leave her eye. 
All gets right with the world." 
</P>
<P>
But she thinks she will quit the program when she's 30. "I don't want to be 
having kids the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Rocking the sleeping baby named Michael, Wyckoff said her sympathies 
unquestioningly lie with Mark and Crispina Calvert, the biological parents of 
the child being carried by Anna Johnson. "I understood Mary Beth Whitehead and 
her desire to keep the baby. But it's hard for me to understand where Anna 
Johnson is coming from." (The baby boy, born last week, is now with the 
Calverts. Johnson is still seeking shared custody.) 
</P>
<P>
In her program, surrogate candidates are screened for genetic history, mental 
illness and chemical dependency -- and personality characteristics compatible 
with Wyckoff's. Once accepted, they attend group sessions with counselors to 
help one another deal with thoughts of keeping the child and accept that the 
baby will belong to the contracting couple. "I'd never have a surrogate in a 
program without ongoing psychological counseling and the camaraderie of other 
surrogates. It's essential." 
</P>
<P>
Even though her own surrogate said she did not need counseling after the birth, 
Wyckoff said she insisted, as always, "so they can resolve even the slightest 
thing said or done, so it won't come back to haunt them." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband see a big problem with the "do-it-yourselfers." 
</P>
<P>
"Do-it-yourself surrogacy is like wanting to go to Hawaii. You buy a yacht, and 
ask the broker, 'Which way to Hawaii?' He points and says, 'That way,' " Olivor 
said. "It's that kind of adventure." 
</P>
<P>
"It's that dangerous," Wyckoff added. 
</P>
<P>
These days, surrogacy is more socially acceptable than when she started out, 
Wyckoff said. Whereas it was difficult to find mental-health or health-care 
providers 10 years ago, she has no problems today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the industry, such as it is, has yet to organize. Wyckoff said there 
are very few successful brokers in the United States. Many fail because they 
don't have the credentials or are too intent on making money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When brokers met two years ago in Denver to devise professional guidelines, the 
meeting fell apart because of disagreements, Wyckoff said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, some, like Wyckoff, wanted to limit surrogates to those with a 
history of uncomplicated births, a proposal others called discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
Even the successful programs aren't necessarily alike, she said. Some insist on 
anonymity, some use balloon payments at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Wyckoff said she continues to design her own business on the Golden Rule. "I 
try to treat the surrogate, and now the couples, as I'd like to be treated."

TIPS ON AVOIDING UNWANTED VALET SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning Joseph N. Bell's Aug. 24 article objecting to the growing practice 
of restaurants forcing unwanted valet parking on the public, Mr. Bell should 
have had the fortitude to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
I wholly agree with Joe and The Times in deploring the practice, but both 
overlooked the obvious method of cure. 
</P>
<P>
It's very simple. Mention the offending restaurants by name. That would have 
ensured a fast cure and would also have been a very nice tit for tat. 
</P>
<P>
Joe would have been scratching that itch and The Times would have performed a 
public service for the majority of patrons at a possible very small cost in 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants would think twice before instituting a similar disservice to 
their customers.

HOSTAGE DRAMA AT MCDONALD'S ENDS SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman fleeing a robbery at a children's clothing store in La Verne dashed 
into a nearby McDonald's restaurant, where he held as many as 19 hostages -- 
including several children -- for several hours before sheriff's deputies 
stormed the facility shortly after midnight today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was in custody by 12:15 a.m. -- more than six hours after the 
incident began. 
</P>
<P>
All the hostages were believed freed and unharmed. No shots were fired during 
the tense stand-off in a commercial district in La Verne, on the eastern edge 
of Los Angeles County. Police, however, apparently had initiated the assault 
with three diversionary explosive blasts called "flashbangs." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's special tactics officers moved into the McDonald's 
less than a half hour after a dozen hostages, believed to be employees, managed 
to get free of the building. They apparently had hidden in a staff lounge for 
six hours, with the intruder unaware of their presence. 
</P>
<P>
One SWAT member dressed as a McDonald's employee had managed to infiltrate the 
restaurant late in the ordeal, swapping places with a hostage. When the assault 
began, officials said, he leaped over a counter and tackled the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, officers inside reported that one suspect was in custody and a 
search was under way for a possible second; the remaining hostages began to 
pour out. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports throughout the night whether one or two gunmen 
were holding hostages. 
</P>
<P>
One young girl could be seen limping as she was escorted from the McDonald's by 
a SWAT team member. Another little girl was carried out by an officer. None 
appeared seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Another suspect had been arrested as he fled the Kids Mart clothing store in a 
shopping plaza at Foothill Boulevard and Fruit Street at 5:30 p.m., Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a robbery victim ran out of the store after the holdup and 
flagged down a passing La Verne police motorcycle officer and pointed out the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the robbery, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they had not determined what happened in the clothing store, 
but it appeared that the robbers left with an undetermined amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
The first suspect under arrest was described as in his 30s with tattoos 
covering his arms. His name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
As the other robbery suspect ran into the McDonald's across the street, several 
people in the fast-food restaurant ran out, deputies said. Those who escaped 
said two employees and several children remained inside. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's SWAT team closed the shopping center, surrounded the restaurant, 
and contacted someone inside by telephone from a command post set up at La 
Verne Lutheran High School, said John Blickenstaff, mayor of the San Gabriel 
Valley city. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Bill Wehner said, "The hostage negotiators are on the line. 
They are trying to make contact with the suspects." 
</P>
<P>
It was not known, however, if the negotiators ever managed to get through to 
the hostage-taker. 
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of on-lookers converged on the shopping center throughout the 
night as officers attempted to piece together the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies using binoculars caught glimpses of hostages inside the restaurant, 
noting that the gunman -- believed to be carrying a rifle and a handgun -- had 
forced some to lie on the floor under tables. Children, however, could be seen 
seated at tables and playing board games. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live near the shopping plaza came out of their homes and stood in 
anxious knots along Fruit Street. They described the restaurant as a popular 
hangout for area children after school. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Taton rushed to the scene because her son, Robert, 17, who has worked at 
the McDonald's since July, was one of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors came to get me," Taton said. "We thought it would be a 
controlled situation, but this is not the kind of control we were hoping for," 
she said, looking around at the dozens of patrol cars and helicopter hovering 
above. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so sorry for him," Taton's neighbor, Amado Salazar, said of Taton's 
son. "He's such a quiet boy." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Freis, 18, of Upland, was driving up to the restaurant to pick up his 
brother in the parking lot when he saw "a bunch of cops with their guns out. 
They had me get behind a wall." 
</P>
<P>
Freis said he was forced to remain behind the wall for three hours, but that he 
heard no shots or screams from inside the restaurant during that time. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne City Council member Tom Harvey said city officials and representatives 
from McDonald's met with relatives of hostages in La Verne's public safety 
building, the police and fire department headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"They're acting very calm," Harvey said. "They are very controlled. They feel 
like we're handling it well. They have faith in how it's going to turn out. I 
was impressed in how well they're taking this." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kirven of the Pomona chapter of the American Red Cross said 20 to 25 family 
members were at the public safety building. 
</P>
<P>
When they heard the news of the release, "there was cheering and clapping and 
thanks, naturally." 
</P>
<P>
Kirven said that during the ordeal, the family members "seemed to be in good 
spirits," because they were kept briefed of the situation by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Kirven said the Red Cross was arranging for food and psychological counseling 
for the hostages, who were brought to the public safety building for reunions 
with their families. McDonald's restaurants have been the targets of other 
violence. On July 18, 1984, James Oliver Huberty killed 21 people and wounded 
15 more at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, a community of San Diego near the 
Mexican border, before he was killed by a police sharpshooter. It was one of 
the nation's worst massacres. 
</P>
<P>
In Port Arthur, Texas, one person was killed when a man opened fire at crowded 
McDonald's last December.

HUSSEIN WON'T FIND IT EASY TO DESTROY SAUDI OIL FIELDS

<P>
Although Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat to bomb Saudi Arabian oil 
fields sent oil prices soaring Monday, military and industry analysts said that 
those oil facilities would prove difficult for him to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with Saudi Arabia producing at full capacity to make up for the loss of 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil on world markets, even a slight or temporary loss could 
send prices spiraling further. 
</P>
<P>
Of even greater concern is the fact that an outbreak of hostilities could empty 
the oil fields of workers, who are largely foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people who operate the fields will be gone in a minute" in the event 
of war, said Philip K. Verleger, an energy analyst with the Institute for 
International Economics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A government analyst agreed: "If he can keep lobbing missiles, even one a day, 
he won't get many people to work in the oil fields. He will not get many ships 
up there either." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein vowed Sunday that if Iraq is strangled by an international embargo, 
"the oil areas in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region, all the oil 
installations, will be rendered incapable of responding to the needs of those 
who came to us as occupiers." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves include the world's largest field, Ghawar, and 
the biggest offshore reserves, the Safaniya field. These and other crucial 
oil-producing areas lie within 300 miles of the border of Kuwait, which is now 
under Iraqi control, and well within range of Hussein's bombers and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The oil makes its way to world markets through a huge network of facilities 
that present more vulnerable targets than the underground reserves themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil wells would be rendered useless without giant power and water plants. 
Other possible targets are the fewer than 50 major pumping stations that 
service more than 6,000 miles of major pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
A single 50-mile stretch of Persian Gulf coastline contains the terminals 
through which 80% of Saudi Arabia's oil production is shipped. Included in that 
area is Ras Tanura, the world's premier oil port, berthing 18 tankers at a time 
and shipping up to 256 million barrels a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The choke points are what you'd aim for," said G. Henry Schuler, director of 
the energy security program at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington. Much of the equipment, he said, is specially built and 
not easily replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Destroying any of these sites or other critical facilities, however, would 
require a good deal of skill and no small amount of luck, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is very limited in what it can do. Basically speaking, a defended oil 
field is very difficult to attack," says Anthony H. Cordesman, a national 
security expert who has written extensively about the vulnerability of the 
region's oil facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Soviet-made Scud-B missiles -- some of which are nicknamed Al-Husseins 
-- would not be up to the task because they are notoriously inaccurate, experts 
say. Nothing less than "persistent bombing and highly precise bombing" could 
shut down crucial pumping stations, pipelines, terminals and electric power 
stations, Cordesman said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. air defenders, working with the Saudis, likely would render that 
impossible, he added. The U.S. deployment includes AWACS and Hawkeye radar 
planes that monitor all air traffic, which could be intercepted by U.S. and 
Saudi fighter planes. The U.S. forces also have in place the advanced Patriot 
ground-to-air anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis themselves have been working for several years on an extensive 
system of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defenses for their oil fields and 
industrial facilities, but U.S. officials say those systems are not yet fully 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that Iraq could disrupt shipping through the Persian 
Gulf, either by destroying port facilities or intimidating tanker fleets. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts discount that possibility, noting that even Iraq's eight-year war 
with Iran, in which the two sides hit more than 300 tankers, did not cause 
major disruption of oil movements in the Persian Gulf. During that war, Iraq 
repeatedly tried and failed to destroy Iran's main oil-loading terminal on 
Kharg Island. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Iraq succeeded in disrupting Persian Gulf ports, Saudi Arabia could 
ship some of its oil out through an alternate route -- the Petroline east-west 
pipeline from the oil fields to Yanbu, the major Saudi port city on the Red 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The oil wells themselves, which numbered 858 in 1989, are relatively small 
targets, more vulnerable to a terrorist than a bomb or missile. 
</P>
<P>
However, with chemical weapons they could be contaminated for months, making 
their operation impossible. Iraq is known to have test-fired missiles carrying 
chemical warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Fire is always a danger in oil fields. Oil well firefighter Red Adair said he 
spent six weeks attempting to put out the blazes when a terrorist blew up five 
wells in Libya in 1966. Only a handful of companies will even attempt the 
dangerous work. 
</P>
<P>
However, most Saudi wells require injections of processed salt water to 
operate, Cordesman said, so they would not burn as easily. The blaze could be 
extinguished by shutting off the water, which would stop the oil and gas from 
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Iran-Iraq War, Saudi Arabia has undertaken an effort to make its oil 
facilities more resistant to attack. The sensitive master controls of some 
terminals, for example, have been buried in underground bunkers, Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our utmost to take precautions and defensive measures to make 
the minimum vulnerability possible," one senior Saudi official said. The 
biggest problem, he noted, are parts and supplies that require lead times of as 
long as two years to order. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made it a policy that we stock these kind of long lead items," the 
official said. "Other things, usually, you can repair locally and so on, or buy 
from the shelf. So we think we can do a reasonable job if hit . . . in 
recovering fairly quickly." 
</P>
<P>
But one oil industry source noted: "There are only so many preventive actions 
you could take against a Scud-B missile coming in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAUDI OIL SITES AND IRAQI AIR POWER 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's threat to bomb Persian Gulf oil fields jolted world market. Of 
particular concern are Saudi facilities within range of Iraqi missiles and 
bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi strike ranges: 
</P>
<P>
SU-24 Fencer fighter 
</P>
<P>
Al Abbas missile 
</P>
<P>
Mirage F-1E fighter

<P>
Critical Zone 
</P>
<P>
Tiny Tarut Bay area has terminals shipping nearly 80% of Saudi oil, new port at 
Juaymah and computers at Dammam that control production. Attack here could 
cripple oil output for months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TYPES OF TARGETS 
</P>
<P>
Not all Saudi oil facilities make equally good targets. 
</P>
<P>
Oil terminals: Vital but hard to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
Refineries: Not as vital as they seem; crude can be refined outside country. 
</P>
<P>
Oil fields: Hard to destroy. Wells make tiny targets and can be redrilled. 
</P>
<P>
Power, water plants: Vital for wells, run by injection of processed saltwater. 
</P>
<P>
Pumping stations: Critical; fewer than 50 major ones. 
</P>
<P>
Computers: Critical. Main center at Dammam. Loss could paralyze production for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSES 
</P>
<P>
Saudis working on network to protect fields. Now, U.S. supplies main defense. 
Major systems: 
</P>
<P>
Patriot: Surface-to-air missile. Defends against Scud-B (Hussein) missile. 
</P>
<P>
AWACS: Radar plane detects incoming warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkeye: Navy radar plane. 
</P>
<P>
Fighter aircraft: U.S., Saudi planes would scramble against attack planes 
detected by radar. Saudis have five major U.S.-built air bases. 
</P>
<P>
Other measures: Saudis have placed master controls of some oil terminals in 
underground bunkers.

MARINES BEGIN GROUNDING FLEET OF FAILING HARRIER JETS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: FAILURE OF SENSORS MADE BY NORTHROP BLAMED. FIRM PLEADED GUILTY TO 
FALSIFYING TESTS ON SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
The Marine Corps has begun to ground its AV-8B Harrier jets because of failures 
in on-board sensor systems supplied by Northrop Corp., which pleaded guilty in 
February to criminal charges of falsifying tests of the equipment, 
congressional sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines began the grounding in April and will have grounded five planes by 
October, after which the aircraft will be taken out of service at an average of 
1 1/2 planes per month, according to congressional sources quoting Navy 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The Harrier jet is a key weapon in the Persian Gulf crisis, with about 60 of 
the aircraft estimated to be deployed in the region. Information about whether 
the defects in the sensors might be affecting Marine military operations there 
is classified, a congressional committee source said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps has just under 200 Harriers in its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy official Monday confirmed that aircraft are being grounded. He said the 
Northrop sensor systems, which control the stability of the aircraft, are 
failing at a faster rate than projected by Navy requirements. No spare sensors 
are available to repair the aircraft, necessitating parking the $22-million 
Harriers as problems arise, the congressional source said. 
</P>
<P>
No other company produces the "rate sensor assembly" and it is unclear how long 
it would take to find another maker for the part. Last year, Northrop was 
suspended from receiving new contracts for the sensor, among other products. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop officials said Monday that they had no knowledge of the grounding. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy documents are expected to be introduced today at a hearing before the 
House Committee on Government Operations about fraudulent testing of Harrier 
parts by Northrop. The hearing will be the seventh held since 1987, called by 
three different committees, to examine problems at Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply don't know whether the weapons will do their job," said Rep. 
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), a committee member. "We may find that some of what 
our soldiers depend upon will not perform up to specification. It may threaten 
the lives of many of our men and women in uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Reliability problems with the sensors have caused accidents, committee sources 
said. Details of the mishaps are unavailable and Northrop officials said they 
are unaware of any such accidents. A federal official corroborated the report 
that aircraft have had mishaps and added that the Navy has fought efforts to 
reveal the full extent of the safety problems associated with the sensor. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts of falsifying tests on a guidance system 
for an Air Force cruise missile and on the so-called "rate sensor assembly" for 
the Harrier. The federal indictment charged Northrop with not performing 
required tests and providing falsified results. 
</P>
<P>
Under its Navy contract, the company was supposed to vibrate the Harrier sensor 
at 32 times the force of gravity, but the company's test device was not capable 
of vibrating at that intensity, said William Fahey, the assistant U.S. attorney 
who prosecuted the company. 
</P>
<P>
"They vibrated them to less than half the requirement," Fahey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After the government's investigation of Northrop became public in 1987, 
Northrop obtained permission from the Navy to relax the vibration requirement, 
but it was still unable to get the sensor assemblies to pass the test, Fahey 
said. The company asked for a second reduction in the requirement, which the 
Navy agreed to in 1988, Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the second reduction, which took the requirement to 12 times the 
force of gravity, Northrop had to "reconfigure" the sensor so that it could 
pass the test, Fahey said. Neither the Navy nor Northrop undertook any program 
to repair or replace the earlier Harrier jets with the improperly tested and 
produced units, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fahey also said that federal investigators obtained preliminary reports that 
aircraft accidents were occurring with the defective sensors, but the Navy 
never produced a full record. 
</P>
<P>
"The Justice Department has had difficulty obtaining a complete record of the 
performance history of the Harrier jets with respect to the rate sensor 
assemblies' ability to perform as contractually required," Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop spokesman said the company has sought unsuccessfully to obtain 
government reports about the failure rates of the sensors. In the past, 
Northrop has stated that the fraudulent testing was done by a small group of 
employees who were fired and that the operation in Pomona, where the false 
testing occurred, has been closed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the criminal case is closed, Fahey said the Justice Department is 
continuing to pursue a civil case against Northrop on the Harrier. The Pentagon 
has yet to conclude an administrative case that will determine the future of 
the Northrop subsidiary that produced the sensor. 
</P>
<P>
That subsidiary, the precision products division in Norwood, Mass., is under an 
administrative suspension that bars it from obtaining new government contracts. 
A Northrop spokesman said the company is still making the rate sensor 
assemblies under prior contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Government Operations panel 
said, "Northrop is a case study in botched Pentagon procurement." The 
committee's panel on legislation and national security will conduct the hearing 
today.

JET PARTS: CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
SUPPLIERS ARE FREE TO INSPECT THEIR OWN PARTS. SUCH QUALITY CONTROL LEEWAY 
LEAVES THE TESTING INDUSTRY OPEN TO FRAUD, AND AIR TRAVELERS VULNERABLE TO 
TRAGEDY.

<P>
The crash of a DC-10 jetliner last summer in Sioux City, Iowa, which killed 112 
people and miraculously spared 184, was ordained 18 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, a titanium disk was installed in a General Electric jet engine, which 
was later mounted onto the DC-10. But the disk had a flaw, one that would go 
undetected in one inspection test after another. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, 1989, the disk disintegrated, knocked out most of the jet's control 
system and sent the plane cartwheeling down the runway -- earning the accident 
a grim distinction as one of the most deadly failures of quality control 
testing in U.S. aircraft history. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no evidence of wrongdoing, a federal investigation has 
revealed that GE and its subcontractors had concerns from the beginning about 
whether its quality control tests were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure comes amid growing concerns that the system for testing 
commercial and military aircraft components is deeply flawed and can have 
tragic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts point to basic deficiencies. There are no mandatory standards 
for individuals or companies that conduct tests. And the testing process turns 
on an honor system, leaving manufacturers free to pass judgment on the quality 
of their own parts. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for improvement is . . . obvious," said Desmond D. Dewey, executive 
director of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, the leading 
technical organization for U.S. testing standards. 
</P>
<P>
At its worst, the system appears wide open to fraud. In dozens of felony cases, 
aerospace contractors have been convicted of falsifying tests on such products 
as aircraft castings, missile welds, cockpit instruments, engine bolts and 
missile guidance systems -- parts that can cost anywhere from 50 cents to 
$10,000 apiece. In some cases, federal officials don't know where the defective 
parts have ended up. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of aerospace subcontractors describe a system where financial pressures 
have had a corrosive effect. If parts are rejected as substandard, suppliers 
can lose bonuses for prompt deliveries; so suppliers cover up their quality 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Suppliers often threaten to take business away from independent labs if they 
don't certify their parts. Although most labs resist the pressure to certify 
bad parts, some in Southern California are known as "Certs R Us" shops, as one 
machine shop owner describes them. Inspectors who stand their ground are often 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose government authorities will address this subject when we slam a 747 
into an office building and it is attributed to falsified tests and 
certification on a component of the airplane," said Ron Cedillos, owner of 
Cedillos Testing Co., a Long Beach lab. 
</P>
<P>
There is some movement toward reform. The testing society is seeking to 
establish national standards for inspectors. And Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) instructed the Federal Aviation Administration in a House report 
this year to look into a system that would require independent lab testing of 
aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
Future legislation is likely to require not only that independent labs conduct 
tests, but also that tests be paid for by prime contractors rather than their 
suppliers. Prime contractors presumably would insist that parts be top-quality 
and suppliers wouldn't be able to shop for accommodating labs. Very few 
aerospace contractors have such a system today. One exception in Southern 
California is General Dynamics' Pomona Division. 
</P>
<P>
Although aircraft are made of several hundred tons of aluminum, as a general 
rule their structures are supposed to have no defect larger than the head of a 
pin -- more precisely, 3/64ths of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Expensive 
</P>
<P>
Much of a plane's critical primary structure -- the ribs, spars and frames 
whose loss could cause an accident -- must be free of any detectable defect. 
That means no voids, cracks or contamination of the metal or composite 
plastics. 
</P>
<P>
Assuring those standards depends on non-destructive testing, a procedure in 
which a part is not cut apart or otherwise destroyed to determine quality. By 
some estimates, 5% or more of an aircraft's cost can be attributed to the 
expense of testing parts. With jetliners costing up to $125 million apiece, 
testing can cost $6.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of quality control testing is the quality of those who do the 
tests. An estimated 80% of the nation's 12,000 top inspectors -- so called 
Level III test technicians -- have been qualified only by their own employers 
and have never passed tests administered by technical societies. 
</P>
<P>
Level III inspectors are the most capable, supervising Level II inspectors and 
writing procedures for them to follow. Level I inspectors, often considered 
trainees, have limited responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
There are no rules about what must be covered in written exams for inspectors, 
and parts suppliers are able to hire anyone they want to administer exams to 
inspectors and certify them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are . . . unethical people out there" who will administer examinations 
of any degree of difficulty that a company wants, said Ron Selner, manager of 
technical services at the American Society of Nondestructive Testing. "We have 
even seen documents that . . . say if a guy fails a Level II exam and gets 60% 
of the answers correct, then he is a Level I . . . You ought to go back and 
give him a Level I test. He may not be any better on a Level I." 
</P>
<P>
The current system of quality control testing gives enormous responsibility to 
inspectors. They face enormous pressures as well. Honest disagreements over the 
quality of parts can turn into heated confrontations. If inspectors stand up 
for what they believe, they risk getting fired. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Michael Lee Meadows. The veteran aerospace inspector refused to 
certify a Navy missile casing based on his evaluation that it had signs of a 
crack. His boss at El Segundo-based Airite Division of Dover Sargent Co., a 
forging house, disagreed with the conclusion. "He asked me if my opinion would 
be any different if I were standing in an unemployment line," Meadows recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Meadows, 38, refused to certify the part and was fired last year as a Level III 
non-destructive test technician. He now lives in Mojave and works for the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
Richard La Chance, Airite's general manager, said the $10,000 missile casing 
that Meadows wanted to reject was good and that Airite's metallurgist sided 
against Meadows. La Chance said the company had earlier destroyed another 
missile casing in a special destructive test to satisfy an assertion by Meadows 
that it was bad. La Chance said the destructive tests showed the unit was good, 
but Meadows said that the test proved that casing to be defective. 
</P>
<P>
"The question was, when I have a referee -- and then another referee -- and I 
still can't get parts moved, what do I do at that point?" La Chance said. "He 
refused to be a part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A High Price 
</P>
<P>
Leading quality-control experts say such incidents are not uncommon. "I lost my 
own boy three jobs in quality control simply because I taught him don't take 
anything that is second best and don't stand for any unethical practices by 
management," said Selner, the executive at the American Society of 
Nondestrutive Testing. "Because he wouldn't sign off for (defective) things, he 
got ditched. Now that was not the purported reason that he got laid off or 
fired, but that's why he lost his job." 
</P>
<P>
There are a range of quality-control tests. The most widely used include: 
fluorescent penetrant inspections, in which parts are dipped into a dye that 
exposes cracks under a black light; magnetic particle inspections, in which 
magnetic fields combined with a dye help to expose cracks; radiography, in 
which parts are X-rayed; and ultrasonic tests, in which sound waves detect 
flaws in the grain of the metal. 
</P>
<P>
The tests are sophisticated, but the cover-ups are simple. 
</P>
<P>
One inspection process requires that only a sample of parts be tested, but if 
any one part in the sample fails, then the whole batch must be tested. Getting 
around that requirement is easy. When a bad part shows up, throw it back into 
the batch, pick out another part and keep testing until you have all the good 
test parts you need. In one variation of the scheme, the same good parts are 
used over and over in X-ray examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Cases of outright fraud are increasing. VSI Inc., a leading supplier of 
aerospace rivets and other fasteners, pleaded guilty in May to four counts of 
falsifying test results. Two former quality control supervisors at the firm's 
Voi-Shan unit in Chatsworth also pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Voi-Shan possessed an approval stamp for "Inspector 11," but there was no 
Inspector 11. Rather, the stamp was used to approve defective parts, said Tom 
Runion, one of two Voi-Shan inspectors whose allegations led to the criminal 
probe. An estimated 37,000 certifications were made using the Inspector 11 
stamp, according to Runion's attorney, Will Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Northrop paid a record $17-million fine earlier this year 
when it pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it falsified tests of guidance 
systems for nuclear-armed cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In Tampa, Fla., Aerodyne Investment Castings pleaded guilty last year to 
criminal charges that it certified castings for warplanes and tanks made with 
scrap metal rather than the required virgin alloy. 
</P>
<P>
Derek J. Vander Schaaf, the Pentagon's deputy inspector general, says phony 
testing is one of his top priorities in investigating defense fraud. "We have 
had dozens and dozens of cases that have been pressed over the years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many Pentagon officials in the field view fraudulent testing as a minor 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of (fraud) as more of an exception than the rule," said 
Robert Gibson, a branch chief for quality assurance at the Pentagon's Defense 
Contract Management Region office in Los Angeles. "We deal with 5,000 (firms in 
the Southern California) region. If we thought they were all fraudulent, we 
would need an organization as large as the industry to police it." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has a local staff of 636 quality assurance representatives and 
specialists, who receive eight weeks of formal job training and then go on to 
audit contractors and conduct actual inspections of parts in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of fraud and sloppiness, some private firms are getting tougher on 
suppliers. Boeing, the world's leading aircraft producer, has tightened 
surveillance of suppliers in recent months, though it asserts that Boeing 
aircraft are safe. The company has recently assigned six workers to a special 
unit for investigating allegations of flawed products and improper testing. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has had a lot of problems with fraud cases, and we felt that was 
an untenable situation," said Bob Bogash, Boeing's director of quality 
surveillance. In addition to the fraud unit, Boeing has a contingent of several 
dozen quality-control representatives in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Rose, owner of Bell Gardens-based V&amp;W Castings, discovered the hard 
way about the Boeing quality-control representatives. On a routine inspection 
several weeks ago, a Boeing man spotted an unauthorized welding repair being 
performed on a V&amp;W casting. As a result, Boeing disqualified V&amp;W as a 
supplier, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing will permit such welding repairs, Rose said, but only if it gives 
authorization -- something he didn't get. "They saw the welded casting, and at 
that point they blew the whistle," Rose said. Despite the problem, he asserted, 
"I have integrity. I fly on airplanes myself. I don't want to go down because 
of a defective part." 
</P>
<P>
Although faulty parts won't necessarily cause an aircraft to crash, the failure 
of some critical parts poses major safety risks. The jet engine disk that 
ruptured in the Sioux City DC-10 accident was one such part. 
</P>
<P>
The disk started as a billet of titanium cast at the Titanium Metals Corp. of 
America in New Jersey and then was forged into a 27-inch disk at Alcoa Corp. in 
Cleveland. The last stop was at GE's jet engine plant in Kentucky. It was 
apparently inspected at each factory, but the flaw was never detected. 
</P>
<P>
When the disk failed, metal fragments disabled three hydraulic systems on the 
DC-10, leaving the jumbo jet with virtually no controls. 
</P>
<P>
Since the disk was made 19 years ago, General Electric and its vendors have 
changed their processes, and company officials testified in a government 
hearing that a flaw such as the one at issue in the Sioux City crash is now 
less likely to occur. General Electric officials declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The accident hearings, however, have raised questions about whether tests were 
capable of detecting the flaw even if performed correctly. Memorandums 
uncovered by federal investigators indicate that GE and Alcoa officials had 
questions about the adequacy of the tests dating back to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, serious discrepancies were found in GE's quality control records. Six 
so-called "sister disks" from the same batch of titanium were still operating 
in other engines at the time of the crash, according to production records. But 
when federal investigators recalled those disks, chemical analysis showed that 
they could not have been from the same batch, a spokesman for the National 
Transportation Safety Board said. The mystery remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FAA is concerned about what the Sioux City accident says about 
shortcomings in the system of parts testing. Leading outside experts are 
dismayed. Says Dewey, the testing society official, "We cringe when we see 
those kinds of things."

FINANCIER SILBERMAN GETS 46-MONTH PRISON TERM; 
</P>
<P>
SENTENCING: EX-GOV. BROWN'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF APOLOGIZES FOR 'THE CRIME I 
HAVE COMMITTED.' HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN A SCHEME TO LAUNDER ALLEGED DRUG 
MONEY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard T. Silberman, onetime governor's aide and wealthy financier, was 
sentenced to 46 months in federal prison Monday after saying he was sorry he 
had laundered cash he believed was drug money. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing the sentence, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving said it was 
gratifying to hear Silberman express remorse for the first time in the complex 
case. 
</P>
<P>
But it mattered more, Irving said, that Silberman, who "achieved more than most 
men could ever have dreamed of," had turned to crime, betraying himself, his 
wife -- San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding -- his family, and his 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"It boggles my mind," Irving said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving chose the prison sentence prosecutors had recommended after a plea 
bargain struck last month in which Silberman pleaded guilty to a single felony 
conspiracy count. Silberman was convicted of another felony count -- a 
technical currency violation -- in June after a two-month trial and could have 
received up to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had recommended a $75,000 fine. Irving put off that decision, 
saying he needed details of Silberman's financial status and knew only that 
Silberman said he was ruined financially, with debts of $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was likely to decide in the next few days whether to fine 
Silberman, but said he was inclined only to make Silberman pay the financial 
costs of incarceration, which he termed substantial. Irving said he would 
recommend that Silberman be assigned to a minimum-security prison camp, naming 
the facility at Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, because that would make 
it easier for visits from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, a former aide to former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., had 
been charged with seven felony counts in an alleged scheme to launder $300,000 
in cash that an undercover FBI agent had portrayed as Colombian drug profits. 
He stood impassively at a podium Monday as Irving imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Just before being sentenced, Silberman said that, in "this hour of my deep 
remorse," he was "extremely sorry for the crime I have committed." 
</P>
<P>
Golding called the case a "tragedy of a very human nature. The only thing I can 
say is that when someone you love is in trouble, you do the best to stand by 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Four other men have been charged in the complex case, two of whom already have 
pleaded guilty to a single felony count. The two others -- including reputed 
mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego -- are due to stand trial Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Norman Myers, a Malibu investment banker accused of being a courier in the 
alleged scheme, was to be sentenced Monday. Irving postponed sentencing until 
Nov. 19 -- presumably after the trial for Petti and Darryl Nakatsuka, 43, of 
Los Angeles, a security guard also accused of being a courier. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have indicated that they do not intend to call Silberman to testify 
against Petti or Nakatsuka. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman had been a key player in statewide Democratic politics since the 
mid-1970s, serving as Brown's chief of staff and, among other positions, as 
Brown's secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman achieved wealth in business, particularly in banking and fast-food 
ventures. He was a general partner during the early years of growth at the Jack 
in the Box restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
His most recent venture, a San Diego-based gold mining firm, Yuba Natural 
Resources, consistently had trouble paying its bills, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was arrested April 7, 1989, at a Mission Bay hotel and, according to 
the FBI, confessed to laundering the $300,000 and said he was searching for 
funds to save his financially troubled mining firm.

E. GERMANY BIDS WARSAW PACT FAREWELL;

EASTERN EUROPE: THE AGREEMENT COMES JUST NINE DAYS BEFORE REUNIFICATION. IN 
BONN, THE UNITY TREATY IS SIGNED.

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany, discarding two of the Communists' most cherished symbols just 
nine days before reunification, left the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on Monday and 
bade farewell to foreign ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann, a pacifist pastor, signed 
the historic agreement to quit the pact with the alliance's supreme commander, 
Soviet Gen. Pyotr Lushev. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you all the best for the future," a grim-faced Lushev told Eppelmann at 
the ceremony, which in five minutes ended 35 years of active military 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The East German news agency ADN said the signing ceremony's "mood was like that 
at a funeral" and described the atmosphere as "realistic and chilly." 
</P>
<P>
Acting head of state Sabine Bergmann-Pohl officially said farewell to all 
ambassadors accredited to East Germany at a separate reception at her 
headquarters on Marx-Engels Square. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, meanwhile, with the stroke of a pen Monday, the unification process 
became official. 
</P>
<P>
In a private ceremony witnessed only by press photographers, West German 
President Richard von Weizsaecker signed the 1,000-page unity treaty that 
details the legal and social unification of the two Germanys that will take 
effect Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
On leaving the Warsaw Pact, East Germany will hand over sensitive equipment, 
withdraw from the command structure and stop paying funds to the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
It became the first country to pull out of the seven-nation pact since the 
peaceful revolutions that swept Eastern Europe last year. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in May, 1955, the Warsaw Pact squared off against NATO forces in the 
West during the tense years of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's National People's Army was regarded as the most efficient 
fighting force in the pact, but next week its 50,000 troops will be absorbed 
into a unified German army. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Soviet Union's 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany will 
be sent home only gradually in a phased operation ending in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
This means Warsaw Pact forces will remain in part of Germany, even though the 
country as a whole will belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
At the reception for more than 100 ambassadors and charges d'affaires 
accredited to East Berlin, Bergmann-Pohl thanked them for their understanding 
of the dramatic events that put them out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors will leave by Oct. 2, the day before the two Germanys formally 
unite, and their missions will become consulates or branches of their 
countries' Bonn embassies.

<P>
Rebel leader Charles Taylor said Monday he will organize a general election in 
Liberia for Oct. 10, but a senior peacekeeping official scoffed at the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Taylor said 
the election would be open to opposition groups, including a breakaway rebel 
faction under Prince Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"By Oct. 10 we hope to have all assembly members elected," Taylor said, 
repeating his claim to be president of the West African country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sending 10 members from our delegation to meet with the other 
(Johnson's) faction to begin to discuss bringing this country back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
But in neighboring Sierra Leone, a senior official with the West African 
peacekeeping force said: "It's not a serious proposition. What does Taylor 
control? How many children attend school on his side, how many hospitals are 
open?" 
</P>
<P>
He said the peacekeeping force will press on with its mission to install an 
interim government of prominent Liberians, formed a month ago in the Gambian 
capital of Banjul and backed by countries involved in the peacekeeping effort. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia has won control of most of the 
country since it started the civil war in December. But it has been unable to 
take the central part of the capital, Monrovia, held by the remains of the late 
President Samuel K. Doe's army and Johnson's relatively small splinter group. 
Doe was killed by Johnson's troops two weeks ago.

DIPLOMACY: ASSAD APPARENTLY IS TRYING TO GET IRAN TO TAKE A TOUGHER LINE 
AGAINST IRAQ.

<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad, who is believed to be trying to persuade Iran to 
take a harder line against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis, has extended his 
visit to Tehran into a fourth day, the Iranian news agency reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
No details of Assad's talks with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani have been 
disclosed, but his visit was extended "due to the importance of the issues 
under discussion and the need to complete consultations," the Islamic Republic 
News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian leader, Iran's key Arab ally and a rival of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein, met for talks in Damascus with Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
earlier this month. The United States has voiced increasing concern that Iran 
may not abide by the U.N.-sponsored trade embargo on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Rafsanjani, at a banquet for Assad, again rejected a suggestion by 
Baker that a regional security structure be considered to keep Hussein in check 
after the current crisis is resolved, calling it an "arrogant scheme." Iran has 
interpreted Baker's suggestion as an attempt by Western powers to keep a 
long-term foothold in the oil-producing area. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not allow foreign forces and the hegemonist powers, who are all 
geared up to tighten their grip on vital oil resources, the Persian Gulf and 
the Red Sea, to remain in the region," the Iranian news agency quoted 
Rafsanjani as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has sent 4,000 troops to Saudi Arabia and pledged to send a full 
armored division of up to 15,000 additional troops, also insists that the 
American-dominated Western forces must leave the region when the crisis is 
resolved. Both Syria and Iran have demanded an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian media have reflected political divisions within the country, with 
radical-line newspapers focusing on the emotive issue of the deployment of 
Western troops in Saudi Arabia, the site of Islam's holy cities of Mecca and 
Medina. On the other hand, Tehran Radio, controlled by the brother of the 
centrist president, who favors improved ties with the West, sees a positive 
aspect to the Syrian presence there. 
</P>
<P>
"Syria," a Tehran Radio commentary said, "believes that by sending a few 
military units to Saudi Arabia to confront the Iraqi incursion, it is possible 
to prevent the expansion of the U.S.-led Western influence in the region." 
</P>
<P>
As Assad continued his talks in Tehran, leaders of exiled Iraqi opposition 
groups gathered in Damascus on Monday, underlining the Syrian opposition to 
Hussein. They included religious, Communist and Kurdish groups that claimed to 
have wide support among Iraqis living abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there is a golden opportunity now, and all opposition groups agreed 
we should postpone the discussion of ideological differences to agree on the 
toppling of the Saddam regime," said Mohammed Taqi al Mudarresi, religious 
leader of the Islamic Action Organization. He said the groups will establish a 
government in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Damascus-based diplomats said last week that the groups had little influence 
and no affinity except opposition to Hussein. The mainline Kurdish 
organizations would not take part in the Damascus conference, one diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran announced Monday that it has arrested 29 people for trying to 
smuggle food to Iraq, the Iranian news agency also reported. It was the first 
action reported by Iran to enforce the U.N. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said two groups of smugglers were handed over Sunday to the 
revolutionary court in Sanandaj, a Kurdish city 50 miles from the Iraqi border. 
The food seized included rice, flour, sugar, vegetable oil and milk.

<P>
As the U.N. Security Council prepared to tighten sanctions against Iraq by 
imposing an air traffic embargo, French President Francois Mitterrand proposed 
a four-point plan to settle the Middle East conflict. The plan calls for a 
U.N.-guaranteed Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the release of all foreign 
nationals detained as hostages -- ideas Iraq has previously rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, meanwhile, announced it would boycott the U.N. General Assembly session 
because the United States denied landing rights for an Iraqi plane for Foreign 
Minister Tarik Aziz. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Jordanian and Yemeni envoys expelled from Saudi Arabia 
this week were monitored photographing strategic oil, military and government 
installations and later meeting with Iraqi diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater characterized Saddam's new 
threat to blow up oil fields in the Middle East as part of "a daily diatribe 
from Saddam."

The West German government said it will deliver nearly $500 million worth of 
East German military equipment to the U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. The 
equipment, part of a German aid package, is expected to include some 
Soviet-made equipment no longer needed by the dying East German army. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea will contribute $220 million in cash, goods and services this year 
and next to support the multinational efforts against Iraq. The United States 
had asked for $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Hafez Assad of Syria extended his visit to Iran. He is 
believed to be urging Iran to take a tougher stand against archenemy Iraq. 
Syria has said that U.S.-dominated Western forces must leave the gulf once the 
crisis ends.

Iraq's veiled warning that it might launch war to retaliate against sanctions 
rattled oil markets, pushing prices to the highest level in a decade in London 
and to a record high in New York. The Tokyo exchange was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The prices skyrocketed despite new estimates showing that enough oil is being 
pumped to forestall, at least until winter, worldwide energy shortages. 
Analysts said the markets are moving on emotion and headlines. Nonetheless, oil 
prices caused stocks to plunge around the world.

Far fewer U.S. military reserves are likely to be called to active duty to 
support the Persian Gulf buildup than the nearly 50,000 that have been 
authorized, Pentagon sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest public accounting of reserve call-ups, the Pentagon said Thursday 
that 21,653 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard reserve forces 
have been placed on active duty since President Bush authorized use of the 
reserves Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a House committee last week that he expects 
nearly 50,000 reserves to be on active duty by Sept. 30, but a military source 
said Monday that the total is unlikely to exceed 40,000 and that it will take 
several more weeks to reach even that total. The source spoke on condition he 
not be identified.

DESERT DILEMMA: HOW TO SHUT OFF THAT DESIGNER WATER, GET BACK TO CANTEENS

<TEXT>
<P>
Even in the age of Perrier, the image is jarring: front-line American soldiers, 
clad head to toe for combat, quaffing liters of commercial bottled water that 
cost more in this country than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. Army has its way, they will soon be back to the good old canteen. 
But even after Army units solve the awesome problems involved in desalinating 
some of the saltiest water in the world, some coddling is to continue. 
Commanders believe that to wean troops from the designer stuff, they will have 
to chill the rubbery-tasting alternative that emerges from Army storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic bottles of Nissah and Yaiba currently in use are provided by 
contractors. But of the total of 1.5 million gallons of water consumed in this 
arid climate daily as part of the American presence, the U.S. military provides 
less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The rest comes from the Saudi government, which has arranged the 
round-the-clock shipments that ferry case after case of Saudi Arabia's purest 
all the way to the front. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. supply experts are far from happy with the arrangement and are 
particularly concerned at the mounting difficulties and potential danger of 
trucking water to front-line troops who have moved to increasingly isolated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to become more self-sufficient in water all the time," said Army 
Capt. Bob Stanley, an 18th Airborne Corps officer detailed to provide 18.6 
gallons of water per man per day to three full Army divisions. 
</P>
<P>
By Thanksgiving, Stanley said Monday, the Army hopes to meet 90% of the U.S. 
needs by separating the salt from sea- and well-water, and then using pipelines 
to deliver water as far as 80 miles from the source. 
</P>
<P>
By then, military officials said, the majority of troops might again rely on 
the green-plastic canteens strapped to their belts rather than on the liter 
bottle stuffed in their fatigue pockets. 
</P>
<P>
On a scorching day, however, the quartermaster officer stood on a beach along 
the Persian Gulf as a water purification detachment based at Ft. Irwin, Calif., 
told of the difficulties of turning some of the world's saltiest sea water into 
something a soldier might like to drink. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of depressing to us because the process is so slow," said Sgt. 
Eddie Maldonado, a Pico Rivera native. His 82nd Quartermaster Detachment, by 
drawing water from the Persian Gulf and piping it through an Army reverse 
osmosis system, has been able to meet no more than 20% of the predicted 
capacity of 150,000 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
So salty is the water that the self-dubbed "water dogs," the first military 
desalination unit in Saudi Arabia, must send it through the system twice. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, set up on this beach largely for training, is scheduled to move 
closer to the front in the next few days. Military experts said that there is 
no guarantee that the job will be any easier. 
</P>
<P>
The Army, responsible for supplying water to all four branches of the U.S. 
services, hopes to win Saudi government permission to drill new wells in the 
desert, where underground aquifers contain water that is brackish but far 
easier to purify. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, no such permission has been forthcoming, and the Army has had 
to rely on existing wells and the attempts to tap water directly from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the highest (saline content) we've ever used the system with," said 
Stanley, known in 18th Corps command headquarters as commander-in-chief for 
water. 
</P>
<P>
At retail prices, the bottled water costs about 18 cents a liter, about half 
again as much as gasoline in oil-rich Saudi Arabia. The cost is borne by the 
Saudi government, but military officials made it clear that they are troubled 
by the expense. 
</P>
<P>
The beachside unit visited by reporters Monday contains the only two 
large-scale desalination systems the Army has established here. There are about 
five others in the country, together with about 20 smaller units capable of 
producing about one-tenth the volume. Other units are on the way, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The reverse-osmosis purification unit, known as a ROPU, must reduce the volume 
of dissolved solids from an extraordinary 6.5% in the Persian Gulf to less than 
0.15% to meet Army standards. The process, conducted under high pressure, 
creates a chemical charge that helps to separate the pure water from the brine. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Army meets its late November production target, it will have to 
cope with the inevitable complaints from those who have become used to Nissah 
and Yaiba, which, while often warm, are also tasty. 
</P>
<P>
The Army system provides for its water to be held in massive, 50,000-gallon 
storage tanks. This tends to impart a faint taste of rubber to the water. 
</P>
<P>
To combat the opposition, Stanley said his superiors had decided to postpone 
any switch from the bottles until the Army could ship refrigeration units 
capable of cooling the water in 400-gallon "water buffalo" storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get the water chilled before we wean the soldiers off the bottled 
water," he said. But he insisted that the Army version is "not a real big 
morale killer." 
</P>
<P>
But even at the beachside unit, where swarming flies and a ban on swimming 
tempered the oceanfront allure, soldiers made their designer-water preferences 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got nothing against this stuff," a sergeant said, kicking the rubber 
storage tank as it baked in the heat, "but I'm waiting till those bottles run 
out."

SENATE PANEL MOVES TOWARD APPROVAL OF SOUTER

The Senate Judiciary Committee appeared ready to approve the nomination of 
Judge David H. Souter to the Supreme Court after its two conservative Democrats 
announced their support Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) and Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) joined five 
Republicans on the 14-member panel who have made public their support for 
Souter in advance of Thursday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, opposition from Heflin, DeConcini and Sen. Arlen Specter 
(R-Pa.), the most liberal Republican on the panel, helped doom the nomination 
of controversial Judge Robert H. Bork to the high court. All three support 
Souter. 
</P>
<P>
Heflin made clear Monday that he sees Souter, like Bork a conservative, as 
temperamentally different from the dogmatic Bork. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Souter will not bring a scorched-earth philosophy to the court, but he 
will bring a sense of historic perspective and a clearheaded approach to the 
analysis of legal issues," said Heflin, a chief justice in Alabama before 
joining the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"He has not chosen to turn back the clock on the great constitutional 
principles of our day," said DeConcini, recalling the language used against 
Bork. 
</P>
<P>
The six other Democrats and one Republican on the panel have not yet stated 
their positions, but no one has said he will vote against Souter. In the entire 
Senate, only Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) has announced that he opposes Souter. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston based his opposition on Souter's refusal to say how he would vote on 
overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot support a nominee who refuses to acknowledge that a woman's right to 
choose to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental right," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
Undecided Senate liberals were coming under some pressure to oppose the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an influential 
coalition of rights groups, called for the Senate to reject Souter. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that David Souter has demonstrated that he has a commitment 
to constitutional guarantees of individual rights and liberties," the group 
said. It cited as "astonishing" Souter's statement during the committee's 
hearings that his home state of New Hampshire does not have racial problems.

SENATE VOTES 94-1 FOR BILL TO BAR AGE BIAS IN WORKER BENEFIT PLANS 
</P>

<P>
The Senate voted overwhelmingly Monday to extend additional rights to millions 
of older workers, passing a compromise bill to bar age discrimination in 
employee benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed, 94 to 1 -- with Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.) the only no 
vote -- after Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) 
announced a technical compromise intended to allay GOP fears that the measure 
would threaten voluntary early retirement plans and unfairly burden employers. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch had voiced concern that folding employee benefits into the coverage of 
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 would cause businesses to 
"respond to this change by eliminating early retirement incentive programs -- 
programs that many older workers find very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
The bill puts the Senate on record as saying it intended the 1967 law to 
prohibit arbitrary discrimination against older employees in the administration 
of benefit programs -- unless separate treatment of workers on the basis of age 
could be justified. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the compromise gave in to a Republican demand to exempt federal 
workers from the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill overturns a Supreme Court ruling that June Betts, an Ohio public 
employee who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, was not entitled to disability 
retirement benefits because she was over 60 and only deserved her standard 
age-and-service pension. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 decision by the court last year said age discrimination laws covered 
hiring and firing, wages and salaries, other fringe benefits and terms and 
conditions of employment but were silent on employee benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This one Supreme Court ruling opened the door wide for potential 
discrimination in older workers' health, disability, life insurance and 
severance benefits," Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz said that, if the Supreme Court decision had been left uncorrected by 
Congress, it could have led to "premature exits from office and assembly lines 
by some of America's most valued employees." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, known as the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, still must be 
considered by the House. It would amend the 1967 Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act in two major areas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It makes clear that discrimination on the basis of age in virtually all 
forms of employee benefits is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It ensures that older workers are not coerced or manipulated into waiving 
their rights to seek legal relief. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum said he regretted some parts of the compromise but called it "our 
only real chance . . . this year" for a law that would help millions of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement may be a little like a hippopotamus," Hatch added. "Right away, 
some will say that it is big and ugly."

S.F. OFFICIALS WANT QUAKE-RAVAGED FREEWAY TORN DOWN

After months of often bitter debate, a deeply divided Board of Supervisors 
voted Monday that the earthquake-ravaged Embarcadero Freeway should be torn 
down and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate the board," an exultant Mayor Art Agnos told a hastily called 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes there is enough state and federal money available to replace 
the controversial elevated roadway with a surface or sub-surface artery from 
the Bay Bridge to Chinatown and North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake shook up and damaged the freeway's 
underpinnings so badly that the 1 1/2-mile roadway, Interstate 480, was quickly 
closed to all traffic -- including traffic under the devastated slab.

A memorial service is scheduled today in Long Island for Alfred Kouzel, 67, an 
Academy Award-winning cartoonist who died Sept. 6 at a hospital in Trostberg, 
West Germany, where he was being treated for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Long Island, Kouzel began his career in animation after graduate 
work at UCLA, where he produced several award-winning films. 
</P>
<P>
His "The Juggler of Our Lady" won prizes at the Brussels World's Fair. In 1960, 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an Oscar for his 
adaptation of Jules Feiffer's "Munro," about a youngster mistakenly drafted 
into the Army. He also was honored for his work in 1986 on "The Muppet Babies," 
based on the Jim Henson characters. 
</P>
<P>
Kouzel formed Ariel Productions with Eli Bauer, producing 65 syndicated 
cartoons. Earlier, he worked on the "Flintstones" and "Yogi Bear" series for 
Hanna-Barbera Productions.

WALL STREET GETS A CASE OF WAR JITTERS; DOW SINKS 59; 
</P>
<P>
STOCKS: ECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTRIBUTE TO THE ROUT. THE CLOSELY WATCHED MARKET 
INDICATOR CLOSED AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN A YEAR.

<P>
The financial markets were thrown into turmoil Monday as investors reacted to 
the combination of increasing tensions in the Middle East and domestic budget 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index dived 59.41 to 2,452.97 -- its lowest close in 
more than a year. Bond prices also fell, boosting yields for the benchmark 
30-year Treasury bill to 9.17% from 9.12% on Friday. Meanwhile, oil and gold 
prices soared. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling that war is imminent," said Michael Metz, market strategist 
at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. "If you were to lose oil production in 
Saudi Arabia, there would not be enough oil to go around at any price." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers would find themselves so financially pinched after paying their 
energy bills that they would have little left over for discretionary spending, 
Metz added. "And since 60% of the economy is based on consumer spending, that 
translates to a very dramatic economic slowdown -- probably a recession -- and 
that could happen on a worldwide basis." 
</P>
<P>
The market activity was spurred by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
announcement over the weekend that he plans to bomb Saudi Arabian oil fields if 
the economic blockade has its intended effect and begins to strangle his 
nation. Market analysts believe that oil prices could double if Hussein carries 
out his threat. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are talking $60-a-barrel oil, all bets are off for the economy. All 
bets are off for earnings, and all bets are off for the stock market," said 
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer with First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, economic problems caused by high oil prices could be worsened by the 
apparent inability of Congress to make a significant dent in the budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Congress cuts the deficit, the Federal Reserve will not lower interest 
rates. High interest rates coupled with high oil prices could have a 
devastating impact on the U.S. economy and the stock market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the worst possible combination of events for stock valuations," said 
Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative analysis at Merrill Lynch in New 
York. "Interest rates and inflation are rising, earnings are falling and there 
is a lot of uncertainty. You couldn't ask for a worse situation." 
</P>
<P>
Added Johnson: "This is partially at the doorstep of the Middle East, but it is 
also at the doorstep of Congress and their failure to reach an agreement about 
the 1991 budget." 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for the future is also bleak on Wall Street, industry analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about this market is you don't have to wait long to have some 
losses," Johnson said. "You buy a stock on Friday, and it's down two points on 
Monday." That serves to depress prices further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When investors get beaten over the head enough, they lose the sense of urgency 
to buy stocks," he added. "Stocks may look enticingly cheap, but investors 
still believe they can buy stocks cheaper tomorrow. It is a totally demoralized 
investor environment." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's selloff was broad-based, with 1,414 issues declining, compared to only 
237 advancing. The average share on the New York Stock Exchange fell 61 cents. 
Volume was moderate, with 162.21 million shares trading hands, compared to 
201.05 million shares traded on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The few winners were primarily gold stocks. 
</P>
<P>
* Newmont Gold rose 3 1/8 to 46 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Homestake Mining climbed 1 1/4 to 21 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* And Placer Dome jumped 1 to close at 18 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, banks, transportation companies, aluminum firms and blue chip stocks 
lodged steep losses. 
</P>
<P>
* Chase Manhattan, which announced a costly corporate restructuring on Friday, 
fell 1 5/8 to close at 11 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* First Chicago closed at 16 7/8, down 1 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* And Bankers Trust dropped 2 to finish the day at 32 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UAL Corp. lost 8 1/2 to close at 92 1/4 as buyout plans for the 
carrier appeared to grow more uncertain. Delta Air Lines, which forecast 
"significantly worse" earnings for the current quarter, closed down 1 3/4 to 52 
7/8. 
</P>

MARKETING: PRODUCERS FLEE HOLLYWOOD FOR THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever New York ad agency hotshots would come to visit director Fred 
Petermann at his TV commercial production company in Hollywood, they always 
wanted to go outside for walks in the California sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Once outside, however, the East Coast clients often found themselves surrounded 
by dirty air, ugly buildings and people asking them for spare change. It was as 
if they'd never left New York. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walked out the front door of our office, there was nowhere to go," 
said Petermann, who has directed commercials for American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. and Budweiser and is regarded as one of the best in the business. 
Last year, Petermann left Hollywood after 16 years and rented space in Venice. 
He is awaiting completion of a plush, new Santa Monica office building that he 
will move into in December. "I just didn't want to be in Hollywood anymore." 
</P>
<P>
He has plenty of company. The major movie studios abandoned Hollywood years 
ago, and only Paramount remains. Now, many production companies that specialize 
in making TV commercials are doing the same thing. They are cruising to the 
beach towns of Santa Monica and Venice. Luring them are new luxury hotels, fine 
restaurants and hip art galleries. Also, many top directors have moved to the 
area -- and a gaggle of hip ad agencies has also set shop there. Then, there's 
that keen desire to at least appear to be where the action is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a theme park for clients," explained Gary Buonanno, executive producer at 
Michael/Daniel Associates, which moved from Hollywood to Studio City three 
years ago and is now looking to relocate in Santa Monica. The company has 
filmed commercials for Bud Light. 
</P>
<P>
"When clients come to California, they don't want to be trapped in town. They 
want to feel like they're really in California," said Gary Feil, executive 
producer at BFCS, which has filmed ads for the California Lottery, and which 
opened in Santa Monica two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
One production company that recently moved to the beach even placed bicycles 
and roller skates in its office for clients to use. So popular have the beach 
towns become that over the past year at least six commercial production 
companies have moved from -- or announced plans to move from -- Hollywood. 
Besides Petermann Films, Michael/Daniel Associates and BFCS, plenty of others 
have their cameras focused on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Riverrun Films, which filmed those "Getting to Know You" ads for Geo 
automobiles, may soon move from Hollywood to Venice. Image Point Productions, 
which has filmed some of those roving red dot commercials for 7-Up, plans to 
move from Hollywood within the next six months -- probably to the Westside. And 
six months ago, Chelsea Pictures, which has filmed "Heartbeat of America" ads 
for Chevrolet, left Hollywood for Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Others have been there for some time, including De Sort Films, which moved 
there 11 years ago, Cucoloris Productions and Berkofsky/Barrett Productions. 
Perhaps the most sought-after director in the business, Joe Pytka, moved his 
commercial production company there in 1985. "I was enchanted by Venice because 
of its art community," said Pytka, who has directed many of Nike's Bo Jackson 
ads, as well some of the Pepsi ads that feature Michael Jackson and Madonna. 
"The creative atmosphere was like New York's Soho district 15 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But today, creativity is hardly mentioned by most. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally an image thing," said Steven Monkarsh, executive producer at 
Riverrun Films. "The commercial production companies have finally caught up 
with the art community." 
</P>
<P>
Some say the lure is the trend-setting Los Angeles ad agencies -- such as 
Chiat/Day/Mojo, Suissa &amp; Associates and the Shalek Agency -- that have 
moved to the area. "If ad agencies moved to the Mojave Desert, it wouldn't be 
long until we moved there," said Michael Romersa, chief operating officer of 
Partners USA, a production company moving to Santa Monica. Partners, which has 
filmed ads for Giorgio perfume, also owns Michael/Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the cool place to be," said Jonathan Miller, president of Image Point 
Productions. "Certainly, the advertising business is all about image and 
perception. If you're perceived to be doing trendy things, it doesn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Adds John Marias, executive producer at Chelsea Pictures, "This area is fun. 
Hollywood is an ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is frustrating officials from Hollywood. "That's the challenge of 
being in Hollywood," said Larry Morris, president of the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce. "Hollywood is a victim of its own success." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, executives at some commercial production companies that plan to stay 
in Hollywood are bemused by the movement out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"If the emperor is wearing all of his new clothes at the beach, that's fine 
with me," said Larry Morris, chief financial officer at HKM Production, which 
recently purchased and renovated a big building in Hollywood. "We're really 
happy here. And we bought the building we're in for a song." 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, the real estate in Santa Monica and Venice is very pricey. 
Executives interviewed said their rents or mortgage payments increased anywhere 
from 25% to 100% once they made the move from Hollywood to the beach. Others 
complain that parking near the beach is always scarce. And most still truck to 
Hollywood to use sound stages or special vendors. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't stopping many from making the move. Even the West Coast 
president of the Assn. of Independent Commercial Producers moved his commercial 
production company, Smillie Films, from Hollywood to Santa Monica a year and a 
half ago. "The reality is, most directors live in these areas," said Bill 
Perna. "And they don't want to keep commuting to Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Many trace the beginning of this trend back to 1979, when Jack De Sort was 
among the very first to move his production company, De Sort Films, from 
Hollywood to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
People told him he was crazy. After all, the business had always been in 
Hollywood. "I wanted to get away from Hollywood," said De Sort, who 
occasionally picnics on the roof of his office building that is one block from 
the ocean. "I wanted to be where the air was clean." 
</P>

J. W. Thompson Chief of L.A. Office Resigns 
</P>
<P>
The fast pace of change at J. Walter Thompson's Los Angeles office continues. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the agency picked up some badly needed new business but lost 
the man who has run the Los Angeles office for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the agency announced that James K. Agnew, who has been with the 
agency for 20 years, was resigning "to pursue other career interests." Bill 
Lane, executive vice president of JWT West, will assume Agnew's duties as 
general manager of J. Walter Thompson/Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lane returned to California in May after two years in New York as co-executive 
creative director at a time when the Los Angeles office was losing ad business, 
including the 20th Century Fox account. Agnew said he already had begun 
exploring the possibility of a position in one of Thompson's international 
offices when Lane returned "as part of an orderly succession." 
</P>
<P>
When that failed to pan out, Agnew said he chose to resign. "I'm excited about 
some of the opportunities that are available with my background," he said, "and 
felt it was important to be open to discuss those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Like other New York agencies that have opened Los Angeles offices, J. Walter 
Thompson has been disappointed in the results. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, however, the Los Angeles office has been getting back on its feet. As a 
result of several recent business wins, the agency has rehired four employees 
that were laid off earlier in the year, Agnew said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the agency picked up the new Los Angeles-based cruise company 
Concorde Cruises. Agnew declined to reveal the size of the billings, but 
industry sources estimate it at about $5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Concorde's new, 352-passenger ship will start operations in December, 1991, 
with seven-day cruises from Puerto Vallarta to Acapulco and Guatemala. Mexicana 
Airlines, also a client of Thompson, will be the primary air carrier to Puerto 
Vallarta. Print advertising for the new cruise line will probably begin this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tracy-Locke Finds Life Beyond Taco Bell 
</P>
<P>
Some are calling it the agency that refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
Back in April, the Los Angeles office of the Dallas ad agency Tracy-Locke lost 
the $80-million national ad business for its biggest client, Taco Bell, to 
Foote, Cone &amp; Belding's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
Massive layoffs followed. There were even rumors that the Los Angeles office 
would close. But management staunchly denied that, citing the fact that it hung 
onto the Mexican fast-food chain's $10-million regional business. Well, earlier 
this month it lost that business, too. 
</P>
<P>
Is the office doomed now? No way, insists Dan Michel, who joined the office as 
president about a year and a half ago. "We take a long view of things," said 
Michel. "And we think our chances for success here are terrific." 
</P>
<P>
He may be right. Over the past six months the agency has picked up six new 
clients, including Aqua Chem pool chemicals and Walt Disney Records. Michel 
declined to reveal the combined billings of the new clients, but they are 
believed to exceed $15 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"Taco Bell was a blessing and a burden at the same time," said Michel. "You 
can't build an agency on a single client." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cycle Campaign Isn't a Case of Typecasting 
</P>
<P>
No one's going to mistake Alan Pando for Evel Knievel. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, the Moto du Monde (Motorcycles of the World) Grand Prix-style 
racing series awarded its estimated $2-million advertising business to his 
agency, the Los Angeles office of DDB Needham Worldwide. The agency will also 
handle public relations for the new competition and seek out corporate 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Pando, president of the agency's Western operations, recalls he has only ridden 
a motorcycle once. "But I think they stopped making it after World War I," he 
said.

BAILOUT AGENCY RIPE FOR FRAUD, CONGRESS TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE RESOLUTION TRUST CORP. IS TOO DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE LAWYERS AND 
CONSULTANTS, THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE WARNS. A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN 
STAFF IS URGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The General Accounting Office warned on Monday that the Resolution Trust Corp., 
the federal agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, is understaffed and 
too heavily dependent on lawyers and consultants, making it vulnerable to fraud 
and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony at a Senate hearing, Comptroller General Charles Bowsher charged 
that more than a year after the establishment of the RTC, the agency's skeleton 
staff relies too much on outside contractors -- mainly private lawyers, 
accountants and appraisers -- to manage the $30 billion to $40 billion in 
assets that Washington has taken over from failed S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after his appearance, Bowsher said he believes that the Bush 
Administration should expand the RTC's staff substantially to avoid repeating 
the mistakes that were made in late 1988, when the government rapidly sold off 
a wide array of troubled S&amp;Ls without first accounting fully for their 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is so little government oversight of those consultants, the RTC 
could easily become the victim of a new round of S&amp;L abuse, including 
inflated fees and other conflict-of-interest problems involving attorneys and 
accountants who are hired to handle legal and financial work at failed thrifts, 
Bowsher warned. 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that the RTC still has not accounted fully for the assets it 
holds. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came as, separately, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision 
reported that losses in the S&amp;L industry moderated in the second quarter of 
1990, suggesting some relief for what is left of the financially troubled 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Private-sector S&amp;Ls -- those that have not been taken over by the 
government -- posted a combined loss of $196 million for the three-month 
period, down from $374 million in the first quarter and $3.4 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony before a governmental affairs subcommittee, Bowsher warned 
that unless the RTC's staff is beefed up with additional specialists, the 
agency's massive disposal of S&amp;L assets could turn into another debacle for 
the government, much like the recent Housing and Urban Development scandals. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot of money at HUD because we didn't have enough talent in 
government for the proper oversight of outside contractors," he said. "And when 
I saw the billions of dollars going into this program and so much of it going 
to private contractors, I was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The RTC currently has 3,200 employees, and the Bush Administration plans to 
increase that staffing to a peak of 6,200, Bowsher said -- a level that he 
insisted is meager by historical standards in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Bowsher noted, the Reconstruction Finance Corp., set up by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the New Deal to help industries whose 
companies had failed during the Depression, had as many as 12,000 staff members 
at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTC doesn't have enough staff in place," Bowsher added. "They have to have 
some management systems in place. . . . They have to have people who know what 
the assets of these S&amp;Ls are . . . or this is going to be a very bad 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chairman of the subcommittee, charged that the RTC 
is already too lax in its supervision of outside consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor said lawyers are already profiteering at the RTC's expense, charging $300 
per hour in some cases. And he warned that inflated fees charged by consultants 
and private contractors could seriously reduce the amount of money the 
government will be able to take out of the S&amp;Ls that it sells to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Pryor's charges, Lamar Kelly, director of the RTC's asset 
management division, acknowledged that the agency has no way of knowing whether 
any conflicts of interest exist among the thousands of lawyers and other 
professionals hired to oversee the failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the RTC now has 120,000 legal cases pending and that it has been 
forced to hire thousands of lawyers around the nation without cross-checking on 
their backgrounds to determine whether they have previously been involved in 
questionable S&amp;L transactions.

IN SMOKER DEATH CASE, FAMILY WINS BUT GETS NO AWARD 
</P>

<P>
In a stunning verdict Monday night, a jury here found American Tobacco Co. 
liable for the lung cancer death of a longtime smoker but awarded zero damages 
to his family. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, seen as a victory for the tobacco industry in its fight to 
discourage smoker death lawsuits, shocked the lawyers, Wall Street consultants 
and reporters who packed the courtroom in the 150-year-old courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before rendering its verdict on the wrongful 
death claim brought by the family of Nathan H. Horton, a carpenter and 
contractor who died in 1987 at age 50 after smoking American's Pall Mall brand 
for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a baffling decision," said a litigation consultant for a Wall 
Street investment firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It sounds like 
it's continuing to protect the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the verdict was read by Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen, lawyers 
for American Tobacco asked him to "reform" the verdict, contending that since 
no damages were due to plaintiffs, judgment should be entered for the tobacco 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Hortons, who had been seeking punitive damages of $15 million, 
moved for Bogen to award at least nominal damages or to set a new trial on the 
issue of damages alone. 
</P>
<P>
Bogen said he would take both motions under advisement and left the courtroom 
without further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict came just before 7 p.m. on a 9-3 vote. It was uncertain whether the 
three dissenters had favored a clear judgment for American or a damage award 
for the Hortons. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at home Monday night, jury foreman David G. Roach said the verdict was 
a compromise between jurors who were about evenly split between plaintiffs and 
defendants. "It was a very high likelihood of a hung jury," said Roach, 41, 
deputy director of computing and information systems at the University of 
Mississippi. "This was a verdict that nine out of 12 could accept." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome could prove discouraging to plaintiffs' lawyers since it shows they 
must contend not only with the tobacco industry's high-powered legal defense 
but with the hostility of jurors toward smokers who ignore health warnings yet 
seek damages for smoking-related disease. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Feuerman, a tobacco analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Monday night 
called the verdict "very positive" for the industry "because it basically 
confirms the industry's long-term record" of defeating smoker death claims. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston and 
chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages lawsuits 
against tobacco companies, said: "The upside of this is that the tobacco 
companies, even in the Deep South, even with six smokers on the jury, can't 
come up with a verdict anymore. The downside is, we're still waiting for our 
verdict." 
</P>
<P>
The number of smoker death claims against the industry has dwindled from about 
120 two years ago to about 55 today. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of eight women and four men included six smokers, of whom five 
reportedly stated on jury questionnaires that they could kick the habit if they 
tried. That was seen as a negative for plaintiffs, who said Horton had tried 
but was unable to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's verdict actually makes it three trials out of the last five that the 
industry failed to win. Still, the tobacco companies' 35-year record of never 
paying a nickel to a customer who contracted smoking-related disease remains 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, a federal jury in Newark, N.J., awarded $400,000 damages in a 
smoker death case, but the verdict was overturned on appeal last January and a 
new trial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, the first Horton trial ended in a hung jury when bitterly 
divided jurors, split 7-5 in American's favor, refused to continue deliberating 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for American declined comment after the verdict in the retrial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Horton attorney Don Barrett, obviously disappointed, said: "The longest journey 
must begin with a single step. That's all I have to say."

KEATING ASKS APPEALS COURT TO REDUCE BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr., on his sixth day in Los Angeles County Jail, asked a 
state appellate court on Monday to lift or reduce his $5-million bail while he 
awaits trial on state securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Keating claim in their petition -- technically a writ of habeas 
corpus -- to the California Court of Appeal that he is being held under an 
excessive bail that violates provisions of the state Constitution and the 
Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the bail) bears no relation to ensuring Keating's appearance at future 
proceedings," the appeal states. "It is 50 times higher than bail set for other 
defendants faced with identical charges." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, former chairman of American Continental Corp., the former parent of 
failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, was jailed last Tuesday after a 
42-count indictment was unsealed in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
No hearing has been set on Keating's petition. The Los Angeles County District 
Attorney's office, which earlier did not object to Keating's release on his own 
recognizance, said it would fight efforts to lift or reduce the bail. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner set the $5-million bail for Keating, citing 
the severity of the charges. Keating and three co-defendants are charged with 
misleading mostly elderly investors in the purchase of more than $200 million 
in American Continental bonds through Lincoln branches. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of hearings last week, Klausner rejected arguments to lower 
Keating's bail. The judge said Keating was a flight risk because of criminal 
charges, investigations and civil lawsuits filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, said his client's six children would 
provide most of the security for a reduced bail and that he would never skip 
town and leave them with the debt. "There is no risk of flight in this case," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who just three years ago estimated his wealth at nearly $40 million, 
has testified that he is now destitute. His former accountant testified last 
week that Keating has a negative net worth of $5.2 million. Federal regulators, 
however, have expressed skepticism of his claim of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
They have been investigating him since they seized Lincoln in April, 1989 -- a 
day after American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. It is estimated 
that Lincoln's collapse -- caused by risky investments in real estate and junk 
bonds -- will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion, making it one of the 
most expensive thrift failures ever. 
</P>
<P>
A special state grand jury, impaneled last April, indicted Keating and three of 
his former aides Sept. 13 on state securities law violations stemming from the 
sale of American Continental debt securities at Lincoln's 29 Southern 
California branches. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's bonds are now nearly worthless. Many of the bond buyers 
said they were misled into believing that the bonds were as safe as federally 
insured deposits. The bonds, however, were not insured. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner stunned everyone when he set the high bail for Keating because Los 
Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, acting as a special state prosecutor in the 
case, had not sought such a high bond. The judge also initially set the 
co-defendants' bail at $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Klausner reduced the bail on Judy J. Wischer, former American 
Continental president, to $200,000 and cut the bail on Robin S. Symes and Ray 
C. Fidel, both former Lincoln presidents, to $100,000 each. All three posted 
bail and were released. 
</P>
<P>
All four defendants are scheduled for arraignment on Oct. 5.

Lockheed Rebuffs Simmons: Lockheed Corp. said its board rejected a proposal 
from Texas investor Harold C. Simmons to eliminate Lockheed's "poison pill" 
anti-takeover defense provision. The defense gives Lockheed the right to sell 
stock to other shareholders at a discount if a hostile buyer acquires 20% or 
more of the company's stock, a provision that would dilute the stake of an 
unfriendly suitor. 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries, a Houston-based chemical company controlled by Simmons, owns 
19.8% and last month said it was willing to buy another 10 million shares from 
a Lockheed employee stock ownership plan if the aerospace firm removed its 
poison pill. Lockheed said Simmons, who made an unsuccessful bid for control of 
Lockheed Corp. last spring, will not be exempted from the poison pill 
provision.

Wolf Accused of Bad Faith: United Airlines pilots accused UAL Corp. Chairman 
Stephen M. Wolf of trying to undermine them in a letter that was seen as an 
indication that the proposed $4.4-billion buyout of the carrier is in deep 
trouble. In a four-page letter to its members, the United Airlines unit of the 
Air Line Pilots Assn. said Wolf is telling the company's board that employee 
ownership is not widely supported by the union's members. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, some members of the board believe him, and the board will 
decide our collective future on Oct. 9 based on Mr. Wolf's allegations," the 
group said. Oct. 9 is the deadline for the pilot-led group to arrange financing 
for the $201-a-share deal, which the board accepted in April. UAL stock 
plummeted $8.50 on Monday to $92.25.

FCC Chairman Unveils Fin/Syn Timetable: In speech before the Academy of 
Television Arts &amp; Sciences, FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes said the Federal 
Communications Commission would hold public hearings on the financial interest 
and syndication rules later this year and hoped to have a report and order 
issued by the first quarter of 1991. The fin/syn rules prohibit the three TV 
networks from earning hundreds of millions in profits off reruns of old TV 
shows. Sikes said his mind was not made up about how he will rule in the 
proceeding but termed the erosion of network share of viewers "important."

JERRY WEINTRAUB QUITS HIS FIRM, JOINS WARNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Weintraub resigned Monday as chairman and chief executive of Weintraub 
Entertainment Group, which has sought protection in bankruptcy court, to 
produce movies for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation appears to leave Kenneth Kleinberg, Weintraub Entertainment's 
president, as the company's top-ranking officer. But it wasn't immediately 
clear whether Kleinberg, 47, would assume the chief executive's post. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Weintraub Entertainment bondholder said he believed that 
Kleinberg, a longtime entertainment attorney, would leave the independent film 
studio. "I think Kleinberg's going to resign too," the bondholder said. 
Kleinberg didn't return a call to his office, and Weintraub declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, 52, produced the major hit "Oh, God" for Warner Bros. before forming 
his ill-starred independent company in 1987. In a statement, Warner Bros. 
Chairman Robert Daly and President Terry Semel said: "(Jerry Weintraub's) 
creativity as a producer, along with his broad-ranging relationships with key 
members of our creative community, make us happy to welcome him into the Warner 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub's resignation follows a tug of war among Weintraub Entertainment 
creditors over his services. Some creditors had argued that Weintraub should 
remain with the company while seeking to associate it with Warner under a deal 
that might provide some payoff to creditors from his future productions. 
</P>
<P>
Others, who ultimately prevailed, argued that Weintraub Entertainment might 
fare better under new leadership. "Jerry originally wanted to do this through 
the company, and I think that would have been a good thing. . . . 
Unfortunately, there were creditors who didn't want it," a person familiar with 
the situation said. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub Entertainment, which owes about $175 million to its banks and 
bondholders, filed earlier this month for protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and has been trying to reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Oh, God," Weintraub scored hits with "The Karate Kid" for 
Columbia, "Diner" for MGM/UA and "Nashville" for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
But that golden touch never materialized at the Weintraub company, which lost 
millions of dollars on "My Stepmother Is an Alien," "Listen to Me," "Troop 
Beverly Hills" and other films. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal with Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc., the studio will 
provide Weintraub with staff, office space and film development funds. 
Weintraub Entertainment remains attached to Columbia Pictures under an overall 
distribution agreement for its films.

LABOR: DEMOCRACY GAINS IN TEAMSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three court-appointed administrators with enormous power over the 
scandal-plagued Teamsters Union have made remarkable progress in their effort 
to democratize the giant organization and eliminate the pervasive influence 
that organized crime has had on it for nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
The gains have not come easily. The international officers have been waging an 
expensive legal fight to block almost every move the outside administrators 
make -- even those moves most of the officers themselves liked and had agreed 
to accept last year in a court consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear why the top officers decided to spend millions of the union's 
dollars vainly fighting the administrators, who several officers privately 
admit are generally doing a good if costly job. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the legal battle has been pushed by the union's feisty president, 
William McCarthy, who was infuriated by the presence of the administrators. But 
most of the Teamsters' 18 highest officers, including McCarthy, signed the 
unprecedented consent decree to avoid court trials of a few of them on 
corruption charges and the rest on charges that they permitted corruption in 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
The administrators were empowered to oust corrupt leaders, including those 
found to have underworld ties; to supervise operations of the union, and to 
conduct scrupulously honest elections. Much of their goal has been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Now several of the officers have quietly joined forces to implement a plausible 
plan they hope will retain the gains made under the administrators and still 
help them keep their well-paid positions. 
</P>
<P>
The informal inside group is said to be willing to continue cleaning up the 
union by creating an ethical practices committee under the effective 
court-appointed investigating officer, Charles Carberry. 
</P>
<P>
The group is also reportedly ready to continue government-conducted elections 
of local union delegates to the international conventions, probably with the 
second administrator, Michael Holland, who is now doing it under the consent 
decree. However, they want to scrap their previous acceptance of a secret 
ballot referendum procedure that would give each of the 1.4 million members the 
chance to vote directly for top union officers. They expect that delegates to 
next summer's convention will reject the referendum, unless the court 
intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, they have to quell the furious power struggle raging among the 
officers and reach a consensus on a candidate for the presidency and a single 
slate of candidates for the other top offices. They expect to achieve their 
unity goal before the union's international executive board meets in two weeks 
in Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
If they can unite their forces and scuttle the referendum, they will reduce the 
already slim chance of a victory by Ron Carey, the dissident reform candidate 
whose hope for success rests in part on a continued split among the current 
leaders and on his vigorous, direct appeal to the members. 
</P>
<P>
Even without new, attractive leaders like Carey, the union is not what it was a 
year ago when the administrators were appointed by U.S. District Judge David 
Edelstein. 
</P>
<P>
Carberry, the administrator named to clean up corruption, has taken action 
against 40 officials at the national and local levels, and his cleanup effort 
is continuing. Half of the members of the old executive board have either been 
removed or left voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Although government investigators say some remaining officials are still linked 
to the underworld, the grip that mobsters had on the union has been badly 
weakened and will soon be broken entirely if the cleanup continues. 
</P>
<P>
The other encouraging news comes from Holland, the administrator in charge of 
democratizing the union. He says the procedure now being used to elect 
delegates to the Teamsters' convention next July is "the best I have ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Edelstein said the election system that Holland put in place means "the 
coming of the light of freedom to this dark union." 
</P>
<P>
Carey agrees, saying the system for electing convention delegates is "honest, 
and now it is up to the members to elect him and make sure corruption is never 
again tolerated in the Teamsters, as it has been for so long." 
</P>
<P>
He is struggling, though, to defeat the attempt to kill the promised referendum 
election and instead allow delegates to elect officers at the convention in 
Orlando, Fla., next June 24-28. 
</P>
<P>
Like almost all unions, the Teamsters have traditionally elected their officers 
at conventions. Carey and others say that may be fine for other unions but not 
for Teamster conventions, which have always been dominated by local officers, 
who are delegates because of their positions. 
</P>
<P>
The local officers are strongly influenced by entrenched national leaders whose 
power stems from their ability to dole out jobs and other forms of patronage. 
</P>
<P>
However, even in fairly conducted elections, delegates are expected to once 
again include most of the local officers because they seem to be popular with 
their own members. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, 71, has indicated that he wants to keep his job, but that won't be 
easy if the inside group can agree on a consensus candidate. McCarthy 
apparently isn't being considered. 
</P>
<P>
Among several incumbents said to be in the running are vice presidents Arnie 
Weinmeister, Walter Shea, R. V. Durham, Mike Riley and Weldon Mathis, the 
union's general secretary, who narrowly lost to McCarthy in 1988, when the 
executive board named a successor to the late Jackie Presser. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the public fight for power that is so rare in the Teamsters nor the 
move to back out of the nationwide referendum can diminish the impressive gains 
already made to reform the country's largest union.

NORTH AMERICAN S&amp;L SENTENCES ISSUED; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE TWO DEFENDANTS, WHOM THE JUDGE BELIEVED WERE MINOR PLAYERS IN A 
MASSIVE FRAUD, AVOID JAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The final two defendants in the North America Savings &amp; Loan scandal were 
each sentenced Monday to serve one month in a halfway house and ordered to pay 
$35,000 in restitution and fines for laundering $1.5 million stolen from the 
now-defunct thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Armando J. Vasquez, 53, and Frederick Youngdahl, 55, were convicted last month 
of bank fraud for submitting phony invoices to North America and then returning 
the money they received -- minus a $25,000 laundering fee -- to thrift Chairman 
Duayne D. Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler in Santa Ana denied a request 
by federal prosecutors to imprison the men, agreeing with the defense that they 
were bit players in a fraud that is estimated to have cost taxpayers $120 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely sorry that my actions, however small, hurt the public," said 
Vasquez, a Costa Mesa architect. "I am ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
Youngdahl, a Newport Beach engineer, declined to comment in court. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana-based North America was seized by regulators in 1987. The case was 
described by federal authorities as particularly egregious because the 
masterminds behind the fraud -- Christensen and consultant Janet Faye McKinzie 
-- spent much of the thrift's money on extravagances such as Rolls-Royces and 
lavish parties. 
</P>
<P>
In March, McKinzie was convicted of 22 of 26 counts against her, including 
racketeering, conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate transportation 
of stolen property. Stotler sentenced her to 20 years in jail, the harshest 
punishment meted out in California and the second-longest nationwide for an 
insider in the nation's savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
The former real estate agent and high-school dropout had contended that she was 
temporarily insane because she was under the influence of prescription drugs as 
well as Christensen himself, whom her attorney characterized as "the Jim Jones 
of the savings and loan industry." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez and Youngdahl maintained that they too were taken in by Christensen, a 
major client of both men. Christensen was an unindicted co-conspirator in the 
North America trials, having died in a mysterious car accident just 9 1/2 hours 
before regulators seized North America. 
</P>
<P>
Youngdahl's attorney, Richard G. Hirsch, said his client was still in something 
of a fog about the transactions that got him into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Youngdahl to this day is still somewhat under the spell of Dr. 
Christensen," Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul L. Seave told Stotler he didn't believe the 
defendants' stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Each defendant, a successful entrepreneur, portrayed himself as an innocent 
dupe, totally ignorant of any wrongdoing -- or even the possibility of 
wrongdoing -- by Christensen," Seave said in his sentencing recommendation. 
"The defendants' stories, in the government's view, were wholly incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Stotler denied a federal recommendation that the two men pay millions of 
dollars in restitution, saying that the $13.5 million that McKinzie was ordered 
to return in restitution and fines would cover the money stolen through the 
money laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe Mr. Vasquez when he says it won't happen again," Stotler said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's sentencing marked the end of the federal government's criminal 
prosecution of those involved in the North America fraud. Altogether, seven 
people were convicted.

WAR'S WAKE: You won't see Orange County in PBS' acclaimed Civil War documentary 
this week, but the war had an effect here: It made possible the massive Irvine 
Ranch. . . . At war's end, cotton trade with the South was so disrupted that 
demand for wool skyrocketed. Four ranchers bought land here to graze sheep, and 
one, James Irvine, above, eventually bought out the others and wound up owning 
a fifth of the county's territory. Irvine's heirs later began development, most 
notably in the city that bears his name. Michael Flagg and Mark Landsbaum

25 VIETNAMESE JOURNALISTS IN COUNTY DENOUNCE KILLING OF COLUMNIST, WIFE

The slaying of a controversial Vietnamese-American magazine columnist and his 
wife in Virginia prompted Vietnamese-language newspaper publishers in Little 
Saigon on Monday to denounce what one editor called "terrorism against 
newsmen." 
</P>
<P>
Triet Le, 61, is the ninth Vietnamese emigre journalist to be attacked or 
killed since 1980. The victims include a Garden Grove publisher who died in an 
arson fire in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Le and his wife, Tuyet Thi Dang-Tran, 52, were found dead of gunshot wounds in 
the driveway of their home in Baileys Crossroads, Va., about 11:30 p.m. 
Saturday, a Fairfax County police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not comment on a possible motive Monday, and had made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the Vietnamese news media have been killed, and . . . the 
government didn't find out who did it," said Dinh D. Nguyen, editor-in-chief of 
the Westminster-based weekly magazine Dieu Hau, or The Eagle. About 25 
Vietnamese publishers, editors and other journalists signed a statement Monday 
night denouncing terrorism, threats and killing of writers regardless of the 
motivation. They called on U.S. authorities to investigate assassinations of 
four newsmen and to take steps to protect writers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We call for more attention (by U.S. authorities) to this kind of terrorism 
against Vietnamese newsmen," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Le's children by a previous marriage live in Orange County and were 
headed back to Virginia for their father's funeral, which is scheduled 
Thursday, said Len Phuong, who worked with Le at Van Nghe Tien Phong magazine 
in Arlington, Va. The bimonthly magazine has a staff of five and an 
international circulation of 14,000, Phuong said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Le enjoyed a wide following, he had been criticized for sensationalism 
and for personal attacks on a number of Vietnamese political figures, community 
leaders and other prominent exiles. He was also the subject of a libel suit, 
Phuong confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a critical mind, so there is some group of people that do not like 
him," Phuong said. "But what he wrote was the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Others who knew Le described him Monday as a fiercely anti-communist muckraker 
who reported -- some say fabricated -- everything from political intrigue to 
corruption to adultery. Though he wrote under the pen name Tu Rua, his real 
name was well known and he had accumulated a long list of personal and 
political enemies, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the most controversial Vietnamese journalists and one of the most 
famous," said Yen Ngoc Do, editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News in Westminster, 
who said he himself was once tongue-lashed in print by Le. "He had so many, 
many, many enemies." 
</P>
<P>
"He has very bitterly attacked almost everyone in the Vietnamese community," 
said another prominent emigre whom Le had accused in print of pro-communist 
leanings. "It could be a lot of people, but I would lean toward a political 
motive (for the Le killing) rather than a personal one." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the magazine's publisher, Nguyen Thanh Hoang, was the target of 
an arson attack that damaged his home and car. Two years later, Hoang's name 
appeared with several others on the "hit list" of a Vietnamese extremist 
organization. Last November, a page designer for the magazine, Nhan Trong Do, 
was found shot to death outside his home. Police have not made an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese extremist groups have claimed responsibility for a number of 
previous attacks on newspaper editors and publishers whom they accused of 
communist leanings, including the 1987 arson death of Garden Grove publisher 
Tap Van Pham. The Vietnamese Party to Exterminate the Communists and Restore 
the Nation claimed responsibility for the attack, which investigators believe 
was motivated by Pham's acceptance of advertisements that were perceived by 
some as pro-communist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the FBI announced an investigation into political violence in the 
Vietnamese exile community after reports of political motives in attacks around 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Bill Coulter, spokesman for Fairfax County police, would not comment 
Monday on whether any group had claimed responsibility for the Le killings, nor 
would he say whether the FBI had been asked to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in Santa Ana, Jim Neilson, declined to say whether the 1988 
FBI investigation is still active. No indictments have been made, and the 
majority of the attacks have gone unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Phuong said Le had received numerous death threats during his 13-year career, 
as have many other Vietnamese-American writers, editors and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
"It does sound like a campaign to stifle dissent or eliminate rival or 
discordant voices within an exile community," said Bruce Hoffman, a domestic 
terrorism expert with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Cuban, Armenian, Filipino and Taiwanese exile communities, Hoffman 
said, the attackers could be motivated by politics or by a personal vendetta, 
or could use one to mask the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Often it can be a mixture of things, but if you claim it as a political 
attack, the perpetrators gain legitimacy and notoriety that they wouldn't 
otherwise have," Hoffman said.

QUAYLE TO JOIN PURSUIT OF VIETNAMESE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After stepping out of a naturalization ceremony, one of the first sights a new 
Vietnamese-American citizen in Orange County will likely see is a Republican 
voter registration table. 
</P>
<P>
County Republicans sent the first Vietnamese-American delegate to their party's 
national convention in 1988. And the GOP has opened a campaign office in 
Westminster's Little Saigon during every election since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Vice President Dan Quayle will continue the party's aggressive effort to 
win the political hearts of the county's rapidly growing Southeast Asian 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle is scheduled to attend the opening of the Asian-American Republican 
Headquarters in Westminster, where leaders of the Vietnamese and Korean 
communities will launch voter registration efforts for the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will be joined by California's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Pete 
Wilson, who helped open the same headquarters during his successful 1988 U.S. 
Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very conscious in terms of outreach to the Asian community for 
some years, knowing the Asian population is growing," said county Republican 
Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes. "We think the Southeast Asian community has a very 
strong potential for growing its ranks within the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other parts of California, the Asian community in Orange County is made 
up largely of Vietnamese and Koreans. There are about 120,000 
Vietnamese-Americans in Orange County, the largest concentration of Vietnamese 
outside their native country. And just blocks away is the nation's 
second-largest Korean community with about 80,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republicans detected a sympathy for their politics among the 
newly arrived Vietnamese shortly after the community began to grow in the early 
1980s. Many refugees were attracted to the hard-line anti-communist politics of 
President Reagan and later, to Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
But even with its rapid growth, the Asian population still represents barely 6% 
of Dornan's congressional district and an even smaller portion of the 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ky Ngo, the Vietnamese delegate to the 1988 Republican convention, said of his 
community's GOP bent: "We know more than 95% vote Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason most people register Republican is that it is strongly 
anti-communist," he said. "We are the Vietnamese refugees, we escaped 
communists, we escaped from oppression." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Republican effort is an investment in the future, as the county's 
Asian community grows. For this election, however, the GOP is aiming at the 
closely fought reelection of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) who 
represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have also launched a registration drive in the Vietnamese community 
on behalf of Pringle's opponent, Tom Umberg. Umberg's campaign manager, George 
Urch, said they have three Vietnamese-speaking workers assigned to register 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
QUAYLE'S ITINERARY 
</P>
<P>
Here is Vice President Dan Quayle's itinerary for his Orange County tour today. 
</P>
<P>
11:40 a.m.: He will arrive at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station aboard Air Force 
II and give brief remarks to Marines. 
</P>
<P>
12:30 p.m.: Quayle will attend a private fund-raising luncheon in Newport 
Beach, sponsored by the state and county Republican Party organizations. 
Sponsors expect about 70 people to attend at a cost of $1,000 per couple. 
</P>
<P>
1 p.m.: He will attend a meeting of Orange County Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
2:10 p.m.: The vice president will arrive in Westminster for the opening of the 
Asian American Republican Headquarters. He will be joined by Sen. Pete Wilson, 
Republican nominee for governor, and Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), 
who is seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
3:10 p.m. Quayle will depart from El Toro and fly to Los Angeles to attend an 
evening fund-raiser for state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), the 
Republican nominee for lieutenant governor.

SURROGATE SAYS CHILDBIRTH IS TOO GREAT A BOND

Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson said Monday that the public has unfairly 
condemned her for the most natural of all instincts: a mother's deep bond to 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is fighting for shared custody of the baby boy she bore Wednesday 
for an infertile couple, said she has suffered widespread criticism for backing 
out of the $10,000 surrogate contract she signed. But she said the connection 
between mother and child is more important than any promise she made about 
giving up the child to his genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not allowed to change my mind, you might as well take the rest of my 
rights away too," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Your feelings always change during pregnancy. That one statement I made one 
time, you can't really go by that. My feelings are constantly changing. I have 
a right to change my mind. 
</P>
<P>
"But now people view me as a person not good to her word, or think that I'm 
just seeking publicity, that I should just give the baby and not argue about 
it. But how can you detach yourself from the feelings of being a mother?" 
</P>
<P>
Because of the deeply emotional nature of childbirth, Johnson said the 
surrogate arrangement ought to be treated like adoption, in which a birth 
mother has a certain period of time to decide if she will give up her child. 
She said it is "not fair" that surrogate mothers do not have that option. 
</P>
<P>
The newborn is currently living with Mark and Crispina Calvert, the infertile 
couple who hired Johnson to bear a child conceived in a laboratory from their 
sperm and egg. Johnson visits the baby boy daily, but further court proceedings 
will determine if that arrangement will last. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who calls the baby Matthew, wants a shared parenting arrangement. She 
said she wants to be a permanent part of the boy's life. 
</P>
<P>
"He will always be my son, no matter what," she said. "He knows my voice. He 
latches onto me when I'm breast feeding as though we had never been separated. 
He still knows who his mother is." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, rejected allegations that she chose to fight for her child in 
order to gain publicity or more money. She said she developed an inextricable 
bond to the child when he was in her womb. Giving birth to him gives her 
parental rights, she said, and added that she will not give them up, even for 
the sake of shortening what could be a prolonged court fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a battle between the Calverts and myself," she said. "It's like 
having a rag doll in the middle and pulling. We both love the child so much 
that neither side wants to give in. 
</P>
<P>
"But how can I give up? I love my son and will fight for him until there's 
nothing left in my body." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if she feels that the most important thing is to create a peaceful 
environment for the child, Johnson responded: "Isn't it important for the child 
to know his mother?" 
</P>
<P>
She lamented having gotten involved in the surrogate arrangement and said she 
would advise others not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people get hurt in the long run, and the one most hurt is the baby," 
Johnson said. "When he's older, it will be hard to explain to him why he has 
three parents." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said surrogate contracts have too much potential to go wrong. Looking 
back, Johnson believes that both she and the Calverts, who call the child 
Christopher Michael, were naive and put too much trust in each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I have become more cautious now, about everything," Johnson said. "About 
people, about my environment. I was too trusting to begin with. I think on both 
sides we were." 
</P>
<P>
Now, when she visits the baby, it's "a little uneasy being in the same house, 
but we make the most of it," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she can tell the baby gets "stressed out" by the arrangement, and is 
confused by the three-parent feeding schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But she still feels that spending time with him is the best thing for the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we (surrogate mothers) are carrying donated sperm and egg, we are 
still the mothers," she said. "The child comes out of our bodies. That makes it 
ours. We are connected forever to that child."

AIDS VICTIMS MOURNED AT VIGIL; 
</P>

MEMORIAL: MORE THAN 1,000 COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE REMEMBERED, AMONG THEM A

Gay activists and relatives of AIDS patients held a candlelight vigil Monday 
evening to mourn the more than 1,000 Orange County residents who have died from 
the illness, including an Orange County gay leader who succumbed on the eve of 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Werner P. Kuhn, one of the most prominent leaders of Orange County's gay 
community during the 1980s and a noted advocate of AIDS patients statewide, 
died Sunday of complications arising from the disease. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn was among those eulogized Monday night by more than 100 gay activists and 
relatives of AIDS patients during the vigil held in front of the Orange County 
Hall of Administration to commemorate Orange County residents who have died 
from the illness over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
The county's AIDS death toll reached 1,003 at the end of August, said Dr. Penny 
Weismuller, disease control manager for the county's Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn served as executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Community Service 
Center of Orange County from 1985 until late last year, when he resigned for 
personal reasons and moved to Santa Monica. He became ill while attending the 
Santa Fe Opera Festival last month and was hospitalized shortly thereafter, 
according to a statement released by his companion, Charles Hankins. 
</P>
<P>
He died Sunday at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Werner was one of the strongest leaders of the gay and lesbian communities in 
Orange County," said Laguna Beach Councilman Robert F. Gentry, the county's 
only openly gay elected official. "He came to Orange County from the East Coast 
with a style that was no-nonsense, upfront and tell-it-like-it-was." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Rye, N.Y., to German immigrant parents, Kuhn graduated from Dartmouth 
College and earned law and business degrees at Columbia University. He lived in 
Albany, N.Y., from 1973 to 1985 and helped found that city's Lesbian and Gay 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's candlelight vigil was designed not only to remember those who died but 
also to send a message to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, said Jeff 
LeTourneau, co-chairman of the Orange County Visibility League, the lesbian and 
gay civil rights organization that sponsored the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the county to be aware of the prevalence of this disease," LeTourneau 
said. "We also want to create political awareness and pressure the Board of 
Supervisors to pass an AIDS anti-discrimination measure." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed measure, which would have banned discrimination against AIDS 
patients, was defeated 3 to 2 by the board in June, 1989, leaving Orange County 
the only urban area in California without such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn led the fight for the measure -- over the objections of other gay leaders, 
who feared that the gay community would be hurt by its failure, said Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
"Werner would not take no for an answer," Gentry said. "It failed, but we all 
learned something about the needs of people with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Visibility League will ask the supervisors to reintroduce the 
anti-discrimination measure at today's board meeting. They said the measure 
will encourage AIDS testing and help reduce the number of AIDS cases in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Jemison-Smith, AIDS coordinator at UCI Medical Center, said the number of 
AIDS patients in the county is increasing, with about 42 new cases being 
diagnosed each month. 
</P>
<P>
"What a difference 10 years makes," Jemison-Smith said in a speech at the 
memorial. "Who would have dreamed 10 years ago that we would be here this 
evening mourning 1,000 friends?"

A new weapon to combat fraudulent telephone-sales and investment schemes may be 
coming to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council tonight is expected to pass a law requiring anyone who wants 
to operate an investment or telephone-sales company in Irvine to fill out an 
extra page of information about their business and themselves to receive a 
business license. 
</P>
<P>
"The form will give us more information on these companies, and it will make 
them jump through the hoops, so to speak, so we can determine if they are 
legitimate," Police Sgt. David Freedland said. 
</P>
<P>
The form requires applicants to divulge whether they are registered with 
various state and federal agencies regulating investment companies, whether the 
owner of the business has been convicted of fraud-related offenses and whether 
the business operates out of a post-office box or postal center. Y

RESIDENTS SAY POLICE SLOW IN RESPONDING

<P>
The Police Department is investigating complaints that officers were slow in 
responding to a brawl in which a 17-year-old youth was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who remained unidentified Monday, was fatally shot in the chest late 
Saturday night at a wedding reception at a house in the 1300 block of South 
Rosewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Another unidentified youth received gunshot wounds and is in serious condition 
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred three days after Santa Ana police announced that gang 
violence was on the decline. It was a record 13th gang-related killing this 
year in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents continued to express anger Monday at the way police handled the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe a life could have been saved if they had gotten here when they 
were called out," said Frank Balderrama, who lives on the same street. 
</P>
<P>
Balderrama said he called 911 four times to report the scene that preceded the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
"They (police) asked me if I was willing to sign a complaint," Balderrama said. 
"I told them they had a riot on their hands. Let them produce the tapes and 
show us what these so-called emergencies were" that delayed the arrival of 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police had no immediate response to the charges beyond saying that 
officers are reviewing the 911 tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are gathering information about the calls to see how many there were and 
when they were received," Lt. Robert Helton said. DAVAN MAHARAJ

CITY REJECTS RESCUE OF GROVE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A last-ditch plea to rescue the financially strapped Grove Shakespeare Festival 
was rejected Monday night by the Garden Grove City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council, on a 3-2 vote, turned down two proposals to save the festival. 
</P>
<P>
The first proposal was to give the Grove festival $30,000 normally allocated 
for televising the Strawberry Festival Parade. The second was to give the 
festival $20,000 in redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
The council had voted two weeks ago to spend $7,248 to temporarily help the 
festival through what Barbara Hammerman, the managing director of the festival, 
called "a short-term but serious cash-flow crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday night, the board of directors for the Garden Grove Assn. for Arts, 
the parent organization for the festival, voted to cancel "A Child's Christmas 
in Wales," the final play in the 1990 season but to proceed with "The 
Importance of Being Earnest" on Oct. 4 at the Gem Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hammerman, to close down the festival will cost an estimated 
$120,000, including refunds and lost deposits.

BOY FREED OF CHARGE IN PLAYMATE'S DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
At the request of the victim's mother, Orange County prosecutors on Monday 
dismissed criminal charges against a 12-year-old La Palma boy accused of the 
fatal shooting of his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, was scheduled to go on 
trial Monday before Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney said that he discussed the case with the 
victim's mother, Paula LaFortune, and learned she did not want the prosecution 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The critical issue, Romney said, was whether the youth had the knowledge that 
what he was doing could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim's mother told us that the two boys were so close, he would never 
have pointed the gun at her son if he'd known he could have hurt him," Romney 
said. "She said this boy had suffered enough for what he'd done and she hoped 
we would not go forward." JERRY HICKS

VOLLEYBALL VIOLATIONS REVEALED;

CAL STATE FULLERTON: NCAA RULE INFRACTIONS DISCOVERED IN ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT'S 
INQUIRY INTO WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL PROGRAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
An athletic department inquiry has uncovered NCAA rule violations in Cal State 
Fullerton's women's volleyball program, including a student-athlete who spent a 
night at Coach Jim Huffman's house and the hiring of two of her teammates to 
work for a private volleyball team operated by Huffman's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the university's volleyball "coaching staff permitted members of the 
team to utilize the volleyball office phones to make local calls," also in 
violation of NCAA regulations, according to a Sept. 24 preliminary report by 
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll. However, the eight telephone calls 
amounted only to $1.16 in toll charges, according to Carroll's report, a copy 
of which was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said all the infractions are considered "secondary violations" of NCAA 
rules and typically result in either private or informal reprimands from the 
Big West Conference. He said he will make a full report to the conference by 
late October and that the university also "will take action if it is felt any 
is needed." 
</P>
<P>
Big West Commissioner Jim Haney said Monday that "in essence, the amount (of 
the telephone expense) does not make a difference. The rule is a rule." 
</P>
<P>
"Yet in evaluating the rule as to the severity of the violation, the time, the 
frequency, local calls versus long distance are all important," Haney said. He 
did not comment on the other allegations, saying that the details have not yet 
been forwarded by Fullerton officials. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman and his assistant coach, Marlon Sano, said Monday they were unaware at 
the time that their actions might have violated NCAA regulations. The use of 
phones and other alleged improper activity has stopped, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said he has no idea what action might be taken against him or the 
volleyball program. "It's not like I was giving them cars and slipping them 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sano: "I don't think anything is really going to come of it." 
</P>
<P>
The probe, which Carroll described as an "inquiry" and not an "investigation," 
began with allegations lodged by a former volleyball team member, whom 
university sources declined to identify. Huffman said the former player making 
the allegations was "a kid who was unhappy because the role I wanted her to 
play wasn't the role she wanted to play" on the team. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the inquiry, Huffman volunteered information about the use 
of team members as paid assistant coaches on Sano's private club volleyball 
team, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Carroll's inquiry into the unauthorized use of Huffman's office 
telephone continues. 
</P>
<P>
A final report to the Big West Conference is expected by late October, Carroll 
said. "I am not done with my phone research and I anticipate being able to 
identify additional calls," Carroll wrote in a memo to Barbara Stone, faculty 
athletics representative. "However, I firmly believe the total dollars will 
remain very small. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we are done, the offending student-athletes will be required to reimburse 
the cost of the toll calls they made," Carroll wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Carroll characterized the telephone violations as "very 
minor" and the permitting of a player to spend the night at Huffman's home as a 
"minimal" infraction. The most serious of the violations, Carroll said, was the 
hiring last spring of volleyball student-athletes to coach a club team run by 
Sano. 
</P>
<P>
The student-athletes, whom university officials declined to identify, also were 
transported to the club team's tournaments by Huffman and Sano in violation of 
NCAA rules, Carroll said. But Carroll downplayed the significance of those 
violations, saying the hiring of student-athletes as assistants on club 
programs operated by their university coaches is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman "did not realize that it was a violation of NCAA rules as it is a 
common practice in California NCAA Division I women's volleyball programs," 
Carroll wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll also found that a volleyball team member was provided a key to Sano's 
house in order "to feed his dogs" while Sano and his wife were on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to problems the player was having with her own housing situation, she 
spent two nights at coach Sano's house," Carroll wrote. "This may be a 
violation of NCAA rules." 
</P>
<P>
The same player stayed at Huffman's house when he and his roommate were home, 
which violated NCAA rules that permit "no extra benefit" beyond financial aid 
administered by the college. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said Monday that it had been a case of "a kid who has got a problem and 
you're trying to help them out. Obviously, it won't happen again."

HIGHLY RECRUITED CHEROKEE PARKS TO BEGIN COLLEGE TRIPS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: MARINA'S 6-FOOT-11 SENIOR CENTER HAS NARROWED HIS CHOICES TO 
ARIZONA, ARIZONA STATE, DUKE, KENTUCKY AND UCLA.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five shoe boxes sit under Cherokee Parks' bed, but they don't house the Marina 
High School center's size 14 basketball shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Parks uses the boxes to file the hundreds of recruiting letters he receives 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
He recently has added a file cabinet to keep the hundreds of recruiting letters 
from schools including Duke, Arizona, Arizona State, Kentucky, UCLA, Indiana, 
Michigan, Syracuse, North Carolina, North Carolina State and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't even begin to count the number of letters I have," Parks said. 
"There's a ton of them." 
</P>
<P>
Parks received his first recruiting letter in the eighth grade. He had been 
playing basketball only a few months when the letter came from Stanford Coach 
Mike Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Montgomery was the first to see the potential. Perhaps he was getting 
an early start on a gangly 14-year-old who, at the time, hated playing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Montgomery just wanted a head start on Parks, now one of the most 
sought-after high school basketball players in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Parks averaged 22.1 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.5 blocked shots 
and shot 59% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter, he has averaged more than 20 points and 10 rebounds per 
game since his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Steve Popovich said Parks could be the most highly recruited 
basketball player in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
"(Mater Dei's) Tom Lewis and LeRon Ellis were highly recruited," Popovich said. 
"But Cherokee keeps getting mentioned in the top four or five nationally." 
</P>
<P>
That allows Parks to be picky. 
</P>
<P>
He narrowed his choices to five schools -- Arizona, Arizona State, Duke, 
Kentucky and UCLA. Their combined record last season was 105-57, with Duke, 
Arizona and UCLA reaching the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Parks based his decision on the quality and needs of each program, his 
impressions of the coaching staffs and the players. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly it came down to the coaches and the players they're recruiting," Parks 
said. "Location was kind of a factor, but it wasn't the main reason." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five finalists have told Parks, a center, that he will move to 
power forward if he comes to their school. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . at least until I get a little bulk on me," said Parks, who would like 
to add 12 pounds to his playing weight of 228 pounds. "I still want to keep my 
body fat (percentage) low." 
</P>
<P>
Because his final five choices are located all over the nation, Parks said he 
will make his decision after visiting the campuses. He said he hasn't decided 
yet if he'll commit to a college before the high school season begins. 
</P>
<P>
So in the next two months, Parks will be rolling up more frequent flier miles 
than the Cal State Fullerton football team. The airlines are going to love the 
kid. 
</P>
<P>
 So, without further ado, Mr. Parks, here is your itinerary: 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 14-16, Lexington, Ky.: Parks will jump off the plane just in time to 
catch the Wildcats' Midnight Madness practice to kick off the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats were one of the first teams to schedule a midnight scrimmage, and 
the school goes all out -- cheerleaders, the band, the works. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be something else," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of the trip will be meeting with Wildcat Coach Rick Pitino, 
who visited Parks in Huntington Beach two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitino coached Providence and with the Knicks and he turned both teams 
around," Parks said. "After coaching in the NBA, he knows what it takes to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky is currently finishing the last year of an NCAA probation, the result 
of infractions during the recruitment of former Los Angeles Fairfax star Chris 
Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 19-21, Durham, N.C.: Duke's record under Coach Mike Krzyzewski -- four 
Final Four appearances in the last five years and 231-101 in the last 10 
seasons -- appeals to Parks. But he knows little about Durham, and is curious 
about the Atlantic Coast Conference campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about living in a different part of the country," Parks said. 
"That's why I want to take the trips." 
</P>
<P>
Parks will attend basketball practices and a football game and will stay with 
the Blue Devil players. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 26-28, Tempe, Ariz.: Parks has seen this campus before, having watched the 
Pac-10 basketball tournament in Tempe last year. During his recruiting trip 
he'll watch the USC-Arizona State football game, sit in during classes and 
watch practice. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, he'll meet with Sun Devil Coach Bill Frieder. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder made quite an impression on Parks and his mother, Debe, when he visited 
their home in early September. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is that guy's life," Parks said. "He's fanatical." 
</P>
<P>
"When he came in, he was dressed all nice and neat," Parks said. "Then we 
started talking basketball with him. He starts running his hands through his 
hair and by the time he left, he was a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 2-4, Tucson, Ariz: A week after his trip to Tempe, Parks will return to 
another Arizona campus. 
</P>
<P>
Parks was in eighth grade when he first met Wildcat Coach Lute Olson. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to watch (former Marina star) Mark Georgeson in a game," Parks said. 
"I didn't even know who Olson was. That shows you what little I knew about 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Parks was one of the few people around Marina who didn't know 
of Olson, who coached the Vikings from 1965 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 16-18, Westwood: No need for a plane ticket here. Westwood's just a 
30-minute ride up the 405 freeway from Parks' home. 
</P>
<P>
Parks is a regular at UCLA basketball games and several of his friends and 
Marina graduates go to school there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice, big school," Parks said. "I want to go to a big school." 
</P>
<P>
Many people in the recruiting circle say UCLA has a lock on Parks. But Parks 
says that's not necessarily so. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have a talented core of young players -- Tracy Murray, Don MacLean 
and freshmen Shon Tarver and Ed O'Bannon. Tyus Edney of Long Beach Poly, one of 
the top point guard recruits in Southern California, orally committed to UCLA 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"(Coach Jim) Harrick's building an awesome program there," Parks said. "UCLA 
will be good if I decide to sign late. I can see how the team does this year." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, everyone wants to know what Parks is doing. Rarely does a 
night go by that his phone isn't ringing off the hook with calls from 
reporters, coaches and recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters from as far away as Chicago, Raleigh, N.C., and Philadelphia 
regularly call local papers, asking about Parks. One magazine writer even 
interviewed the Marina equipment manager about Parks' college choices, Popovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the uniqueness of his name," Popovich said. "With a name like 
that, people automatically latch onto it. I think it (his popularity) would be 
different if his name was John Jones or something." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone already knows Parks has one of the greatest names in basketball. But 
he wants to show he has the greatest all-round game. 
</P>
<P>
College coaches all over the nation have watched Parks play the last three 
summers at the Nike Camp in Princeton, N.J. Parks has gone against some of the 
best players in the country, including Shawn Bradley, a 7-4 center now at 
Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I love going there because you can go all out," Parks said. "The officials 
working our games are trying out for jobs in the ACC and the Big East, and they 
allow you to be aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn a lot at those camps. You find out that the turnaround (jump shot) 
doesn't work against the bigger guys. It gets sprayed back in your face." 
</P>
<P>
Said Popovich: "The camp has helped Cherokee exposure-wise, but I don't know 
how much basketball-wise. A guy can be a great player in his own community, but 
a camp like that will let him see how he stacks up nationally." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Parks found out how he stacks up internationally. He averaged 39 
points and 18 rebounds per game for a Southern California all-star team that 
played in Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Parks said the games in Sweden gave him a taste of what to expect in college. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of 6-8 guys and the European style is very aggressive," he 
said. "Over the back is unknown there."

IRVINE VALLEY GETS OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT WITH RENEWED SOCCER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Valley College men's soccer team is off to an impressive start that 
belies its young age. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley had a soccer team in 1985, but the program was dropped for 
financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But about a year ago, the college began looking into the possibility of 
starting a sports program and decided to begin small, with a men's soccer team 
in the fall and a softball team in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Martin McGrogan, who is also the boys' soccer coach at Corona del Mar High 
School, was hired as Irvine Valley's coach in June. Since high school boys' 
soccer is played in the winter, there should be no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract players, McGrogan started the program with a summer 
class. From there, the team has gotten off to the best start among Orange 
County teams. Irvine Valley is 7-0-1 and won its first tournament -- the 
MiraCosta Tournament -- two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Daman leads Irvine Valley with seven goals and keeper Aaron Ryan has three 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very fortunate," McGrogan said. "We are in a very good soccer area. We 
tried to get the word out and get some players, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley will get a solid indication of where it stands starting today, 
when the Lasers travel to Orange Coast for a 3 p.m. match to open the Orange 
Empire Conference season. OCC (3-4) is the defending state champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates are led on offense by Andy Strouse, who was the conference player 
of the year last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had a chance to get off to a good start," McGrogan said. "And now 
we're getting greedy. We would like it to continue, but now it gets much 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Despite winning, El Camino (3-0) was bounced from the top spot of the weekly 
Southland football poll. The Warriors defeated Saddleback, 31-24, but 
Bakersfield (2-0) took over the No. 1 position. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield defeated Glendale, 31-3, Saturday, after starting the season Sept. 
8 with a 44-8 thumping of Navarro, Tex., the J.C. Grid-Wire defending national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (2-0) fell to second in the poll, with Riverside (2-0) third. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (2-0) is fourth, Fullerton (2-0) fifth, Moorpark (2-0) sixth, 
Pasadena (2-0) seventh, Golden West (2-0) eighth, Cerritos (2-1) ninth and 
Santa Monica (2-0) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's best two games, Rancho Santiago is at El Camino and Pasadena is 
at Fullerton, both at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Don Watson, the Orange Coast water polo coach, has put together an impressive 
streak of Orange Empire Conference victories in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's teams have won 42 consecutive matches and three titles coming into 
this season. OCC extended the streak to 43 last Tuesday with a victory over 
Rancho Santiago and is hoping for 44 today when the Pirates play host to 
Cypress at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast finished third last weekend in the Merced Tournament. Golden West, 
the defending state champion, defeated OCC, 11-7, in the semifinal match. 
Golden West led, 6-5, after three quarters before pulling away in the final 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West was defeated in the championship match, 9-7, by Cuesta. Golden 
West, the defending South Coast Conference champion, opens conference play 
Wednesday with a 3:30 p.m. match at Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Kevin Leon leads the Mission Conference in punting after two games. 
Leon, a sophomore from Esperanza, is averaging 41.9 yards in his eight punts. 
He has a long of 66 yards. . . . Mark Recktenwald of Orange Coast leads the 
conference in kickoff returns. He has averaged 41.3 yards in three tries with a 
long of 55. . . . Kari Calliham is averaging 12 kills per match and the Cypress 
women's volleyball team has opened the season at 4-0. Cypress was 6-12 last 
season and 0-19 in 1988.

Cal State Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy likes to refer to his traveling 
band of Titans as the road warriors, but these days, they're just road weary. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three weekends, Fullerton has logged more than 12,000 air miles, 
about 1,000 road miles and has spent at least a dozen hours waiting in 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention three defeats, to Auburn (38-17), Mississippi State (27-13) and 
Akron (48-17). 
</P>
<P>
"All the travel could be catching up to us," Murphy admitted Monday. "There are 
a lot of things I'd like to say that I'm not going to say, but you can read 
into that." 
</P>
<P>
We can? Let's give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, we're just tickled to death that our athletic department changed 
Saturday's Fresno State game from a home game to an away game so we could make 
more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we get to spend even more time on buses, another night in a hotel and 
play another game in a hostile environment. Now, we'll have five consecutive 
away games instead of three. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, bad read. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy doesn't like playing games he has virtually no chance of winning, like 
the one Sept. 8 against Auburn. And he doesn't like playing five consecutive 
road games, like he will by the time the Oct. 6 game at Nevada Las Vegas rolls 
around. 
</P>
<P>
But he has learned to bite his tongue when it comes to criticizing the athletic 
administration for its scheduling philosophy. That will only get him in hot 
water. 
</P>
<P>
So instead, he tries to find something positive in the situation and focus on 
that. Here's Murphy's upbeat outlook for this week: 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been great to play a home game, but we don't have to leave too 
early Friday, the bus ride to Fresno isn't that long, and we should get plenty 
of rest before the game. In the past, players have told me they'd rather play 
at Fresno because they attract big crowds, it's big-time football, and it's 
first-class all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was very pleased with his team's effort against Auburn and Mississippi 
State, but he couldn't say the same about Saturday's game, in which Fullerton 
blew a 10-0 first-quarter lead and was badly outplayed by Akron from the second 
quarter on. 
</P>
<P>
"Some played hard and some didn't -- it was a matter of inconsistency," Murphy 
said. "We didn't match the effort of the previous two games." 
</P>
<P>
One player, quarterback Paul Schulte, might have given too much effort, Murphy 
said. Schulte passed for 183 yards in the first quarter but went on to throw 
five interceptions and complete just one more pass in the second and third 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a competitive son of a buck, but he may have done something against his 
nature by trying to make big plays by himself," Murphy said. "There are very 
few athletes in our conference who can do that, but when we fell behind, he 
tried to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the players were emotionally fatigued and physically exhausted 
after the Akron game, but he believes they'll bounce back this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The positive thing about this week is we play a conference game, and our kids 
get excited about those," Murphy said. "So from an emotional standpoint, we 
should be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Titan baseball Coach Augie Garrido, who returned to Fullerton in August after 
three seasons at Illinois, held his first fall practice Monday, and his wasn't 
the only new face on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido and first-year assistant George Horton have recruited nine more 
players, including former Cerritos College all-state pitcher Dan Naulty, to 
join the 10 returning players and the five players recruited by former Coach 
Larry Cochell. 
</P>
<P>
Naulty, a former Ocean View High School pitcher, is a hard-throwing, 6-foot-5 
right-hander who has a sidearm motion. He had signed with Miami last spring but 
wasn't accepted to the school. He has been admitted to Fullerton, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido has also added community college pitchers Yusef Ford (Laney), Paco 
Chavez (Cerritos) and Darin Pometta (Merced), and outfielders Chris Powell 
(Cerritos), Craig Fairbrother (Cerritos) and Jeff Manship (Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
Two Illinois players, infielder Jason Moler, a former Esperanza standout, and 
outfielder Vic Boyd, a former Mater Dei standout, have transferred to 
Fullerton, but neither has received a release yet from Illinois Athletic 
Director John Mackovic. Moler and Boyd will redshirt this season and become 
eligible next year. If they don't get releases, Moler will have two years of 
eligibility remaining and Boyd three. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Bailey, a former Mission Viejo High and Rancho Santiago College pitcher 
who was academically ineligible last spring, will join the Titans this season. 
</P>
<P>
However, former Golden West College pitcher Jason Hutchins, who signed with 
Fullerton last spring and said he would honor his commitment if Garrido became 
coach, has enrolled at Texas A &amp; M, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Football Coach Gene Murphy said there's an "outside chance" that injured 
starters Terry Tramble (safety), Michael Jones (rover) and Kerry Reed 
(receiver) will return for Saturday's game at Fresno State. Tramble broke his 
left forearm against Auburn, Jones broke a finger in the season opener against 
Sonoma State, and Reed damaged knee ligaments against Sonoma State. Offensive 
guard Shannon Illingworth, who injured his knee in practice after the Sonoma 
State game, will miss at least one more game. Offensive tackle Mike Simmons, 
who missed the Akron game because of a sprained ankle, is questionable for the 
Fresno State game, as is reserve tackle Jim DeFelippo, who started Saturday in 
place of Simmons and suffered shoulder and knee injuries. . . . Including the 
1983 California Bowl game, this will be Murphy's ninth game at Fresno in 11 
years. Under Murphy, the Titans are 2-6 at Bulldog Stadium. . . . The 7 p.m. 
game will be televised live on SportsChannel with Greg Papa and Jack Snow 
calling the action. . . . The two-time defending Big West Conference champion 
Bulldogs are 4-0 with victories over Eastern Michigan, New Mexico, Utah and New 
Mexico. They are averaging 34.5 points and 485 total yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan baseball team will play 10 games this fall, beginning with an Oct. 25 
contest at Chaffey College. Nine of the games are against community college 
teams. . . . According to American Volleyball Coaches Assn. statistics, Titan 
junior middle blocker Stephanie Scofield is ranked 16th in the nation in digs 
per game with an average of 4.35. The Fullerton volleyball team fell to 3-10, 
0-2 in conference with losses to Cal State Long Beach and UC Irvine last 
weekend.

S&amp;L BAILOUT AGENCY IS RIPE FOR FRAUD, GAO TELLS CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The General Accounting Office warned on Monday that the Resolution Trust Corp., 
the federal agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, is understaffed and 
too heavily dependent on lawyers and consultants, making it vulnerable to fraud 
and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony at a Senate hearing, Comptroller General Charles Bowsher charged 
that more than a year after the establishment of the RTC, the agency's skeleton 
staff relies too much on outside contractors -- mainly private lawyers, 
accountants and appraisers -- to manage the $30 billion to $40 billion in 
assets that Washington has taken over from failed S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after his appearance, Bowsher said he believes that the Bush 
</P>
<P>
Administration should expand the RTC's staff substantially to avoid repeating 
the mistakes that were made in late 1988, when the government rapidly sold off 
a wide array of troubled S&amp;Ls without first accounting fully for their 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is so little government oversight of those consultants, the RTC 
could easily become the victim of a new round of S&amp;L abuse, including 
inflated fees and other conflict-of-interest problems involving attorneys and 
accountants who are hired to handle legal and financial work at failed thrifts, 
Bowsher warned. 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that the RTC still has not accounted fully for the assets it 
holds. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came as, separately, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision 
reported that losses in the S&amp;L industry moderated in the second quarter of 
1990, suggesting some relief for what is left of the financially troubled 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Private-sector S&amp;Ls -- those that have not been taken over by the 
government -- posted a combined loss of $196 million for the three-month 
period, down from $374 million in the first quarter and $3.4 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony before a governmental affairs subcommittee, Bowsher warned 
that unless the RTC's staff is beefed up with additional specialists, the 
agency's massive disposal of S&amp;L assets could turn into another debacle for 
the government, much like the recent Housing and Urban Development scandals. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot of money at HUD because we didn't have enough talent in 
government for the proper oversight of outside contractors," he said. "And when 
I saw the billions of dollars going into this program and so much of it going 
to private contractors, I was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The RTC currently has 3,200 employees, and the Bush Administration plans to 
increase that staffing to a peak of 6,200, Bowsher said -- a level that he 
insisted is meager by historical standards in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Bowsher noted, the Reconstruction Finance Corp., set up by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the New Deal to help industries whose 
companies had failed during the Depression, had as many as 12,000 staff members 
at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTC doesn't have enough staff in place," Bowsher added. "They have to have 
some management systems in place. . . . They have to have people who know what 
the assets of these S&amp;Ls are . . . or this is going to be a very bad 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chairman of the subcommittee, charged that the RTC 
is already too lax in its supervision of outside consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor said lawyers are already profiteering at the RTC's expense, charging $300 
per hour in some cases. And he warned that inflated fees charged by consultants 
and private contractors could seriously reduce the amount of money the 
government will be able to take out of the S&amp;Ls that it sells to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Pryor's charges, Lamar Kelly, director of the RTC's asset 
management division, acknowledged that the agency has no way of knowing whether 
any conflicts of interest exist among the thousands of lawyers and other 
professionals hired to oversee the failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the RTC now has 120,000 legal cases pending and that it has been 
forced to hire thousands of lawyers around the nation without cross-checking on 
their backgrounds to determine whether they have previously been involved in 
questionable S&amp;L transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor also complained that the RTC's headquarters in Washington does not appear 
to have much control over the agency's regional offices, where most of the 
agency's day-to-day work is actually taking place. 
</P>
<P>
That lack of communication is holding up the negotiations involved in some 
sales of S&amp;Ls, and is also making it easy for questionable entrepreneurs, 
who previously were involved in the S&amp;L scandal, to invest in the industry 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"The carcass (of the thrift industry) is out there lying on the beach, and I 
don't want to see someone else get to the meat that's left before the public," 
Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement in the industry's overall loss figures last quarter, 
Timothy Ryan, the OTS director, said continued softening in many of the 
nation's real estate markets may make it difficult for the thrift industry to 
continue to reduce its quarterly losses through the remainder of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He added that total assets held by the industry, including assets at thrifts 
now controlled by the government, declined by $20 billion from first-quarter 
levels. Deposits fell by $13 billion during the period. 
</P>
<P>
Some $89 billion in deposits has flowed out of the nation's thrifts over the 
last 12 months. Most of the outflows have come at institutions already acquired 
by the RTC, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to predict that the industry will become profitable this 
year," Ryan said.

BREN, SMITH GO ANOTHER ROUND IN LEGAL BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: AT ISSUE NOW ARE INTEREST ON THE HEIRESS'S AWARD AND PAYMENT OF LEGAL 
FEES IN THE 7-YEAR COURT FIGHT OVER THE VALUE OF HER STAKE IN THE IRVINE CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BIRMINGHAM, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two squads of California lawyers unpacked their pin-striped suits and legal 
briefs here Monday and prepared to do battle this morning over as much as $180 
million in interest due from a 1983 sale of stock in the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is the latest skirmish in a 7-year legal war that pits Joan Irvine 
Smith, whose grandfather founded the sprawling Irvine Ranch, against Donald L. 
Bren, the Newport Beach billionaire who now controls the real estate giant. 
</P>
<P>
A Michigan court referee in June decided that Smith and her mother, Athalie 
Clarke, should get $149 million for their 11% stake in the company. What 
remains to be decided is the interest -- accumulated over 7 years -- owed to 
Smith on that award. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's lawyers will argue that the interest rate should be determined under a 
Michigan law in force in 1983, when the sale occurred. That law leaves the 
interest rate up to the referee within certain limits, probably including a 
Michigan law that caps interest rates at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The heiress's lawyers say they may ask for as much as a 12% compound interest 
rate, which would amount to an additional $180 million for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. lawyers will argue that the referee should elect to follow 
another Michigan law that took effect only last year but before the referee 
ruled on the case. That law sets the interest rate in such cases at the 
company's borrowing rate, which the company says has averaged between 9% and 
10% over the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also argue that the amount be computed using simple interest. 
In other words, each year's interest would not be added into the principle on 
which subsequent interest is figured. At 10% simple interest, the amount due 
Smith would be $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
The complex case is being heard in Michigan because the company is incorporated 
there. The lawsuit was filed by the company in 1983 when it could not come to 
an agreement with Smith over what she should be paid for her stock. The case 
came to trial in 1987 and took up 150 days in court over the next two years 
before referee Robert B. Webster, a retired judge, issued his opinion in June. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, whose grandfather James Irvine founded the ranch in the 19th Century, 
had asked $330 million for her stake, saying the company was worth $3 billion. 
Irvine Co. Chairman Bren, 58, one of the nation's richest men, offered her $114 
million when he bought control of the company in 1983. Bren valued the 
company's assets at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
After months of testimony by Bren, company executives, Smith, her mother and 
expert witnesses for both sides, the referee set the value of the company's 
vast landholdings and office, apartment and industrial buildings at $1.36 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The award to Smith was far less than she had asked for, but $35 million -- or 
about 35% -- more than the company had offered her. Both sides claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue to be settled is payment of legal costs of more than $30 million, 
or $15 million each, expended in the 7-year dispute, according to the company's 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Each side will argue in a hearing today and Wednesday that the other side 
should pay the legal costs. Smith's lawyers decline to say how much the court 
battle has cost the pugnacious heiress, who has quarreled with company 
management for 30 of her 57 years. 
</P>
<P>
And, say both sides, the case could continue through further costly hearings if 
the referee agrees with Smith's contention that he should follow the old law 
and use his discretion in setting the interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
That would likely require more time and more expensive expert witnesses, say 
lawyers for both sides. There is also a chance, the Irvine Co. says, that the 
referee could set a lower interest rate than either side is now discussing. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Bren and Smith have discussed settling the matter out of court. 
"But the short answer is that we're still quite far apart," said William B. 
Campbell, a lawyer for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a settlement is unlikely is not surprising. The trial testimony 
has, at times, reflected some hard feelings between Bren, the urbane 
billionaire, and Smith, the feisty horsewoman. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's lawyers accused Bren of trying to stampede Smith and other shareholders 
into selling their stock by sowing dissent on the company's board. While the 
referee didn't consider it a major point, he did note in his June opinion that 
an accounting firm which shareholders relied on for an estimate of the 
company's value, Los Angeles-based Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., was secretly in 
the employ of Bren at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Bren's lawyers argued that Smith's experts had wildly overestimated the value 
of the company, and, in fact, the referee said that one of the chief experts, 
prominent consultant Steven E. Roulac of San Francisco, was unconvincing in his 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The company's lawyers also argued that Smith is an eccentric, litigious woman 
who simply likes battling the powerful landowning and development company, 
which was originally formed to manage the Irvine family's huge ranch. In fact, 
as they attempt to recover the company's legal fees, Irvine Co. lawyers will 
argue that Smith filed the suit merely to be "vexatious." 
</P>
<P>
But Howard I. Friedman, Smith's lawyer, denies that. "There's clearly nothing 
vexatious about our case at all, and that's clear from the fact the referee 
gave us a third more money than Mr. Bren was offering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case has dragged on for so long because it is extremely difficult to set a 
value on privately held companies, especially one as unique as the Irvine Co., 
which owns about one-sixth of the land in Orange County and is said to be the 
largest private urban landholder in America. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the largest such cases on record, since few people can afford the 
time and expense of bringing such an action. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides will also argue that the referee made mathematical and technical 
errors in setting a value on the company that could decrease Smith's award by 
$17 million or increase it by as much as $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Smith hasn't collected a penny and won't until these matters are 
settled and the results certified by the Michigan courts. The case has been 
heard by a referee outside the court system so as not to tie up a courtroom and 
a judge for years. 
</P>
<P>
How much interest is awarded and whether one side must pay the other's costs 
will go a long way toward bolstering one side's claim to victory. 
</P>
<P>
What seems certain now is that still more time will pass before the referee 
decides which law -- the old or the new -- will guide him in determining the 
interest. At that time, a second -- and last -- hearing will be scheduled in 
this affluent Detroit suburb. Depending on how the referee rules after this 
week's hearing, the second hearing could be merely a formality or another long 
chapter in this lengthy fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IRVINE CO. VS. JOAN IRVINE SMITH 
</P>
<P>
In June, a court referee ruled that Irvine Co. must pay $149 million to Joan 
Irvine Smith and her mother, Athalie Clarke, for their 11% interest in the real 
estate development firm. That was $35 million more than the company agreed to 
pay her in 1983. Still to be resolved are four major issues: 
</P>
<P>
The amount of interest that the company should pay Smith on the $149-million 
award for the past seven years. The interest could amount to as much as $180 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The payment of attorney fees and court costs. Both sides say the combined costs 
exceed $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whether damages should be assessed to either side for violations of pretrial 
orders or discovery abuses in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the referee's determination of the company's 1983 value of $1.36 
billion ought to be adjusted because of errors.

KIRKPATRICK SEEN IN KEY POST AT PARAMOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON and MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Kirkpatrick, a onetime screenwriter who moved into the executive ranks, 
appears to be next in line for the co-presidency of Paramount Pictures, a 
high-profile post that Sidney Ganis is expected to vacate soon. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis and studio Chairman Frank Mancuso have been negotiating Ganis' exit for 
more than a week, according to a source at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The co-president, who is 50 and has two years remaining under his employment 
contract with Paramount, is expected to remain with the studio as a consultant 
and an independent producer, according to studio sources. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis didn't return a call seeking comment. Kirkpatrick also declined comment. 
A Paramount spokeswoman said: "This is all speculation, and we can't comment on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of Ganis' departure began circulating in July, when Kirkpatrick left 
Walt Disney Co. to join Paramount as executive vice president. Kirkpatrick was 
given extensive authority over filmmaking when he joined the studio, and he 
quickly pushed Ganis aside in what some Hollywood observers described as a 
classic power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry sources expressed surprise that Paramount would put film 
production in the hands of Kirkpatrick, rather than a better-known executive 
such as former Paramount President Ned Tanen. "To have David and a bunch of 
kids running the studio isn't going to send the right message to Wall Street," 
one top talent agent said of the 38-year-old Kirkpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Tanen, who is 59, stayed on as a consultant to Paramount after resigning the 
presidency but has repeatedly told associates that he isn't interested in 
returning to an executive role. He didn't return a call Monday seeking comment 
on his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso, 56, is said to have taken a much stronger hand in script and casting 
decisions at Paramount over the past several weeks, and some insiders 
speculated Monday that Mancuso would continue to involve himself more directly 
in movie decisions under a Kirkpatrick regime. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis, who came to Paramount after working as marketing vice president and 
principal aide to filmmaker George Lucas at his Marin County ranch, has been 
blamed by some in Hollywood for weakening Paramount's standing in the creative 
community during his two-year tenure as co-president. Several agents and 
producers have complained that the former marketing chief is indecisive and 
slow to act and that his cost-cutting efforts alienated some talent. (Paramount 
marketing and distribution chief Barry London is the other co-president.) 
</P>
<P>
Ganis didn't have strong relations with Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, two 
of the most successful producers on the Paramount lot, and had argued against 
signing their lucrative production deal last year. But he is close to Francis 
Ford Coppola, among other filmmakers, and even as the studio's marketing chief 
he argued strongly in favor of producing "Tucker" to lure the director into 
making "The Godfather, Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Ganis partisans maintain that he was unfairly blamed for Paramount's problems. 
They say, for instance, that Paramount's tough business affairs department 
repeatedly undermined him. "Sid made many decisions that business affairs 
overruled," one defender said. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis is given much of the credit for shepherding the studio's big summer hit 
"Ghost" through the studio. So far, "Ghost," the second-biggest hit of the 
year, has grossed $148 million. Ganis projects still in the Paramount pipeline 
include "Regarding Henry," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Harrison Ford, 
and "Dead Again," directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Donald Sutherland.

Kirkpatrick has a reputation as being an aggressive executive and a savvy -- 
some say savage -- political player. But with filmmakers, he maintains a gentle 
touch -- too gentle for Disney's tastes, where his hands-off approach to movie 
making drew some criticism from fellow executives. 
</P>
<P>
This is Kirkpatrick's third tour of duty at Paramount. He began as a story 
analyst there after graduating from California Institute of Arts in 1974 and 
writing a screenplay called "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase," which was 
produced by New World in 1976 under the title "Dynamite Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Even as a story analyst in 1979, Kirkpatrick was writing scripts on the side. 
"Screenwriting was his first goal," recalled screenwriter Larry Wilson, who 
worked with Kirkpatrick at the time. 
</P>
<P>
He left Paramount to work with independent producer Sidney Beckerman at United 
Artists, then returned to Paramount in 1982 as executive director of 
production. At Paramount, he was the executive in charge of Eddie Murphy's 
films -- including "Beverly Hills Cop" -- and dealt routinely with Simpson and 
Bruckheimer, particularly on "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick left Paramount to join Weintraub Entertainment Group's film 
division, where he worked under Guy McElwaine, then chairman of the division. 
At Weintraub, Kirkpatrick oversaw an ill-starred slate that included "Fresh 
Horses" and "My Stepmother Is an Alien." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick's career moves of late haven't happened quietly. When he left for 
Weintraub Entertainment in 1987, Paramount sued him for breach of contract. 
(The suit was later settled with a Kirkpatrick payment to the studio.) When he 
returned to Paramount this year, Disney sued him, claiming that Kirkpatrick had 
broken an agreement by trying to hire away one of its executives and by using 
internal information to interfere with a Disney production. Kirkpatrick is 
contesting the suit.

2 WHO DEFRAUDED N. AMERICA S&amp;L AVOID JAIL TERMS 
</P>

<P>
The final two defendants in the North America Savings &amp; Loan scandal were 
each sentenced Monday to serve one month in a halfway house and ordered to pay 
$35,000 in restitution and fines for laundering $1.5 million stolen from the 
now-defunct thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Armando J. Vasquez, 53, and Frederick Youngdahl, 55, were convicted last month 
of bank fraud for submitting phony invoices to North America and then returning 
the money they received -- minus a $25,000 laundering fee -- to thrift Chairman 
Duayne D. Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler denied a request by federal 
prosecutors to imprison the two, agreeing with the defense that they were bit 
players in a fraud that caused the failure of the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely sorry that my actions, however small, hurt the public," said 
Vasquez, a Costa Mesa architect. "I am ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
Youngdahl, a Newport Beach engineer, declined to comment in court. 
</P>
<P>
North America was seized by regulators in 1987, and its failure is estimated to 
cost taxpayers $120 million. The case was described by federal authorities as 
particularly egregious because the masterminds behind the fraud -- Christensen 
and consultant Janet Faye McKinzie -- spent much of the thrift's money on 
extravagances like Rolls-Royces and lavish parties. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie was convicted in March on 22 of 26 counts that included racketeering, 
conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen 
property. Stotler sentenced McKinzie to 20 years in jail, the harshest 
punishment meted out in California and the second-longest nationwide for an 
insider involved in the nation's savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
The former real estate agent and high school dropout had pleaded that she was 
temporarily insane because she was under the influence of prescription drugs as 
well as Christensen himself, whom her attorney characterized as "the Jim Jones 
of the savings and loan industry." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez and Youngdahl claimed that they, too, were taken in by Christensen, a 
major client of both men. Christensen was an unindicted co-conspirator in the 
North America trials. He died in a mysterious car accident just 9 1/2 hours 
before regulators seized North America. 
</P>
<P>
Youngdahl's attorney, Richard G. Hirsch, said his client was still in something 
of a fog about the transactions that got him into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Youngdahl to this day is still somewhat under the spell of Dr. 
Christensen," Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul L. Seave told Stotler he didn't believe the 
defendants' stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Each defendant, a successful entrepreneur, portrayed himself as an innocent 
dupe, totally ignorant of any wrongdoing -- or even the possibility of 
wrongdoing -- by Christensen," Seave said in his sentencing recommendation. 
"The defendants' stories, in the government's view, were wholly incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Stotler denied a federal recommendation that the two men pay millions of 
dollars in restitution, saying the $13.5 million that McKinzie was ordered to 
return in restitution and fines would cover the money stolen through the 
money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe Mr. Vasquez when he says it won't happen again," Stotler said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's sentencing marked the end of the federal government's criminal 
prosecution of those involved in the North America fraud. Altogether, seven 
people were convicted of crimes ranging from racketeering to making false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"Christensen and McKinzie used other people, including their good friends, to 
accomplish a massive looting of the savings and loan," Seave said after the 
sentencing. "It's sad they not only stole from the taxpayers but exploited 
their friends for their own greed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NORTH AMERICA S&amp;L SCANDAL 
</P>
<P>
North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana was seized by regulators in 1987 
and its collapse is expected to cost taxpayers $120 million. Seven people 
connected with the S&amp;L were convicted, including thrift consultant Janet 
Faye McKinzie. She received 20 years in jail in July, the stiffest sentence 
ever meted out in California and the second- longest nationwide for a S&amp;L 
insider involved in the country's thrift debacle. Below is a tally of the

SMALL AVOCADO HARVEST PUSHES UP MARKET PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
FARMING: GROWERS WHOSE CROPS WEATHERED THE 1990 FROST AND HEAT WAVE CAN EXPECT 
TO EARN ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS LAST YEAR. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adverse weather produced the smallest avocado crop in a decade this year, but 
growers expect to exceed last year's revenues because the buttery-textured 
pear-shaped fruit is fetching record high prices at supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Growers who weathered the double whammy of a Valentine's Day frost and a May 
heat wave with all or part of their crops intact can expect to earn an average 
of $1.05 per pound for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, the California Avocado 
Commission in Santa Ana estimates. 
</P>
<P>
That is significantly higher than the 62 cents a pound growers averaged last 
fiscal year, and it marks the first time ever the average price has exceeded $1 
a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The high prices are being passed on at the supermarkets, where consumers can 
expect to pay $1.75 or more apiece for the rubbery-skinned delicacy that has 
become a mainstay of California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are grumbling, but they are buying anyway, said Paul M.G. Astbury, 
president of Gibson's Food Emporium, a gourmet supermarket in Irvine at which 
large avocados are selling for $1.99 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing you can substitute for an avocado" in many special recipes, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For growers, the limited availability has amounted to agony or ecstasy -- 
depending on how much of their crops they can send to market. 
</P>
<P>
"If you happened to survive the freeze, then you would be making money," said 
Dan Lopez, a vice president for the Tustin-based Calavo avocado growing 
cooperative. "If you were frozen out or affected by the heat, then you are 
losing money." 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 14 freeze ravaged many trees, destroying their ability to produce 
avocados this year. Then, just as the trees were flowering came the May heat 
wave. Flowers wilted and dropped, cutting the size of the projected crop by 
half within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
The commission estimates that this year's crop is expected to total 210 million 
pounds, more than 100 million pounds fewer than the previous low -- 312 million 
pounds for fiscal 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of California's largest avocado grower, Treasure Farms in 
Irvine, typifies that of the industry as a whole. Orchard Manager Alan Reynolds 
said the grower's 1,200 acres of avocado groves produced about a third of their 
normal crops by the time harvesting was completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
"This 1990 crop we're finishing up has been fairly hard on everybody," Reynolds 
said. "Some people make out OK, but there are other people who have almost 
nothing per acre." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding growers' weather-related headaches is the fact that thieves have 
discovered that money does indeed grow on trees. Growers are having to go to 
new lengths to protect their groves. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Crane, commission director of industry affairs, said that in San Diego 
County, the state's heaviest avocado-producing region, growers are being 
protected by an industry-sponsored avocado task force within the Sheriff's 
Department. The commission has created a $740,000 fund to protect groves in the 
state. Crane estimates that avocado rustling costs growers more than $10 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said Treasure Farms, which grows avocados on land leased from the 
Irvine Co., has taken extra security precautions, among them fencing some of 
its groves. 
</P>
<P>
Although the industry is reaping a strong return from a scant crop, industry 
officials say the low yields are hurting the industry's ability to serve all of 
its markets. Lopez of Calavo said the lack of supply has prompted some 
supermarkets to give avocados smaller displays. He also said that institutional 
food services have been loyal but that they are having trouble affording to put 
avocado on restaurant and banquet menus. 
</P>
<P>
So far, industry officials say, foreign crops have had little impact on the 
shortage of California avocados. 
</P>
<P>
For cash-short avocado lovers, there is a ray of hope. Next year's crop is 
expected to be 50% bigger -- that is, if there is not another bout of adverse 
weather, Crane said. That would yield a projected total output of 315 million 
pounds, still behind the industry average of about 400 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added warily, "the only one who knows is Mother Nature." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AVACADO HARVEST TAKES A DIP 
</P>
<P>
This year's avacado crop is California's smallest in a decade because of bad 
weather -- a frost last winter and extreme heat this summer. The drop in 
supply, however, has caused prices to soar at the supermarket to nearly double 
what they were two years ago.

ADVISER WENT AGAINST OWN ADVICE -- AND LOST; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: STOCK OPTIONS TRADER JAMES DOUGLAS DONAHUE ALWAYS HEDGED HIS BETS. 
THEN A GAMBLE BACKFIRED AND HE LOST MORE THAN $100 MILLION FOR INVESTORS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financial adviser James Douglas Donahue had the golden touch -- and the track 
record to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
For about a decade, he made hundreds of clients happy by grabbing double-digit 
returns through aggressive trading of stock options, all the while promising to 
always hedge his bets. 
</P>
<P>
That's why many of his clients were shocked to learn last month that Donahue 
had lost more than $100 million belonging to 1,500 investors in a limited 
partnership run by his company, Hedged Investments Associates Inc. He had 
gambled big on UAL Inc. stock. 
</P>
<P>
Equally as surprising was the way they received that news: through an 18-minute 
videotape, broadcast during a meeting called by Donahue at a Denver hotel. 
Donahue himself was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"Words aren't adequate to express my regret and sorrow over the impact I've had 
on your lives," Donahue said in a choked, breaking voice. "I have affected your 
lives and my life. Many of you have been my friends for 20 years and I feel 
terrible remorse for the things I've done to you." 
</P>
<P>
The investors ranged from the founders of Gates Rubber Co. and Samsonite Co., 
both based in Denver, to retirees who entrusted Donahue with their life 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I should be just as angry as angry can be," said Bert Johnson, a 
58-year-old insurance broker from Evergreen, Colo. "But I'm not at the point 
where I'm bitter as much as I'm just frustrated. We don't know what went on. My 
guess is that he broke his own rules." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson declined to say how much he lost. 
</P>
<P>
As the investors try to uncover just out how Donahue lost their money, 
Hedged-Investments, based in Englewood, has filed for Chapter 7 liquidation 
proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, claiming about $2 million of the $100 
million remains. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hedged-Investments' subsidiary, Aeroturbine Energy Corp. in 
California, has filed a petition for Chapter 11 reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue and his firm already have been named in at least four lawsuits alleging 
he was negligent, breached his fiduciary responsibility and failed to allow 
access to records. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys and investors agree it could take more than a year just to sort out 
the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was known as an aggressive trader in stock options, which are contracts 
to buy or sell stocks for a specified price in the future. Aides say Donahue 
lived by two rules: Never take an excessive position in any one stock and 
always hedge, a technique to ensure that potential losses are minimized. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that attracted not only me, but obviously bigger hitters than I was, 
was the concept that this is a hedged-fund operation," client Johnson said. 
"You cover all your options so that it doesn't matter if the stock market goes 
up and down. You have yourself covered in both directions. That was the major 
selling point." 
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, Donahue gambled that the stock of UAL, United 
Airlines' parent, would rise. But a failed employee buyout plan, coupled with 
the drop in stock prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait, caught him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't able to cover his position quickly enough, he has told investors. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically acknowledged he broke the promise that he'd always hedge," said 
Chesley Culp III, a Denver attorney representing several small investors. "It's 
intentional misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Harry Hobson, whose client, Union Texas Petroleum Corp.'s pension 
fund, lost an estimated $8 million, said there was no inkling that the firm was 
in trouble. The fund invested because "it appeared at the time, I think, that 
he had a good earnings record," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dill, Donahue's attorney, said investors were aware of the risk 
involved. Nonetheless, he said Donahue was "very depressed and upset and 
concerned about the effect this had on many friends and associates." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue received a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Denver 
in 1959 and earned a master's degree in mathematics from Stanford University 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
In July 1960, he joined the research department of Martin Marietta Corp. in 
Denver as a statistician and computer systems analyst. He became part owner in 
Falcon Research Development Co. in May 1966, then joined the staff of Science 
Applications Inc., a specialist in statistical and computer research, in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the stock options trading industry, Donahue developed and refined 
his own theory, which he detailed in a newsletter called Options Strategies 
that was published from 1974 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Donahue opened Hedged-Investments, using his computer software program 
to assess stock risks. 
</P>
<P>
He kept the number of limited partners in each venture to fewer than 100 to 
avoid registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But some of the 
partners, like company retirement funds, were composed of 100 or more 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue's concept attracted investors of all financial backgrounds, from 
retirees to Denver business leaders and pension retirement funds, including 
Weyerhaeuser Co. of Tacoma, Wash., which lost $35 million in 
Hedged-Investments. 
</P>
<P>
As the years passed, Donahue reportedly earned 15% to 20% annually for his 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
"He really was very impressive from the standing of seeming to know what he was 
doing," said Johnson, who described Donahue as friendly and intelligent. "It's 
no secret that he was showing, for approximately 10 years, fantastic returns on 
money that people were investing with him." 
</P>
<P>
Some investors said they were skeptical about the UAL-blamed losses, noting 
that Donahue never provided them with the results of a company audit. And as of 
June 30, Hedged-Investments had informed clients that their investments still 
showed an increase, several have said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Harvey Sender, who has been appointed trustee of the Chapter 7 
liquidation process, said the case is complex because of the amount of money 
and documentation involved. 
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement was made late last month, Union Texas, Weyerhaeuser, 
Paradigm Partners Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., H&amp;W Hedge Fund of California 
and Denver-based Debt Investment Inc. have sued Donahue, Hedged-Investments or 
Aeroturbine to recoup losses. 
</P>
<P>
Among the investors listed in documents filed in bankruptcy court are: Charles 
Gates, owner of Gates Rubber; several members of the Shwayder family, former 
owners of Samsonite; Dianne Ingels, a former director of the failed Silverado 
Banking, Savings and Loan, and Laurence DeMuth Jr., secretary and general 
counsel of U S West Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he knows several retirees who lost so much they will be forced to 
return to work. But he notes, Donahue, too, is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a broken man himself. When all this stuff shakes out, he'll lose 
everything he had," Johnson said. "He might keep his house, but his reputation 
is gone."

JOSEPH N. BELL: COLUMN ON PESKY VALET PARKING BRINGS SPEEDY RESPONSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been some months since I've reported in this space on mail. I have a 
very large pile of letters on my desk, arranged so I have to look at them daily 
and suffer commensurately about my dereliction in not responding. 
</P>
<P>
If I spent half as much time answering letters as I do feeling guilty, I'd be 
further along than dealing with the mail of last June, which is where I am now. 
But I'm determined -- rather like the pile of unread New Republics and New 
Yorkers beside my bed -- to get at these letters, and someday I will. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I'd like to summarize some trends in the correspondence that seem 
noteworthy -- and sometimes surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Two quite disparate columns produced by far the most mail in the last six 
months: the column on valet parking and that on the AIDS quilt. Response to the 
former was totally one-sided, while the AIDS column prompted sharply differing 
views. 
</P>
<P>
I touched an unexpected nerve with valet parking. A lot of people are as angry 
as I am about being forced to turn our cars over to sometime jockeys who drive 
the cars 20 feet and park them for us in frequently near-deserted parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Kovitz, who once worked for The Times, wrote about looking into this 
practice some years ago and discovering that "the kids did not get to keep the 
tips but made an hourly stipend. Patrons who thought they were helping some 
poor student through college were sadly misinformed." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Prince of Laguna Hills chastised me for "overlooking the obvious method 
of cure. It's very simple. Mention the offending restaurants by name. . . . 
Other restaurants would think twice before instituting a similar disservice to 
their customers." (The point is well taken; I didn't do it because I didn't 
want to single out two offenders when so many are guilty of the same practice.) 
</P>
<P>
And Myron Simon of Anaheim, who "dislikes having someone park our car," 
described watching a TV news program "which stated that the person who owns the 
car is totally responsible for his car no matter who is driving it" and 
suggested I "investigate and give us a follow-up column." 
</P>
<P>
I did. I talked to Dan Angel who ran a highly successful Orange County valet 
parking company for eight years and got out of this business three years ago 
for the same reasons that are disconcerting a lot of us today. 
</P>
<P>
Angel said there are three systems of valet parking now in use by local 
restaurants and hotels: the in-house method, in which the parking attendants 
are employees of the hotel or restaurant; legitimate valet companies that 
charge the facility a fixed rate for each car parked and who carry liability 
insurance; and marginal, often fly-by-night operators who may or may not have 
insurance and run their own show while the restaurant or hotel management looks 
the other way. 
</P>
<P>
In the first instance, says Angel, customers can be sure who's responsible, 
although whether or not attendants keep their tips depends on the policy of the 
facility; in the second instance, the customer can be assured that the 
attendants keep their tips and are also paid a minimum wage ("That's the law," 
says Angel simply), and that the valet company carries liability insurance 
("Although," points out Angel, "they are responsible only if there is 
negligence on the part of the attendant"); and in the third instance, virtually 
anything goes. Attendants may be stripped of their tips, insurance may be 
non-existent, and the operation could be pushing the edges of illegality. 
</P>
<P>
Angel got out of the business when he found that he was being undercut by 
operators who were being hired with no questions asked at no charge to the 
facility. "There are all sorts of marginal people getting into this business 
now," said Angel, "and it's extremely difficult for a solid, totally dependable 
operation to compete as long as the hotels and restaurants are willing to look 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
Angel suggested three questions consumers should ask parking attendants when 
faced with compulsory valet parking: 
</P>
<P>
1. Is this an outside concession or part of the hotel or restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
2. Do you have liability insurance? 
</P>
<P>
3. Are you allowed to keep your tips? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if enough of us do this, the restaurants and hotels will get the word 
that we don't like this gun at our heads. And that it may very well drive us to 
take our trade elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Moving along to the column on the AIDS quilt, the response was deeply divided 
-- and highly emotional. 
</P>
<P>
On the affirmative side, here is part of what Mark Shier, rector of the 
Episcopal Church of St. Andrew in Fullerton, wrote: "So many times I have 
intended to write you in appreciation for this column or that. . . . What has 
pushed me over the edge from intention to action is the column on the AIDS 
quilt. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you. I have not yet seen the quilt because I dread the sorrow it will 
engender in me, much as I weep when I see the Vietnam War Memorial. Perhaps the 
grief at young life and talent wasted as well as the social and institutional 
rejection in both tragedies is the reason . . . I decided to write this on 
church stationery because I felt it important to say in this small way that 
there is another kind of minister of the Christian Gospel than Lou Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
"We are true in an imperfect fashion to the compassion and love commanded by 
Jesus. We are the majority." 
</P>
<P>
A common strain ran through the letters of those who objected to the quilts 
piece: that the people infected had brought on this suffering by their own 
behavior and were also putting others at risk, and therefore didn't warrant 
compassion. Two examples will illustrate: 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Thomas of Garden Grove wrote: "It saddens me that one of your knowledge 
could let himself be taken in by the sob stories about those who have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never believed that the disease was a curse from God. A loving God does 
not curse his creatures. However, like a good parent, He has warned us all 
about certain things that may be harmful to us. He gave us the Commandments 
along with a number of other guidelines and one of them was a warning against 
sodomy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have to condemn them. They do that themselves. There is no need to 
punish them. They do that themselves. But to build them up as heroes or 
long-suffering martyrs is to sell our whole civilization down the river." 
</P>
<P>
And H. Virginia Carter-Lee of Newport Beach wrote, in part: "Your recent 
bathos-filled commentary on the AIDS quilt compels this message. 
</P>
<P>
"Unquestionably the AIDS patient deserves compassionate treatment . . . It 
should nevertheless be clearly understood that this terrible scourge is 
overwhelmingly the result of a deliberately chosen lifestyle and most of those 
who suffer from it are not hapless victims of circumstances beyond their 
control. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I opine from the unique perspective of one whose every immediate family member 
is a physician . . . I resent the daily obligation to assume risks in an 
atmosphere of uncertainty because of the legally protected HIV privacy status 
of patients." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't my intent to get into a debate with letter writers here. But I would 
point back briefly to a recent column on critical thinking and the definition 
of "loaded" statements -- in this case that ho mosexuality is a "deliberately 
chosen lifestyle," a scientifically dubious assumption on which both of these 
arguments are based. 
</P>
<P>
Jumping around in the space that's left, I'd like to thank the letter writers 
and phone callers -- all, oddly enough, men -- who filled me in on where I 
could find string bikinis on Orange County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Several veterans of World War II also took umbrage at my column about the 
camaraderie at an art opening between American and German was aces. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Frank Bradley of Huntington Beach, who signed himself "USNR, survivor of 
Omaha Beach": "As for this German, Hanns Scharff, I find it hard to believe 
that he was soft on all American POW airmen. As brutal as the German command 
was, some Americans must have been badly abused, both physically and mentally. 
As as result of their mistreatment, there must be some survivors out there 
today who would like to meet up with Scharff and beat the (writer put in a 
underscore line) out of him." 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there was the column about some of the influential people 
in my life. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to explain at the end why I listed only men, even though women probably 
played a more significant role, but that didn't placate several irritated 
female phone callers who weren't buying this. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not going to get into this one any deeper than I already have except to say 
that if I had listed only women, I doubt if any irate men would have called. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the last word should be given to Alan Blum of Balboa Island who thinks 
I missed the plane in my comments about names for the facilities at our new 
airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Blum: "After the airport reverts to its rightful name of Orange County 
Airport or perhaps another SUITABLE name, I suggest renaming the gents' 
restroom Wayne's John.' "

MUSIC: FLUTES OF CHAMPAGNE FOLLOWED THE ANGST OF MAHLER AFTER THE ORANGE COUNTY

Party Scene 
</P>
<P>
Two softly lit banquet rooms in the Center Club -- the VIP hangout a few steps 
from the front doors of the Performing Arts Center -- were filled with Orange 
County Philharmonic Society members and their friends Friday night following 
the season-opening concert hosted by OCPS. A harpist plucked easy-listening 
tunes. Servers brought flutes of champagne and Chardonnay. Bite-size buffet 
offerings included cheeses, fresh fruit and miniature French pastries. With 
their little plates and frequently refilled glasses in hand, half of the arts 
patrons took seats at white-clothed tables while the others opted to stand and 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
Point Counterpoint 
</P>
<P>
It was late, but the patrons were lively -- especially when discussing the 
Schumann and Mahler pieces performed that night by the Royal Concertgebouw 
Orchestra of Amsterdam. "Fantastic," proclaimed Lucia Van Ruiten, who shared 
the concert and her table at the party with her brother-in-law, James Helfrich. 
(Van Ruiten and Helfrich waited in vain for the arrival of their "dear friend," 
Concertgebouw principal cellist Godfried Hoogeveen. "He wasn't invited!" said 
Helfrich, amazed, after leaving the party to search for Hoogeveen -- and 
finding him in his hotel room. "That's crazy! The musicians are always the most 
fun at a party.") Meredith and Lyman Porter reported that they "loved the 
Schumann, but the Mahler was a little . . . long for us." Phyllis and Dan 
Chiles loved the Mahler, but admitted it was "very heavy. I think for the 
casual concert-goer it was probably a bit tedious," Dan said. It was tough 
sledding even for Joann Halvajian, whose husband is the chairman of the OCPS 
board of directors. "I love this orchestra, and I love Mahler," said Halvajian, 
"but I wouldn't have chosen that piece for the opening night. It's very 
ponderous." James Hanshumaker -- a professor of music at USC who provided a 
preconcert explication of the program -- agreed, in a way. "You have to be a 
Mahlerite to appreciate what they did tonight," he said. "Mahler is very deep, 
dark, Angst-filled -- very sophisticated. And that piece is the most 
sophisticated of all Mahler. I'm actually quite surprised they performed it 
here. It's the kind of program they will love in New York." And finally, a word 
from Erich Vollmer, OCPS executive director: "I knew I was taking a gamble with 
this program. It's a little bit introspective, a little bit tougher than usual. 
(But) this orchestra is so synonymous with Mahler -- to have them here and not 
take the Mahler would be like going to Vienna and not eating pastry." 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Riccardo Chailly stepped into the banquet rooms early in the party -- 
only to be battered with photo flashes and surrounded by schmoozers. He soon 
fled. Soloists Jard Van Nes and Goesta Winbergh mingled awhile longer. Also 
seen were Pat and Dick Allen, Nancy and Frank Posch, Petrina and Jerry Friede, 
Cindy and Bob Searles and Laila and William Conlin. 
</P>
<P>
Quote 
</P>

Asked their thoughts on the program, Linda and Stephen Wagner said that 
although they couldn't remember the names of the composers whose work was 
performed, they enjoyed the evening. "I'm not that big on knowing that much 
about (classical music)," said Linda, "but I know what I like. It's like good 
champagne -- if you like it you like it." PAMELA MARIN

DIO BLARES HIS STUFF IN WICKED SHOW OF FORCE

Considering how effective blaring rock music was in rousting Manuel Noriega out 
of Panama some months back, perhaps our military should consider a similar 
tactic in resolving the Persian Gulf crisis. Of course, it's armed millions 
we're dealing with there, so we'd need a bigger audio nuisance, like that 
produced by the Dio-and-Stryper-headed metal mega-bill at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Just set them up on the Iraq border and Ronnie James Dio's Wagnerian excess of 
blackboard-screeching vocals and bombastic rock could cause even the most 
fanatic hordes to gnash their teeth in despair, and the show's incessant flames 
and explosions made a wicked show of force. And if there's any doubt in the 
Middle East that we're the Great Satan, Dio's devil-horn hand signals and 
garish skeletal rib-cage stage design should settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
His 18-song (counting keyboard and guitar showcases) show ranged from his 
Blackmore's Rainbow days with "The Man on the Silver Mountain" to the 
well-crafted crunch fest "Lock Up the Wolves" title track from his current 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Dio's lyrics tend to be direct and to the point, such as on "Stand Up and 
Shout," in which he screamed "Stand up and shout! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! 
Shout! Shout! Shout!" or "Don't Talk to Strangers" where he reminded, "Don't 
talk to strangers! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!" You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Former Yngwie Malmsteen keyboardist Jens Johansson did a neoclassical solo on a 
synth that was suspended from wires. And, in true neoclassical style, the 
instrument exploded when he was finished. 
</P>
<P>
Rowan Robertson, an 18-year-old guitar whiz, did a similar solo turn displaying 
his metal fret-board technique, a style so aptly described by Frank Zappa as 
going "weedle-weedle-wee" a whole lot while making faces and waiting for the 
smoke bombs to go off (Yup, Robertson got a climatic explosion, too). 
</P>
<P>
Dio's album covers are coveted by anti-rock proselytizers, as they invariably 
show priests being cast into pits of fire or damned masses shuffling into hell. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his fans were attempting to mimic that hell-bent ethos because the 
small but wild crowd was awash in spilled beer and some acrid, 
chemical-smelling smoke. (One partaking gentleman was polite enough to identify 
what he was smoking as PCP before he went thoroughly cow-eyed.) 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't necessarily help that kids have such great role models as KNAC-FM 
deejay "Dangerous Darren" who, when announcing Stryper a couple of hours 
earlier, burbled, "Hey man, it's not even Dio yet," then describing his 
condition with a vulgarism. 
</P>
<P>
Having eschewed its overtly Christian bent, second-billed Stryper now seems 
nearly indistinguishable from countless other plodding metalers. 
</P>
<P>
The lyrics of the Orange County-based quartet's current "Against the Law" album 
may still differ in lyrical content -- supporting fidelity, clean living and 
such -- but the group's lackluster delivery (complicated further by problems 
with drummer Robert Sweet's equipment) failed to put any conviction behind the 
performers. And certainly their message seemed lost on this crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Third-billed Love-Hate, on a lineup that also featured Dogs D'Amour and Cold 
Sweat, proved equally vapid in its 30-minute set.

In a sign of easing tensions between Nationalist Taiwan and Communist mainland 
China, a team from Taiwan will be competing under the name "Chinese Taipei." 
The presence of teams from both North Korea and South Korea has helped raise 
enough excitement in Seoul that 416 South Korean journalists are registered to 
cover the events. The games, which run to Oct. 7, are also providing a pretext 
for expanded diplomatic contacts between Beijing and Hanoi, which have had

U.S. EXPORTERS EXCITED BY OPENING UP OF BRAZIL; 
</P>
<P>
'A SLUMBERING GIANT IS WAKING UP . . . ,' SAYS THE COMMERCIAL COUNSELOR AT THE 
EMBASSY IN BRASILIA. THE REVIVAL SHOULD INCREASE THE COUNTRY'S IMPORTANCE ON 
THE WORLD MARKET.

<TEXT>
<P>
The good news for American exporters is spreading fast: Latin America's biggest 
national market is opening its doors to foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Foreign Commercial Service office at the American Consulate in Sao 
Paulo is being swamped with inqueries from businessmen looking for ways to take 
advantage of the new opening. The phone there "is ringing off the hook, and 
people can't get any work done," said Kevin C. Brennan, commercial counselor in 
the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan views the Brazilian move to liberalize import policy as part of an 
economic "sea change" that will increase this country's importance on the world 
market. "As I see it, a slumbering giant is waking up in Brazil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 150 million, Brazil has one of the world's 10 biggest 
economies, accounting for half of the industrial base in Latin America. 
Brazilian industry was built up during decades of "import-substitution" policy 
that protected domestic producers from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
But President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office in March, has rejected 
protectionism and has begun lowering tariffs and other import restrictions as 
part of sweeping economic reforms. Since the United States already is Brazil's 
No. 1 source of imports, with sales of $4.8 billion in 1989, American industry 
is in a good position to take advantage of the new opening. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the story of Brazil is as exciting as what's going on in Eastern 
Europe in many ways, and for U.S. manufacturers, Brazil is a much more 
lucrative market," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. exports to Brazil increased by 11% in the first half of 1990 and 
are expected to rise 5% to 8% in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a conservative estimate based on the fact that there is a recession 
going on in Brazil," he noted. "The long-term trend is very favorable." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan said some potential U.S. exporters are scared off by Brazil's 
$117-billion foreign debt and how it might affect supplier financing. But, he 
added, "As far as I'm aware, there hasn't been any problem with short-term 
credits." 
</P>
<P>
After Mexico, Brazil has the second-largest portfolio in the U.S. Export-Import 
Bank, which currently lists $3.2 billion in outstanding credits for exports to 
the Brazilian market. And last week, Brazilian authorities announced that this 
country is dropping a requirement that all imports of $200,000 or more must be 
financed abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Foreign Commercial Service, an agency of the Commerce Department, has 
representatives in the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Brasilia, 
Belem and Belo Horizonte, and has district offices in Los Angeles, San Diego 
and San Francisco. They all offer services to businessmen interested in 
exporting to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
One of the services is "industry sector analysis" reports on different segments 
of the Brazilian market. For $750, the Foreign Commercial Service will prepare 
a tailored market research report called a "comparative shopping survey" that 
analyzes opportunities, price ranges and competition in Brazil for a specific 
line of products. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agency also helps line up Brazilian companies to serve as 
representatives and distributors for U.S. manufacturers and exporters. But 
Alexandre Barros, a consultant to foreign companies doing business in Brazil, 
predicted that many exporters will find it necessary to train their 
representatives to market new products. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazilian representatives don't know how to get to the consumer," Barros said. 
"I think marketing is the key to success." 
</P>
<P>
The first major move in Brazil's opening to imports came at the beginning of 
July, when the government abolished a list that had barred imports of 1,800 
product categories, from boats to motors to toys. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Economy Ministry has been issuing new orders twice a month or 
so, lowering tariffs on long lists of import products. Many are produced by 
Brazilian monopolies and oligopolies at prices up to four times international 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Joao Cunha, national undersecretary of economy, said a task force in the Trade 
Department of the Economy Ministry is preparing a reformed tariff master list 
of 20,000 items that will be ready at the end of the year and will be 
implemented over the next four years. He said imports will be divided into 
three categories: 
</P>
<P>
* Products that have no counterpart produced in Brazil will enter the country 
without tariffs. More than 1,300 products already have been given "zero-tariff" 
status. 
</P>
<P>
* Common products, including consumer goods, will enter with tariffs averaging 
20%. Some will be as low as 5%, and many will be lowered gradually over four 
years to give domestic industry a chance to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
* Products similar to those being produced by "nascent industries" considered 
to be in Brazil's national interest, including ones that need time to develop 
competitive high technology, will be charged tariffs averaging 40%. 
</P>
<P>
A separate policy is planned for Brazil's computer industry, called 
"informatics," which has been heavily protected. While most informatics items 
have now been removed from the list of banned imports, the government is 
studying a proposed list of more than 60 that would continue to be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes microcomputers, video monitors, magnetic discs, keyboards, 
electronic cash registers, transistors, fiber optics, facsimile machines and 
electronic telex terminals. The ban would expire in October, 1992, with 
Brazil's informatics "market reserve." 
</P>
<P>
As in other industries, foreign companies will be permitted to form joint 
ventures with Brazilian informatics firms, importing technology and some 
components. Commercial counselor Brennan said he assumes that computer 
components not produced in Brazil, such as semiconductor chips, will end up on 
the zero-tariff list. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign manufacturers and exporters of hundreds of products are applying for 
and receiving "zero-tariff" status. Brazilian manufacturers have 30 days to 
challenge such an application, but new regulations make it more difficult for 
them to justify tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
The reformed tariff list due at the end of the year will include many new 
zero-tariff items, taking effect immediately, and more will be added as new 
applications come in, Cunha said. He said manufacturing machinery and equipment 
have priority for zero-tariff status.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gentle breeze caressed the long rows of white marble crosses, while a 
carillon solemnly chimed the noon hour for 53,485 U.S. and Philippine World War 
II servicemen buried or commemorated here in America's largest military 
cemetery overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the vaulted memorial, Arnold Cual studied the giant battle maps of the 
bloody Pacific campaign and spoke emotionally of his own links to America. He 
fought with U.S. troops against the Japanese, then served under U.S. officers 
in the Philippine army. He later lived 16 years in San Francisco and worked 
with the U.S. Army at the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
Now, like his homeland, 67-year-old Cual wants to cut the ties. He supports the 
attempt by President Corazon Aquino's government during four days of 
negotiations last week to remove the giant U.S. military bases in the 
Philippines, the most visible and controversial symbol of America's long 
presence here. 
</P>
<P>
"America should let go the Philippines," Cual said. "I think it's high time to 
leave the Philippines alone. Without America, we'll be forced to stand alone. 
We'll be sovereign." 
</P>
<P>
The search for a Philippine national identity is inextricably linked to the 
future of the U.S. bases. Growing nationalism means the bases are caught in the 
tangled web of emotions and history that tie the United States to its only 
former colony. Resentful of America's role here, many Filipinos say their 
nation can never be independent as long as Washington keeps troops here. 
</P>
<P>
Most Filipinos are taught, as few Americans are, that the bases date back to 
the turn of the century, when the United States sent 70,000 soldiers here to 
cruelly subjugate the colony it had "won" from Spain. At least 200,000 
Philippine civilians were killed in America's first, now forgotten, overseas 
war. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the Spanish who had ruled despotically for 400 years, Americans gave 
the Philippines universal education, a common language, roads and bridges, and 
republican -- if not quite democratic -- political institutions. World War II 
brought the shared horrors of Corregidor and the Bataan Death March. Formal 
independence came in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime opponent of the bases, Leticia Ramos Shahani, chairwoman of the 
Philippine Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recalled over lunch recently how 
she cried as a 14-year-old girl when the U.S. flag finally came down. Suddenly 
misty-eyed again, she began singing "God Bless America," warbling more verses 
than her American guest knew. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so obsessed with Mother America," Shahani said later. "Even though 
America has so many other interests." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Filipinos speak wistfully of their "special relationship" with America. 
Peculiar is another word for it. Jeepneys, the ubiquitous form of public 
transportation that began as U.S. war surplus jeeps, still often carry U.S. 
flags and names like California Dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
Manila's English-language papers are obsessed with news about the United States 
or even about U.S. diplomats and businessmen in the Philippines, virtually 
ignoring the country's Asian neighbors. Nor, considering America's economic and 
political clout here, does anyone complain when columnists invariably assume 
that the bases are the motivation behind every American act. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Filipinos apply for visas to the United States every year. On 
most days, far more visa applicants line up outside the U.S. Embassy than show 
up down the street to protest the presence of the bases. At last count, there 
was a four-decade wait for immigration visas to America. 
</P>
<P>
Manila remains a wacky testament to U.S. influence. Public buildings were 
copied from those in Washington. Forbes Park, Taft Avenue and Harrison Plaza 
are among the neighborhoods and streets named after U.S. Presidents and 
colonial governors. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is where it's at," explained a young policeman in Basco, an island 
north of Luzon. "I think we should be the 51st state." 
</P>
<P>
America's presence was heightened last December when two American F-4 Phantom 
jets from Clark Air Base provided air cover for government troops during an 
attempted coup in Manila. Although they helped save Aquino's government, many 
complained that the Americans were only trying to pressure Aquino to extend 
leases for the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was no surprise when the Philippine foreign minister and chief 
negotiator, Raul Manglapus, entitled his opening remarks for the bases talks "A 
Question of Sovereignty." He bitterly cited the "American atrocities" of the 
1899-1901 Philippine war of independence as well as the shared hardships and 
triumphs of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Repeated emotional references to the glorious joint U.S.-Philippine effort in 
World War II sometimes now only serve to provoke the longer memory of the 
American Philippine war. . . ," said Manglapus, a guerrilla fighter during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Americans here tend to cite more recent memories, such as last week's State 
Department warning of "an imminent terrorist bombing" by Communist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, U.S. special negotiator Richard L. Armitage conceded that any 
extension of the U.S. military presence will "be dictated in the main by the 
issue of sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
But Armitage argued that sovereignty "is as much an attitude, a state of mind, 
as it is an empirical fact." 
</P>
<P>
No nation, he said is "literally sovereign in the sense that it can act, even 
within its own borders," without regard to other nations. The United States, he 
said, is no less sovereign for the "inundation" of foreign ideas and goods. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that Filipinos do not believe themselves to be masters in their 
own house, and to the extent a U.S. military presence accounts for that belief, 
it would seem to be incumbent on the leaders of this country to do something 
about it," the American negotiator said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the week, the issue still clearly dominated the discussion. The 
Philippine spokesman, Rafael Alunan III, cited national dignity as the No. 1 
achievement of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've achieved our goal," Alunan told reporters after the last session. "That 
was to regain our dignity, to demonstrate sovereignty and establish 
self-esteem. They respect that. If we can achieve full independence, we can be 
a stronger ally." 
</P>
<P>
Armando Doronila, editor of the Manila Chronicle, says the issue serves as a 
distraction from internal problems. "People talk about sovereignty in absolute 
terms," he said. "It doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
But Doronila says the bases are unlikely to go anytime soon, sovereignty or 
not. "If they go abruptly, the vacuum would be more disruptive than anything 
else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cual, the veteran at the American cemetery, thinks it will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Americans leave, the Philippines will be a different place," he said, 
studying a map of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where Gen. Douglas MacArthur 
finally returned to liberate the Philippines in October, 1944. "I don't know if 
better or worse. But definitely different." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Camps 
</P>
<P>
The six U.S. military facilities in the Philippines are: 
</P>
<P>
1 SUBIC BAY NAVAL BASE -- The U.S. military considers Subic as its most vital 
installation in the Philippines, holding the world's largest naval supply depot 
and servicing the 7th Fleet. The base is located 50 miles northwest of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
2 CLARK AIR BASE -- Clark is the headquarters of the U.S. 13th Air Force. Built 
as a U.S. cavalry post in 1901, Clark provides logistics support to American 
forces throughout the Pacific. It is located 50 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
3 SAN MIGUEL NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS STATION -- San Miguel, located 60 miles 
northwest of Manila, is a vital relay station for the U.S. Navy's 
communications network in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
4 CAMP O'DONNELL -- The U.S. Air Force uses Camp O'Donnell as a communications 
and electronics station. It is located 60 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
5 WALLACE AIR STATION -- A radar and communications station overlooking the 
South China Sea. It lies 150 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
6 CAMP JOHN HAY -- It serves as a rest and recreation center for U.S. forces in 
the Pacific. It is located in the mountain city of Baguio, 125 miles north of 
Manila.

STEELER FAN BEATEN AT COLISEUM SHOWS SOME IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the first home game since the Raiders decided to stay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome home: 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a Pittsburgh fan wearing a Steelers T-shirt as he walked through a 
crowd of Raiders fans in a section of low-priced seats at the Coliseum was 
first pelted with ice by hooting fans, and then beaten and kicked in the head 
by one fan in front of several thousand others, right behind the Steelers' team 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Paul Albrecht, 35, a former Pittsburgh resident who lives in 
Tucson, regained consciousness Monday in the neurological intensive care unit 
at County-USC Medical Center, where he was in improved, but still critical 
condition, said hospital spokeswoman Adelaida de la Cerda. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Monday identified Shane Geringer, 19, of Agoura as the man who 
allegedly kicked and punched Albrecht. He was arrested at the game and booked 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon with great bodily injury. The 
suspect was released late Sunday after someone posted his $30,000 bail, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Bill Pavelic said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just indiscriminately started punching (Albrecht) and kicking him," Pavelic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time security officers got to him, the detective said, "the victim was 
unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
A Steelers trainer and team doctor tended Albrecht until paramedics arrived, 
said Steelers spokesman Don Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally there are scuffles in the stands," Edwards said, "but something 
like this, the way it was described . . . that's a scary sight to see." 
</P>
<P>
According to the police report, Pavelic said, both men were "very HBD" -- 
police shorthand for had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the telephone at Geringer's home said he was not there, 
and did not know when he would return. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction in Pittsburgh -- where the 1970s cross-country rivalry with the 
then Oakland Raiders had all the intensity of two blue-collar cities with 
tough-guy teams -- was fairly muted Monday. At most, Albrecht was considered to 
be the 12th, unofficial, player on a sadly losing team. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's 20-3 loss to the Raiders, the Steelers record is 1-2, and that 
only because the defense scored a touchdown in an earlier game. What happened 
to Albrecht was yet another sign of a dispiriting failure -- in the fans' 
estimation, "Just another loss that we suffered in Los Angeles," said John 
Poister, acting program director at WTAE radio. Pittsburgh fans figured, "We 
didn't even win the fight." 
</P>
<P>
The incident got hourly mentions on the local news, yet Eartha Jackson, 
producer of the KDKA radio call-in show "Myron Cope on Sports," said that in 
the show's nearly two hours, "we've had one call" about Albrecht. "Everybody 
else is concerned about the pitiful performance that the team has been putting 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Police said earlier that Albrecht was "vociferous" in his support of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
But John Conroy of West Los Angeles said that when he saw Albrecht late in the 
fourth quarter, he "wasn't taunting or doing anything other than wearing this 
shirt, walking on the aisle closest to the field," and was "being pelted by 
people with ice and paper cups," and some kind of liquid. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point he put a magazine up to his head -- it looked like the program 
-- to cover his head. I think I saw a bit of a smile on his face as if, 'OK, 
this is gonna happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
Conroy said he turned back to the game, and then "I heard this intake of breath 
by the whole section near the 50-yard line" and "a bunch of people rushing" to 
where Albrecht lay. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Conroy saw two couples in Steelers shirts leaving the game, and 
"people were throwing all kinds of stuff at them" before a security guard 
intervened. "I was flabbergasted by that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It "didn't shock me, given the behavior of these people, that that (Albrecht) 
guy was jumped on and beaten up," said Conroy. "The whole atmosphere was kind 
of hostile, and if this is for a winning team, what are you going to do if 
you're losing? I tell you one thing, I'm not going back to a Raider game, out 
of protest." 
</P>
<P>
It was the talk of the stadium, said one season ticket-holder. When one little 
boy crowed to the man escorting him, "He really hit that guy," the adult told 
the boy, "Just because you root for another team is no reason to get hit." 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Rich Molony said that most scuffles that require intervention at 
Raiders' games end with the combatants simply being thrown out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, "if it's a pretty good (fight), the crowd starts booing" as the 
officers approach, "and throwing beer on us and basically taking officers on." 
</P>
<P>
Working at the Coliseum is, along with movie-set security, one of two 
moonlighting law enforcement jobs Los Angeles police are allowed to do, Molony 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders crowds "tend to be very one-sided. I've been told they have to relocate 
fans at almost every game," after "someone from out of town buys tickets" and 
finds they are "right in the middle of the Raiders section." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened Sunday, said Raiders executive Al LoCasale. "That's an 
area where we asked them (the Coliseum) for additional security." 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum's private security, Contemporary Services, would not comment on 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have always said they ask for more security than is required at 
home games, but they can do little as Coliseum tenants, "other than insist that 
the Coliseum over-staff an event, to err on the side of over-staffing," 
LoCasale said. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders and the Coliseum share the expense of over-staffing Raiders games, 
he added, and they try to help ticket-holders who want to change seats because 
of problems brewing in their sections. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum spokeswoman Alisa Spillman said, "We really don't see it like it's 
going to erupt into this huge rash of problems. It was an isolated incident."

GROSS CENSUS UNDERCOUNT IN POOR AREAS ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE ELLEN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' poorest communities with the greatest needs were "grossly 
undercounted" by census enumerators, Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz told a 
meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from 20 cities met to plan a strategy to convince legislators that 
preliminary census figures undercounted residents in cities both large and 
small, particularly in neighborhoods with low-income and minority residents. 
</P>
<P>
The problems with the methods used to count populations were amplified in Los 
Angeles and other large urban centers with significant ethnic populations, 
Heinz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Undocumented immigration into California is tremendous," Heinz said. "People 
in L.A. don't live in the kind of way where you can use a mail-out, mail-back 
process and have it work; a lot of our city doesn't speak English." 
</P>
<P>
Fear of overcrowding and immigration laws also deters residents from filling 
out the form, she said, adding, "People don't believe it is confidential." 
</P>
<P>
The complaints will be voiced today before the House Post Office and Civil 
Service subcommittee on census and population by mayors from Chicago, 
Baltimore, Denver, Brownsville, Tex.; Winston-Salem, N.C., and Meridian, Miss. 
The cities hope to win congressional support for adjusting the 1990 population 
figures. However, the final decision on whether to revise the count rests with 
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, who has until next July 15 to 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
Conference participants agreed that in attempting to persuade the 
Administration to adjust the figures, cities should document any measures that 
they took to aid their local census bureau in counting residents, particularly 
when the information conflicts with preliminary census counts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Los Angeles sanitation workers wrote down the address of each 
house in 400 randomly selected city blocks. Their numbers showed 4.5% more 
housing units than were reported in preliminary census numbers, Heinz said. In 
another study, after counting the number of idle gas meters and examining rent 
stabilization figures, city workers concluded that vacancy rates in certain 
neighborhoods were only half that recorded in the preliminary census, Heinz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's preliminary figures put Los Angeles' population at 3.42 
million -- up 15% from 1980. However, the city claims that at least 49,513 
dwellings were not counted, which could increase the city's population count by 
123,783. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors also will tell the subcommittee that census officials are failing to 
give adequate feedback on whether they are incorporating the data provided by 
cities in their post-census studies. 
</P>
<P>
Post-census studies conducted by officials in 1980 showed a 4.65% undercount in 
Los Angeles, but the corrected figures were not incorporated into the city's 
population total. Since 1990 base figures are based on the previous decade's 
census, the preliminary figures are too low even if mistakes in counting were 
not a factor, Heinz contended. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, East Los Angeles was a test area for the census. After a post-census 
enumeration study was conducted, significant undercounts of minority groups 
were revealed: almost 10% of the Latino community was missed, 7% of the Asian 
population was overlooked, and 9% of African-Americans were not counted, Heinz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By knowing how officials used the post-census data, cities could decide whether 
to demand an increase in the current 2% limit on the number of housing units 
that cities can challenge, the conference concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors will also ask the census subcommittee to move up to April 1, from 
the current July 15 date, Mosbacher's deadline for announcing whether the 
census figures will be adjusted nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Many city's laws require them to redistrict before July 15, 1991, which means 
that the newly drawn districts will not reflect the latest population figures, 
the mayoral representatives said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTOR COREY FELDMAN FACES NEW DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Corey Feldman, who has campaigned against drug use and is featured in an 
upcoming video about drug addiction, was charged Monday with possession of 
heroin after his second arrest on drug charges since March, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, 19, who has appeared in such films as "The Goonies," "Gremlins" and 
"Stand by Me," was arrested Thursday in North Hollywood after Los Angeles 
Police detained him because they believed he had stolen a car, a suspicion that 
proved false, Sgt. Gil Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
But a check of Feldman's record showed that he had three outstanding traffic 
warrants, and officers conducting a pre-booking search found two balloons 
containing one-third of a gram of heroin in Feldman's socks, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Feldman was arrested after officers who had stopped him for a traffic 
violation found 25 balloons of heroin and cocaine in his car. He has pleaded 
not guilty to felony drug charges stemming from that arrest.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PAID IN DRUGS FOR AID IN ESCAPE GETS 12 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who received more than 50 pounds of cocaine for helping a Colombian drug 
trafficker escape from jail was sentenced Monday to more than 12 years in 
federal prison for drug convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Croom, 32, who earlier this year pleaded guilty to two narcotics charges, 
was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison by U.S. District Judge 
Stephen Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In secretly taped conversations, Croom admitted receiving 50.6 pounds of 
cocaine in exchange for helping to arrange the 1987 escape of William Londono 
from the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles, prosecutors said. Londono 
is considered a significant cocaine dealer who apparently has fled to Colombia, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Bienert said Croom allegedly admitted his 
involvement in the escape to an inmate in several conversations in 1988 and 
1989.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USE OF SMUGGLING PROFIT FOR DEFENSE FUND 
OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled Monday that a former Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent accused of drug trafficking could use $100,000 his 
attorneys say he made smuggling gold and jewelry into the United States for his 
defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. came after a defense 
lawyer for Darnell Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes said his client needed 
the cash to pay his two lawyers and an investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia has more than $3 million in funds frozen in Luxembourg banks that 
prosecutors charge were generated by drug trafficking. The $100,000 is part of 
those funds and prosecutors say that it, too, came from drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Although Garcia isn't charged with jewelry smuggling, prosecutors opposed the 
ruling. They declared the funds are illegal whether they come from narcotics 
trafficking or smuggling. 
</P>

SILBERMAN GETS 46 MONTHS IN FEDERAL PRISON 
</P>

<P>
Richard T. Silberman, one-time governor's aide and wealthy financier, was 
sentenced Monday to 46 months in federal prison and said he was sorry that he 
laundered cash he believed was drug money. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing sentence, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving said it was 
gratifying to hear Silberman express remorse for the first time in the complex 
case. 
</P>
<P>
But it mattered more, Irving said, that Silberman, who "had achieved more than 
most men could ever have dreamed of," had turned to crime, betraying himself, 
his wife -- San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding -- and family and his 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"It boggles my mind," Irving said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving chose precisely the prison sentence that prosecutors had recommended 
following a plea bargain struck last month in which Silberman pleaded guilty to 
a sole felony conspiracy count. Silberman was convicted in June after a 
two-month trial on another felony count -- a technical currency violation -- 
and could have drawn a total of 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also had recommended a $75,000 fine. But Irving put off that 
decision, saying he needed the details of Silberman's up-to-date financial 
status, adding he knew only that Silberman said he was ruined financially, with 
a negative net worth of $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who was a top aide to Edmund G. Brown Jr. when he was governor, 
had been charged originally with seven felony counts in an alleged scheme to 
launder $300,000 in cash that an undercover FBI agent had portrayed as 
Colombian drug profits. He stood impassively at a podium Monday as Irving 
imposed sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Just before being sentenced, Silberman said that, in "this hour of my deep 
remorse," he was "extremely sorry for the crime I have committed." 
</P>
<P>
Golding called the case a "tragedy of a very human nature. The only thing I can 
say is that when someone you love is in trouble, you do the best to stand by 
them." 
</P>
<P>
She confirmed that Silberman was nearly $2 million in debt. "I'm living on my 
salary," she said. "Dick doesn't have a salary." 
</P>
<P>
Golding also said, "My house has been on sale for a long time. That's no 
secret." 
</P>
<P>
Four other men also have been charged in the complex case, two of whom already 
have pleaded guilty to a single felony count. The two others -- including 
reputed mobster Chris Petti, 63, of San Diego -- are due to stand trial Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Norman Myers, a Malibu investment banker accused of being a courier in the 
alleged scheme, was also due to have been sentenced Monday. But Irving pushed 
that sentencing back to Nov. 19 -- presumably after the trial for Petti and 
Darryl Nakatsuka, 43, of Los Angeles, a security guard also accused of being a 
courier. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have indicated they don't intend to call Silberman to testify 
against Petti or Nakatsuka. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman had been a key player in statewide Democratic politics since the 
mid-1970s, serving as Brown's chief of staff and, among other positions, as 
Brown's secretary of the Business and Transportation Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's son, Craig, works for California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also had achieved great wealth in business, particularly in banking 
and fast-food ventures. He was a general partner during early years of growth 
at the Jack in the Box restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
However, his most recent venture, a San Diego-based gold-mining firm, Yuba 
Natural Resources, consistently had trouble paying its bills, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was arrested April 7, 1989, at a Mission Bay hotel and, according to 
the FBI, he confessed to laundering the $300,000 and said he was searching for 
funds to save his financially troubled mining firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to FBI notes of the alleged confession, Silberman also offered upon 
arrest to implicate California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Chula Vista 
Councilman David Malcolm and several prominent businessmen in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, Malcolm and the others have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrest, prosecutors contended, Silberman already had done two 
laundering deals, using cash supplied by undercover FBI Agent Peter Ahearn -- 
who was posing as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug lords -- and 
was negotiating with Ahearn to do a third. 
</P>
<P>
He had been introduced to Ahearn after first contacting Petti, whom he knew 
from a barber shop both men frequented, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal was a November, 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock in a 
subsidiary of Silberman's Yuba Natural Resources. The second was a February, 
1989, swap of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, Silberman could have drawn 75 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But after the two-month trial, Silberman was convicted only of a technical 
charge of structuring a transaction to avoid the paperwork that federal law 
requires for any cash transaction over $10,000. He faced 10 years in prison on 
that count. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked, heavily for conviction, on several other charges, 
including two counts of money laundering and a sole count of conspiring to 
launder money. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 24, Silberman accepted a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to the 
conspiracy count, saying he had conspired to violate the same technical 
currency law. He could have drawn five years in prison for that charge. 
</P>
<P>
Contradicting his trial testimony, Silberman admitted in the plea bargain that 
he believed he was laundering drug money. He said he had conspired to violate 
the currency law by structuring a deal so that thousands of dollars he believed 
to be drug proceeds were broken into smaller sums, then sent overseas to a bank 
account whose number he supplied. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea bargain, Silberman also agreed to drop an appeal of the 
sole count on which he was convicted at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, prosecutors were spared the burden of a second trial, promised to 
dismiss four other charges against Silberman and agreed to recommend to Irving 
that Silberman serve a prison term of 41 to 51 months. Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Charles F. Gorder, the lead prosecutor in the case, also said he would urge no 
more than a 46-month term. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators actually recommended more time in prison, up to 63 
months, according to legal papers filed last week in the San Diego federal 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
But Irving said Monday that 46 months was appropriate. He said that he at first 
had considered leniency because of Silberman's many "contributions to the 
community." But he said he dismissed that notion when considering the 
discrepancy between Silberman's trial testimony and the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"The system expects and demands you be truthful," Irving said. "You were not. 
The system can not tolerate people coming into court and being untruthful." 
</P>
<P>
Irving said he would recommend that Silberman be assigned to a minimum-level 
prison camp. He also said he would suggest to prison officials that Silberman 
be assigned to the facility at Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, since 
that would make it easier for visits by plane from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was likely to decide in the next few days whether to fine 
Silberman. But he said he was inclined simply to make Silberman pay the 
financial costs of incarceration, which he termed "substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gorder nor lead defense lawyer James J. Brosnahan of San Francisco knew 
Monday what those costs might total. 
</P>
<P>
The plea bargain calls for Silberman to pay the government $5,500, the money 
prosecutors contend Silberman earned on the second of the two deals, the bond 
deal. In papers filed last week, Gorder contended that Silberman personally 
pocketed about $75,000 on the first deal, the stock deal, warranting a $75,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Under new federal sentencing rules that abolished parole, convicted criminals 
must serve 85% of a sentence. Silberman will be free in just over 39 months 
from June 28, when he first went to jail, or October, 1993, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving made no mention at the sentencing hearing of Silberman's suicide 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, fearing he could not get a fair trial before Irving, Silberman 
fled to a Las Vegas hotel and attempted suicide by taking an overdose of pills 
-- including tablets that had been prescribed for a family dog, according to 
legal papers filed last week.

DEL MAR MAN HAS PLAN TO CUT COST OF S&amp;L BAILOUT 
</P>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Bob Dyson has stirred up congressional interest in a plan that is 
designed to cut the cost of bailing out the nation's troubled savings and loan 
industry and, at the same time, make affordable housing available to a greater 
number of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson, a Del Mar real estate broker who served as president of Red Carpet 
Realty during the early 1980s, plans to present his "Incentive Resolution Plan" 
to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp in October. HUD staff 
members are reviewing Dyson's plan, according to spokesmen for two area 
congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson's S&amp;L plan would dramatically change the way the federal Resolution 
Trust Corp. disposes of assets seized when S&amp;Ls fail. At present, the RTC, 
which wants to raise cash quickly, generally demands that buyers pay cash for 
seized assets. However, congressional critics have panned the RTC for selling 
assets at cut-rate prices in order to move property owned by the failed 
S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson wants the RTC to stop offering properties at discounts to cash buyers and 
instead offer them at market value to the growing number of Americans who are 
being shut out of the market. Receiving full-market value for assets of failed 
S&amp;Ls would boost the amount of money flowing into the U.S. Treasury and 
lessen the need for taxpayer assistance in paying for failed S&amp;Ls, Dyson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dyson's plan probably would require congressional action to create a 
new kind of loan, which would be offered to Americans who lack the money needed 
for down payments or whose credit histories are blemished. The mortgages would 
subsequently be bundled together and sold on the secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson's proposal to expand the universe of potential home buyers has caught the 
attention of local congressmen who are sorely aware that only 30% of Americans 
can afford to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
The plan could "potentially save the taxpayers a lot of money by allowing 
taxpayers to get full value" on property that the federal government seizes 
along with failed S&amp;Ls, said U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado). "Dyson's 
general premise is a sound one . . . but we need to do a lot of analysis." 
</P>
<P>
"Fire sales are not the solution, but fire sales are the order of the day with 
the RTC," said Hunter, who complained that cash-rich buyers can find windfalls 
by paying $.20 or $.30 on the dollar for RTC-owned properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We can save the taxpayers a lot of money if we don't have these fire sales," 
Hunter said. "If done skillfully, (sales) can be structured in a way where the 
assurance of a (solid) return to the U.S. Treasury is very high." 
</P>
<P>
Many real estate industry observers believe that the RTC's cash-only deals are 
likely to disrupt already-threatened residential markets, said Herman Smith, a 
past-chairman of the Washington-based National Assn. of Home Builders. "When 
you're marking down (properties) at a tremendous discount, it affects both the 
comparables in the area and ad valorem taxes," said Smith, a Fort Worth, Tex., 
builder who was in San Diego last week for an NAHB meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, Hunter said, Dyson's proposal would "develop a larger pool 
of home buyers" who are now shut out of the home market. And it would eliminate 
the possibility of windfall profits under the RTC's current cash-only system. 
</P>
<P>
"The average couple making $40,000 a year might be able to swing a mortgage for 
$80,000 or $90,000," Hunter said. "But they can't possibly find $20,000 or 
$30,000 to buy some of these properties." 
</P>
<P>
If suitable financing were made available, potential home buyers would 
eventually "return two to three times as much for some of these properties," 
Hunter said. "I like the concept of (Dyson's) plan." 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal raises some interesting possibilities," said Ben Haddad, chief of 
staff for U.S. Representative Bill Lowery (R-San Diego). "Our review encourages 
us to go further. Because of (Dyson's) background and the elements of his plan, 
this is not just a fly-by-night proposal." 
</P>
<P>
"RTC is experiencing difficulties now," Haddad said. "They don't have all the 
answers on the best way to dispose of these real estate properties. . . . Dyson 
appears to have a win-win type of solution." 
</P>
<P>
Dyson wants to demonstrate his plan by selling the assets of a failed thrift in 
Oklahoma. "We can prove it by selling 70% of (the S&amp;L's properties) in 120 
days," Dyson said. "I can guarantee that people will line up to buy these 
properties at fair market value." 
</P>
<P>
The test will be ruled a success if Dyson can turn "non-performing assets back 
into performing assets," he said. "Everybody asks what's in it for me, but we 
won't earn a dime for our efforts until we perform." 
</P>
<P>
A key element of Dyson's plan is the establishment of a new type of mortgage 
that would be awarded to consumers who now lack down payments or whose credit 
history keeps them out of the home-buying market. 
</P>
<P>
The government would make those consumers "demonstrate that they can work their 
way back into credit-worthiness" by making payments for a year. Dyson said the 
RTC would still have the option of marketing properties should their new owners 
fail to make payments. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the properties are already owned by the RTC or are considered assets of 
the failed (S&amp;L), no new money would be needed to complete the sales 
transaction," Dyson said. "Discount points and monthly mortgage payments would 
generate the cash necessary for closing costs . . . normally charged to the 
seller." 
</P>
<P>
During the early 1980s, Dyson served as president of financially troubled Red 
Carpet Realty. He initiated a turnaround that helped the real estate 
franchising firm eliminate debts and contingent legal liabilities totaling $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lobbying Congress, Dyson has been appearing before large 
organizations such as the NAHB in order to drum up support for his plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is (my) belief that it will take extreme political pressure from the public 
to move the government in any other direction than the course they have 
selected with the RTC," he said. "Every day that the RTC is allowed to continue 
in its present direction costs each and every one of us far more than we would 
choose to accept."

BANKS CROSS THE LINE TO SEEK PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: SAN DIEGO INSTITUTIONS ARE TAPPING MARKETS IN COUNTIES TO THE NORTH, 
WITH TEMECULA IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY A PRIME TARGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Escondido-based North County Bank opened a branch in Temecula in 1985, the 
only competitors were the locally owned Overland Bank and branch offices of 
Bank of America, Security Pacific and Great American. 
</P>
<P>
But the Riverside County town's once-tiny financial industry has been growing 
in stature along with the area's population, and most of the new banking 
arrivals are San Diego County institutions that have crossed the county line in 
search of profits. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula isn't the only destination for San Diego's growth-minded institutions. 
Local banks and savings and loans have established footholds elsewhere in 
Riverside County and in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bank and S&amp;L executives said the northward migration is driven by the fact 
that San Diego County has relatively few locations left to support new 
branches. Still, local institutions have moved cautiously into neighboring 
counties. Executives said they have selected niche markets that should provide 
few surprises and a greater likelihood of success. 
</P>
<P>
They have also built office staffs partly by hiring employees from 
out-of-county competitors rather than sending San Diego-based bankers into 
unfamiliar territory. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key for us opening in Riverside," said First National Bank 
spokesman Ron Phillips, which opened a Riverside branch office last year. "We 
were able to bring on board experienced bankers who'd lived and worked in that 
market. Opening a branch is easier when you have that kind of" experience. 
</P>
<P>
The county line proved to be no great hurdle for local institutions in 
Temecula, executives said. Its location near the county line on Interstate 15 
makes it seem more of an extension of North County than a part of Riverside 
County, they said. 
</P>
<P>
North County Bank moved into Temecula because the area shared many traits with 
North County, said Mike Gilligan, the bank's chief financial officer. "We've 
had a tremendous response from the people up there. It's grown fast. . . . We 
already have $35 million in deposits." 
</P>
<P>
ENB Holding Co., which owns Escondido National Bank and San Marcos National 
Bank, has also enjoyed rapid growth in Temecula. Last year, ENB expanded into 
Temecula through the addition of an Escondido National branch. But in July, ENB 
won regulatory approval to open a new bank, Temecula Valley National Bank, 
which absorbed that operation. The new bank, with assets of $32 million, opened 
a branch office in nearby Murrieta in August. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula is "working out well for us," said Harvey J. Mitchell, president of 
ENB. "We're in storefronts in both Temecula and Murrieta, but we've bought 
property in Temecula and we're starting work on a 10,000-square-foot main 
office building." 
</P>
<P>
ENB capitalized the new bank with $3.5 million of a $5-million private stock 
offering that was completed in May, Mitchell said. The remainder of the new 
capital was allocated to ENB's two existing banks. 
</P>
<P>
While 1989 marked San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank's 100th anniversary, it 
also marked the opening of a Temecula branch that became the first 
out-of-county branch for San Diego County's largest independent bank. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Trust &amp; Savings, with 50 branch offices, has largely saturated 
the San Diego market, President Daniel D. Herde said. The bank reviewed several 
out-of-county expansion plans but was most comfortable with the burgeoning 
Rancho California/Temecula area. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a look and were encouraged by the market studies," Herde said. "We 
felt that it was one area where we could manage comfortably . . . and it's not 
far from Fallbrook, where we have a branch." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Bank of Commerce opened a branch office this past summer in 
Temecula, an area President Peter Davis described as "almost an extension" of 
its market. 
</P>
<P>
But distance was not an important factor for Bank of Commerce, which early this 
year opened a Small Business Administration loan-origination office in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of Commerce, which wanted to expand its SBA business outside San Diego, 
could have crossed over into Orange County, Davis said, but it opted for Los 
Angeles County because "Orange already had two or three big (SBA) players. . . 
. Rather than buck them with just one office, we decided to go to Los Angeles," 
where there is less competition for SBA loans, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a year, Bank of Commerce's Glendale office has become Los Angeles 
County's sixth-largest SBA lender, Davis said. With its Los Angeles office up 
and running, the bank recently opened a full-service branch office in the city 
of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Once Bank of Commerce made the decision to attack Los Angeles, Davis looked for 
office space near the local SBA district office. By chance, the office, in 
downtown Los Angeles, was moving to Glendale, and Bank of Commerce is now 
located just down the hall from it. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Davis agreed that "conventional wisdom said that L.A.'s already 
got sufficient banking services." Still, Bank of Commerce, which stuck to its 
SBA lending niche, is thriving despite the fact that it sits across the street 
from a Bank of America branch and within a stone's throw of at least 10 other 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Other local institutions have made their own moves out of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Bank SSB, which recently changed its name from La Jolla Savings Bank, 
fulfilled its desire to enter the Orange County market when it purchased a 
branch office in Mission Viejo from San Diego-based Flagship Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan. La Jolla Bank also plans to open a branch office in Indian Wells 
near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
First National Bank, which several years ago identified Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties as potentially lucrative areas, has a branch office in 
Riverside, and might eventually add offices along the I-15 corridor. It has 
also opened a loan origination office in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
BSD Bancorp, a bank holding company that owns Bank of San Diego, acquired Long 
Beach-based Coast Bank in 1982. BSD "would like to make acquisitions of other 
(out-of-county) banks," said Vito Guarino, president of BSD Bancorp. "We know 
that out-of-county can be profitable because Coast has been our most successful 
operation over the past five years." 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont Bank has opted not to expand outside of San Diego County, but it has 
expanded its Western Trust Services with the acquisition earlier this month of 
a trust operation owned by Glendale-based Fidelity Federal Bank. The 
acquisition boosted Western's trust asset total to $400 million, up from about 
$300 million, according to Grossmont President Donald K. Clague.

<P>
BUSINESS LOANS: WESTERN GENERAL CAPITAL CORP. OF SHERMAN OAKS INVESTS PRIVATE 
AND FEDERAL MONEY INTO SMALL FIRMS FROM LAUNDROMATS TO HERBAL TEA STORES.

Cheng-Hsung Tsai has suffered hard times since he and his family immigrated 
from Taiwan seven years ago. His English is poor, so he had trouble finding a 
job. In Taiwan, Tsai was manager of a garment factory, but in the United States 
he could only find work in restaurants and carwashes. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Tsai hit on the idea of running a coin-operated laundry 
business, but he couldn't get a bank loan to help him get started. 
</P>
<P>
Then Alan Thian entered the scene. Thian, 38, is president of Sherman 
Oaks-based Western General Capital Corp., one of about 390 small business 
investment companies (SBICs) throughout the nation that are licensed by the 
federal Small Business Administration and are eligible for federal money to 
make loans to start companies or buy investments in them. 
</P>
<P>
With a $250,000 loan from Western General, Tsai recently bought two Laundromats 
near downtown Los Angeles and replaced several of the 120 washing machines and 
70 dryers with new, large-capacity machines that cost $5,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Thian said Tsai will take in about $480,000 in revenues this year, but the 
company won't turn a profit for five years, when the loan is due to be repaid 
in full. But Thian said he has faith in Tsai. "He convinced me he's very 
hard-working," Thian said. 
</P>
<P>
Thian, a Singapore immigrant, started Western General Capital a year ago. So 
far, he has invested $1 million of privately raised money into three 
coin-operated laundry businesses, a home builder, an herbal tea store and a 
computer parts importing business. Under SBA rules, a new SBIC must raise at 
least $1 million in private capital and invest at least 65% of it in small 
businesses before qualifying for federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
But by year-end, Thian hopes to start receiving the government funds, which he 
can invest in companies with greater potential. 
</P>
<P>
If he's lucky, Thian will find the next Apple Computer, which got its start 
with help from an SBIC in the 1970s. On the other hand, SBICs are known as the 
riskiest part of the SBA, and the number of SBIC liquidations has doubled in 
recent years as the economy has soured. 
</P>
<P>
The SBA is best known for its bank loan program, which guarantees about $3.7 
billion a year in loans to small businesses. For SBA-backed loans, banks are 
permitted to charge interest rates of up to 2.75% above the prime rate -- the 
rate banks charge their most credit-worthy customers. That means banks can now 
charge up to 12.75% for their SBA loans. 
</P>
<P>
But for many small companies that don't qualify for bank loans, SBICs such as 
Western General are the only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Under a complex formula based on their borrowing costs, SBICs now charge a 
maximum interest rate of about 16%, although Thian has charged a 13% fixed rate 
so far to his clients. SBICs are also limited to investing in businesses with 
annual net income of $2 million or less. 
</P>
<P>
Thian said Western General so far has made loans that have ranged from $100,000 
to $300,000 and takes in about $11,000 a month in interest. After expenses, he 
said, he shows a profit of about $6,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Western General is chartered by the SBA to help businesses that are hampered 
because of "social or economic disadvantages." There are 133 of these SBICs 
nationwide and 26 in California. Western General is the only one in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Thian got the idea to start an SBIC a few years ago. Since immigrating to the 
United States in 1975, Thian has managed a family-owned restaurant, earned his 
MBA at USC at night andinvested in real estate -- he now owns five houses in 
the Los Angeles area. In 1982 he became a director of General Bank, a small 
commercial bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After serving on the bank's loan approval committee, "I found out there are a 
lot of small businesses having trouble getting loans, especially minorities," 
Thian said. 
</P>
<P>
Thian and six other bank directors put in $1 million and received an SBIC 
license in August, 1989. He runs Western General out of a tiny office in 
Sherman Oaks, and has two employees. 
</P>
<P>
Thian plans to start taking investment positions soon in start-up companies, 
but under SBA rules he's limited to investing no more than 30% of Western 
General's private capital in a single company. His long-term goal is to raise 
more private capital so that he can take bigger stakes in fledgling 
manufacturing companies. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have $300,000 you're getting into really small businesses like 
coin-operated laundries. You're not really helping the economy that much," he 
said. "But if I can help a business and help stimulate the local economy, that 
will be a bigger achievement." 
</P>
<P>
SBICs are eligible to receive up to four times their private capital in 
matching funds from the SBA, up to $35 million. That means Western General is 
now eligible for $4 million from the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
Some billion-dollar companies, such as Federal Express and Intel, the computer 
circuits concern, got started with the help of SBICs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an SBIC owned by Continental Illinois Bank invested about $500,000 
in Apple Computer when it was starting up in 1978. After Apple went public in 
1980, Continental sold its position over a two-year period for a $44-million 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
John Hines, the Continental SBIC's now-retired president, "became kind of a 
legend in the industry after that deal," said Mike Kim, Continental's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
But such success stories are rare among SBICs. Since the program started in 
1958, 465 SBICs out of a total of 1,597 have been placed in liquidation after 
defaulting on their payments. Since 1980, the backlog of the SBIC program's 
liquidation portfolio has grown from $100 million to more than $500 million, 
and the number of SBICs placed in liquidation has doubled in the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"SBICs are the venture capital arm of the SBA," said Bernard Kulik, who runs 
the SBIC program. "They're probably the riskiest single operation in the 
agency's inventory." 
</P>
<P>
Why are SBIC liquidations up? For one thing, many of the small companies that 
SBICs finance hope to sell stock to the public eventually and use the money to 
finance their growth. But Kulik said the market for new securities has never 
fully recovered from the 1987 stock market crash, hindering many SBIC-backed 
companies from raising enough money to keep operations going. 
</P>
<P>
But officials admit that the SBIC program also suffers from internal problems. 
In testimony before the Senate Committee on Small Business last month, SBA 
Administrator Susan Engeleiter said SBIC problems also "result from spotty 
government oversight and supervision of the program." 
</P>
<P>
SBICs must have an independent audit done annually and must comply with certain 
regulations, such as limits on the size of companies that receive financing. 
But beyond that, it is up to each SBIC to decide which businesses it will 
invest in. "We do not pass on individual investments," Kulik said. 
</P>
<P>
The SBA also doesn't place any restrictions on ownership of SBICs, nor does it 
offer a precise definition of "social or economic disadvantages." It does pass 
approval on an SBIC's manager, but offers few guidelines as to who would 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Thian said he hopes to avoid the problems that have beset other SBICs by 
picking businesses that produce steady returns, rather than trying to strike it 
big with a high-risk technology or an oil and gas company. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he's leaning heavily on the expertise of Chris Lin, chairman of 
another SBIC, Myriad Capital Inc. in Monterey Park, which helped fund General 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Lin said he "got burned pretty bad" when he started Myriad 10 years ago by 
investing in businesses with poor management, such as a seafood trading company 
that failed because of the owners' lack of experience. Those early losses 
taught him to carefully scrutinize an owner's background before investing, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With advice from Lin, Thian said he has refused loans to applicants who wanted 
to start Laundromats because they lacked experience and their business plans 
"just didn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The businesses that Western General has invested in are all owned by Asian 
immigrants. Thian said that's because he has only invested private capital so 
far and initially turned to the community he knows best. 
</P>
<P>
After he starts receiving government funds, Thian said he will start 
advertising his services and "I'll extend loans to all nationalities and 
races."

2 CONVICTED OF RUNNING BOILER ROOM OPERATION; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE TYPICAL SCHEME INVOLVED BRIBING EMPLOYEES TO KEEP INCREASING THE 
SIZE OF OFFICE-SUPPLY ORDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two men who ran an office supply boiler room in Sherman Oaks have been 
convicted of 30 counts each of wire fraud and transportation of stolen 
securities in U.S. District Court in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Peter R. Tripp, 42, and Richard Fonseca, 55, were found guilty by a jury 
Thursday of bilking the Greenville Publishing Co., publisher of the Greenville 
Sun in eastern Tennessee, out of $561,000. They face maximum sentences of 210 
years -- 10 years for each of the 12 counts of transportation of stolen 
securities and five years for each of the 18 wire fraud counts -- plus 
penalties of $250,000 per count and payment of restitution to Greenville 
Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp and Fonseca will likely be sentenced in the next 60 days, said U.S. 
Postal Inspector Tom Dugan in Pasadena, who was part of the investigation. A 
third defendant, Laszlo Grabecz, 42, a native Hungarian, is a fugitive and is 
believed to be in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dugan, Tripp and Grabecz owned and ran office supply boiler rooms 
for 10 years in the Los Angeles area until their arrest in April, 1989. They 
most recently operated under the name of Business Systems Exchange in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca was Business Systems' principal salesman. A fourth defendant, Fonseca's 
son, Christopher, was dropped from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp and Grabecz have also been indicted on federal tax fraud and tax evasion 
charges and the trial is due to begin next month in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said more than 100 office supply boiler rooms like Business Systems are 
currently operating in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
He said the typical scheme used by Tripp and Grabecz involved having sales 
people call companies and secure small orders for ballpoint pens, paper pads, 
staples and other office supplies. They would then send "gifts" of radios, 
microwave ovens, televisions and compact disc players to the employees who 
ordered the products. 
</P>
<P>
The employees would then receive bribes of 10% of the invoices if they agreed 
to continue ordering increasingly larger quantities of the supplies at inflated 
prices. If the employees couldn't find places to store the supplies, Business 
Systems would hold the inventory, leaving companies to pay for products that 
were never shipped. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said Greenville's bookkeeper, Edith Malone, initially ordered $174 of 
office products in October, 1984. The monthly orders grew in size, finally 
reaching $77,373 during one month. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 Malone was convicted in U.S. District Court in Tennessee on 11 counts 
of transportation of stolen securities and was sentenced to five years in 
prison. She was a government witness in the trial against Tripp and Fonseca. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said he didn't know how many companies had been duped in a manner similar 
to Greenville, but "hundreds would be an understatement." He also didn't have a 
precise figure for how much money Tripp, Grabecz and Fonseca made over the 
years, but said it was likely several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jimmie Baxter in Knoxville said Tripp, a former rock 
musician, and Grabecz lived in million-dollar homes. Tripp drove a Rolls-Royce 
and Lamborghini, and Grabecz wore a $14,000 Piaget watch and "did all his 
shopping on Rodeo Drive," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp and Grabecz were indicted last month by a federal grand jury in Los 
Angeles on 13 counts of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, tax evasion 
and filing false tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment says the defendants diverted money from their boiler room scams 
into various "hidden" bank accounts, then failed to declare the money in the 
accounts as income on their personal and corporate tax returns. It alleges that 
Tripp and Grabecz evaded paying a total of about $300,000 in income taxes 
between 1984 and 1986, and understated the income of their businesses between 
1985 and 1987 by more than $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The tax evasion trial is due to start Oct. 30, but it may be delayed to give 
prosecutors more time to prepare, said Phillip Hall, a special agent with the 
Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles. If convicted on the tax charges, Tripp 
and Grabecz face maximum sentences of 29 years and $850,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before his arrest last year, Tripp received attention after he survived 
the sinking of a charter yacht on a New Year's Eve excursion to Copacabana, 
Brazil. Authorities said 56 people died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Described as a "key" witness by Brazilian authorities, Tripp said he saw the 
ship's booking agent give money to a police officer, who then allowed the yacht 
to proceed despite heavy winds and dangerous surf.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SYNCOR INTERNATIONAL REPORTS $1.1-MILLION PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth pharmaceutical company, said its net 
income for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 slid less than 1% to $1.1 million 
from $1.2 million a year ago, when the company recorded a tax benefit. Syncor's 
first-quarter sales increased 18% to $36 million from $30.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth company's operating income soared 77% in the first quarter to 
$1.8 million from $1 million a year earlier. Syncor's net income a year ago was 
boosted by a $332,000 tax-loss carry-forward that the company did not enjoy 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor's sales gains were due to better market penetration, said the company's 
chief executive, Gene McGrevin, in a statement. McGrevin said he expected 
Syncor's sales to continue to grow for the rest of the year, but added that the 
company's operating expenses also would grow because it hired more pharmacists, 
expanded its sales and marketing staffs and invested money in computer systems.

BUSINESSES CAN CLIMB ABOARD THE AMERICA'S CUP BANDWAGON; 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTION: FOR FEES RANGING FROM $2,400 TO $250,000, SAN DIEGO COMPANIES WILL 
BE LISTED IN A DIRECTORY TO BE PUBLISHED FOR THE 1992 EVENT.

The San Diego Yacht Club's defense of its America's Cup title in 1992 is 
expected to generate $1 billion for the local economy. But area businessmen who 
are interested in getting their share of the windfall will have to pay to play, 
according to event organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Local businesses will have to pay fees ranging from $2,400 to $250,000 to be 
listed in a directory of goods and services that will be distributed to racing 
syndicates and sponsors. To make these somewhat costly fees more palatable, 
they have been divided into three payments spread out over three years. 
</P>
<P>
The fees paid by businesses will be their ticket to membership in America's Cup 
Services, a marketing arm of the nonprofit corporation formed to manage the 
yearlong event for the Cup's defenders. The group has planned an extensive 
publicity campaign to promote the regatta along with those San Diego-area 
businesses willing to support the race with their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup Organizing Committee will use the $1.5 to $4.6 million it 
expects to earn from these fees to help offset ACOC's estimated $10-million 
budget for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC has budgeted an additional $10 million that it hopes to receive from 
the San Diego Port Authority to stage the race and provide public venues. 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed a way to raise the private income source," said Dal Watkins, 
the president of the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to put on a good show . . . it has to be a little bit" from 
everybody, added Tom Vincent, the president of the Greater San Diego 
Hotel-Motel Assn. and the general manager of the San Diego Princess Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins and Vincent are on the committee that directs the ACS. 
</P>
<P>
The central component of the organization's publicity campaign is a 
comprehensive glossy San Diego directory that Parker Pike, ACS membership and 
hosts program director, describes as "a catalyst for business." 
</P>
<P>
The directory will include maps, calendars and profiles for those interested in 
attending, sponsoring or participating in the America's Cup event. 
</P>
<P>
The sole criterion for joining ACS is paying the membership fee, and a 
committee spokesman said that applicants will not be screened. Fee-paying 
businesses will be listed alphabetically and by category in the ACS directory. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that purchase some of the more expensive memberships will be granted 
space for advertisements. "They will have the implied endorsement of this 
organization," Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
The $2,400 membership program is set up for what ACS calls "host merchants," 
which will only be listed in the directory. ACS will also sell 100 restaurant 
memberships at $10,000 and 100 charter memberships at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant members will receive a one-sixth page black and white advertisement 
for their fee. Charter members will be given space for a full-page, four-color 
ad. 
</P>
<P>
Those who purchase ACS's ten $250,000 associate memberships can choose their 
position for a two-page, full-color advertisement in the directory. 
</P>
<P>
ACS plans to print and distribute 500,000 directories in three different 
editions beginning in November, Pike said. The third and largest edition will 
be published in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the directory, ACS members will receive promotional assistance 
from an 800-number referral center being established by the organization to 
field calls from the media, travel agents, tourists, syndicates and sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
All ACS members, regardless of the type of membership they purchase, will also 
be allowed to use the America's Cup logo for their own publicity purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The regatta will begin with the five-day First International America's Cup 
Class World Championships in San Diego next May. Defender and challenger 
selection trials will begin the following January and will run through April.

BOOKS: FOR MONIKA JENSEN STEVENSON, 'KISS THE BOYS GOOD BYE' BECAME AN 
OBSESSION. BUT DID SHE, HUSBAND LOSE THEIR OBJECTIVITY TRYING TO PROVE THE U.S. 
HAD BETRAYED ITS POWS IN VIETNAM?

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monika Jensen Stevenson's husband advised her not to get too deeply involved in 
an investigation of American soldiers abandoned in the jungle after the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
If she did, he warned, she would awaken one morning to find she was "chasing 
the dragon," a reference to opium smokers in the dens of Hanoi. "When you 
become addicted," Stevenson told his wife, "the dragon chases you." 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, did the dragon devour the Stevensons, particularly Monika 
Jensen Stevenson? Was she so engulfed by the cause of publicizing the POWs' 
plight that she fell prey to what she has accused the U.S. government of doing 
-- allowing the ends to justify the means? 
</P>
<P>
Was the Stevensons' showing how the government forgot its men so important that 
it justified their using anonymous sources and repeating stories told by 
individuals whose credibility has been tested by others and found lacking? 
</P>
<P>
In their new book, "Kiss the Boys Good Bye: How the United States Betrayed Its 
Own P.O.W.'s in Vietnam," the Stevensons have elected to become the advocates 
for families of lost soldiers and the community of former soldiers who came 
home but never stoped fighting the war. 
</P>
<P>
They call this network, whose most prominent members include such personalities 
as Texas financier H. Ross Perot and Navy Capt. Eugene (Red) McDaniel (said to 
be the most tortured POW during the war), the Telephone Tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, Americans were left behind" in Vietnam, William Stevenson 
said in a recent interview. "But I got involved in this quagmire only after I 
saw what was being done to good people, to POW wives and honorable men who 
fought for their country in an unpopular war and are now getting discredited by 
their own government for telling the truth about POWs being alive." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, her eyes narrowed and angry, added: "It seemed to me, well, it 
seemedto us that it was time the American public were told that this is not the 
cause of a bunch of kooky people and Rambo-esque types." 
</P>
<P>
Their book did encounter hurdles getting into print and the strain seems to 
have worn on the Stevensons. Their first publisher rejected their original 
manuscript, claiming it was editorially and legally unacceptable. They 
countered with a still unresolved lawsuit, insisting the publisher was bowing 
to government pressure. Meantime, the Stevensons found a new publisher. Over 
the last two years, they have made numerous revisions of the manuscript and 
legal reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a whole basement filled with manuscripts, " William Stevenson said 
wearily. 
</P>
<P>
His wife grew agitated by questions about their research, methods and sources 
during an interview. In questioning for a radio show, she barked at a caller 
who claimed one of her key sources had recanted his view that Americans were 
still alive in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an out and out lie!" she said later. "He never would recant! His 
statements appeared in the Congressional Record." 
</P>
<P>
Anger and resignation would seem odd conduct for this couple. Monika Jensen 
Stevenson was a producer for the prestigious "60 Minutes" television show who 
left in 1986 after the program would not let her do a larger story on the POW 
issue. Her husband, an acclaimed author of such books as "A Man Called 
Intrepid" and "90 Minutes At Entebbe," is considered an expert in government 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But the couple's book clearly shows their struggles with one of the most 
emotional remnants of Vietnam, the war after the war, the bitter, complex 
battle over the unanswered questions that remain about America's POWs. 
</P>
<P>
After the United States signed the 1973 peace accords with the Vietnamese, 
then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the government knew of no American 
POWs alive in Vietnam. That line changed by the 1980s, particularly after 
former Marine Bobby Garwood got out. 
</P>
<P>
Now officials say it is "assumed" that some of the 2,497 Americans still 
officially unaccounted for in Indochina may be alive but that there is no 
"hard" evidence of this. 
</P>
<P>
The Stevensons claim throughout their book that they saw hard evidence: 
classified Pentagon reports of "live sightings" of American captives. 
</P>
<P>
But they also show how they, too, developed deep concerns in trying to discern 
what was evidence of government lies and what was their own or others' 
paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
She describes growing edgy, irritable and suspicious that what probably were 
ordinary events -- crank phone calls, stolen briefcases, a gas leak in their 
home -- might have more meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The POW project, as Monika Jensen Stevenson notes in the book, was her 
obsession initially. 
</P>
<P>
Not until Page 181 of their 420-page work, which she wrote in the first person, 
does Monika Jensen Stevenson note that her husband has even expressed any real 
interest in a POW project. His curiosity was piqued only after he learned an 
old friend, a BBC reporter, also was investigating the subject. "Apparently you 
only believe men in your own line of business," she snaps at the husband in 
print. 
</P>
<P>
But once they began working together, the Stevensons knitted a theory of 
government ineptitude and cover-ups by relying on a variety of sources, some of 
them questionable. 
</P>
<P>
There were, for example, government officials who asked to remain nameless and 
to whom they gave false titles. The book refers to them simply as "The 
Preacher" at the Pentagon, or "Casino Man" of the CIA. By their very anonymity, 
their credibility is difficult, if not impossible, to judge. 
</P>
<P>
They liberally quote Lt. Gen. Eugene Tighe, who as director of the Defense 
Intelligence Agency from June, 1977, to September, 1981, said he "repeatedly" 
stated his belief that Americans were alive in Vietnam. "Habitual fatigue sets 
in among some bureaucrats," he told the Stevensons. "Instead of saying 'Let's 
work out how we get them out of there,' they discard reports and prevent very 
valuable intelligence going for evaluation and action." 
</P>
<P>
But Tighe is one of the few sources they employ with unsullied credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, they give equal or more weight to individuals like James "Bo" Gritz, 
a retired Green Beret commander best-known for his unsuccessful missions into 
Southeast Asia in search of American POWs, and CIA operative Scott Barnes. The 
Stevensons give considerable space to telling their stories and making them 
into heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But Gritz has damaged his credibility over the years by going to Indochina, 
claiming he would rescue POWs and coming back empty-handed. Once he brought 
back what he said were the remains of POWS, but they turned out to be pig 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes went to Thailand as part of a team hunting for men missing in action. He 
claimed he entered Laos with a mysterious American who was not a team member. 
Barnes said they photographed two white men in a Laos prison camp. He claimed 
the team subsequently received a message order that the white men would be 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
But all other members of the team denied Barnes' story. Two Los Angeles Times 
reporters who checked hotel registers and telephone and telex records found no 
gap in Barnes' stay in Thailand. Moreover, Laotians in the Thai village of Ban 
Don Phaeng, who Barnes claimed had accompanied him into Laos, said that Barnes 
had not crossed the Mekong River into Laos. 
</P>
<P>
Monika Jensen Stevenson concedes she had doubts about both Barnes and Gritz. 
But she asserts that their stories were worth retelling in her book. Why? 
Because she had checked them with intelligence sources she trusted in the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the only problematic section of their book. 
</P>
<P>
The Stevensons, for example, assert -- but only in passing -- that 86 POWs were 
spirited out of North Vietnam in 1986 and kept in special wards in a Philippine 
military hospital. But they dwell not on the 86 POWs but on a military chaplain 
who told them the story and who was discredited for retelling other stories of 
lost soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
But what about those 86 POWs? Is the chaplain's story true? What about POW 
families whose hopes might be raised by the Stevensons' printing of the padre's 
tale? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if that story is true," Monika Jensen Stevenson conceded. "We 
took it as far as we could. But the real point was to show what the government 
did to (that young chaplain) when he tried to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
To buttress their credibility, the Stevensons, while on their book tour, have 
carried around a list of 70 men who they assert the government has known to be 
alive in Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
The list, which they say they received from a government source, does not 
appear in their book (in which only one soldier allegedly still held as of six 
weeks ago in Vietnam is named -- in a photo caption). 
</P>
<P>
But it does not trouble them to pass around the list -- like the information in 
their book -- before weighing its credibility or effects, they said. Again, 
their argument is that the discussion it prompts is what is more important than 
whether it holds true information. 
</P>
<P>
And, to some degree, at least one individual whose life might be affected by 
the list's release, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stevensons and this book have raised our hopes," said Doris Alfond, whose 
brother is on the list of 70 missing-but-possibly-alive POWs. "Maybe some of 
the stories are true in this book, maybe they are not. But the Stevensons have 
worked long and hard on this and we know they are dedicated, which is more than 
I can say for our government." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of an interview, Monika Jensen Stevenson pulled a package of 
color photographs from her purse of Mark Smith, a former POW who sued the 
government for ignoring lost POWs, and a troupe of Asian men in green fatigues 
standing around in the jungle of Southeast Asia. The Stevensons said the men 
were preparing a mission to rescue two POWS from a Laotian village where they 
are held captive. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith is paying his men in rice which he buys with his government pension," 
Monika Jensen Stevenson said with admiration, adding, "People in the government 
tried to tell me that Mark Smith was a gold smuggler and a fanatic. But Mark is 
just a true hero who won't give up." 
</P>
<P>
And neither can she. Like the soldiers who came home from the war but could not 
stop fighting it, she is still a captive of the unknowns about POWs, she said, 
adding, "There was so much we could not put in this book that still needs to be 
looked into. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But her husband is ready to move on. "I don't ever want to get involved in this 
bloody issue again," he said, smiling as he looked at his wife. "She pressured 
me, rather, got me into this and I'm glad to be done with it."

<P>
ARTS: SUING THE NEA WAS AN UNUSUAL MOVE FOR THE MUSEUM, WHICH HAS BEEN WITHOUT 
A DIRECTOR FOR A YEAR, AND IS IN THE MIDST OF CONFLICT OVER DESIGNS FOR A NEW 
BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum took an unusual step for conservative Orange 
County in recently choosing to take the National Endowment for the Arts to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the recent climate for arts in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
As the nationwide furor over freedom of expression and the NEA raged, a nude 
photograph of John Lennon was yanked from a Fullerton exhibition in April, then 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, a handful of irate Costa Mesa residents condemned a 
community-theater production of the 1979 satire "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains 
It All for You" as "anti-religious bigotry" that shouldn't get one cent of city 
arts money. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Newport Beach museum called a crowded press conference two 
weeks ago to announce its suit against the NEA over the federal agency's 
controversial anti-obscenity oath. The museum seeks an injunction barring the 
federal agency from requiring grantees to certify they will not produce or 
exhibit work that the NEA might consider obscene. The museum claims the 
anti-obscenity requirement violates its First and Fifth Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor officials proclaimed that their action placed them squarely "in 
the mainstream of the American arts community," where numerous institutions 
have opposed the NEA funding restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the press conferences and lofty pronouncements, however, lurks a museum 
badly in need of an image boost. Now more than a year without a director, the 
small but nationally respected 27-year-old institution has encountered a series 
of troubling events in the last year, some of which may be seriously impeding 
its search for new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
While some art-world officials dismiss these developments as something that 
happens to any major organization at some point, others express fear that the 
void at the top could result in the corporate co-opting of Orange County's most 
adventuresome art institution. 
</P>
<P>
The first plateau in the museum's remarkable five-year growth curve came in 
August, 1989, when director Kevin E. Consey resigned to take a similar post at 
Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. By Christmas, chief curator Paul Schimmel 
had handed in his resignation to take over curatorship of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Then last May, next-in-line curator Lucinda 
Barnes left, at the time citing personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, in a move some viewed as a power play by billionaire trustee 
Donald L. Bren, the developer hired an architect to provide alternatives to 
designs by famed Italian architect Renzo Piano for the museum's new 
$30-million-dollar building -- reportedly without Piano's knowledge and without 
a board vote or any public announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after that, trustees -- still acting without a director's guidance -- 
voted unanimously to dismiss Piano and replace him with a man who had never 
applied his talents to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials say the appointment of a successor to Consey is not imminent. 
They don't even have a short list. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent museum curators and directors across the country say Newport Harbor's 
staff resignations cast no aspersions on the museum, noting that both Consey 
and Schimmel landed bigger and better assignments. 
</P>
<P>
And even 18 months can be considered an average length of time before finding a 
new director, some museum experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that museum trustees fired Piano and engaged a new architect for 
their building without a director on board raised red flags for some museum 
professionals, one of whom turned down a preliminary inquiry about the job 
because of the way the architect switch was made. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other prominent museum official believes a damaging perception 
persists: that a single trustee -- Bren -- is "calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren is chairman of the mighty Irvine Co., a Newport Beach 
development firm that owns one-sixth of Orange County's land and has pledged 
10.5 acres to the museum for its new 75,000-square-foot building in Corona del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees wanted a bigger, more prominent building than the museum's current 
23,000-square-foot site, one where permanent collections and temporary 
exhibitions may be shown simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Also aiming for a higher-profile image, a unanimous board chose architect Renzo 
Piano for a new building design. Piano had won international acclaim for such 
projects as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Elation marked last summer's unveiling of Piano's preliminary designs. But, 
soon after, enthusiasm began to wane. Some trustees became concerned that 
Renzo's plans couldn't provide hoped-for facilities at a hoped-for price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Piano had told the board his design could be adapted to their needs and had 
been working with trustees to modify his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Still, later in the year, without a board vote or public announcement, Bren 
hired William Pedersen, partner in the prominent New York architecture firm 
Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, to provide trustees with alternatives to Piano's 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Bren has declined to be interviewed, but an Irvine Co. spokesman has said the 
developer dipped into his own pocket for Pedersen's sketches only after he was 
approached by other trustees. 
</P>
<P>
But speculation had spread that Bren was personally dissatisfied with Piano's 
design. That the entire board had not approved nor even known of Pedersen's 
hiring, "was exactly the kind of individual power play that can really upset 
the equilibrium of an institution," said a museum expert who declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, however, the full board did vote to drop Piano and to hire Pedersen. 
</P>
<P>
That trustees would select an architect for the new building without the 
guidance of a director doesn't bother some. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Auping, chief curator at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, 
N.Y., discussed the director's job with board members this summer. He made it 
clear he was happy where he was before a formal offer was made, and none of the 
events in the museum's recent past colored his response, he recently asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Others who rejected inquiries didn't cite the architecture switch as among 
their reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rosenthal, an independent curator who works at New York's Guggenheim 
Museum, said no to Korn-Ferry International, the Los Angeles-based search firm 
hired by the museum -- but only because he doesn't want to be director of any 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
Others point out that competition for directors may have lengthened Newport 
Harbor's quest. Director searches at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New 
York, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington and the Walker Art Center in 
Minneapolis (though that post was recently filled) have undoubtedly made the 
task more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
But Julia Brown Turrell, director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa, had 
grave concerns. When the former MOCA chief curator was approached "in a very 
preliminary way" by Korn-Ferry, she immediately ruled herself out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was troubling to me that the very vital question of who the new architect 
would be appears as if it were decided without a director," Turrell said. It 
seemed that trustees did not want "the input of their artistic leader in 
something that would set the artistic course of the museum for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Davies, director of the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, said he had 
received no job inquiry from Newport Harbor. But he brought up the perception 
that Bren is "calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
"In any arts organization, you have individuals on the board who end up having 
a disproportionate amount of influence," Davies said. "But to have one person 
so clearly identified with the decision-making of the institution is unhealthy, 
and it will definitely deter potential candidates for director." 
</P>
<P>
Another museum insider charged that Bren's active participation "tragically 
documents the takeover of an independent institution by a corporation (Irvine 
Co.). The Newport Harbor Art Museum is one whose quality was driven on its 
individuality and independence and it clearly is not independent any more." 
Because Bren has refused interviews, it is difficult to gauge his reaction to 
such criticism. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine Co. spokesman Larry Thomas said that Bren and his firm had approved 
Piano's design and that "whoever is saying Bren was personally unhappy with 
Piano's design is inaccurate. . . . The only initiatives (Bren has) undertaken 
on behalf of the museum have been at the request of the museum leadership," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee James V. Selna has said that initial contact with Pedersen was not the 
result of a board vote, nor was the entire board aware of the move. But Selna 
said that process was democratic and in no way domineered by Bren. 
</P>
<P>
Divisive management battles -- real or perceived -- are not new to museums, 
especially those embroiled in building projects, and some observers believe 
that everything will ultimately come out in the wash for Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Others view the situation as indicative of a broader crisis in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Halbreich, who will become director of the Walker Art Center in March, 
believes that the problem is "reflected in the numerous openings and searches 
and questions regarding who shall lead and what they shall lead and how. 
</P>
<P>
"In certain situations, the business of running a museum has overshadowed the 
mission of being a museum," said Halbreich, director of contemporary art at 
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, who was not approached for the Newport Harbor 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the role of many museum directors has been something akin to a blind 
man in the subway holding out a tin cup. One is constantly raising funds for 
something that's getting more and more remote to one's experience, because 
someone is always riding somewhere to ask somebody for something. And the 
(director's) relationship to the artists and the audience and the object is 
becoming more distant."

Howard Hughes, the eccentric and reclusive billionaire who was widely 
publicized for his avoidance of publicity, died in a plane crash in 1976 
without leaving a verifiable will or heir. 
</P>
<P>
But he did leave one legacy that even he couldn't avoid -- the image of a man, 
now mythlike in status, who took the American dream of fabulous wealth and used 
it to insulate himself from life for more than a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
By many accounts, the man who had everything was an orphan who lived the 
saddest and loneliest of lives: fearful of germs, fearful of people, fearful of 
the daylight, fearful of many foods and in thrall to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Hughes' death, playwright Sam Shepard came up with his 
version of the man's final days in "Seduced," now in a quietly powerful and 
disturbing production by Sledgehammer Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of calling his main character Howard Robard Hughes, Shepard named him 
Henry Malcolm Hackamore. But the outline of Hackamore's life is the same as 
Hughes', even to the extent of showing him about to embark for his fatal flight 
from Mexico to the United States to seek a medical treatment that he would 
never receive. 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer is presenting the show at the Progressive Stage Company through 
Oct. 14. And thanks to tight direction by Ethan Feerst (the executive director 
of the company) and careful attention to the text, this emerges as one of the 
most affecting productions this company has ever done. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard does not spend any time elucidating why Hackamore as an individual 
needed to control everything in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Shepard explores the desire to control as a universal impulse, 
something he suggests that we all try to do within the limits of our individual 
power and wealth. Maybe no man is an island, but we all try to become islands 
in our own ways, Shepard implies. We ward off life when what we really want is 
to ward off death. 
</P>
<P>
The Sledgehammer production, nicely cast with some of San Diego's finest local 
talent, creates an eerie portrait of those hypothetical last days. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Salmon, who has made a name for himself with comic and hapless roles at 
the Bowery and the North Coast Repertory Theatres, here shows an unsuspected 
depth of command as Hackamore. It isn't easy to project power while sitting 
helplessly in a chair with an intravenous tube hooked up to one's chest. But 
Salmon does it. He speaks his commands softly and threateningly into a 
microphone and we are not surprised to see Steve Soden as his live wire of a 
bodyguard jump to attention, without a questioning word for the most absurd and 
pathetic of requests. 
</P>
<P>
Don Loper lurks in and out wordlessly as the doctor who changes Hackamore's 
plasma. Verrier Scatolini and Susan Gelman parade and prowl stunningly as the 
two women Hackamore wants to see before he dies. Scatolini gets to play an 
elegant, faded movie star type who has still retained her glamour and tries to 
use her wiles to get Hackamore to turn a few more tricks. Gelman is trampy, a 
onetime show girl with little patience for pretension. Both are seductively 
outfitted by Pam Stompoly. 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer usually excels in set and sound design, and again, they don't 
disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
In a happy match between Vince Moutain's set design and Dan (Pea) Hicks' sound 
design, door panels whoosh upwards and fall again sharply, slicing the air like 
strokes of a guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
It's a reminder of how Hackamore sliced off so much of his life. And as a 
chilling lesson in how a refusal to live does not exempt one from death. 
</P>
<P>

CURSORY 'MURDER' LACKS INSIGHT AND CONTEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although not necessarily good, television is frequently hasty. On Sunday, CBS 
presented Leona Helmsley -- whose recent tax fraud conviction is on appeal -- 
as a fang-toothed sex goddess with panoramic lips. And tonight it's this. 
</P>
<P>
Only 11 months after Carol Stuart's murder, and less than nine months after the 
apparent suicide of her husband and presumed slayer, Charles Stuart, a movie 
about this bizarre, disturbing, unresolved and still-puzzling case is hitting 
the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston" airs at 9 tonight on Channels 2 
and 8, almost as if CBS had put in a 911 call for another quickie movie about a 
sensational crime and this is the one that showed up. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there is a 911 connection here, for the story begins with Charles 
Stuart's anguished 911 call on his car phone reporting that he and his pregnant 
wife had been shot after leaving a birthing class. And Arnold Shapiro, 
executive producer of the CBS series "Rescue 911," carries the same title on 
this movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Night, Sweet Wife" is taut and well acted by Ken Olin as furrier Charles 
Stuart and Margaret Colin as Michelle Caruso, the Boston Herald reporter 
celebrated here as being practically the only early doubter of Stuart's story 
that it was a black assailant who seriously wounded him and murdered his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Only one reporter had the courage to find out" the truth, a CBS promo 
proclaims. If so, Caruso's skepticism is about the only revelation in this 
movie, which, in the main, is thin and vacant, essentially regurgitating news 
coverage and speculation without adding insight. 
</P>
<P>
The Stuarts appear to be a blissfully married young couple as they leave the 
birthing class. In a series of flashbacks, however, Charles surfaces as mean, 
cold and even murderous as he plots to do away with Carol (Annabella Price). 
</P>
<P>
After initially targeting a black suspect, police finally began to suspect that 
Stuart shot his wife in the head (the Stuarts' prematurely delivered baby died 
17 days later) and shot himself in the abdomen to divert suspicion. Before they 
can arrest him, however, he jumps to his death from a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Although it made headlines, the suicide is still a jolt because there is 
nothing in Dan Freudenberger's script to that point -- or in Stuart's 
personality as depicted here -- to establish him as someone who would take his 
own life. This suggests that no one associated with this movie has a clue about 
this man. Yet there are portrayals of his private feelings and private 
conversations with Carol even as he is shown about to murder her. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Night, Sweet Wife" depicts indiscriminate harassment of black men by 
Boston police as they search for the black assailant described by Stuart, 
resulting in heightened racial tensions, but the story does not give this 
apparent racism much context. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, in dramatic terms, is there any serious discussion of the journalistic 
issues raised by the Stuart case (Boston media reported the names of early 
suspects who were not even formally charged, for example) beyond Caruso's 
protest that the police investigation and her paper's coverage were "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
What viewers do get is instant history, and that, one may argue, is wrong.

TELEVISION: THE CAROL STUART MURDER CASE IN BOSTON RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS, 
INCLUDING THIS ONE: IS IT TOO EARLY FOR A TV MOVIE ON THE SUBJECT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be mystery twists left in the Carol Stuart murder case, but -- in the 
most venerable tradition of show business -- the TV movie must go on. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 11 months since the story burst onto the front page and into the 
nightly news, eight since her husband also died. The Boston grand jury has yet 
to deliver the results of its investigation of the matter; nevertheless, airing 
at 9 tonight on CBS is "Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston." 
</P>
<P>
The mournful salutation is taken from the farewell letter written by husband 
Charles for her funeral; the subtitle adds the ugly irony, since it was Charles 
who put her there, according to a preponderance of circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
As the story of Carol's death first unfolded, the Stuarts -- white, well to do, 
living in splendid suburbia -- were idolized as "the Camelot couple" trapped by 
urban violence, and black violence at that, since, as "Chuck" Stuart told it, a 
black man jumped into their car to rob them on their way home from a birthing 
class, shot the pregnant Carol in the head and wounded him in the stomach. Son 
Christopher, taken from his mother's dying body, lived 17 days. 
</P>
<P>
The media went hysterical over what seemed like the biggest Boston story since 
the Tea Party. Police set off a racial rage by swarming through the black 
community in search of suspects. One was found and supposedly was close to 
indictment on Jan. 4, 11 weeks after the attack, when Stuart jumped off the 
Tobin Bridge to his death in the grim Mystic River, an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was revealed that police had begun to think that maybe Chuck, perhaps 
for the insurance money and/or simply to get rid of Carol, had shot her, 
wounded himself and made up the intruder. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, who has come to symbolize the yuppie gone mad, is portrayed in the CBS 
dramatization by Ken Olin, who plays the sensitive yuppie man-hero Michael in 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
(It may be hard to miss Olin tonight: While he's killing his wife on CBS, he'll 
be opening the "thirtysomething" season on ABC fretting over whether his new 
son should be circumcised.) 
</P>
<P>
This will also be a special night for executive producer Arnold Shapiro, who 
takes over CBS' prime-time schedule, with the season debut of his "Rescue 911" 
series opening the evening at 8. 
</P>
<P>
The two programs are not unrelated. Fortuitous timing by a "Rescue 911" camera 
crew helped Shapiro get to the air first with this singularly sensational crime 
story. Carol Stuart's death had been a national event because of its bizarre 
circumstances, but it was Charles' death that set off a frenzy for TV and book 
rights, with dozens of writers and producers and perhaps a couple dozen more 
publishers and literary agents in hot pursuit of deals. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro had had a "Rescue 911" camera crew stationed in Boston awaiting rescue 
efforts that could be taped for the show, and they happened to be riding with 
an emergency rescue team the night that the wounded Stuart used his cellular 
car phone to summon police. The show eventually did a segment around the rescue 
effort, and contacts with the family, including Stuart, and other sources gave 
Shapiro a hefty advantage over other producers seeking to get the story to the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
But the question about unanswered questions in the case keeps bobbing up: Is it 
too early for a movie? 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stuart's family, the DiMaitis, aren't pleased. They issued a statement 
that it was "very disturbing" that the movie was made without their consent or 
participation "and that such a movie is being broadcast while there is still a 
sitting grand jury, before anyone, even our family, knows the outcome of the 
criminal investigation." The statement added that the movie "sets a dangerous 
precedent for any innocent individual or family whose life is touched by 
tragedy to lose all rights to privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kessler, executive vice president of television for Fries Entertainment, 
believes that it is, maintaining that there's too much unresolved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Fries has in mind its own version. It optioned a book by 
investigative journalist Joe Sharkey, who delivered his 110,000-word text 
Friday to Prentice-Hall Press, which plans an early spring publication for 
"Deadly Greed," the working title. 
</P>
<P>
Sharkey told The Times from his home in Glen Ridge, N.J., that he was 
"astonished" that a movie has been made so quickly because, for one thing, a 
major unanswered question is the role of Chuck's younger brother, Matthew, in 
the actual crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the answer but I'm not ready to discuss it," said Sharkey, who 
presumably will discuss it when his book is rolling into the bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew, supposedly tormented by conscience because he had helped Chuck in the 
plot, was said to have met with police the day before Chuck's death. 
</P>
<P>
The Sharkey book would be produced for TV by Louis Rudolph, who has done some 
major docudramas ("A Case of Rape," "Guilty or Innocent: The Sam Sheppard 
Case," "Small Sacrifices"). A UCLA classmate of Shapiro's in theater 
arts/television and a longtime friend, Rudolph said that the Sharkey book would 
necessarily need to add new elements to the story before another Stuart movie 
would be made. 
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, "Look how long it has been since the grand jury has been back. 
The silence is deafening." 
</P>
<P>
Sharkey, who has done investigative duty for the Philadelphia Inquirer and the 
Wall Street Journal, said that the crime itself is uncomplicated: "Guy shoots 
his wife and when they come to get him, he jumps off the bridge," but the idea 
of a movie now "is very odd (because) to me the case is characterized by three 
things: No. 1, the hype; No. 2, police misconduct and No. 3, a cover-up that is 
continuing. How the movie sorts that out is beyond me. That hasn't been sorted 
out yet." 
</P>
<P>
A primary focus of his book is likely to be the print press: "The story was 
driven not by journalistic concerns," Sharkey said, "but by marketing concerns, 
which I think is more and more a problem in our business. This story was seen 
as a hell of a marketing device. 
</P>
<P>
"The Globe and the Herald (the Boston dailies) are in a tremendous competition 
to cover local news and this was a barn burner, they thought. They saw it (the 
Stuart case) as a metaphor. They emptied the newsrooms and basic journalistic 
practices were trampled in the process." The papers snapped up Stuart's version 
so quickly "that they didn't ask the hard questions." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro acknowledged that his movie might eventually need an epilogue tag "if 
some startling fact comes to light." But very little has developed since the 
movie project was earnestly started in January: "The grand jury was supposed to 
be done Feb. 1, then March 1, then April 1 . . . and they're still not done," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The scramble over movies about Page 1 news stories "isn't the game that I've 
ever played," said Shapiro, "and now (that this one is over), I personally am 
happy to remove myself from it." 
</P>
<P>
He reflected on the days after Stuart's alleged suicide: "It's almost like we 
were casually strolling down the trail toward a television movie (based on the 
shooting of the Stuarts) and suddenly this herd came along and surrounded us 
and was beginning to pass us up. And that's when we realized that there was 
going to be a movie and here we were already three months into this." 
</P>
<P>
Would-be producers kept dropping along the trail until the only ones left were 
Shapiro and Mark Wolper, son of David L. Wolper, the veteran documentary and 
docudrama producer. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Wolper was in "the race" for the Stuart movie for about four 
months, hiring writers, getting rights (he wouldn't say whose). Then he quit, 
because to beat the Shapiro project, he pleaded, it would "hurt the quality of 
the film, and we were not willing to do that" -- which is the normal invocation 
for producers in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
(Shapiro noted interesting history here: that he had worked twice for David 
Wolper: "I mean, he is Mr. Documentary. He handed me my Academy Award for 
'Scared Straight' at the Oscars in 1979 and later that year he handed me my 
Emmy for 'Scared Straight.' ") 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro hired Dan Freudenberger ("Do You Know the Muffin Man?") to write his 
script: "I think the reason that they called me is that I pride myself on being 
able to do this quickly," the writer said. "I told them that, because I wanted 
the job -- and they told me how fast they wanted it and I couldn't believe it!" 
</P>
<P>
The first air deadline was the May ratings sweeps, meaning that the producers 
needed to start production March 15 -- which might well have caught the 
interest of the Guinness Book of World Records for haste. 
</P>
<P>
Freudenberger had his first meeting Jan. 26 and delivered his first outline 
Feb. 10, while chasing in and out of Boston interviewing virtually everybody 
but the ever-silent police, although he said he found a detective who was 
willing to talk without being identified. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to make the May date would have been to get a rough script outline 
so that the movie could be "storyboarded" -- sketches drawn of each scene so 
locations could be found and sets built -- and then write the script as 
shooting was going on, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally told the network that if NBC (the network interested in the Wolper 
project) makes it (first), fine," Freudenberger related, "but we can't in good 
conscience make it accurately this fast. They said, 'OK, we'll shoot in May, 
because we don't want to shoot it in summer because it's going to be too hot to 
have actors in winter clothes for January and shooting someplace in August." 
</P>
<P>
Wolper and NBC quit about May 1. "What I heard was that they never got a script 
they were happy enough with to go out and shoot," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Freudenberger was in Chicago for the last three days before filming (the movie 
was shot May 29 to June 27), polishing the script while the actors were 
rehearsing it, "but by that point, it (the script) had stopped keeping you up 
at night."

Brown Arrested: Disorderly conduct charges were dismissed Monday against 
recording artist Bobby Brown, who was arrested Sunday after he intervened in a 
restaurant confrontation between his brother and a police officer. Brown, 23, 
and brother Tommy, 29, were arrested early Sunday in an Atlanta restaurant. 
According to police, the elder Brown had been arguing with another man, then 
cursed and threatened a police officer when the officer tried to calm him.

BERG'S 'WOZZECK' IN THE URBAN JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Music Center Opera introduced its misbegotten production of "Wozzeck" 
to Los Angeles last year, the directorial Wunderkind in residence moved the 
action from Germany ca. 1830 to a world of nightmare modernism. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers wore battle fatigues and green berets. Poor Marie became a 
sophisticated slut in a black sheath. Alban Berg's monumental pathos got 
muddled in sociopolitical trendiness. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the San Francisco Opera to restore interpretive sanity. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
The new production at the War Memorial Opera House does indeed take some 
liberties. Lotfi Mansouri's careful action scheme teeters on the brink of 
histrionic hysteria from the start. Michael Levine's marvelously inventive 
designs ignore the intended 19th-Century milieu and invoke urban-jungle 
claustrophobia, ca. 1925 -- the time of the premiere of the opera. 
</P>
<P>
The result impels a clash of styles. The actors deal in heightened naturalism. 
The settings invoke stylization that stalks toward crafty Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
The characters are imprisoned in monstrous barracks, trapped in towering 
tenements. Facades are rigged, angles ominously distorted, proportions 
violently exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Berg's poor people live in ratty slums. The enemy, we are told, is the city. 
</P>
<P>
That makes good sense on any terms except those of the composer. He concerned 
himself with fundamental matters of human cruelty. The metropolitan milieu is 
virtually irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
In the crucial murder scene, it actually becomes perverse. Marie, after all, is 
supposed to die in "a pond in the forest." 
</P>
<P>
Mansouri and Levine make it a vaporous non-pond in a sketchy non-forest near a 
geometric quasi-penal housing unit. The San Francisco solution doesn't work 
well. Still, it works better than the quasi-bathtub in the mock-Vietnamese 
compound concocted at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco "Wozzeck," shared with Toronto, suffers from some obvious 
surface contradictions. Ultimately, however, these seem relatively unimportant. 
The director and designer respect the spirit of the work, even when they 
obscure the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Mansouri defines the characters deftly, and motivates their behavior with 
telling detail. Levine uses elaborate yet flexible scenic devices to reinforce 
the essential moods of terror and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he literally illustrates the text in ways that may be a bit too easy. 
Marie comments that the moon is red ("Wie der Mond rot aufgeht!"). Obediently, 
the cyclorama suddenly glows crimson. In most cases, however, the bold and 
bleak images create their own supportive poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Friedemann Layer, who has inherited the baton from the originally scheduled 
Christoph Perick, provided supportive poetry of his own on Sunday afternoon. He 
struck a fine balance between analytical clarity and emotional propulsion. He 
really savored coloristic nuance and textural cohesion. If any unhappiness 
lingered from the recent labor dispute, it wasn't obvious in the well-staffed 
pit. 
</P>
<P>
Other conductors -- most notably Karl Bohm -- have built those two otherworldly 
B-natural crescendos after Marie's murder into a more shattering outcry. Few, 
however, have gauged the catharsis of the great D-minor interlude so 
poignantly. 
</P>
<P>
The delicately balanced cast was dominated by Allan Monk -- urgent yet dazed, 
tough yet sensitive, vocally bluff yet potent in the title role. Judith Forst, 
replacing the originally intended Teresa Stratas, played Marie with feverish 
ardor and sang with luminous point. 
</P>
<P>
Wozzeck's adversaries, all picturesquely characterized, included Siegfried 
Vogel as the heartily demonic Doctor, Stuart Kale as the whining and preening 
Captain and Warren Ellsworth (a veteran of the Los Angeles war) as the 
handsome, agile and aggressively horny Drum Major. 
</P>
<P>
John David De Haan brought boyish lyricism to the posturing of Andres. Joseph 
Frank coped sweetly with the prophetic utterances of the Fool. Emily Golden 
made the most of Margret's lusty counterpoint. Little Darren Mayer exuded 
vulnerability as Marie's child. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone articulated the unexpurgated German text beautifully. The supertitles 
did not flinch at the translations.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 2 VIEWS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
DOCUMENTARIES: FILMMAKERS EXAMINE THE LIVES OF TRAILBLAZER ADAM CLAYTON POWELL 
JR. AND THE LEGACY OF EARL WARREN AND COURTROOM ACTIVISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There could scarcely have been two more different men in public life than Earl 
Warren and Adam Clayton Powell Jr., yet both had a profound effect on civil 
rights legislation in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Their remarkable and engrossing stories are well-told in Richard Kilberg's 
54-minute "Adam Clayton Powell" and Bill Jersey and Judith Leonard's 88-minute 
"Super Chief: The Life and Legacy of Earl Warren," which screen together 
tonight at 8 at UCLA's Melnitz Theater as the first offering in the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and UCLA Film Archive's Academy/Contemporary 
Documentary series. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who was to head the largest Protestant congregation in America and 
become the country's most powerful black politician, was a tall, movie-star 
handsome orator-playboy born to wealth and position. For decades, he fought 
boldly and effectively for the rights of his people while at the same time 
living high with a succession of beautiful wives. 
</P>
<P>
His story is the stuff of tragedy, his downfall brought about by his flagrant 
self-indulgence and tax troubles -- both of which played into the hands of his 
enemies. How sad it is to hear this man, who did so much to lay the groundwork 
for the civil rights revolution of the '60s, sneer at Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The many people who knew and worked with Powell suggest persuasively that, for 
all his well-publicized peccadilloes, he was more sinned against than sinning. 
Sadly, the hard-drinking man we see aboard his yacht during his Bimini exile 
surrounded by a bevy of women and nearing the end of his life brings to mind no 
one so much as Errol Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
In dizzying contrast, Warren -- who rose from Alameda County district attorney 
to California attorney general, then governor and finally chief justice of the 
United States -- was a staunch, devoted family man whose sense of fair play led 
to the activist Warren Court, which handed down one civil rights decision after 
another that would have enormous and ongoing effect upon American society. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony of Warren's life, which the filmmakers cannot avoid (but leave 
you feeling strongly that they wish they could have) is that as California's 
attorney general (and soon-to-be governor), he strongly advocated placing 
Japanese-Americans in concentration camps. The filmmakers emphasize that Warren 
subsequently regretted this stand deeply and was haunted by it for the rest of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they downplay this dark chapter in Warren's otherwise exemplary life to the 
extent that it tends to undercut the case they make for Warren as a great man, 
someone who in the view of his own grandson, stood for that which was "beyond 
the expedient."

JAZZ REVIEW;

<P>
NORRIS AND MCKENNA'S PIANO YIN AND YANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be difficult to find two jazz pianists who have less in common than 
Walter Norris and Dave McKenna. As far apart musically as geographically 
(McKenna is based in Boston; Norris has lived in Berlin since 1977), they were 
presented Sunday in a first-ever joint appearance, promoted by fellow pianist 
Daniel May, at a ballroom in Loew's Santa Monica Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Norris is an adventurer who brings classical influences to bear even on such 
jazz and pop standards as Charlie Parker's "Bird" and Leroy Anderson's "Belle 
of the Ball." Moving in and out of tempo and switching from music-box gentility 
to experimental, jagged atonality, he has the imagination, and the technical 
resources, to take "My Foolish Heart" or "Lush Life" through uncharted melodic 
and harmonic byways. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, Norris was stunning. Though his two original pieces seemed a little 
too abstract for the audience, he left no doubt that his is one of the most 
vividly innovative minds in the contemporary piano field. 
</P>
<P>
When McKenna's set followed, he offered the bright, masculine yang to Norris' 
deep, dark yin. In his long, accessible series of standard tunes, he retained 
the swinging jazz essence. His left hand is distinctly his own: the moving 
fingers walked, or strode, or strummed. He is a master of a form that stems 
directly from traditional roots. 
</P>
<P>
Because he did not speak, some of the ingenuity of his song-linking was no 
doubt lost on many. "Just Friends" led to "Can't We Be Friends," followed by 
"Beautiful Friendship," after which came a Cole Porter medley -- but who knew? 
</P>
<P>
Eventually McKenna began to pull; he is a brilliant performer in what seems, 
after a half hour, to be more a manner than a style. For a finale, Norris and 
McKenna played a few numbers at two pianos, but the oil of Norris and the water 
of McKenna rarely mixed. Norris had to tone down his complexities; not until 
they played a blues was there a true sense of compatibility. But this was a 
rare and challenging evening for performers and listeners alike.LEONARD FEATHER

RICK DU BROW: 'COP ROCK,' 'TWIN PEAKS': DOUBLE TROUBLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
TV or not TV . . . 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLE PUMP: ABC gives its big gamble of the season, "Cop Rock," a two-night 
launching this week. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Bochco's musical police drama not only debuts Wednesday, its regular 
night, but has its premiere repeated Saturday. It's on at 10 p.m. both days. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's airing is in the same time slot where "Twin Peaks" will be seen 
weekly this season, starting Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's trying to woo young adults away from their VCRs on Saturdays with unique, 
late-night shows. 
</P>
<P>
EYE-POPPER: Was it a "Flash" in the pan -- or does CBS have a sleeper? 
</P>
<P>
Lots of buzz over the solid debut of the comic-strip series "The Flash" against 
strong programs that included "The Cosby Show," "The Simpsons" and even 
"Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it was a special two-hour blowout, but it actually kept building in 
ratings against "Cheers" and "Gabriel's Fire." 
</P>
<P>
We'll know better about "The Flash" when its regular one-hour outings begin 
Thursday -- and when new "Simpsons" episodes arrive Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CBS is delighted as "The Flash" scored big with kids 2-11, teens and 
men between 18 and 54. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH HOPES: CBS is so exuberant after the performance of "The Flash" and other 
series that the cellar-dwelling network says it hopes to win the first week of 
the new season, which ended Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
National ratings, scheduled for release today, will determine whether that 
expectation is justified. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Sunday's big-city overnight ratings showed CBS' "Murder, She 
Wrote" knocking off ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "America's 
Funniest People." 
</P>
<P>
And CBS' Sunday movie "Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean," starring Suzanne 
Pleshette, also beat the opposition in the overnight survey. 
</P>
<P>
PICKUP: NBC made it official Monday -- "Real Life With Jane Pauley," successful 
as a series of specials, has earned a weekly spot on the prime-time schedule 
come midseason. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: Wonder if Shelley Long thinks much about her decision to leave 
"Cheers." She never should have left. She was pretty wonderful as Diane. 
</P>
<P>
TOGETHER AGAIN: It was swell to watch "Honeymooners" Art Carney and Audrey 
Meadows reunited on "Uncle Buck" Monday, but there must be better places than 
on that dismal series. What they did was fascinating -- they actually humanized 
the show a bit. 
</P>
<P>
VARSITY: With Phil Shuman, Patrick Healy and Bill Lagattuta, KNBC Channel 4 has 
the strongest bench in local TV news. 
</P>
<P>
FOX TROT: With those icy ratings for the Emmy show, how long can the TV Academy 
stick with Fox? Imagine -- just 14% of all TV viewers tuned in. We said wrongly 
last week, on receiving mixed-up data, that big-city audiences were actually 
up. But the national 14% figure was devastating. OK, Fox outbid the Big Three 
networks for the show, but should the academy be selling off its audience? 
</P>
<P>
HE AND SHE: Hal Fishman may be the 800-pound gorilla at KTLA Channel 5, but 
co-anchor Jann Carl holds up just fine. 
</P>
<P>
COLLECTOR'S ITEM: "The Andy Griffith Show" debuted 30 years ago next week, and 
superstation TBS marks the occasion Oct. 3 with a three-hour special starting 
at 5:05 p.m. Don Knotts, who played Deputy Barney Fife, will be on hand with 
other cast members for the outing, "30 Years of Andy: A Mayberry Reunion," 
which will also include five episodes. 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING BLOCKS: With careful handling, Burt Reynolds' new Friday CBS sitcom, 
"Evening Shade," could provide a fine lead-in boost for the Whoopi 
Goldberg-Jean Stapleton series "Bagdad Cafe." Nice program flow here. 
</P>
<P>
TWO FOR THE SEESAW: Funny how "Murphy Brown" gets -- deservedly -- unending 
praise, while the also-successful "Designing Women," which can be lots of fun 
when Dixie Carter and Annie Potts are on-screen, has to struggle for industry 
respect. No Emmys yet for any of the leads. Kind of like the way Penny Marshall 
and Cindy Williams were slighted in "Laverne &amp; Shirley." 
</P>
<P>
SITTING PRETTY: Does "Murphy Brown" creator Diane English have any major 
changes in store for this season? No way. "We've got a good thing going," she 
says, and she doesn't intend to mess with it. This lady would never make it as 
a network executive. 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL BY FIRE: If Sharon Gless' new show "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" holds 
up, there'd seem to be little chance for "Face to Face with Connie Chung" to 
get back its Monday night slot when the reporter resumes her series. Might be a 
good thing for Chung -- fewer hours and higher quality. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE MOVE: Don't bet against Johnathan Rodgers becoming the first black to 
head a Big Three network in the future. Only in his mid-40s, he broke ground 
for blacks here a decade ago by becoming news director of KNXT Channel 2 (now 
KCBS). He's quietly been a major CBS trouble-shooter, and now he's president of 
CBS' owned-and-operated stations. A class guy all the way. 
</P>
<P>
CENTENNIAL: Try to find somebody who gets cable's "Ha!" comedy network because 
next Tuesday is the 100th anniversary of Groucho Marx's birth and the channel 
plans to make a big day of it. 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE RECORD: Just in case you missed it (because it wasn't presented on the 
Emmy telecast), Patrick McGoohan -- of "The Prisoner" fame -- won as best guest 
actor in a drama series for a "Columbo" role as a high-powered lawyer. 
Suggestion: Check out the Orwellian "Prisoner" videos. 
</P>
<P>
FADEOUT: A tip of the hat to the best forgotten series of the year -- "Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "Edith, Sunday's supposed to be the day of rest. How can I rest 
when I'm going to church?" -- Archie Bunker, "All in the Family." 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Gracie. . . .

U.S. DOCTORS PAY A SOVIET HOUSE CALL; 
</P>
<P>
THE TEAM OF PHYSICIANS FROM ALASKA FOUND VAST DIFFERENCES IN MEDICAL CARE. THEY 
ALSO FOUND AN APPRECIATIVE COLLECTION OF PATIENTS. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ANADYR, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Fritz Craft, 34, an American dentist filling teeth in a hospital in this 
remote seaport on the Bering Sea, could not believe it when his first adult 
patient jumped up and hugged him at the end of his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened again. And again. 
</P>
<P>
Anesthesia, it turned out, is rarely used when repairing cavities in the Soviet 
Far East. So for the first time in most of their lives, Craft's Soviet patients 
were experiencing painless dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the outbursts of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
For 32 members of an Alaskan medical expedition to this part of Siberia, the 
example was just one of many they discovered during a 17-day tour of the Soviet 
Union's northeasternmost corner -- a tour that underlined for them and for a 
Times reporter allowed to accompany the mission vast differences between U.S. 
and Soviet health care. 
</P>
<P>
Often, conditions and procedures were primitive by American standards. The 
visitors saw novel techniques unfamiliar to most in the United States, some of 
them showing medical promise, others smacking more of folk medicine. There was 
the "bone-stretching" procedure, the use of enormous quantities of electricity 
in shock therapy, the use of ultraviolet light tubes as treatments for colds. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a child has an earache, sore throat, runny nose or cold, we have them 
sit with an ultraviolet light in their ear, nose or mouth for a few minutes," 
explained the Soviet doctor on duty in the medical ward of the Fairy Tales 
Kindergarten in Bilibino, 
</P>
<P>
site of the world's only nuclear power station above the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, a little girl and a boy were seated at a tiny table with 
ultraviolet light tubes up their nostrils. Another girl had a tube in her 
mouth. "Colds in this, the coldest place on Earth, are passed around quickly," 
the doctor noted. "We found that the ultraviolet light treatment has cured and 
reduced colds in our kindergarten by 40%." 
</P>
<P>
The ultraviolet machine is just one of the numerous exotic medical devices 
never before seen by the American doctors who visited clinics and hospitals in 
the small cities of Pevek, Bilibino, Anadyr and Magadan, and a number of rural 
communities in Magadan Oblast (region), across the Bering Sea from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Carr, 42, a physician's assistant with the Alaska State Dept. of 
Corrections, visited a hospital in Talja where he saw 1,000 volts of 
electricity fired through the body of a woman being treated for depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The hair on her head stood straight up," Carr said. "I was told the 
electricity was run through her to realign her nervous system. She was seated 
in a chair mounted on thick rubber mats. Obviously, she wasn't grounded. If 
someone had touched her, they would have been electrocuted." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, a typical shock treatment -- known as electroconvulsive 
therapy, or ECT -- would use 150 volts of electricity, according to an American 
mental health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians here have other techniques that would look strange to an American 
doctor. Heated demitasse-size suction cups are placed on patients' backs to 
keep fluids from settling in lungs and are put on other parts of the body for 
all sorts of aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
Many traditional home remedies are used in hospitals -- herbal medication, hot 
packs on the chest, mustard plasters, chopped garlic around the neck, hot tea, 
honey and vodka. 
</P>
<P>
High-frequency current is prescribed for muscle stimulation. Ultrasound is a 
common procedure. Weird-looking electromagnetic field machines with a claw-like 
device suspended over one's head are supposed to cure headaches. 
</P>
<P>
All these are part of normal treatment in hospitals where medicinal mud is 
often applied on the belly of a pregnant woman, on the belly of a woman wanting 
to get pregnant, for arthritis, bursitis, and other such ailments. 
</P>
<P>
The American doctors were fascinated with the possibilities offered by some of 
the Russians' exotic procedures but expressed a great deal of skepticism about 
most of the unorthodox practices they saw in the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
One unusual surgical procedure developed here, however, has already been 
introduced in Alaska -- the Gavril Ilizarov bone-stretching technique. 
Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Michael Holloway, 45, has used the procedure 40 times in 
Alaska since he was here on a similar expedition last year. It is applied to 
cases where a patient, due to either birth defect or injury, has one leg 
shorter than the other. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway explained the procedure this way: Wires drilled into bones are 
attached to external metal rings. The rings are connected to rods and bolts 
that are turned with a wrench one-fourth of a millimeter four times a day. When 
the desired length is achieved, the bone is held in place to allow 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
When performed properly, there is regeneration "not only of a healthy bone, but 
also of skin, muscle, blood vessels and nerves lengthening up to 10 inches in 
the leg," Holloway said. "People that are crippled don't have to stay crippled 
with this remarkable discovery." 
</P>
<P>
What the Soviet health care system lacks is at least as striking as some of its 
more unusual procedures and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are many doctors, there is a serious shortage of specialists. 
The system also lack materials and supplies. Needles and syringes, for example, 
are used repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
There is an acute shortage of birth control products, and abortions are common. 
In a Pevek hospital last year, there were 900 abortions and 500 births. 
</P>
<P>
Anchorage ophthalmologist Marvin Greendahl, 46, hoped to perform a simple 
surgery on interpreter Tatiana Khokhorina's 3 1/2-year-old son, who has a 
congenital cataract with 50% vision in the affected eye. But he was unable to 
operate, he said, "because, unfortunately, there is no high-tech ophthalmology 
equipment in the entire Magadan region." 
</P>
<P>
"If Tatiana's son does not have the operation, he will lose sight in the eye," 
Greendahl said. "I'm making arrangements to fly the boy to Alaska for surgery 
later this year. It's impossible to do the type of eye surgeries here that we 
do every day in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Royann Royer, 35, who teaches dental hygiene at the University of Alaska, found 
a great fear of dentists among children here. "They cry with pain because there 
is no anesthesia. Dentists have no X-ray machines. Dental equipment is 
low-speed, prolonging pain." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the children also tend not to brush their teeth every day. It's 
easy to understand why. Toothpaste is a product in seemingly perpetual short 
supply throughout the Soviet Union, and the local variant "tastes terrible," 
noted Craft. "When I gave them American toothpaste, they went bananas over it. 
They wanted to brush more." 
</P>
<P>
Common medical practice here often seems bizarre by U.S. standards, starting 
with the pay of the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the past 73 years of communism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
doctors and nurses, along with engineers and teachers, have made among the 
lowest salaries in the country -- half to one-fifth as much as common laborers, 
mechanics, bus drivers and miners. It is from the working class, not the 
professional class, that much of the leadership of the country is derived. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nina Tihovska, 38, a cancer specialist in Magadan City, earns 500 rubles a 
month (the equivalent of about $800 at the official exchange rate) -- twice as 
much as doctors in other parts of the Soviet Union because of Siberia's 
remoteness and harsh climate. She said the reason 70% of Soviet doctors are 
women is because men prefer to earn much higher salaries as workers, leaving 
the lower-paying jobs to women. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ryan, a hospital administrator, and Steve O'Connor, a paramedic, were 
quickly ushered out of a maternity ward in Pevek, a seaport nearly on top of 
the world, at the edge of the Arctic's East Siberian Sea and icebound most of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have thought we had the plague," said Ryan, 57, director of the Indian 
Health Service Hospital in Bethel, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
What Ryan and O'Connor didn't know was that in general, only women are 
permitted in Soviet maternity wards. Even the new father is forbidden to see 
his wife or child for six days, when they leave the maternity wing of the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike America, where hospitals discharge patients as soon as possible, here a 
15- to 30-day stay is common for a relatively minor problem or procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet hospitals try to make up for their technical shortcomings in other ways. 
"The Soviet doctors seem to be knowledgeable and their surgical skills appear 
to be excellent," commented Alaska hospital administrator Joe Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he added, "there is a great deal of loving and care on the part of Soviet 
doctors and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
But they lack modern instruments and technology. It is like the 1930s."

In Bilibino, Galina Nikonchok, 35, a hospital head nurse, showed Brian Saylor, 
42, of the Anchorage Health Department, the record room where a red 
cloth-covered medical record book is kept for every person living in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Each book starts with a birth certificate. Every time the person visits a 
doctor or a hospital, an entry is made in the book until the final recording of 
the death certificate. If a person moves, the record book is sent to the 
hospital in the new location. 
</P>
<P>
Children's hospital walls are decorated with colorful murals and drawings of 
fairy-tale and other characters, including even Mickey Mouse. Children wear 
Mickey Mouse T-shirts by Soviet artists. 
</P>
<P>
Communist propaganda posters line hospital corridors. In one hospital were 
photographs from the Afghanistan war. In hospitals throughout Magadan Oblast, 
one can see V. I. Lenin and Mickey Mouse side by side. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 members of the Alaska medical expedition flew from Anchorage to 
Provideniya in a chartered Aeroflot turboprop. From there the expedition split 
into four groups, flying to various centers in rural areas of the Magadan 
region. Helicopter flights were made to remote camps where Soviet medical 
brigades provide health care for nomadic reindeer herders. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Mala, 43, a physician and University of Alaska professor, led the 
expedition. Alaska's Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper has described Mala as "the 
key player in the unfolding relations between the Soviet Far East and Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
Mala went to Moscow in 1985 and later visited the Siberian Academy of Medical 
Science. He is a founder of the International Union for Circumpolar Health 
</P>
<P>
and was the organization's first secretary. 
</P>
<P>
With a membership consisting of all nations at the top of the world, the 
union's purpose is to research health problems common to the global far north. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, Mala became founder-director of the Institute for Circumpolar 
Health Studies at the University of Alaska with an initial $500,000 funding 
from the Alaska Legislature. He led his first medical expedition to Siberia 
last summer. His Soviet counterpart, who coordinates the expeditions in the 
Soviet Union, is Dr. Alexsei Lebedev, 47, the minister of health for Magadan 
Oblast. 
</P>
<P>
Mala is credited by many with melting the "ice curtain" that previously existed 
between Alaska and its neighbor across the Bering Sea. America's first male 
Eskimo physician, Mala attributes his success in breaking down the barriers 
between the two nations "to the magic of my heritage," and adds, "You see, my 
father was an Eskimo and my mother was Russian."

CONGRESS MOVES TO DELAY BUDGET CUTS; WHITE HOUSE VOWS FIGHT

Congress today took the first step to delay $85 billion in imminent spending 
cuts, while the White House said it would rather "negotiate into the night" 
than accept a delay. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans were almost unanimous in opposition as the House Appropriations 
Committee approved, 32 to 20, a catchall bill that would keep government 
operations going for an additional 20 days -- until Oct. 20 -- to provide more 
time for negotiators to reach an agreement on deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to discourage President Bush's promised veto, the committee 
attached to the bill an additional $2.1 billion to finance U.S. participation 
in Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The committee sidestepped another foreign policy question, Bush's proposal to 
forgive $6.7 billion of Egypt's debt in appreciation of Cairo's assistance in 
the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater repeated today that Bush would veto any 
legislation that would delay across-the-board spending reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts -- called a sequester -- will take place unless the targets of the 
Gramm-Rudman law are modified or delayed and will mean reductions of up to 40% 
throughout the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to avoid a sequester. We are willing to negotiate into the night," 
Fitzwater said.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said today that war could break 
out in the Persian Gulf at any moment, and he called Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
an "act of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the General Assembly, Shevardnadze referred to Aug. 2, the date 
of the invasion, as "Black Thursday," and called the action "irrational." 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq flagrantly violated the United Nations Charter, the principles of 
international law, the universally recognized norms of morality and the 
standards of civilized behavior," the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said today that it received a 76-minute 
videotaped message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The tape was delivered 
to the department by Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat. Officials were making a 
copy of the tape before handing it to the news media later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein taped his address in response to an eight-minute message delivered on 
Iraqi television by President Bush 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. television networks have said they are unlikely to broadcast the 
entire tape. Bush, when told last week that Hussein's message might run 90 
minutes, said the tape would put Americans to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze spoke on the second day of the General Assembly session. On 
Monday, leaders from France, Iran, Brazil, Argentina, Poland and Indonesia 
condemned Iraq for invading Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet foreign minister hinted at the possibility of a U.N. military 
operation in the gulf region, noting that "the United Nations has the power to 
suppress 'acts of aggression.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There is ample evidence that this right can be exercised," he said. But such a 
step should come only after all peaceful, non-military forms of pressure have 
been applied, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the invasion, the Soviet Union was Iraq's strongest ally. 
</P>
<P>
Later today, the Soviet minister was to preside over a special meeting of the 
Security Council attended by up to 12 foreign ministers. The session is 
expected to end with passage of a resolution extending to air corridors the 
U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq and occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The air embargo would ask all nations to bar flights to and from Iraq.

After a shaky start, the Magellan probe is successfully mapping cloud-shrouded 
Venus, beaming back "revolutionary" views of a heavily fractured, volcanic

Laboratory in Pasadena said today. 
</P>

A brief but dramatic movie made with Magellan data was presented at a news

of complex faults and fractures. Other photographs released today, including a

Pope John Paul II set down rules for Catholic universities today, pleasing many 
U.S. Catholic educators by dropping earlier plans to give bishops jurisdiction 
over the hiring and firing of theologians. 
</P>
<P>
But the pontiff also included a stipulation that surprised American officials 
-- that a majority of an institution's teachers be Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited papal document upheld the right of academic freedom and 
independence. But it also stressed that students and teachers -- particularly 
theologians -- must not stray from official church teaching, and it gave local 
bishops a watchdog role. 
</P>
<P>
"All Catholic teachers are to be faithful to, and all other teachers are to 
respect, Catholic doctrine and morals in their research and teaching," the Pope 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-page document, drawn up over 10 years, appeared to meet the requests of 
U.S. Catholic educators, who had complained that earlier drafts threatened to 
undermine academic freedom and give the church hierarchy too much control.

Like a father laying down the law to his teen-age son, the U.S. government says 
that as long as Iraq occupies Kuwait, Saddam Hussein can't use the car. 
</P>

The Iraqi president's black, bomb-proof, $300,000 limousine is resting on its 
bulletproof tires at a repair shop in the suburb of Livonia, where the Cadillac 
was sent to have its engine rebuilt, the Customs Service said. 
</P>
<P>
It will be held there under authority of President Bush's executive order 
freezing Iraqi assets in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reason to believe that this car might have been used by Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein," said Donald Watson, a Customs official in Chicago. 
"In any case, he's not going to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
The Customs Service titled its news release on the car, "Is Saddam Hussein 
Walking?" 
</P>

The Cadillac has bomb-proof armor and tear gas dispensers.

It's never too late to quit smoking to save one's health, U.S. Surgeon General

</P>
<P>
The health benefits of quitting are "major and immediate" and extend to men and 
women -- young and old, sick and well, she said. People who quit before age 50 
have half the risk of dying in the next 16.5 years compared to continuing 
smokers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
And for all ages, 10 to 15 years of abstinence reduces ex-smokers' risk of 
dying to nearly the level of people who never smoked.

Recent sharp hikes in oil prices during the Persian Gulf crisis are the 
"totally unjustified and indefensible" result of speculation at consumer 
expense, the European Community's top energy official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have doubled since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The widely traded North Sea Brent, which rose to a decade-high price of $40.40 
a barrel Monday, was being quoted midday today at $40.70 a barrel on the 
European spot market. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the U.S. benchmark 
West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery was up 40 cents over 
Monday's close to $38.65 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"The increases in oil prices yesterday and in the past few weeks are totally 
unjustified and indefensible," said Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy 
commissioner. The loss of oil production from Iraq and Kuwait has been made up 
by higher production elsewhere, he said, so oil stocks in Europe and other 
regions are "unusually high."

REVISED GNP DATA SHOWS SLOW GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE REPORT OF A 0.4% GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER FURTHER FUELS FEARS OF 
A RECESSION.

<P>
The economy grew at a barely perceptible 0.4% annual rate during the second 
quarter, an even worse performance than first believed, the government said 
today. Many analysts believe that it is sliding into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's revised report on the gross national product -- the 
total output of the nation's goods and services -- was the lowest since an 0.3% 
rate was posted in the final quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It was a reminder of how precarious the economy was even before Iraq invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, resulting in a dramatic increase in the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the drop in 
economic growth "is certainly cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good news. The number is very low," Fitzwater said. "Obviously we are 
concerned about the economy and the growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe we are in a recession right now," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as for heating 
and transportation, any price increase not only slashes available funds needed 
to feed economic growth but also fuels inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the department's two earlier estimates put economic growth at a 
lackluster 1.2% rate from April through June. The final revision was due to 
lower inventories and smaller exports than first believed. 
</P>
<P>
The GNP rose at a 1.7% annual rate in the first quarter, down from 2.5% in 1989 
and 4.5% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a price index tied to the GNP was unchanged at an annual rate 
of 3.9%. But with the surge in oil prices, inflation as measured in the

Pratt &amp; Whitney, a major manufacturer of jet engines, has advised customers 
of cracks found inside the main turbine shafts of 12 of its newest engines, a 
company spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was considered serious enough to advise all customers and the 
Federal Aviation Administration when it was discovered earlier this month by 
the company, Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman Mark Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said emergency inspections have turned up cracks in only 12 of the 174 
PW4000 engines delivered to aircraft builders and air carriers so far. The 
engines are designed to power wide-body airliners.

DALLAS DEALS QB WALSH TO NEW ORLEANS

<P>
Dallas quarterback Steve Walsh, who has been Troy Aikman's backup since both 
were drafted last year, was traded to New Orleans today for three draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, said his team will receive the Saints' No. 1 
and No. 3 choices in 1991 and a No. 2 pick in 1992. Jones said the No. 2 pick 
could be upgraded to a No. 1 if Walsh performs well for the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who started five games last season when Aikman was injured, will compete 
for the starting job in New Orleans with John Fourcade, who has been erratic in 
the Saints' first three games. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was concluded at NFL headquarters just before a meeting of league 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys Coach Jimmy Johnson said he and Jones debated until late last night 
whether to trade Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
But, Johnson said, Aikman "is the best quarterback in the NFL, as far as I'm 
concerned, and will be the best for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
"Steve has handled things in a class manner, but he deserved to be a starter on 
another team," said Johnson, who coached Walsh at the University of Miami when 
the Hurricanes won the national championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 110 of 219 passes for 1,371 yards last season. He threw five 
touchdown passes and nine interceptions. This season, Walsh was 4 for 9 for 40 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We drafted Steve to be a part of the Cowboys," Jones said. "But we will have a 
good future, because we will have a lot of flexibility in the draft because of 
the trade." 
</P>
<P>
He said he liked having Walsh and Aikman on his team. 
</P>
<P>
"From a personal standpoint, it was a great feeling. . . . It made me lay my 
head down better at night." 
</P>
<P>
The trade had been rumored for weeks. Before today's deal, it had been 
speculated that disgruntled Saints quarterback Bobby Hebert would be part of a 
three-way deal involving the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The deal gives the Cowboys three No. 1 picks next year -- their own, the 
Saints' and the one they obtained from Minnesota in the Herschel Walker trade.

The Philadelphia 76ers extended Coach Jim Lynam's contract two years and signed 
top draft pick Brian Oliver to a guaranteed four-year contract at a reported 
$1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sixers' owner Harold Katz said today that it took 10 minutes to agree with 
Lynam on a contract that extends the coach's tenure through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Katz then described the signing of Oliver, a 6-4 guard from Georgia Tech, as 
"the most difficult of a second-round draft choice I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Lynam, 49, was in the last year of a three-year contract that paid him a 
reported $700,000. A source indicated that the coach probably will get $700,000 
for the additional two years.

Cornerback Tyrone Braxton, a leader in the Denver Broncos secondary, has been 
lost for the season with a torn ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Braxton, who was injured Sunday in the Seattle game, was scheduled to undergo 
surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament at St. Luke's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials said Monday that the surgery will require a six- to eight-month 
rehabilitation period. 
</P>
<P>
Braxton had been a starter for only one season, but already he had become one 
of the team's most vocal and inspirational players. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said he has not decided who will start in 
Braxton's place. Possibilities are Alton Montgomery and veteran Randy Robbins, 
but Reeves said the Broncos also would explore the trade market in search of a 
cornerback.

Detroit second baseman Lou Whitaker strained a ligament in his right knee and 
probably will miss the rest of the season, the Tigers announced. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker was injured while sliding into home in the first inning of Sunday's 
6-0 victory at Oakland. He left the game and was fitted with an ankle-to-thigh 
brace before returning to Detroit, where he was examined Monday by Dr. David 
Collom at Henry Ford Hospital, a team spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year major league veteran was batting .237 with 18 home runs and 60 RBI 
in 132 games this season. If Whitaker misses Detroit's nine remaining games, he 
will finish with his lowest batting average since 1980, when he hit .233.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: BAKING SODA, CORN STARCH TEAM TO CONQUER UNDERARM ODOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I'm having difficulty finding an underarm deodorant that will not 
cause irritation. Within a day of using any deodorant, my skin develops a deep 
red irritation. I have even tried natural products from health food stores, but 
with no success. 
</P>
<P>
The only non-irritant I have found is baby powder and corn starch, but I have a 
stressful job and require more protection. Help! 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Here are some hints to help prevent irritation from antiperspirants and 
underarm deodorants. Never apply them after showering or shaving under your 
arms. For greatest effectiveness, antiperspirants should be applied to dry skin 
in the evening before bed. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't work, here is a recommendation you may find helpful. A reader 
of this column offers the following: 
</P>
<P>
"After reading about underarm odor, I feel led to write you about a simple 
solution to this problem. My daughter has underarm odor. I used to nag her to 
wash herself better and use deodorant, but it never helped. One day I read 
about baking soda. After much arguing, my daughter agreed to give it a try. 
That was the end of her objectionable smell. But if she doesn't use it, I can 
still smell her from across the room. Baking soda really works, and it is very 
inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time we have heard of this home remedy. A baking soda and 
corn starch combination, dusted on, can be effective for some people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When I read the letter from the woman whose husband caught genital herpes 
from her after 10 years of marriage, I wept. The pain she expressed reminded me 
of the anguish my husband and I went through ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Herpes is a cruel disease, but Zovirax has helped us cope with the physical 
symptoms. Our local support group has given us strength to deal with the 
emotional symptoms. I highly recommend the Herpes Resource Center, which can 
put people in touch with a support group in their area. The number is (919) 
361-2120. 
</P>
<P>
A. Thanks for the tip. People with herpes need all the help they can get. There 
is also a newsletter put out by the Herpes Resource Center with information on 
research and practical advice on dealing with this viral infection. Another 
source of information about herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases is 
the STD hotline: (800) 227-8922.

2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell paid filmmaker George Lucas more than 
$300,000 and agreed to quit using the name Luke Skyywalker in an out-of-court 
settlement revealed late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which actually transpired two weeks ago, puts to rest a 
$300-million federal trademark infringement lawsuit filed by the Marin 
County-based Lucasfilm Ltd. on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claimed that Campbell, by using the name Luke Skyywalker, had engaged 
in unfair competition and infringement on a licensed Lucas trademark. Luke 
Skywalker is the hero of Lucas' blockbuster "Star Wars" trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
Lucasfilm attorney Charles Shephard refused to comment on the specific 
financial arrangements of the agreement but said the settlement put into force 
a permanent injunction on Sept. 12 prohibiting Campbell and his company from 
using any variation of the Skywalker trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely pleased with the settlement," Shephard said. "Mr. Campbell can 
no longer appear on stage calling himself Skyywalker.

CBS won the first week of the 1990-91 television season, the first time the 
network has been tops for premiere week since 1984, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the week ending Jan. 25, 1987, that CBS won a week 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' top-rated new show was "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," in 28th place, and 
its winning Sunday movie was "Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean." 
</P>
<P>
Comedy remains king for the new season -- nine of the top 11 shows are sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS win was not exactly a landslide, with only 0.4 rating points separating 
No. 1 from No. 3, making it the closest premiere week since the start of the 
1966-67 season. The one-two spots on the Nielsen list went to NBC's "Cheers" 
and ABC's "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
In ratings for the week ending Sunday, compiled by the A. C. Nielsen Co., CBS 
won with a 13.6 rating and a 23 share. NBC was second with a 13.4 rating and a 
23 share, edging out ABC, which posted a 13.2 rating and a 22 share. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households. A share is the 
percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a particular show or network.

HENRY ELLARD 
</P>
<P>
It started out like a record-breaking day: An 11-yard diving catch in front of 
Ben Smith, next a 15-yard reception between Jessie Small and Eric Allen, then, 
isolated on a linebacker, a 50-yard scoring pass play. Three Jim Everett 
passes, three Henry Ellard catches for 76 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
A fierce Philadelphia pass rush followed, ending the Ram loss. Still, Ellard 
finished with seven receptions for 145 yards, bringing his three-game totals to 
17 catches for 313 yards and two touchdowns.

<P>
This seems to be a bad time to be looking for work in California. The economic 
news hasn't been good, and those who are pounding the pavement hunting for a 
job may find the situation pretty grim. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest forecast by UCLA's economists, the state unemployment 
rate will rise to as high as 7.3% in 1991 from 5.5% this year, well above the 
projected national rate of 6.8%. That would be the first time in several years 
that California will suffer worse unemployment than the nation as a whole. It's 
likely to be worse in Southern California than in the north. 
</P>
<P>
State industries such as construction, aerospace and high technology are 
beginning to slump, and the volume of help-wanted advertising, a sensitive 
measure of economic conditions, is sinking. David Hensley, UCLA's top 
California economic forecaster, is expecting a recession next year. Some of his 
colleagues don't go that far, but most expect very slow growth in the state at 
least until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, my. That's enough to give you a headache. Is the sun finally setting on the 
California economic boom of the 1980s? Should those who are hoping to land a 
good job in the Golden State just forget about it? 
</P>
<P>
The superficial answer to both questions is probably yes. The state is in for 
some tough times over the next 12 months. If you go no further than the news 
headlines and the unemployment lines, you may end up feeling depressed. 
</P>
<P>
But if you take a deeper look at the California economy, you'll spot some 
amazing changes that have occurred over the last decade. Changes that should 
bolster the spirits of job-seekers during this difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
A generation ago, people used to enumerate the principal industries of 
California on the fingers of one hand: aerospace/defense, tourism, agriculture, 
real estate/construction and services (which included everything from banking 
to fast food). If you want to know where most Californians work, look in those 
places, economic observers would say. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are looking for work in California today, forget that advice. 
</P>
<P>
The state's biggest companies and "traditional employers" are, quite simply, 
less likely to provide opportunities for good jobs with career advancement 
potential than they did 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So where are you more likely to find those opportunities now? Think small. 
</P>
<P>
The most intriguing economic trend of the 1980s was the explosive growth of 
small business in California. According to the state Employment Development 
Department, employers with nine or fewer employees were the fastest-growing 
segment of the job market in the past decade. Very tiny firms with three or 
fewer workers grew by more than 50% in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Why did this happen? Mostly because Big Business has slimmed down. The global 
competitiveness of industry has forced American companies to watch expenses and 
keep payrolls lean. 
</P>
<P>
In economic terms, companies have become less "vertically integrated." That 
means they try to do fewer things themselves and rely instead on outside 
suppliers, independent contractors and consultants to do some of the things 
they used to do in-house. In other words, they're contracting out instead of 
hiring their own employees to do a particular job. And, for a job-seeker in 
today's market, that information should read like a Rosetta stone, translating 
the grim economic statistics of today into career opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
A study done for the state Senate in 1987 estimated that the "contingent" work 
force (which includes temporary and part-time workers as well as those hired on 
contract to perform specific tasks) may make up as much as 25% of the state's 
employment. But it noted that growth in such jobs has been so rapid that nobody 
really knows the true magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
For some job-seekers, this trend may seem troublesome. Who wants to work for a 
dinky outfit, probably for lower pay and fewer benefits? And not much job 
security either. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that small business has traditionally paid less than jobs in big 
companies. But it's also true that opportunities for advancement in small 
companies have usually been greater for those willing to work awhile for less 
money. In fact, that has never been truer than it is now. 
</P>
<P>
Let's try an example. You were hoping to get a job in sales and marketing at 
giant Widgets International, but it isn't hiring and doesn't expect to be 
hiring for months. Then you notice that Widgets International uses tiny WeDoIt 
Inc. for some marketing research work. You visit the offices of WeDoIt and are 
soon hired to work on the Widgets International account. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that you won't make as much money, at least initially, at WeDoIt, and 
it may also be that you'll have less job security and perhaps fewer benefits 
than if you had been hired at Widgets International to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
But the advantage you have is that WeDoIt offers more chances to advance, to 
perform different tasks. And, in the changed job market of the 1990s, you could 
end up with much more valuable experience that will be transferable to other 
job situations. 
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts, the sector of the California economy that should keep 
generating new jobs -- even if the state goes into a recession -- is the 
service area, which some people believe represents dead-end careers in 
low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't accurate. The services sector is where many of the new 
small-business jobs are. Anyone who performs work for another business or 
another person is often listed in the "service" category. Many of those jobs 
now pay very well: Companies that contract out usually pay well for the work 
because doing it that way is still cheaper than hiring full-time employees to 
do the task. 
</P>
<P>
That seems especially true in California, where economic change is often more 
rapid than in the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Inscribed on California's Rosetta stone of 1990 might be this career advice: 
Work at a variety of places and gain broad experience.

A RETRAINING PROGRAM CAN EXTEND A CAREER OR IMPROVE IT. BUT IT'S THE EMPLOYEE'S

Pacific Bell is faced with the bloody task of cutting nearly 11,000 jobs during 
the next five years -- about 16% of its work force. And the main operating unit 
of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group is trying to do it without laying 
anybody off. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, officials at the telecommunications company are hoping, will be 
found in aggressive retraining of its employees, coupled with natural attrition 
and early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the options facing some of our employees may not be what they would 
like, but it beats being laid off," Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kate Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
During the next decade, workers who thought they were long past the age of 
matriculation will find themselves once again in a classroom. They will be 
seeking new skills because they have been laid off by a company in a troubled 
industry -- maybe an aerospace company or a savings and loan -- or they may be 
desperately trying to hold onto the job they have in a world of technological 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, retraining has become a booming industry itself. But while training 
programs abound through governmental agencies, colleges and even some 
employers, such as Pacific Bell, there may be a shortage of the right kind of 
training, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to try to retrain all the people that need retraining or teach all 
the skills that need to be taught, we'd never get a plane out the door," said a 
training coordinator at layoff-plagued Lockheed, which does devote significant 
resources to employee training programs. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, experts say, it is up to the individual employee to seek out the 
right training program and get the most possible from it. 
</P>
<P>
"The old view of career decision-making was 'once I get out of school, I make 
one decision -- I get on the career train and stay there for the rest of my 
life,' " said Richard Knowdell, executive director of the Career Planning &amp; 
Adult Development Network, a nationwide network of career counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the expectation is people will change jobs and change careers several 
times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the change will be by choice; some will not, Knowdell said. Either way, 
"there's going to be a huge need for training and retraining." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the Commission on the Skills of the American Work Force found 
that the skills of U.S. workers are lagging their counterparts overseas, 
causing a crisis in productivity. Among other things, the commission called on 
the U.S. government to immediately pour billions of dollars into public schools 
and on-the-job training and recommended that U.S. businesses be required to 
invest an amount equal to 1% of their payrolls on worker training. 
</P>
<P>
"Retraining is not only for people who are being laid off, but for people who 
are remaining with their company in the labor force," said Sonja S. Marchand, 
director of the division of business and industry services of the Office of 
Continuing Education at Cal State Northridge. "Even people who aren't being 
laid off will lose their jobs if they don't continually keep on top of what's 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace industry is a perfect example because it is both shrinking and 
adjusting payroll to training, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
There are many training programs sponsored by such agencies as the state 
Employment Development Department, the California Employment Training Panel, 
which channels much of its training money through local Private Industry 
Councils, and employers themselves. They support an ever-growing army of 
schools, consultants and trainers, Knowdell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies pay top dollar" and private trainers frequently earn $1,500 to 
$2,000 a day, said Knowdell, who also conducts training classes for businesses. 
"It's a good living." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the face of increasing demand, some worry that enough of the right kind 
of training might not be available. Budget cuts at the state's educational 
institutions are an ominous sign as well, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Many government-funded programs don't have a good track record when it comes to 
deciding what kind of training to provide, said Duane E. Leigh, an economics 
professor at Washington State University and author of "Does Training Work for 
Displaced Workers?" a book published recently by the W. E. Upjohn Institute for 
Employment Research. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh studied several government training programs for displaced workers and 
found that job search assistance -- helping workers develop their job-seeking 
skills -- was clearly the most effective form of training. 
</P>
<P>
"The job search assistance looks awfully good for displaced workers in project 
after project," Leigh said. But more intensive classroom skills training and 
on-the-job training were more questionable and more costly. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the programs he studied, "It wasn't clear that the training provided 
was really going to be helpful to people in terms of the jobs available in the 
community," Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly unsuccessful program in Houston took highly educated 
white-collar workers laid off by petrochemical plants and trained many of them 
to maintain air conditioners, computers and refrigeration units. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the California Employment Training Panel designs programs tailored 
to the needs of employers, rather than training for jobs it hopes will exist, 
Leigh said. The ETP reimburses the company for training costs only if the 
worker is placed in a job using his or her new skills and remains there at 
least 90 days. "In the absence of an indication from the employer of what 
skills are going to be needed, it's kind of hard to predict for him," he said. 
"It's just hopeless to try to forecast manpower training needs." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, most of the responsibility for finding the right training program 
and making a success of it belongs with the employee. 
</P>
<P>
"The company gives some, but the employee has to give some, too," said a 
Lockheed official. "If you leave here, you don't leave your training knowledge 
with your Lockheed employee badge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RESOURCE: TIPS ON TRAINING: 
</P>
<P>
* Figure out what you really want. Training may not be the answer for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
* Be willing to commit yourself to training. 
</P>
<P>
* Go beyond what is assigned. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to put into practice what you learn. 
</P>
<P>
* Form a study group. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep an open mind. look at the situation as an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't overlook any options. 
</P>
<P>
* Try not to get discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask for help if you need it.

Margaret Joyce of Thousand Oaks was still adjusting to the shock of being laid 
off from her well-paying managerial job with an electronics firm when she got 
another, albeit more pleasant, surprise: The state Employment Development 
Department has a no-cost, comprehensive program just for high-ranking 
white-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real learning experience for me to find out they don't work just with 
blue-collar jobs, they are really interested in getting the professionals back 
to work too," Joyce said. She was talking about the state agency that has best 
been known for running the network of "unemployment offices" where displaced 
workers -- many unskilled or semi-skilled -- go to collect benefit checks and 
to seek new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the state agency has been working to expand its scope to reflect 
California's shifting job market. Its primary tool has been its 23 Experience 
Unlimited "job clubs" for unemployed managerial, technical and professional 
workers. Last fall, it launched its first "industry-specific" project -- the 
Aerospace Human Resources Network Office in Manhattan Beach -- and plans in the 
coming months to start another in the San Francisco Bay Area for the 
electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It has taken us years to dispel the myth that this is just a place for the 
unskilled and the destitute," said department spokeswoman Valerie J. Reynoso. 
"We have excellent services for the increasing numbers of professionals who 
suddenly find themselves out of a job for the first time since college." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the department placed about 500,000 workers in new jobs, about 10% 
of which were in professional, technical or managerial categories, Reynoso 
said. Its placement services -- provided at no charge to job-seekers and to 
California's approximately 850,000 employers -- represent one of the 
better-known aspects of the state's third-largest department. With an annual 
operating budget of $587 million -- almost $409 million of which comes from the 
federal government -- the EDD has more than 400 offices throughout the state. 
It collects various job-related taxes ($13 billion in 1987), distributes 
unemployment and disability insurance payments ($1.9 billion and $1.35 billion, 
respectively, in 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are 
available). The EDD also provides special job training programs for youths and 
other groups, maintains wage records and is a major source of labor-market 
information. 
</P>
<P>
But with the slowing of California's economy, the loss of many electronics and 
defense-related jobs and the downsizing that has accompanied a decade packed 
with mergers and acquisitions, the department has put increased emphasis on 
employment services, especially for white-collar workers, Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're changing because those folks with needs out there are changing. We're 
seeing different faces these days -- not just blue-collar folks but those whose 
experience includes administration or engineering, those with advanced academic 
degrees," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For all classes of job-seekers, the task of finding employment is getting a 
boost from the department's new $18.5-million Job Match, a massive, 
computerized program that connects eligible applicants with jobs anywhere in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in Northern California in the fall of 1988, Job Match is gradually being 
added at EDD job services offices throughout the state, and officials expect it 
to be fully operational by next spring. Employers can find qualified applicants 
from anywhere in the state, while job seekers no longer will have to go down to 
the local unemployment office periodically to check job postings. At offices 
that already have the Job Match system, EDD employees call a job-seeker at home 
whenever the computer spits out an appropriate listing. 
</P>
<P>
For displaced professionals, however, the informal self-help job clubs known as 
Experience Unlimited remain the department's most effective tool. 
</P>
<P>
The job clubs, which grew out of a 1959 experiment in Berkeley and flourished 
for more than a decade before fading in the late 1970s, were revived in 1986 by 
then-EDD Director Kaye R. Kiddoo, a former Lockheed executive who believed that 
they could serve a growing need. 
</P>
<P>
The state provides one employee to coordinate job club services at each 
participating EDD office and allows members use of office computers, 
telephones, facsimile machines and other facilities. Members help each other in 
scores of ways, including updating resumes, providing job leads, brushing up on 
interview techniques and helping at job fairs. Club members also put out a 
newsletter that contains resume summaries, coded for privacy, and sent to 
employers throughout California and other parts of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Once employed, many former club members help with everything from job leads to 
employment counseling. All services are free, but members are expected to spend 
at least four hours a week on club activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The length of unemployment varies with the positions and the salaries they 
earned, but in the two years we've been here, all of our members have gone back 
to work," said Norma Reagin, director of the job club in Santa Ana, one of two 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Reagin estimated that the club -- which lately has had from 150 to 180 members 
at any given time -- has helped about 2,000 professionals get back to work, 
including engineers, human resources managers, computer analysts and even some 
chief executives, with salaries averaging around $50,000, although some members 
were earning $100,000 or more when they lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Baldoni, who oversees the job club in Simi Valley, said many members 
are high-achieving, well-educated people who have suddenly found themselves 
looking for work for the first time since college. Often, they need help 
learning to market themselves. The club's strength, she said, lies in "the 
diversity of the talents of its members and their willingness to help each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
For Joyce, 34, who lost her job as director of corporate purchasing at a Bay 
Area-based electronics firm about a year after it closed its Chatsworth plant, 
membership in the Simi Valley job club provides an opportunity to meet with 
others in similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a chance to talk with peers, to realize there are a lot of really 
talented people that this has happened to. Without that, you can start to feel 
bad about yourself. This helps you keep your spirits up," Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
M. Ross Feeney, 53, of Inglewood, who lost his job running a materials lab in 
Torrance when his firm cut back its work force, said job clubs such as the one 
at the EDD's Manhattan Beach aerospace network office help bolster his resolve 
to push hard for new employment. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're looking by yourself, you get so you hate the rejections, so you 
stop looking as hard as you should," Feeney said.

During one recent afternoon in the network office's suite near many of the 
South Bay's aerospace firms, Feeney and two other laid-off aerospace employees, 
guided by club coordinator Cheryl Dotson, studied videotapes of Feeney's mock 
job interview, looking for ways to sharpen his technique. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, this small group of new club members -- which included financial 
analyst Melvain L. Sturdivant, 42, of Carson and engineer Gerald L. Morris, 46, 
of Manhattan Beach -- had attended a weeklong orientation session and updated 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
The network is run jointly by the EDD and seven of Southern California's major 
aerospace employers. Dotson said about 1,000 displaced workers have registered 
with the office since it opened in October, and about half have found new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant manager Marie Quinn said a increasingly important thrust for the 
aerospace office is "to open other avenues, to help these people look at 
getting into other fields." That is not an easy concept for career aerospace 
workers to accept, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not yet ready to make a change," said Morris, who spent 15 years solving 
design problems for the same firm. "But I know (the aerospace downsizing) is 
going to be permanent, so now is a good time for me to start thinking about 
where I should be going and what I want to do next." 
</P>
<P>
In every office there are some happy endings, the kind of success stories that 
keep the others going. For Robert Stackhouse, 55, of Simi Valley, it came 11 
months after a corporate takeover cost him his $63,000-a-year position as 
director of contracts for a defense firm. Earlier this month, after a "bleak 
and discouraging" search, he started work for an international consulting firm 
-- a position he found through a tip from a former job club member. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's over," Stackhouse said of his experience with unemployment. "But 
I will continue to do whatever I can to support the job club here."

When Sharyn D. Nappi gets the call to hunt up a certified industrial hygienist, 
she knows it's a tough assignment. 
</P>
<P>
There are perhaps 4,500 such environmental specialists in the world -- and all 
likely to be happily employed. 
</P>
<P>
"And when someone says, 'I need a CIH for Timbuktu,' good luck," Nappi laughs. 
Then she bluntly advises her client, "You're going to have to pay them whatever 
you have to." 
</P>
<P>
Nappi is an environmental headhunter, vice president of Jeffrey B. Brant Co., 
an executive search firm with offices in El Toro and Woodland Hills. She stalks 
the restless environmental engineer, the newly certified solid-waste manager, 
the ambitious recycling specialist and other valuable personnel in the crusade 
to clean up the nation. And she can't find candidates fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in the past few years, opportunities in environmental work have 
been tremendous, notes Nappi. And they only seem to grow, as the industry 
begins to look not only at cleaning up but at preventing future messes. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust for the future," Nappi said, "will be going in and assessing a 
potential situation and taking precautions to prevent it from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the current jobs are in businesses created literally by 
force of law. 
</P>
<P>
Since passage of the 1970 federal Clean Air Act, 1972 Clean Water Act and the 
later Superfund laws, jobs have bloomed not so much in traditional conservation 
work -- such as wildlife management -- but in entirely new fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never had a request for a park ranger," said Rocco Catena, vice 
president and industry specialist with Purcell Group, a Los Angeles-based 
executive recruiter. "The greatest demand in the environmental field right now 
is for technically trained people." 
</P>
<P>
These are often the technical staff on cleanup teams, in regulation-driven 
industries that are likely to just keep growing over the next couple of 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under Superfund laws 
designed to remove or stabilize hazardous waste around the country, has already 
identified more than 1,200 sites and expects to add 900 to the list. Each 
cleanup is likely to average $25 million and take an average of eight to nine 
years. At the moment, 3,000 EPA employees alone are working on Superfund 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
And this is just part of a vast environmental public works project that could 
cost as much as $500 billion over the next several decades, according to a 1989 
report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
More environmental work will come in such new fields as recycling. In 
California, for instance, 25% less trash will be allowed in landfills by 1995, 
50% by the year 2000. And nationally, the EPA target is 25% less in the next 
two years. This is spawning a huge new field in waste handling and recycling, 
which offers not only work for the technically sophisticated, but also for the 
manual laborer. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a whole range of needs," said Robert H. Collins, president of Mine 
Reclamation Corp., which is at the stage of gathering permits for a recycling 
and landfill project at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"People who operate heavy equipment or are in materials handling" will be 
needed, Collins said. "The recycling industry is going to be heavy on 
blue-collar workers initially because the way you separate (recyclable 
materials) is by hand. But there will be jobs in human relations, accounting -- 
there's a whole new industry being built up." 
</P>
<P>
Collins sees opportunity in recycling and waste management for refugees from 
the aerospace industry, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for bright young people who have experience in related fields," 
Collins said, "because there is (a shortage of workers with) direct experience. 
. . . Normally, the aerospace industry has enough technical background, and 
that's what you need -- plus ingenuity." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, people in other lines of work have already begun to specialize in 
environmental concerns. These include accountants, personnel managers, 
assessors, heavy equipment operators and, of course, attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"There simply aren't enough environmental attorneys to go around," noted the 
San Diego-based Environmental Business Journal. 
</P>
<P>
"The hottest commodity in the legal job market is the environmental lawyer," 
agreed Joel Moskowitz, a partner specializing in environmental law with Gibson, 
Dunn &amp; Crutcher in Los Angeles. "The environmental lawyer has a lot to do, 
both in negotiating with government agencies and in bringing suits" to settle 
liabilities among various parties in contested cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz recalls that demand for environmental specialists was already high 
even in the mid-1980s, when he was head of California's Toxic Substances 
Control Program, an umbrella organization directing the state's hazardous waste 
and toxic cleanup efforts. At the same time that Gov. George Deukmejian was 
cutting the state work force and had frozen hiring, he was increasing state 
jobs in toxic-waste cleanup by 50% a year, Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, technical specialties once considered exotic are bread-and-butter 
careers in the environmental field. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the certified industrial hygienist that Nappi has trouble finding 
is typically responsible for the control of occupational health hazards ranging 
from exposure to chemical agents to physical nuisances such as noise, vibration 
and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists, hydrologists, civil engineers and traditional soil scientists are 
now working alongside environmental biologists, nuclear engineers, health 
physicists, risk-management specialists, and sales and marketing people with 
environmental experience -- with salaries in the area of $35,000 to $75,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Experience is one of the best bargaining chips an environmental specialist can 
bring to the job search. 
</P>
<P>
Boston-based CEIP Fund Inc. (formerly the Center for Environmental Intern 
Programs) offers one way to break in. CEIP considers itself the nation's 
biggest on-the-job trainer for environmental work. In the past 18 years, it has 
placed more than 4,000 students and recent college graduates in short-term 
professional positions in environmental work. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, this means positions with industry, consultants, environmental 
organizations or government agencies. The average job lasts five months, and 
median salaries are more than $375 a week. 
</P>
<P>
CEIP Fund also has produced, through nonprofit Island Press (and on acid-free, 
recycled paper, naturally), a detailed, anecdotal "Complete Guide to 
Environmental Careers," a book aimed at "the next generation of environmental 
professionals." 
</P>
<P>
That next generation will have not only the option of a career in a growing 
industry, but job satisfaction, said Kevin Doyle, national director of programs 
for CEIP. 
</P>
<P>
"You can feel good about what you're doing," he said. "It's challenging, and 
you run into other people who are really fascinating -- by virtue of the fact 
that they have also chosen to devote their lives to environmental protection. 
And whether they choose to work for a major corporation or the Sierra Club, the 
same spirit moves them."

'OUTPLACING' HELPS PUT JOB LOSS IN PERSPECTIVE;

SPECIALIZED CONSULTANTS HELP TERMINATED WORKERS LEARN THE SKILLS NEEDED TO GET

<P>
If you're unlucky enough to get fired or laid off, hope that you're lucky 
enough to be "outplaced." 
</P>
<P>
One of the buzzwords of the '80s is going to be just as common in the '90s -- 
as more workers face layoffs, increasing numbers of employers will turn to 
outplacement consultants to help ease the transition to new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Outplacement is a program that many employers provide to terminated workers to 
help teach them to find work. The outplacement consultant will not actually 
find jobs for you, and only your employer can arrange for them to assist you. 
Outplacement is paid for by the employer and usually costs a percentage of your 
annual salary. And it's not just for executives: Clerical and assembly-line 
workers make up a good number of those who are outplaced. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a systematic process by which we help an employee through the job search 
transition or the career transition." said Bylle Snyder, senior vice president 
of Drake Beam Morin, a Los Angeles-based outplacement firm with 45 offices 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
So if your company is undergoing a restructuring and has enlisted an 
outplacement firm to help, here's what it may mean for you: 
</P>
<P>
* You'll get some information even before layoffs or firings are actually 
announced. Most outplacement firms insist on being involved from the very 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
* An outplacement consultant will be in on your actual firing. He or she will 
help explain your compensation package and severance pay. You will also be 
given information on the assistance being provided. 
</P>
<P>
"The outplacement consultant tries to help the employee maintain dignity and, 
as much as possible, to keep him or her from taking it personally. Firing is 
seldom an issue of competence -- it's politics," said Robert W. McCarthy, 
president of McCarthy Resource Associates in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Be aware that the outplacement consultant is present for another reason, too -- 
to keep your soon-to-be-ex boss from saying anything he'll regret later or from 
making any promises that he can't keep. 
</P>
<P>
* If you work in a security-sensitive industry such as aerospace or high 
technology, the outplacement consultant may accompany you to clean out your 
desk, turn in your keys, sign off on your computer. Try to be philosophical 
about what's sure to feel humiliating: At least no one will be able to accuse 
you of having taken anything. 
</P>
<P>
* You'll probably be provided with someplace to go while you search for work, 
either at the outplacement consultant's offices or in rooms your ex-employer 
has made available. In most instances, you'll have access to a photocopier and 
fax and a receptionist will take messages for you. 
</P>
<P>
* The outplacement firm will help you get organized and ready for a productive 
search. "After someone gets the word that he's fired, the first thing we do is 
to assess his finances, health and relationship with his wife," McCarthy said. 
"If those things are all OK, then we help him look for a job. If they're not, 
then we structure a financial plan to help stretch three months' severance pay 
into six, and we try to get his health in shape while he still has medical 
benefits." The firm will refer you to counselors and other professionals you 
may need during the transition. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, down to the nitty-gritty: Helping you find new work. The first step 
is to analyze what your skills are and how your experience may fit into the job 
market; many firms do vocational and aptitude testing to help target positions. 
Then the outplacement consultant helps prepare a resume -- or resumes -- geared 
specifically for the jobs wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Through networking and through more traditional avenues, the job-seeker will 
come up with a number of leads, some productive, some dead ends. The 
outplacement consultant assists in weeding through the leads and can coach on 
preparation of letters to prospective employers as well as follow-up 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"In your letter offering your resume for consideration for an opening, try not 
to say, 'I look forward to hearing from you,' " McCarthy said. "Instead, say 'I 
will call you within the week to share some ideas and answer any questions you 
may have.' This keeps you in control." 
</P>
<P>
Learning how to be interviewed is a key skill, according to outplacement 
experts. Most firms videotape you during a mock interview and then critique 
your responses. "How to handle the human resources interview versus the 
interview with the boss is key," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Also important is fielding the inevitable question on salary requirement. 
McCarthy suggests responding to "What do you want to get paid?" with another 
question: "How do you negotiate compensation?" or with "I'm more concerned with 
the total package. I'm sure you have a fair range -- what is it?" This keeps a 
job-seeker from stating a salary that is too high, or just as damaging, too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
* Now you've got an offer. What next? The final stage of outplacing an employee 
is dealing with the inevitable job offers that will come in after an organized 
search. (Experts say most people do get new jobs, and they get them within six 
months, especially if they're willing to relocate.) 
</P>
<P>
"Don't leap at the first offer," McCarthy said. "Tell the employer that you're 
honored, pleased and excited but that you need a couple of days to shut some 
other things down. Then run to leverage another job that may have been slower 
in jelling." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy compares outplacement to learning to play golf on a driving range. 
"You can get pretty good on the range, but then you have to go to the course 
and deal with real life. It's the same with practicing to find a job -- in the 
end, it's you out there, putting into practice everything you've learned."

<P>
Bob Packer was sick and tired of Southern California. Born and raised on Los 
Angeles' Westside, he had watched traffic grow worse, crime go up and air 
quality go down. 
</P>
<P>
All these maladies were made even worse by his fruitless efforts to find a 
better job than the one he held as an assistant manager at a record store. 
</P>
<P>
Although Packer had a two-year degree in accounting, he was competing for jobs 
with others who had bachelor's and master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't find a decent job," said Packer, now 31. "And there was no way 
I was ever going to be able to buy a house in L.A. -- not with the way prices 
had gone up." 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with it all, he packed up his family about two years ago and headed for 
Las Vegas. He got a job as a bookkeeper for a fast-growing home builder, earned 
a bachelor's degree, was promoted to an accounting position and now earns close 
to $60,000 a year -- three times the salary he was making when he left Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never looked back," Packer said. "Whenever I visit L.A. now, I can't 
figure out why anybody would want to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
Like Packer, more than 200,000 people leave Southern California every year for 
greener pastures, according to the California Department of Finance. While 
that's not near the number of new arrivals, there's a significant trend in 
migration out of the Los Angeles area to other parts of the state or country. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who leave are looking for a better quality of life; others are 
looking for work. And for some, the high cost of Southland housing is the 
impetus for their move. Many renters who have been locked out of the pricey 
housing market here are fleeing to areas where homes are cheaper and their 
meager savings are still enough for a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, a growing number of equity-rich homeowners are cashing in and moving 
out, using their hefty profits to make big down payments on nicer homes in less 
expensive areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, relocating has its drawbacks. It typically means leaving most of 
your family and friends behind, not to mention the Southland's legendary 
weather, beaches and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on where you go, you might even run into racial or religious 
prejudice or the "Go-back-to-California" mentality made infamous by the folks 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
If you're willing to take these risks, you'll want to learn a little more about 
your proposed destination. Here's a rundown of some of the most popular spots 
among Southland refugees: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
<P>
"We're the fastest-growing area in the state, and a lot of the people who are 
coming here are from Southern California," said David Orosco, coordinator of 
economic development at the local chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Orosco said many recent arrivals are seeking work in the area's booming 
construction industry, growing high-tech business and vibrant agricultural 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Others have been lured by the area's still-affordable homes. Although prices in 
the area have zoomed nearly 50% over the past two years, the median-priced home 
in Sacramento is just $148,700 -- a far cry from the $215,533 it would take to 
buy the typical home in Los Angeles or the $245,798 it costs to purchase a 
residence in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, some economists worry that the local economy will suffer if 
the state government -- which accounts for about 33% of the jobs in the area -- 
is forced to make deep cuts in spending to ease its budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Summer in Sacramento can be brutally hot. And if baseball or football are a big 
part of your life, forget it: The state's fourth-largest city doesn't have a 
major league team in either sport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area suffered through some tough times in the mid-1980s when its 
import/export business waned and financial services industry ran into trouble. 
But now they've bounced back, and job opportunities are growing again. 
</P>
<P>
"The business services sector is especially strong," said Frederick Cannon, 
senior economist for Bank of America. "That's anything from data-processing 
companies to law firms." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the city's allure is its mild weather, beautiful bay and fabled 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, San Francisco is much more densely populated than Los Angeles 
and the cost of living is higher. And if you're a conservative, you might not 
like the city's liberal attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Californicate Seattle" is the battle cry in this picturesque city. The 
natives are tired of the estimated 30,000 Californians who move here each year 
and blame them for everything from worsening traffic to higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you can't blame Southland refugees for coming. They like Seattle's clean 
air, relatively low crime rate and growing cultural scene. The city's 
unemployment rate stands at 3.9% -- compared to 5.9% in Los Angeles -- thanks 
mostly to Boeing Corp.'s soaring backlog of orders and the area's fast-growing 
high-tech business. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, however, isn't quite nirvana. It rains an average 160 days a year and 
local property taxes are soaring because of the run-up in housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Our taxes are going up because all you people keep moving in," complains Barry 
Martin, who runs a Seattle gas station. "We don't appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHOENIX 
</P>
<P>
If you're hoping to get a job here in real estate, banking or a related 
business, forget it. A sluggish economy and overbuilt real estate market have 
sent those types of jobs into the tank. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some good growth in service-related and retail jobs, though," said Tom 
Rex, an economist at Arizona State University. "A lot of the jobs are fairly 
low-paying, but others actually pay quite well." 
</P>
<P>
Home prices in the Phoenix area have been dropping for several years, but now 
they may be poised for an uptick. 
</P>
<P>
"I just bought a home with four bedrooms, two baths and a nice-sized yard for 
$87,000," said Ken Plonski, a spokesman for Phoenix-based Del Webb Corp. "I 
wouldn't have bought it if I thought I was going to lose money." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, summers in Phoenix are blistering: Weeks can go by before daytime 
temperatures drop below 100 degrees. Winters are mild but often smoggy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
<P>
Sin City has become a boomtown. Its gaming business is thriving, high tech is 
starting to grow, and new homes and office buildings are rising faster than a 
gambler's fever during a hot game. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is strong, and it looks like it'll continue growing for the next 
several years," said Harold Foster, director of the city's community planning 
and development department. 
</P>
<P>
There's no state income tax in Nevada, so you get to keep more of your 
paycheck. Few cities offer a better variety of entertainment than Las Vegas, 
and you can dine and drink in the casinos on the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Although Las Vegas isn't quite as dependent on the gaming business as it used 
to be, job opportunities in the city still tend to follow the ebb and flow of 
the big hotel/casinos. The local economy might falter if the country falls into 
a recession and people cut back on their entertainment, or if high gas prices 
keep visitors away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RESOURCE: MAKING THE DECISION TO LEAVE 
</P>
<P>
Relocating can be hazardous to your wealth, especially if you don't do some 
homework first. Here are some tips that can help you avoid being disappointed 
with your decision to move: 
</P>
<P>
* Make a list of all the things that are important to you. If you can't bear 
the thought of leaving friends and family behind, you should probably stay put. 
Even if there are no ties that bind, make sure your proposed relocation spot 
can fulfill all of your cultural and recreational requirements. 
</P>
<P>
* Visit your proposed new hometown at least two or three times, preferably 
during different seasons. This gives you a chance to see potential employers, 
drop off resumes and get a better idea of what life there would be like 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to get a new job lined up before you leave. Too many people quit work, 
sell their possessions, give up their home and move only to find out that their 
skills aren't needed in their new community. 
</P>
<P>
* Check out local educational facilities if you have children or plan to go 
back to school yourself. Visit the facilities and talk with administrators. 
Also ask for a tour of the school that your kids would attend: It can tell you 
a lot about the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask realtors about local home prices or rental rates. Salaries are usually 
lower in smaller cities, so you'll need a corresponding drop in housing 
expenses and overall living costs to break even financially. 
</P>
<P>
* Supplement your own research with books. "Places Rated Almanac" (Prentice 
Hall; $16.95) ranks nearly 350 metropolitan areas on factors from climate to 
crime rates. "The Rating Guide to Life in America's Small Cities" (Prometheus 
Books; $16.95) rates 219 cities too small to be considered metropolitan areas.

PARADOX IN DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
THE SOUTHLAND WILL SEE A 15% DROP IN OVERALL EMPLOYMENT IN THE SECTOR BY 1992. 
STILL, MANY FIRMS ARE STILL HIRING. 
</P>

<P>
Most discussions of defense industry employment in the post-Cold War era 
revolve around a single word: Layoffs. The guns-and-missiles business, quite 
simply, is shrinking, and few experts believe that even the Mideast crisis will 
reverse that trend. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers paint a grim picture. Total employment in the aerospace industry in 
California, including the civilian and military sectors, is expected to decline 
nearly 15% to 294,000 by 1992 from 344,000 this year, according to the UCLA 
Business Forecast for California released this month. 
</P>
<P>
And defense-related employment in the state, which includes all jobs that are 
directly or indirectly a result of military spending, will decline nearly 11% 
to 647,000 during the same period from 725,000 this year, according to the 
economic forecasting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But this contraction isn't industrywide. Even as defense companies announce 
layoffs, they are still recruiting college graduates and hiring experienced 
workers with highly specialized skills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a definite paradox," said Sandy Lechtich, president of National 
Recruiters in Canoga Park. "There are lots of people being laid off, lots of 
people who can't find anything, but there are still a lot of needs in certain 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the current opportunities involve electronics specialties, a reflection 
of the military's growing emphasis on electronic warfare and the efforts of 
some defense firms to diversify into civilian high-tech markets. Experts in 
complex software, microwave radio systems, digital signal processing and 
satellite communications, for example, are all in demand. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft, for one, is recruiting microwave radio experts and other 
communications engineers to work on civilian air-traffic control systems, even 
as it pursues a companywide work-force reduction program aimed at eliminating 
6,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Skilled production workers with experience in structural assembly, aircraft 
maintenance and toolmaking are also in short supply. That's in part because the 
shrinking defense budget has been accompanied by an unprecedented boom in the 
demand for new and used commercial aircraft, creating jobs in building or 
retrofitting airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Corp., for example, is cutting its overall payroll by about 3,000, but 
nonetheless has 400 openings for skilled assembly workers to build B-2 bombers 
in Palmdale, according to Dave Suydam, vice president for human resources at 
the B-2 division. In fact, Boeing Co., a subcontractor on the B-2, has 
dispatched workers from its Seattle plants to work in on the project in 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Suydam said the company needs experienced structural mechanics, electrical 
mechanics, painters and liaison engineers. "If you're an aircraft worker doing 
'touch-labor,' then you're working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But landing the available jobs is no easy feat. Companies are looking for 
recruits with specific skills and are being highly selective. And as the 
defense companies attempt to pursue commercial work, experience on military 
projects can even be a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The military environment is very different," said Fred Rodriguez, director of 
employment at Hughes. "The military people are used to working with military 
specifications, and many of them don't have the expertise" for civilian 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Military specifications often require special materials and extremely exacting 
standards that are not generally employed in commercial projects. That 
explains, in part, why Hughes would be laying off electronics engineers from 
some divisions and hiring outsiders into others. 
</P>
<P>
The attempts by many defense companies to shift their focus to commercial 
markets will not do much to improve the employment picture, experts agree. 
McDonnell Douglas has been forced to lay off 8,000 people in Long Beach, 
despite a record backlog of commercial aircraft orders. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez points out that even though Hughes hopes to move to 60% dependence on 
defense from 80% during the next several years, much of that transition will be 
brought about by acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The model presented by firms that are already diversified is not terribly 
promising either. Rockwell International, which relies on military contracts 
for just 25% of its revenue, has had few layoffs among its Southern California 
work force of 34,000, but employment is not expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it appears that from an employment point of view, the defense industry 
in Southern California will increasingly resemble other industries. Those who 
get jobs will have top-notch technical skills, good interpersonal skills and an 
aggressive, well-thought-out approach to job hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days of massive employment for all types of workers. "Long term, 
we'll see more need for high-tech skills and far less need for basic skills," 
said Sal Monaco of DRI/McGraw-Hill. "I just don't see any prospect that it's 
going to take off again."

CAN HIGH TECH ABSORB LAYOFFS IN AEROSPACE?; 
</P>
<P>
MANY EMPLOYERS ARE HAPPILY TAPPING THE TALENT POOL. BUT IT MAY SIMPLY BE TOO 
LARGE.

Politicians and pundits have been expressing the hope that large numbers of the 
Southland's technically skilled aerospace employees will find a niche in high 
technology. While high-tech employers say they are happy to tap the technical 
talent of the region's laid-off defense workers, they admit that they cannot 
assume the entire burden of finding jobs for the rising numbers of displaced 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, although the Southland's high-tech employers are not making headlines 
with reports of big layoffs -- as are their counterparts in Silicon Valley -- 
they are beginning to see a slowdown after years of rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The joy ride is over in electronics in terms of double-digit growth year after 
year," said Richard Bruins, director of economics at Pacific Bell in San 
Francisco. "High tech can absorb some defense layoffs, some people will move 
out of the state, and some people will have to change their jobs altogether." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our industry could absorb all the defense layoffs," said Howard 
Derman, director of human resources for AST Research Inc., a computer 
manufacturer in Irvine with 1,100 employees in Orange County. "But there's no 
question that some engineers affected by the layoffs possess skills that would 
make us consider them seriously for positions." 
</P>
<P>
High-tech industries account for roughly 7% of all jobs in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, compared to about 30% in Santa Clara County, the heart of 
Silicon Valley, according to the state Employment Development Department. But 
unlike Silicon Valley, Southern California's high-tech sector depends less on 
chip manufacturing and more on military and aerospace applications. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout California, employment will decline in most sectors within high tech 
during 1990 and 1991, according to just-released projections by the UCLA 
Business Forecast for California. Southern California will mirror that trend. 
The statewide industry is not losing jobs as quickly as the aerospace/defense 
sector, but high-tech industries will lose 1% to 4% of their jobs during 1990 
and 1991, according to the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring that is occurring generally seems to involve at most a few hundred 
people at scattered companies. For example, Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena could absorb a small part of the layoffs with plans add up to 600 
engineers and aerospace designers to its staff of 7,000 by the end of 1991. But 
the hiring is contingent on congressional approval of two new NASA satellite 
probes. 
</P>
<P>
And Los Angeles-based Teradata Corp., a supplier of database software and 
systems, will add about 300 people in the next year to its staff of 1,500 
employees, 1,000 of whom are in the Los Angeles area. About 80% of the 
job-seekers interviewing with the company come from defense and aerospace 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
While revenue in the electronics manufacturing industry is rising, employment 
in that sector is falling, in part because of U.S. companies' increased 
reliance on offshore production. That trend is likely to accelerate as 
manufacturers push to meet the expected increased demand for high-tech 
equipment in Europe, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
But outside the mainstay high-tech industries, there are some bright spots. And 
some Southland companies are diversifying outside their traditional work in an 
effort to preserve business and save jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy at Pacific Scientific Corp., a Newport Beach-based maker of 
aerospace and industrial instruments, has been to apply the same technology to 
both military and commercial aircraft applications, said Chairman Edgar S. 
Brower. As a result, the company, which employs several hundred people in 
Southern California, has reduced its military sales to 25% from 30% of total 
sales and kept its employment around 1,800.

FRANCISCO SARAVIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to miss the turnoff for Francisco Saravia. Pick the wrong time to 
pass one of the trucks that creep along the two-lane highway, belching smoke at 
trailing motorists, and you will have passed the entrance. A small woods hides 
the village from the main road. 
</P>
<P>
But follow the right strip of pavement for a few curving miles and you might 
believe you have driven straight out of rural Mexico into a Los Angeles suburb. 
Instead of the whitewashed cubes with narrow slits of glass topped by 
corrugated metal -- typical housing in Mexican villages -- homes on the main 
street of Francisco Saravia have L-shaped designs, picture windows and tiles or 
shingles over sloping roofs. Many also have pickup trucks with California 
license plates in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Francisco Saravia and its neighboring villages around Lake Chapala 
in west-central Mexico are the source of a large part of the Southern 
California labor force. Villagers spend their youth picking fruit, washing 
dishes and sweeping factory floors in California, then come home to Mexico to 
build the houses they'll live in when their children take their turn north of 
the border. Here, emigration is a tradition developed over generations. 
</P>
<P>
As Mexico's economic crisis and the U.S. shortage of unskilled labor continue, 
new emigrants are joining this traditional flow: urbanites who can make in an 
hour at an American McDonald's what they'd earn in a day in Mexico City; 
Indians who barely speak Spanish; Central Americans, tired of life in southern 
Mexico's refugee camps and skeptical that they can ever go home. Together, they 
are making labor one of Mexico's most important exports. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day you run into people who are going (to the United States)," said Juan 
Manuel Sandoval Palacios, general coordinator of the Permanent Seminar on 
Chicano and Border Studies, a Mexico City-based group of scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Juan del Rio (a town northwest of Mexico City), I talked to 117 workers 
who planned to go in July -- and that is not a traditional migrant area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of paychecks in dollars has become irresistible for many Mexicans as 
jobs in their own country become scarcer and lower-paying. For the past eight 
years, Mexico has been trying to recover from a borrowing spree that left it 
the second-most indebted country in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
International bankers and officials of industrialized countries have praised 
Mexico's economic reforms -- reductions in government spending, deregulation 
and privatization. However, those reforms have worsened an already bleak 
employment situation. 
</P>
<P>
The government has cut the federal deficit in part by laying off bureaucrats. 
Another approach has been to eliminate subsidies by selling hundreds of 
unprofitable state-owned companies to private business. The new owners' first 
move toward profitability is nearly always to trim payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
Trade tariffs have also been reduced. Faced with increased competition from 
imports, factories have scaled back production as markets shrink. Or they have 
increased productivity, thereby cutting costs to meet international prices. 
Either way, they need fewer workers. 
</P>
<P>
Today's sacrifices eventually will result in a sound economy, more investment 
and, finally, jobs, said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. Meanwhile, the 
Mexican economy is nowhere close to generating enough jobs to employ the 1 
million new workers who enter the labor force each year. 
</P>
<P>
With job applicants lining up outside their gates, employers have little 
incentive to raise wages or increase worker benefits. The spending power of the 
minimum wage -- which about one-third of the labor force earns -- has been 
halved during the past eight years and now stands at about $4 a day. 
</P>
<P>
If options are limited for Mexicans, even fewer opportunities exist for Central 
American refugees. Working in clandestine factories near the Mexico City 
airport or tending 2-square-yard market stalls in southern Mexico refugee 
camps, many wait for word from relatives in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"What does he say? When can we come?" asked Eulalia Cristobal in halting 
Spanish, inquiring after her son, Diego, who was granted political asylum in 
Los Angeles last year. Diego's attorneys from El Rescate, a public interest law 
firm in Los Angeles, had hoped that the case in which he won asylum would 
establish right of asylum for all Quiche Indians from Guatemala, allowing him 
to send for his family. However, the ruling applies only to him. 
</P>
<P>
His mother is eager to leave the Maya Tecum refugee camp in the Mexican state 
of Campeche, the family's latest stop in the five years since their hometown in 
Huehuetenango province was burned by the army. "I am from the mountains, and it 
is so hot here," said Cristobal, a short, thin woman with braided gray hair who 
wears the subtlely striped, straight, ankle-length skirt that is traditional in 
northern Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
About the only work available for refugees in this impoverished area is heavy 
manual labor, not the kind of jobs for which aging women are hired. She tries 
to earn money selling needles, thread and plastic trinkets at an improvised 
market of stick huts in the center of the camp. Sales are slow, she said, 
because no one else has money either. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Cristobal Diego, is helping to build another camp that will have a 
water pump for every four houses -- an improvement over Maya Tecum, where women 
must line up once a day at a water truck. Because of his work, if they decide 
to stay in Mexico, they will be allowed to move to the new camp. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Guatemalans who eagerly ask about conditions in their home country, 
the family's first choice would be to move back. However, the same fear for 
their safety that drove them across the border causes them to hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing north is their best option. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Indians from the tropical south -- the poorest region of the country -- 
are also pushing north. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, the Mixtecs of the Pacific state of Oaxaca began working on 
the coffee plantations in Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico. Within a decade, they 
were also picking crops and peddling wares on the Baja California peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they form an important part of the California agricultural work force in 
northern San Diego County, Fresno, Santa Rosa and reach as far north as Salem, 
Ore., said Lilia Marcela Moreno, a Mexico City researcher who studies 
emigration. 
</P>
<P>
The Mixtecs, for centuries an isolated group that has kept its own language and 
customs, are remarkable because of the extent to which their emigration is a 
cooperative, community effort, she said. A community will pool resources to 
send one or two people to the United States. That has allowed the Mixtecs, 
among the poorest of Mexico's poor, to become migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Before, that option was available only to the middle class of rural Mexico, 
those who could raise $300 or more for bus fare to Tijuana and a coyote, or 
guide, for the perils of a covert border crossing. As workers from towns with a 
migrant tradition, such as Francisco Saravia, moved to better-paying jobs in 
factories and services including as gardening and restaurant work, the Mixtecs 
took their places in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Today, workers from traditional migrant towns usually have legal resident 
status in the United States or can easily obtain it through relatives who live 
there, Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
The newer emigrants are those most likely to be affected by laws that punish 
employers who knowingly hire people who are not legally permitted to work in 
the United States, she said. But even they are not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, you just get new flows (of workers) to places where the 
(Immigration and Naturalization Service) does not have much presence," said 
Francisco Javier Guerrero, another participant in the border studies seminars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to believe that emigration will stop," he said. "The flows will 
continue to increase."
