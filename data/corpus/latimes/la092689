The Soviet Union is expected to join Interpol by the end of next year, a senior 
official of the 147-nation international police coordinating body said in 
London. Secretary General Raymond Kendall said he expects Moscow to apply for 
membership in time for the group's 1990 annual assembly. There has been an 
upsurge of crime in the Soviet Union, Kendall said, and Moscow has become a 
transit point for international drug smugglers who use the Soviet airline 
Aeroflot because it is thought to be above suspicion. Hungary, Romania and 
Yugoslavia are the only East European members of Interpol.

The Federal Aviation Administration said it has tightened security standards 
since the December bombing over Scotland of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 
people, but a General Accounting Office investigation said the FAA does not 
know if airlines are meeting the standards. The GAO report was summarized by 
Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.) at a hearing of her House Government Operations 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation. Collins said security 
deficiencies found in recent FAA airline inspections showed breakdowns in the 
training of airline security personnel. Isaac Yeffet, former director general 
of security for El Al Israel Airlines, told the subcommittee that training 
given security agents for U.S. air carriers "is extremely low, insufficient and 
not effective."

An accused drug trafficker arrested in Colombia is wanted on U.S. charges of 
running an operation that shipped tons of the illegal drug methaqualone to the 
United States, the Justice Department said. The suspect, Carlos Humberto Gomez 
Zapata, is accused of directing a ring that shipped tons of the drug, also 
known as Quaaludes, from West Germany and Austria through Panama to Colombia, 
from where it was smuggled into the United States. Gomez was jailed over the 
weekend, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Washington is 
expected to seek his extradition to the United States for trial.

WATER SNUBBED TODAY MAY LOOK GOOD TOMORROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

Earle Hartling made his way along catwalks above the sewage, bathed in 
mid-morning sunshine. Underneath him, in concrete tanks, roiled the 
tawny-colored waste water from the sinks and the toilets of the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A musty odor here, a decided stench there. And the antiseptic smell of chlorine 
wafted in the gentle breeze across the nine-acre expanse of one of the state's 
largest sewage treatment plants, at San Jose Creek near the intersection of the 
San Gabriel and the Pomona freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Hartling, an engineer with the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, is 
an expert on the matter of transforming sewage into usable water. 
</P>
<P>
He peered down into a concrete opening where the finished product rushed away 
like a waterfall: Clear, clean water, almost -- but not quite -- good enough to 
drink, tumbled into a huge pipe. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to drink a gallon a day for 875 years before you'd contract the 
only virus we've ever found and it still wouldn't even make you sick," Hartling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swim, but Don't Drink 
</P>
<P>
Millions of gallons of this water, considered by health officials to be clean 
enough for swimming but not for drinking, rush through the pipe every day. 
Eventually it flows into the concrete banks of the San Gabriel River, which 
winds to the ocean at Long Beach. But millions more gallons are diverted into 
the ground to indirectly replenish the water supply for portions of Los Angeles 
County, a desert that water has made into a patchwork of manicured lawns, golf 
courses, orchards and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
To boost the water supply that serves 1 million people in the San Gabriel 
Valley, from Monterey Park east to San Dimas, water officials had proposed 
pumping water from the San Jose Creek plant upriver to Irwindale. There, 
through a system of tanks and pipes, the water would have been fed into the 
earth around Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
But a Los Angeles Superior Court judge last month said no to this idea. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Florence Pickard reached this conclusion after she toured the catwalks at 
San Jose Creek and then held a day-long hearing. She decided that, as long as 
water suppliers in the San Gabriel Valley can afford to buy imported water of a 
higher quality than that produced at San Jose, she would not be willing to give 
her approval for reclaimed waste water to be pumped into the Irwindale water 
table, 4 1/2 miles northeast of the San Jose plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Understand Her Caution' 
</P>
<P>
"We can't be particularly mad at her," said Ralph B. Helm, attorney for the 
Upper San Gabriel Water District. "We understand her caution. But we did think 
our plan was a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's approval was necessary due to complicated legal agreements reached 
in 1973 when rules were set forth saying court permission would be required to 
use reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
To pump the renovated water into San Gabriel Valley would not have been an 
extraordinary event in the region. For decades, waste water reclaimed by a 
sewage treatment plant in Pomona has irrigated fields, cemeteries, golf 
courses, schoolyard ball fields and hospital grounds. It has supplied factories 
with water they need to make their products, such as paper. In addition, Cal 
Poly Pomona uses the water for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive use around Pomona, Hartling said, dates as far back as 1904, when 
citrus growers processed sewage into water clean enough to use on crops. And 
just as the citrus growers of long ago found the partial answer to their water 
needs, Hartling and other water experts say, this recycled, reclaimed, repaired 
water may provide partial answers for the future water problems of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant Expansions 
</P>
<P>
Already, the city of Los Angeles is expanding its water reclamation plants. The 
Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County operate one of the state's largest 
water reclamation projects, as a by-product of its sewage treatment operations 
at 10 plants in the county. Two plants, including the largest at San Jose 
Creek, are near Whittier Narrows and the third in the San Gabriel Valley is in 
Pomona. Others are in Cerritos, Long Beach, Lancaster, Saugus, Palmdale, 
Valencia and La Canada-Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
But half of the water produced at these plants eventually goes unused, much of 
it flowing directly into the ocean. This water, Hartling said, could supply the 
annual needs of hundreds of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
"We all realize there is an upcoming water supply shortage in Southern 
California. And water from the (San Jose) plant is being wasted to the ocean," 
Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Economics partly contributes to the fact that the treated water isn't being 
used. But as the cost of imported water increases, economics may one day cause 
water companies to seek ways to acquire the water. 
</P>
<P>
In stating the case for reclaimed water, Hartling -- whose job is to sell 
people on using the water -- makes several points. Due to legal actions, he 
said, the amount of water coming from the Colorado River to Southern California 
will be cut in half in the 1990s. And he said population growth, along with 
water consumption, is occurring at a rapid rate. 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said "there would be a net savings eventually to users," if the 
reclaimed water was piped into the valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pipeline and Pump 
</P>
<P>
Initially, however, there would be the expense of building a pumping station to 
send the water from San Jose Creek to Irwindale via a pipeline, which also 
would have to be built. But, Berlien said, reclaimed water is about a third 
cheaper than water imported from Northern California and outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Reclaimed water would benefit everybody in the San Gabriel Valley," Berlien 
said. "It would be an additional source. There's a shortage of imported water. 
It's a dependable supply that's being wasted." 
</P>
<P>
But Helm said: "It's not that urgent to us. We've got this great big basin we 
can mine." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the water in the San Gabriel Valley is served by wells in a basin 
suffering from what state officials consider to be a victim of the worst case 
of ground-water pollution in California. 
</P>
<P>
The reclaimed water would have supplemented the water table, which feeds those 
wells. And through the process of percolating into the ground, the water 
eventually would have become pure enough to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials in the San Gabriel Valley say they are debating whether to ask 
the judge to reconsider her decision.

REPORT ON TUCSON POWER SPARKS INTEREST IN NEW MERGER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucson Electric Power, the utility that San Diego Gas &amp; Electric had hoped 
to merge with in 1988, has repeatedly ignored its customers while attempting to 
reward its managers and shareholders, a recent Arizona Corporation Commission 
report claims. 
</P>
<P>
TEP has shown an "emphasis on shareholder and management compensation and 
disregard for its customers," according to ACC Hearing Officer Jerry Rudibaugh. 
TEP has "a very unhealthy attitude for a regulated company," Rudibaugh 
concluded. The comments were part of a 70-page report that recommended against 
granting TEP a 31% electric rate increase. Rudibaugh recommended that TEP's 
rate increase be limited to 11.6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcomed by Observers 
</P>
<P>
The report was welcomed by some local observers who believe that San Diegans 
would be better served if SDG&amp;E abandoned a proposed merger with Southern 
California Edison and resurrected last year's aborted merger with TEP. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report hits hard at current and past management, it does not take 
issue with the fact that TEP is a relatively small utility with a short-term 
glut of generating capacity and a highly desired web of transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be concerned . . . if Tucson were to take over SDG&amp;E," said 
Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San 
Diego-based consumer group. "But if SDG&amp;E were to take over Tucson, they'd 
take over the resources and transmission lines that are available, not the 
management team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Even Better Bargain This Year' 
</P>
<P>
"If Tucson Electric Power was a good bargain last year, then it's an even 
better bargain this year," said Peter Navarro, a University of San Diego 
professor and chairman of Prevent Los Angelization Now, a San Diego-based 
consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger with TEP, which was announced in June, 1988, fell apart in 
November shortly after Rosemead-based Southern California Edison made a 
surprise bid for SDG&amp;E. TEP was unwilling to get involved in what was sure 
to be a long and costly effort to fend off Edison's bid. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening negotiations with TEP "is the single most important thing the City 
Council could be doing, outside of its regulatory hearings," Navarro said 
Monday. "It's very important that the council send an emissary to both the 
regulatory authorities and the company in question to explore that 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro believes that San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor should "get on the phone 
to (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom Page's equivalent at TEP" to determine if the 
utility wants to reopen merger talks. Council members could then "pass a 
non-binding resolution recommending that SDG&amp;E reopen discussions," Navarro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shames and Navarro want merger talks reopened, they have found little 
support at the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC has not included an 
SDG&amp;E/TEP merger in a list of scenarios that regulators will study along 
with the proposed merger between SDG&amp;E and Edison. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their review, commissioners have ordered the utilities to explain 
what would happen if the merger were not completed, and what would occur if 
SDG&amp;E were simply to buy power from Edison rather than merge. "We've been 
pushing for (a second look at the TEP merger) but the commission is reluctant," 
Shames said. "I think it's a viable scenario. In fact, it's more viable now 
than it ever was." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E spokesman Dave Smith declined to comment on the Arizona commission 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Rudibaugh's report is but one step in a complex rate-making procedure that the 
Arizona utility must complete before adding generating plants and other 
facilities to its rate base. Shareholders would be forced to make up the 
difference if regulators determine that a new facility would not benefit 
ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Select Decisions 
</P>
<P>
TEP has taken several actions that are counter to the interest of TEP 
customers, according to Rudibaugh, who has recommended that the commission trim 
TEP's $80-million rate increase to $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
His report hit hard at those select decisions. "We cannot and will not permit 
ratepayers to pay for unneeded power resulting from imprudent decision," 
Rudibaugh stated. 
</P>
<P>
Rudibaugh also has demanded that TEP shareholders absorb $850,000 in management 
bonuses because the company's "management compensation already exceeded the 
industry average." In a related development earlier this summer, Einar Greve, 
TEP's former chairman unexpectedly resigned just days after selling most of his 
TEP stock. 
</P>
<P>
Rudibaugh also took issue with TEP's plan to have customers absorb the 
$32.5-million purchase of a coal mine. Rudibaugh determined that the mine 
purchase was "imprudent. . . . It is not clear that it will ever be used to 
benefit ratepayers." 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona commission will review TEP's rate-increase request, its first since 
1983, later this year. TEP is expected to return to the commission soon with 
yet another hefty rate-increase request because more generating capacity soon 
will come on line.

NO RETRIAL FOR LUCAS ON 2 OTHER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Allen Lucas, sentenced to death last week after he was convicted of three 
throat-slashing murders and three other crimes, will not face a retrial on two 
additional murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel T. Williams told San Diego Superior Court Judge 
Herbert Exarhos at a hearing Monday that prosecutors wanted to dismiss the two 
counts "in the interests of justice." 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court jury -- which convicted Lucas on June 21 of three 
murders, one charge of attempted murder and two charges of kidnaping -- 
deadlocked 11-1 for conviction on the two other murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Those charges stemmed from the deaths of Rhonda Strang, 24, and Amber Fisher, 
3, both of Lakeside. Strang was baby-sitting the child when their throats were 
slashed Oct. 23, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
After confirming that Williams had discussed the decision to dismiss with the 
victims' families, Exarhos dismissed the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Fisher of Santee, Amber's aunt, was in court Monday. "I'm glad it's over 
with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, San Diego Superior Court Judge Laura Palmer Hammes sentenced 
Lucas to death for the three murders, saying there was nothing in his 
eight-month trial "to support sympathy or mercy for (Lucas) in light of the 
crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Hammes' sentence confirmed the jury's Aug. 2 recommendation that she sentence 
Lucas, 34, a carpet cleaner from Spring Valley, to death. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Lucas of first-degree murder in the May 4, 1979, killings of 
Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and her 3-year-old son, Colin, as well as in the Nov. 20, 
1984, killing of Anne Catherine Swanke, a University of San Diego student. 
Jacobs and her son were found in their Normal Heights home with their throats 
slashed. Swanke's throat was also slashed. Her body was found on a remote 
hillside in Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also convicted Lucas of the attempted murder of Jodie Santiago 
Robertson, 34, of Seattle. She survived a June 8, 1984, attack in which she was 
choked and her throat was slashed. Lucas also was convicted of kidnaping 
Robertson, who testified for the prosecution at the trial, and of kidnaping 
Swanke.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRIME LAW INITIATIVE SIGNATURES TURNED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of cartons overflowing with signed petitions supporting a ballot 
initiative that would toughen laws protecting victims of violent crime were 
presented to officials in Los Angeles County Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1 million signatures have been collected throughout the state, almost 
twice the number required to get the Criminal Justice Reform Initiative on the 
June, 1990, ballot, Kern County Dist. Atty. Edward Jagels said. 
</P>
<P>
At a presentation at the Los Angeles County registrar of voters' office, about 
50 boxes filled with petitions containing about 292,000 signatures were turned 
over as several members of victims' families cheered. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, sponsored by state Sen. Ed Royce (R-Orange County), includes a 
provision allowing victims to demand a speedy trial for defendants, increases 
penalties for murderers and makes jury selection a duty of the judge rather 
than attorneys.

QUEST FOR FUNDS FROM MOLESTER WINS COURT TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday that 
allows a 16-year-old San Diego girl to continue her quest to obtain funds from 
the monthly pension of a retired state worker convicted of molesting her. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael I. Greer issued the order, making permanent the freeze he 
initially ordered Sept. 5 on the pension paid to convicted molester Colby 
Flaherty, 67, by the state Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
Greer ordered a Nov. 9 hearing to set a trial date for the case, which appears 
to be the first pitting the right to restitution provided victims by the 
California Constitution against a state law that says public retirement 
benefits are exempt from collection by others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a step in the right direction," the San Diego attorney representing 
the girl, William A. Fogel, said after the hearing Monday. Fogel has said the 
girl will seek an order compelling the state to funnel the pension funds to 
her, to help her pay her therapy bills. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty, a retired Caltrans supervisor who lived in Loma Portal, was sentenced 
in December to 12 years in state prison for molesting the girl. He had pleaded 
guilty last October to oral copulation with a girl under 14 and to six counts 
of employing the girl to perform lewd acts that were photographed. 
</P>
<P>
At Flaherty's sentencing, Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez, in addition to 
imposing the maximum prison term, also ordered Flaherty to pay the girl $10,000 
restitution. That money was needed for the girl's medical and therapy bills, 
Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
The only significant asset with which Flaherty could make that restitution -- 
since he was sent to the medium-security prison in Ione -- was his state 
pension, Fogel said.

MARATHON MEETING HELD ON SEWAGE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of city, state and federal agencies met for five hours Monday 
evening but failed to reach a settlement in the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency's lawsuit against the city of San Diego over sewage treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, 23 from half a dozen agencies, huddled in Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor's office during the marathon session. A formal settlement conference 
before U.S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators also were discussing millions of dollars in proposed fines 
against the city for past sewage spills into San Diego waterways. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody left in a rather amicable mood," E. Miles Harvey, chairman 
of Metropolitan Sewage Task Force, said after Monday meeting. "I think several 
issues have been narrowed." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said the two sides moved closer on the key question of a timetable for 
upgrading the city's sewage treatment system to so-called secondary standards, 
as required by federal law. He said further discussions will be held today.

O'Connor, who opened the session at 4:30 p.m., had said she did not expect a 
settlement Monday night. She said that simply bringing all sides to the 
negotiating table Monday was a significant accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bob Filner, an opponent of the costly upgrading of treatment 
standards, criticized the mayor for failing to notify the council of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I just find it incredible that we have people in there, and we don't know 
anything about this," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
If a settlement is not reached, the city and the federal government are to 
square off in court Dec. 5 on the suit, which the EPA filed in July, 1988, 
contending that the city failed to comply with the federal Clean Water Act and 
repeatedly spilled raw sewage into San Diego waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Under the act, all U.S. cities were required to install "secondary" sewage 
treatment systems, which remove 85% to 90% of solids from sewage, by July 1, 
1988, a deadline the city could not meet. 
</P>
<P>
City planners and their hired consultants are designing a sewage treatment and 
water reclamation system that would cost an estimated $2.6 billion to $2.86 
billion, the largest public works project in city history. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Sewage Task Force, which advises the City 
Council, urged it for the first time to delay improving the sewage system at 
the city's Point Loma plant until 2015. That recommendation was based on 
testimony from scientists who believe that the current 190-million-gallon daily 
flow of effluent from the Point Loma plant is not harming the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current "advanced primary" system removes about 75% of solids from 
sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The city had abandoned plans for a secondary system in 1981, when it concluded 
-- mistakenly -- that the EPA would give it a permanent exemption from the 
standards. In 1986, the EPA tentatively denied the exemption and, in 1987, the 
city gave up fighting for one.

PROGRESS, BY MANY MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, just asking an emissary from Moscow about the Soviet Union's 
plans for the future of its Baltic republics would have provoked a chilly "none 
of your business." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze had such a conversation during their three days together last 
week. The foreign minister did not stalk out to protest U.S. meddling in 
internal Soviet affairs. Not only that, he ruled out the use of force as a 
means of pacifying the independence-minded citizens of Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia. Whether that reflects Soviet intentions is another question. But that 
they discussed the matter at all is nearly as impressive a sign of how much 
relations between the superpowers have changed as are the long list of 
agreements, at least in principle, on arms reductions that came of the foreign 
minister's visit. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the United Nations Monday, President Bush ticked off the 
results of a good week's work -- an agreement to hold a summit meeting next 
spring or summer, and progress in all attempts to cut nuclear forces, 
conventional forces and chemical weapons. But he, too, found the atmospherics 
as intriguing as the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of these achievements is important in its own right," he said, But they 
are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails" between the 
two countries. Bush also unwrapped a plan to "rid the earth of this scourge" of 
chemical warfare that would start with the United States cutting its poison gas 
stockpile by 80% if the Soviet Union cut its own chemical weapons to match the 
new American number. Shevardnadze said Moscow takes a "positive view" of the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also urged members of the U.N. to make the fight against terrorism an 
international effort. In another sign of change, as Bush spoke, teams of 
American and Soviet specialists opened a week of meetings at the RAND Corp. in 
Santa Monica to explore ways of joining forces against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
An important step forward came with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
decision not to insist on limits on America's Star Wars missile defense program 
as a condition of negotiating major cuts in intercontinental nuclear missiles 
in both countries, the so-called START talks. He advised Bush of the decision 
in a letter delivered by Shevardnadze last week, along with his promise to tear 
down a radar installation near Krasnoyarsk in mid-Siberia that violates the 
1972 treaty setting limits on missile defenses. The Soviets for a long time 
denied that the radar station was a violation. 
</P>
<P>
What made the Soviets so willing to cooperate? One factor may be that they had 
more to give up in the first place than the United States. But their attitude 
also has roots in the early months of Gorbachev's rule, when it became clear 
that the Soviet economy was a shambles. By then, it was also apparent that the 
edge in large-scale air and ground warfare in the future would go to the forces 
with the highest level of technology built into their weapons. Moscow could not 
hope to keep up with American advances in military technology if it diverted 
scarce resources to its civilian economy. It had little enough hope of keeping 
pace anyway, a point driven home by Monday's announcement of an 8% emergency 
cut in the military budget. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush noted in his U.N. address, "serious differences remain" between the two 
nations, but there is a welcome willingness to talk candidly about the 
differences, a vast improvement over the way things stood five years ago.

AMERICA'S MUSIC MASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Kern may have been carried away by an excess of enthusiasm when he paid 
his now-familiar tribute to Irving Berlin -- he "has no place in American 
music; he is American music" -- but the overstatement from one professional to 
another could at least be plausibly defended. For in the history of American 
popular music no composer ever succeeded so often, so accurately, so memorably 
in catching the moods of successive eras and expressing in such apt words and 
music what people felt and thought and wanted to say and hear. Berlin was a 
craftsman of prodigious talent and staggering output. His colleague Sammy Cahn 
once suggested that a songwriter could feel gratified if, after 50 years of 
work, he had produced a half-dozen immediately identifiable tunes. Berlin, he 
said, had written 60. The word "standard," referring to songs that remain 
favorites generation after generation, might well have been coined just to 
describe Berlin's works. 
</P>
<P>
Artists are rewarded for the pleasures they provide. They are cherished when 
what they have created endures and continues to delight. The comedian George 
Carlin once satirically described the ephemeral and forgettable nature of most 
contemporary pop music -- "Yesterday at the top of the charts, today a golden 
oldie!" Many of Berlin's 1,500 published songs were inevitably of transitory 
interest, but among them is a catalogue of classics whose astonishing freshness 
and appeal assures that they will never be thought of as relics of an earlier 
age. These are songs -- "Always," "Blue Skies," "Easter Parade," "White 
Christmas," "Let's Face the Music and Dance," among scores of others -- that 
are likely to be performed for as long as American music lasts. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin led a remarkably creative life, and lived an almost classic American 
success story. An immigrant whose family fled the pogroms of czarist Russia, 
with virtually no formal schooling and utterly without musical training, he won 
fame and riches simply through the overwhelming assertion of his prolific 
talent. Irving Berlin died the other day at the age of 101. For the better part 
of his life he was a musical legend. The legacy of that life provides a lasting 
gift to his country.

U.S. DRUG FIGHT IN SOUTH AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the so-called "drug war" heats up, I fear that our government will turn to 
increasingly barbaric and simplistic strategies, including increased 
incarceration of drug users, heavy-handed domestic police tactics, vilification 
of drug addicts, and state-sponsored preemptive military strikes against 
suspected drug suppliers. Sen. Joseph Lieberman's (D-Conn.) advocacy for 
allowing the President of the United States to order the murder of what he 
calls "narco-terrorists" (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 18) as a way to "signal the 
seriousness with which we view their acts" represents the first dangerous step 
down this misguided path. 
</P>
<P>
State-sanctioned terrorism, which is exactly what Lieberman is advocating, is a 
foreign policy employed by desperate nations which lack the sophistication, 
financial resources and commitment to democratic ideals required to formulate 
truly workable solutions to complex problems. Until our nation commits whatever 
resources are required to find nonviolent, non-punitive solutions to the 
underlying social problems of poverty, domestic violence, illiteracy, racism, 
mental illness, and hopelessness which plague large segments of American 
society, the drug problem will remain with us. 
</P>
<P>
Sending government hit men to foreign lands telegraphs a message to the world 
that others are responsible for the problems in American society which have 
created our current drug problem. Before we start throwing stones into other 
people's yards, we ought to find some enlightened ways to clean up our own 
internal mess. Creating a society where participation in America's opportunity 
system is perceived by all citizens as obtainable and more desirable than a 
life of drug-dealing and drug use should be this nation's priority.

SOVIET CIVIL WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Yeltsin Sees Discontent but No Soviet Coup," Part I, Sept. 11: 
</P>
<P>
Lately, I have been reading that, because of the general economic 
dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union, there is a possibility of a civil war. The 
recently visiting (Communist Party populist) Boris Yeltsin tackled this rumor 
by indicating that the war scare was simply a "scarecrow" created for the 
purpose of frightening the republics' citizens concerned about "growing" 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to conceive of a "civil" war in the Soviet Union. Unlike the 
United States, the individual republics are not analogous to our individual 
states. The only way one can have a civil war is within each individual 
republic. Westerners cannot seem to grasp that the term "Soviet Union" simply 
indicates the political manner in which these 15 republics, along with Russia, 
are held. The word "soviet" means council. According to the constitution, every 
republic is a separate entity with representatives to the supreme council. 
</P>
<P>
Has anyone else noticed that, every time the Russian-dominated empire loosens 
its grip on the rest of the republics, the first thing we notice is that 
nationalism raises its head? What does that tell us?

PILOTS ON THE LAM WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN SCHRAM, Martin Schram writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALPA is the Air Line Pilots Assn. Alpo is the respected purveyor of dog food. 
But it is understandable if you're starting to confuse the two, because just 
the other day, ALPA began feeding us a line that's hard to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
It began in New York City, where crime is common, and where there occurred a 
hit-and-run accident. It quickly became a violation of the public trust, a 
crime that affects us all in this nation of frequent flyers. 
</P>
<P>
This was a crash that killed two people and involved only one vehicle -- it was 
silver with big letters that say "USAir." After this Boeing 737 drove off the 
LaGuardia Airport runway and broke into pieces in the East River, its two 
drivers -- pilot and co-pilot -- disappeared from the scene of the accident. 
They vanished just after the co-pilot had reportedly mentioned to a Port 
Authority police officer that the pilot had been "mumbling" and "acting 
irrationally." 
</P>
<P>
For a day and a half, the pilot and co-pilot were unavailable to the 
investigators, unavailable to their USAir bosses and unavailable to relieve 
themselves in a jar so that the public could know if they had abused any 
substances prior to this apparently avoidable wreck. They were unavailable, it 
turns out, on the instructions of their union, ALPA, which represents the 
people in which we place our ultimate trust. 
</P>
<P>
Public trust . . . every time we climb aboard an airliner, we trust the company 
to provide equipment that's in top condition and personnel who are skilled and 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of USAir Flight 5050, the airline company gave its passengers a 
shocking mix -- a new pilot who had held that rank just 2 1/2 months, and a 
very inexperienced co-pilot who had made one practice takeoff on an 737 with a 
training pilot at his side, and who was being allowed to fly a Boeing 737 
loaded with passengers for the first time on this rainy night. 
</P>
<P>
What happened after their vehicle crashed is even more shocking. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration said it couldn't find the pilots: "For 
these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 hours after an 
accident that took two lives, and to do so with no explanation, is highly 
questionable," said FAA Administrator James B. Busey IV. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said it couldn't find the pilots: It 
was "inexcusable" for the pilots to avoid prompt urine tests that could be 
pharmacologically conclusive, and the delay "seriously impedes our 
investigation and unnecessarily creates an environment of suspicion," said the 
board's acting chairman, James L. Kolstad. 
</P>
<P>
USAir said it couldn't find the pilots: "We strenuously urged the ALPA 
representative to make (the pilot) . . . available," said USAir vice president 
Patricia Goldman, adding that the union had refused to disclose his 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
And ALPA said in a statement to reporters that the pilots had followed the 
union's advice in "post accident procedures with regard to their actions and 
whereabouts." ALPA added: "There was nothing unusual in the crew's performance 
. . . and the crew has cooperated completely with the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing unusual." "Cooperated completely." So it is that you sense the 
blurring distinction between ALPA's dogma and Alpo's dog meat. How dare they 
try to feed that stuff to a public hungering for assurances of safe travel. 
</P>
<P>
We've seen ALPA's members sacrifice to ensure our safety. Most recently, the 
pilots of Eastern Air Lines have sacrificed their years of seniority -- their 
careers -- to strike in the name of air safety against union-busting air 
conglomerator Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
For now -- this is hard to believe, but it's true -- pilots and co-pilots are 
not required to submit to a drug test even after a crash. 
</P>
<P>
Had the USAir crash happened this coming December, the pilots would have been 
required to undergo drug tests before employment, after crashes and at random 
(ALPA opposes random testing). But even though the Transportation Department 
announced its rule change a year ago, it wrapped its new rule in its old red 
tape. Hence the delay. 
</P>
<P>
This year there have already been more fatal commercial airline crashes (12 so 
far) than in any year in the last two decades. Deregulation has given us a 
bait-and-switch airline industry that advertises bargain rates but says they're 
all out of them when you call, and airlines that price-gouge unsuspecting 
little folks who must make last-minute trips. 
</P>
<P>
It all makes one wonder where the corner-cutting stops. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for government to get reinvolved in the airline industry -- and 
especially to take a new, hard look at an unrepentant union that seems 
unimpressed with the fact that it also represents our public trust.

HISTORIC CHANDLER HOUSE FALLS PREY TO TIME, DECAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the oldest houses in the San Fernando Valley is being demolished this 
week, taking with it a part of the area's history. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1912 by former Times publisher Harry Chandler for his brother, the 
two-story, Craftsman-style house at 13348 Chandler Blvd. in Van Nuys was 
stripped of copper wiring, bathroom fixtures and anything else of value and 
partially demolished over the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the house and a nearby barn are to fall to the wrecking ball 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been praying that someone would come in and save the house," said 
co-owner Joyce Robbins, whose family bought the property in 1920 for "somewhere 
between $8,000 and $12,000." 
</P>
<P>
She said she had tried for six years to interest preservationists and others in 
restoring the five-bedroom house for its historic value. She and her family 
could not afford to repair the structure themselves, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up in that house in the 1920s was like paradise," said Robbins, who 
lived there until she moved to New York in 1948. "I can remember lying on the 
ground looking up at the fruit trees and the sky. It was wonderful. I loved the 
Valley in those days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of a Ranch 
</P>
<P>
The house was part of a 10-acre ranch when the Robbins family bought the 
property. They grew fruit on the land until it was subdivided in the 1950s, 
Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining half-acre on which the house stands will be sold at auction in 
Los Angeles Probate Court on Oct. 19. Real estate agent Sol Taylor, who is 
handling the sale, said he expects the land to bring at least $600,000, which 
will be the opening price. 
</P>
<P>
Area history buffs agreed that it is a shame that the house must be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
"For an ordinary family house, it would be one of the oldest structures still 
left standing," said James Dodson, curator of the Valley College Museum in Van 
Nuys. "Only the adobes are older." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of History 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that's old is being torn down," said Mary Jane Petit, a member of a 
Valley pioneer family who has lived in the Van Nuys area since 1911. "It's a 
pity the house couldn't be saved. It's part of history." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said that when she was born in 1929, the house was one of three on 
Chandler between Fulton and Woodman avenues. Of those, only her old family home 
remains, she said. 
</P>
<P>
'My grandparents bought it as a wedding present for my parents," Robbins said. 
Her mother, Mildred Robbins, occupied the house until her death at age 88 in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother would mourn," Robbins said of the razing. "I feel terrible that this 
has to be done. We throw too much away in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderfully built house. During the Long Beach earthquake of 1933, 
not a brick fell from its chimney," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the house, at age 77, "had outlived its life expectancy." He said 
it "really wasn't restorable" because it had been damaged by dry rot, mildew 
and termites. 
</P>
<P>
A cedar tree he estimates to be about 100 years old will be left standing, 
Taylor said. He said he expects the property to be sold to someone who wants to 
build an estate or subdivide the land into two parcels.

FUNDS OKD FOR APARTMENTS AT ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large North Hollywood apartment complex aimed at attracting entertainment 
industry professionals moved a step closer to reality Monday when a Los Angeles 
City Council committee approved its financing. 
</P>
<P>
The 248-unit Lincoln Academy Village Apartments would be part of an ambitious 
25-acre complex of offices and retail stores in the heart of North Hollywood's 
redevelopment district. The cornerstone of the venture would be the 
headquarters of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Submitted 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan submitted to the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, 
the apartments -- planned for the corner of Magnolia Boulevard and Blakeslee 
Avenue -- would be completed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of the project are applying for $23 million in state bonds to build 
the apartments. They need approval of the full City Council before they can 
submit their application to the state. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement reached earlier this month with the Community Redevelopment Agency 
calls for 20% of the units -- 50 apartments -- to be reserved for very 
low-income tenants for at least 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Very low-income is a category of people who make less than 50% of the Los 
Angeles median income. The estimated monthly rent on those units would be $425 
for a two-bedroom apartment. Other apartments would rent for more than twice 
that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who heads the council committee, complained that 
the city should have required the developers to set aside more low-income units 
for a longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the partnership behind the project -- which includes Japanese and 
local investors -- pledged to reserve 50 apartments for twice as long -- 30 
years. But those units would have been rented to low-income tenants -- whose 
income is less than 80% of median -- instead of the very low-income category 
included in the more recent agreement. Rent was estimated at $570 a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Bonds 
</P>
<P>
CRA staff members explained that to obtain state-issue bonds for the project, 
the developers had to agree to accommodate the poorer tenants for the shorter 
period of time. Molina suggested that both requirements be imposed, leading to 
100 less-expensive apartments. But staff said the project would be financially 
infeasible. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise -- suggested by Councilman Richard Alatorre -- was an added 
stipulation that after 15 years the 50 very low-income units revert to 
low-income units for 15 more years, unless the developer can prove that meeting 
that requirement will cause him financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the project was to include an eight-screen theater operated by 
United Artists near the planned visitors' center and plaza. But in June, 1988, 
United Artists backed out of the project, causing the plaza to be scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln Academy Village Ltd. Partnership bought the 2.3-acre site for the 
apartments from the CRA for $3 million.

The father of a 13-year-old girl shot and killed a burglar as the intruder 
climbed through the girl's bedroom window early Monday, the Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Dimasi fired four shots from a .22-caliber rifle, killing the 
unidentified man and apparently wounding a second burglar who escaped, Sgt. Bob 
Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Dimasi, of Willow Bend Drive, off Willow Glen Road near the Singing Hills 
Country Club, was awakened by his teen-age daughter after she heard two people 
speaking outside her bedroom window and attempting to enter another room at 
1:15 a.m., Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed, Dimasi went to the bedroom while his wife called the Sheriff's 
Department. Dimasi fired when one of the men was entering the house through his 
daughter's window, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
The intruder, who was pronounced dead at Grossmont Hospital, was armed with a 
screwdriver. The second man was being sought Monday night, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Dimasi was not arrested, though the shooting is under investigation.

CRACKDOWN SOUGHT ON TICKET ROBBERIES; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE, AIRLINES NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP RASH OF THEFTS, TRAVEL AGENTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tearful widow of a Van Nuys travel agent killed during a robbery joined 
other travel agency operators Monday to voice complaints that police and the 
airlines are doing little to stop a rash of airline ticket robberies in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Burbank, about a dozen members of the American Society 
of Travel Agents called for coordinated police effort and more security at 
airline gates to stop the apparent ease with which stolen tickets are used on 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for the police and airline industry said later they are already 
making those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police have said that more than 20 armed robberies of travel 
agencies -- in which airline tickets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars 
were taken -- have occurred this year throughout the city. Several others have 
occurred in nearby areas outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves use a variety of sophisticated methods to fill out the tickets and 
sell them to travelers. Each ticket is worth an average of about $1,000, police 
said. No arrests have been made and investigators believe the crimes may be 
linked because of the gunmen have similar descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latinos Targeted 
</P>
<P>
The travel agents said Monday the robberies have primarily occurred at 
Latino-operated agencies. Most often, the robbers are described as Latinos. The 
agents said more than 60% of the stolen tickets are used on airlines with 
regular flights to Central America and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Vaca, whose 46-year-old husband was fatally shot Sept. 15 during a 
robbery at Excelsior Travel &amp; Tours in Van Nuys, said Alfredo Vaca resisted 
the demand of three robbers to open a safe where airline tickets were kept. She 
said her husband was aware of the recent robberies and wanted to make a stand 
against the thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband said they weren't going to get any more tickets," she said. "They 
didn't. But they did get his life. . . . Something has to be done to stop 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Susan T. Kaplan, president of the Southern California chapter of the travel 
agents organization, said airlines make little effort to determine whether 
tickets presented at boarding gates are stolen. Kaplan and other agents said 
they could possibly be held responsible for tickets that are stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The group also criticized police efforts. "Travel agents are the victims and we 
no longer can stand it," Kaplan said. "Airlines are not standing up for us. 
There is no police alert. There is nothing being done." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron Lewis said all travel agency robberies in Los 
Angeles are being handled by the same robbery squad downtown. He said that 
squad also is working with other agencies investigating robberies outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an ongoing exchange of information," Lewis said. "I don't think any 
kind of task force is needed as long as we have the telephone and open lines of 
communication. We have a coordinated effort." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he could not discuss the tactics being used by police to pursue the 
robbers. No suspects have been identified in the robberies or the murder, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airlines Concerned 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hayes, spokesman for the Air Transport Assn. in Washington, which 
represents the major airlines, said the rash of robberies in the Los Angeles 
area has not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been in touch with our member airlines and asked them to increase 
vigilence and take whatever steps they can take to stop stolen tickets from 
being used," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry meetings next month will include discussions of better methods of 
detecting stolen tickets, Hayes said. He also said that a travel agency is not 
usually held responsible for the value of stolen tickets once the airlines are 
made aware that the tickets were taken during a robbery.

An explosion and fire ripped through a 58-foot cabin cruiser on Harbor Island 
at 10:20 p.m. Sunday. The blast damaged two other nearby boats, a San Diego 
Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
No passengers were on board as flames engulfed the privately owned vessel, Big 
Mike, which was docked at the Cortez Marina, spokesman Larry Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters contained the fire in about 20 minutes. Damage to the boat was 
estimated at $1 million, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat arrived in port at 6:30 p.m. Sunday, and all passengers were off by 
7:30 p.m., Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
The vessels Heather and Challenger II sustained damage of $35,000 and $20,000, 
respectively, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion and fire aboard Big Mike apparently was caused by an electrical 
malfunction in the main cabin, Stewart said.

The 50 "community alert" sirens in the 10 miles around the San Onofre nuclear 
power plant will be tested between 10 a.m. and noon Wednesday, Southern 
California Edison officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The sirens -- situated in San Onofre State Park, Camp Pendleton, San Clemente, 
San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point -- will be sounded twice, for two to five 
minutes, utility officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulations require the sirens to warn of a nuclear emergency. The 
sirens are intended to advise people to turn on radios or television sets for 
instructions, utility officials said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHILDREN'S CENTER PROJECT DEADLINE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday signed legislation that sets a 1993 deadline 
for construction to begin on a proposed children's crisis center in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The center is being financed jointly by the county and a private, nonprofit 
group and will house about 85 abused, neglected or abandoned children. Last 
year, the state agreed to let the facility, called Casa Pacifica, be built on 
23 acres at Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The bill signed Monday stipulates that construction must be under way in four 
years or the land will revert to the state. Assemblyman Tom McClintock 
(R-Thousand Oaks), who carried the legislation, said the point is to make the 
land available to the state again if a private operator of the facility cannot 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Pacifica is intended to serve as an alternative to placing abused and 
neglected children in temporary foster homes or leaving them in police stations 
or other institutional settings while the county tries to find foster homes for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say as many as 70 abused or neglected children must be placed 
in foster homes each month. Casa Pacifica is expected to cost $6 million to $10 
million.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL SAYS 'KIDNAPPING' WAS VOLUNTARY, A JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old Chatsworth High School girl who last week claimed that five 
fellow students kidnaped her and tried to rape her told police Monday that she 
voluntarily accompanied the youths and considered the incident a "kid's 
practical joke," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
However, two of the youths were detained Monday on suspicion of battery without 
injury against the girl, who said the youths tried to kiss and touch her 
against her will, Los Angeles Police Lt. L.A. Durrer said. The youths were 
turned over to juvenile authorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl told police Friday that five gang members kidnaped her from the high 
school's parking lot and drove her to a house in the 10200 block of Nevada 
Avenue in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she fled her alleged assailants after they attempted to rape her 
and that she used a pay phone to call her boyfriend, who drove her to the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, the girl told police in the presence of her mother that she agreed 
to go to the house with the youths on the condition that they take her to her 
modeling class later, Durrer said. 
</P>
<P>
"After an in-depth investigation, it was determined that no kidnap occurred or 
could be substantiated," Durrer said.

T-Bill Interest Rates Rise: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities 
rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in three weeks. The Treasury 
Department sold $7.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate 
of 7.72%, up from 7.64% last week. Another $7.4 billion was sold in six-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.79%, up from 7.64% last week. The rates 
were the highest since Sept. 5 when three-month bills sold for 7.88% and 
six-month bills averaged 7.87%. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 7.98% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,804.90, and 8.22% for a six-month bill selling for $9,606.20.

The Paris Opera Ballet is limbering up for this year's season without artistic 
director and sometime dancer, Rudolf Nureyev, who has refused to return from 
the United States until a contract dispute is settled. A spokesman for the 
company said Monday the 51-year-old Russian-born dancer's five-year contract as 
the ballet's artistic director ended in August and attempts to sign him on for 
a further three years had been fruitless. The dispute centers on a demand by 
the French authorities that Nureyev spend at least six months a year working 
for the Paris ballet.Claudia Puig

Employees of the Greek state-run television corporation in Athens went on 
strike Monday to protest a proposed bill establishing private television. The 
strike, which was to last until 1 a.m. today, was the longest in a series of 
work stoppages that began Sept. 7 to protest the legislation breaking the state 
monopoly on television. The government rejected a series of employee demands at 
a meeting on Monday. Those demands included requiring private television 
stations to present Greek programs and also the formation of a special council 
overseeing state and private television and radio. Claudia Puig

Robin Williams, Jay Leno and Billy Crystal do jokes and celebrity impressions 
for Barbara Walters in her first all-comedian interview special, tonight (10-11 
P.M. ET) on ABC. But the emphasis is more on stay-at-home domesticity than 
stand-up routines. Williams introduces Walters to his wife and baby daughter, 
Zelda, and Leno and Crystal talk about their longtime marriages. "In general, I 
haven't liked doing comedians because you ask a question and you end up playing 
straight man," admits Walters, with whom Eddie Murphy was uncooperative in an 
early interview. "But these three were very nice, funny and revealing -- and 
maybe I'm able to sit and laugh more than I might have in the past." Claudia

Rolling Stone guitarist Ron Wood's artistic side will be on display in Los 
Angeles at the same time he's rocking out with the band in town. An exhibit of 
Wood's paintings, sketches, etchings, lithographs and carvings will begin at 
the Madison Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard on Oct. 18, the day the Stones 
begin a four-date stand at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum running Oct. 
18-22. Among the subjects of Wood's brush and pens are his fellow Stones and 
Chuck Berry. An invitation-only opening party will be held at the gallery the 
night before. Claudia Puig

SIX NEW WORKS PLAYED AT DOMINGUEZ HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An admirable amount of expertise and polish marked the performance of six new 
works presented Saturday night at the University Theater, Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. Members of the Almont Ensemble and others gave insightful readings of 
compositions that succeeded as provocative examples of various conservative 
idioms. 
</P>
<P>
A precise and carefully executed atonal style made North Carolina composer J. 
Mark Scearce's "Five Poems in a Letter" for chamber quintet a wonder of complex 
harmonies and melodic lines. Oboist Michael Ericson projected the prominent 
solo part with bravura. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Dvorak's "The Bones of the Greeks" supplied soprano Susan Judy and 
guitarist Stuart Fox an opportunity to display a fitting neo-Renaissance 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere of Marshall Bialosky's "Two Against One," for clarinet, 
viola and piano, proved ambitious and satisfyingly complex, exemplifying the 
composer's ability to work with an abstract idea. Nick Ariondo's "Matsuri 
(Festival)" for accordion and piano synchronized sweeping tonal melodies 
between the two keyboards, creating quirky if not comedic moments. 
</P>
<P>
A neo-classic Piano Suite by Barbara Bennett gave pianist Charlotte Zelka an 
opportunity to demonstrate her steady, comprehensive approach. Carlos 
Rodriguez's relatively familiar Five Movements for Solo Amplified/Processed 
Flute demonstrated an equally satisfying mix of technology and flute 
techniques. GREGG WAGER

'HOLY BATTLES' DETAILS FIGHT BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allowing the viewing public to come to terms with the Constitution is rare 
enough, but "The Supreme Court's Holy Battles" (tonight at 9 on Channel 28) 
goes further. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, it is a study of how the United States became the first nation to 
institute a separation between church and state, and how that institution has 
been attacked and defended ever since. But on a more subliminal level, host 
Roger Mudd -- sounding and looking better than ever -- helps us explore how the 
Constitution is a living document, and why it must remain so. 
</P>
<P>
Most hourlong programs of this sort give history the short end of the hour, 
driven by the fear that we will turn the channel. Mudd and producer-director 
Karen Thomas obviously feel differently. The groundwork of today's legal 
battles over school prayer and other church-state clashes begins with James 
Madison's and Thomas Jefferson's pre-Revolutionary War efforts to allow a 
measure of liberty to non-Anglican worshipers in the Virginia colony. What Mudd 
and historians Thomas Buckley and Martin Marty explain so well is the 
profoundly radical and simple nature of what became the Virginia Statute of 
Religious Freedom: A person's beliefs, or non-beliefs, are a personal matter. 
It was Madison who inserted the essence of this into the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd tosses in some curious, uncited "facts," as when he says that "90% of us 
believe in a Supreme Being." True or not, it does point out that the social, 
church-organized pressure to break down -- in Jefferson's famous phrase -- "the 
wall of separation" persists. In the past 50 years, the program reports, more 
than 90 religious cases have been heard before the Supreme Court, with half of 
those since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As the report cuts between the crackling intelligence of historian Leonard Levy 
-- who thinks it's unconstitutional for congressional chaplains to be on the 
payroll -- and the born-again teens of Renton, Wash. -- who see nothing wrong 
with having their services on public school property -- the viewer can only be 
amazed at the frightening ignorance of the Constitution rampant in the land. 
</P>
<P>
We can also understand how constitutional language is deliberately vague, 
patched together and debated over by human beings. Why it's so vague is best 
summed up by Marty, quoting the Jesuit priest John Courtney Murray: "A republic 
is people locked in civil argument. When the argument ends, the republic ends."

 ABC'S 'LIVING DOLLS': BAD ROLE MODEL FOR COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is living? 
</P>
<P>
Premiering at 8:30 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, ABC's "Living Dolls" is 
the last of the fall season's new comedies, and the least. If ever there was 
evidence of the creative cupboard being bare, this is it -- a "Who's the Boss?" 
spinoff that imitates "The Facts of Life." 
</P>
<P>
Why don't they ever clone the good ones? 
</P>
<P>
"Living Dolls" was created by Ross Brown (a former writer and supervising 
producer on "The Facts of Life") and will regularly air at 8:30 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Four teen models live in New York with their agent Trish Carlin (Michael 
Learned) and her teen son Rick (David Moscow). There's Emily the black one 
(Halle Berry) and Martha the naive one (Allison Elliott). There's also Caroline 
the vain and self-centered one (Deborah Tucker) and Charlie the street-tough 
one (Leah Remini), a la Blair and Jo of "The Facts of Life." 
</P>
<P>
The Jo replica -- tough exterior hides insecurities -- is the center of the 
first two episodes. In tonight's, Samantha Micelli (Alyssa Milano of "Who's the 
Boss?") stops in to do a story on the agency for her high school paper and 
finds her friend, Charlie, having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a 
model in training. Charlie walks out in disgust, but returns when she realizes 
she is loved. 
</P>
<P>
On the second episode, Charlie gets into trouble by throwing a birthday party 
for herself after her mother rejects her. But everything turns out all right 
when she realizes she is loved. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity is awesome. 
</P>
<P>
Learned looks like she made a wrong turn and got lost in "Living Dolls" by 
mistake. Remini manages to shine a little, making you wonder what she would do 
with material written by adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Living Dolls" is bad enough when it tries to be funny, even worse when it 
tries not to be funny. As for the latter, it doesn't have to try. HOWARD

L.A. CHAMBER WINDS APPEAR AT FOUNDERS HALL IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's better, after all, that musicians don't talk to the audience before 
they play. 
</P>
<P>
In introductory remarks for a program Sunday by the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra Winds at Founders Hall in Costa Mesa, oboist Allan Vogel got 
Janacek's age wrong (by a decade) at the time he wrote "Mladi" (Youth). 
</P>
<P>
Janacek was 70, which was miracle enough, not 80, as Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks before Mozart's Serenade in E-flat, bassoonist John Steinmetz 
thanked the audience for its frequent applause between movements of every 
preceding work -- despite its mood-shattering effect. The musicians, Steinmetz 
said glibly, were "happy to receive any applause at any time." Somehow, a few 
of the 148 members of the audience subsequently managed to resist the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Steinmetz also described the Orange County Performing Arts Center's Founders 
Hall as one of the Southland's best rooms for chamber music. Ironically, he 
said this before the piece that tested the bearable upper dynamic limits of the 
resonant room or, as likely, the capacity of the ensemble for well-judged light 
and shade. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's evergreen Serenade received a surprisingly cool interpretation. 
Clarinetist Gary Gray offered focused, pale, but characterless playing in the 
ethereal Adagio. His colleagues skirted over Mozart's endless inventiveness, 
charm and high spirits. They did not take the repeat in the first movement. 
</P>
<P>
Gounod's "Petite Symphonie" revealed the nine-member group's most attractive 
qualities: warmth, precision and sympathetic response to one another. Flutist 
David Shostac and oboist Vogel were models in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
It took two movements for the musicians to bring Janacek's abrupt, fragmentary 
style into focus. But then the sextet -- Shostac, Vogel, Gray, bass clarinetist 
Scott Anderson, bassoonist Kenneth Munday and horn player Steven Becknell -- 
found merriment and innocence in the Vivace; nostalgia, regret and, especially, 
impetuous optimism in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Debussy's "Syrinx" flute solo began life as a death-poem for the god Pan. 
Perhaps to evoke a mood of mystery and sadness, or as a tour de force for the 
flutist, the house lights were kept off during the piece. Shostac played the 2 
1/2-minute solo with steady, luminous tone, but took a rather lively tempo that 
compromised the origins of the piece.

Afghan rebels have closed a critical supply route between the capital of Kabul 
and the war-battered eastern city of Jalalabad, a guerrilla group said in 
Islamabad, Pakistan. About 1,000 fighters overran four government posts along 
the 75-mile road near Sarobi, 30 miles east of the capital, said Masoud 
Khalili, a spokesman for the powerful Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla faction. 
Earlier this year, Jalalabad was the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting in 
the rebels' 11-year war to topple successive Communist regimes. However, the 
rebels failed to capture the city.

Latin American leaders urged industrialized nations to share in the burdens of 
the fight against poverty, drugs and environmental threats, saying the problems 
have often been spawned by the richer nations. The presidents of Argentina, 
Brazil and Venezuela, in speeches before the U.N. General Assembly, put strong 
emphasis on the need for urgent action to lead debt-ridden Latin American 
economies back to growth. "It is alarming to see that there is still no vision 
or clear awareness in developed countries of what is really at stake," said 
President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela. "What is at stake is the destiny of 
mankind."

A bomb exploded in a hotel in the Colombian city of Cartagena, apparently 
killing two people and wounding a third, the police chief in the Caribbean 
resort said. Earlier, a bomb exploded at a Cartagena bank, injuring a 
passer-by, Col. Luis Herrera told reporters in Bogota by telephone. Herrera 
said the fatalities were believed to be doctors attending a convention at the 
Cartagena Hilton. There was no claim of responsibility, but authorities 
indicated the blasts likely were the work of drug traffickers who have declared 
war on the Colombian government.

Ex-convict Tyrone Robinson, 25, pleaded not guilty to charges that he shot and 
killed Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton on Aug. 22. Oakland 
Municipal Judge Horace Wheatley set Nov. 17 for a preliminary hearing to 
determine whether Robinson will be bound over to Alameda County Superior Court 
for trial. Alfons Wagner, Robinson's lawyer, told reporters that he was having 
difficulty getting information on Newton's violent past. Robinson told 
investigators that he exchanged gunfire with Newton in self-defense. Oakland 
police said they found the gun used to kill Newton, but no other weapons were 
found at the scene. Wagner said it was "not uncommon" for a weapon to disappear 
from a crime scene in Oakland.

A federal judge rejected a bid by four television networks that they be allowed 
to broadcast a House subcommittee hearing featuring Samuel R. Pierce Jr. 
Pierce, who was secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department for 
all eight years of the Ronald Reagan Administration, is scheduled to testify 
under subpoena today before a House Government Operations subcommittee that has 
been probing the HUD scandals since May. U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Hens 
Green of Washington rejected a temporary restraining order sought by ABC, CBS, 
CNN and NBC to prevent the House from enforcing a rule that allows a subpoenaed 
witness to request that there be no radio, television and still photography 
coverage of his testimony, one of Green's clerks said.

The premier edition of St. Louis' new morning newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, was 
snatched up around the city by curious readers. Sales were brisk around town, 
and many of the Sun's shiny red street corner boxes, dubbed "facts machines" by 
the Sun, were empty by mid-morning. The Sun, whose debut featured a color 
picture of a sun rising behind the Gateway Arch, is the first major newspaper 
to start from scratch in a big U.S. city since the Washington Times in 1982. 
The Sun published 200,000 copies of its premier edition. The colorful tabloid 
is competing with the 110-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The Post-Dispatch 
has been the city's only daily paper since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded 
in October, 1986.

Federal investigators went inside the wreckage of a USAir jet, looking for 
additional clues to the cause of last week's aborted takeoff and crash into the 
East River that killed two people. Local authorities announced a grand jury 
would investigate the crash of the Boeing 737-400 to see if any criminal 
charges are warranted. The aircraft was headed for Charlotte, N.C., when it 
slid off the runway. Queens Dist. Atty. John J. Santucci said he initially had 
no designated targets and would not seek specific charges. But sources in 
Santucci's office said the grand jury might be asked to consider charges 
including criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and leaving the 
scene of an accident.

Alarmed by the high cost of an anti-pneumonia drug that prolongs lives of AIDS 
patients, an AIDS group announced it will import the drug and sell it at a 
lower price. The People with AIDS Health Group said in New York that it will 
begin filling prescriptions for pentamidine in pharmacies in England, bringing 
the cost for a vial of pentamidine down from as much as $300 in some cities to 
$40. Since word of the group's plans became public, more than 200 people have 
inquired about the possibility of obtaining the drug, said Derek Hodel, the 
executive director of the PWA Health Group.

Pete Harnisch hadn't pitched in two weeks and pennant pressure was weighing on 
the 22-year-old rookie's shoulders as he made his return to the Baltimore 
Orioles' rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Harnisch allowed three hits in 6 1/3 innings Monday night as the Orioles 
defeated the Milwaukee Brewers, 5-3, to remain one game behind the Toronto Blue 
Jays in the American League East race with five games left. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to really relax," Harnisch said. "It was probably the biggest game 
I've pitched to date. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to keep the team close. I didn't expect to go nine. I didn't 
want to go go out there and blow it and get knocked out early and make 
(Manager) Frank (Robinson) have to use the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big win because now we're assured of at least a chance in Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
After two more games in Milwaukee, the Orioles visit Toronto for a three-game 
series against the Blue Jays. Toronto beat Detroit, 2-0, Monday night, 
eliminating the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got two more games here," Robinson said. "Don't give me that Toronto 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all big, they have been for some quite some time. This one is no 
bigger than the others or bigger than the one we will play (tonight). What it 
did was keep us on the same pace with Toronto and kept pressure on them, and 
that's what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Harnisch (5-9) won for the first time since Sept. 7, getting relief help from 
Mark Williamson, who retired the five batters he faced. Rookie Gregg Olson 
allowed one hit in the ninth for his 27th save. 
</P>
<P>
Harnisch, idled by the Orioles' use of a three-man rotation, allowed only one 
hit through the first six innings, a leadoff single in the first by Billy 
Spiers. Spiers stole second, took third on a grounder and scored on Paul 
Molitor's sacrifice fly for a 1-0 Milwaukee lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete pitched excellent and gave me much more than I could have expected," 
Harnisch said. "It was the key to the game." 
</P>
<P>
It stayed 1-0 until the Orioles tagged Milwaukee's Teddy Higuera (9-6) for 
three runs in the third and two in the fourth for a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Jefferson and Phil Bradley hit two-out doubles in the third to tie the 
score, and Tim Hulett singled home the go-ahead run. Cal Ripken doubled home 
Hulett. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Melvin hit a run-scoring double in the fourth and Jefferson added a 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Greg Brock hit a two-run homer in the seventh.

PIRATES STILL A PROBLEM FOR THE CARDINALS, 4-2

One of the big reasons why the St. Louis Cardinals may not win the National 
League East title was staring them in the face Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Cardinals, 4-2, for their 11th victory in 16 
games against St. Louis this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, however, remained four games behind the Cubs, who also lost. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give the Cubs credit," St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog said. 
"They've played well and they beat the Pirates, which is something we haven't 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds hit a two-run homer, and Benny Distefano and Mike LaValliere hit 
consecutive solo home runs for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-11 record against Pittsburgh is the Cardinals' worst against any team. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon (16-12) lost for the first time since Aug. 10. DeLeon had won five 
consecutive decisions. He allowed four earned runs, all on home runs, in five 
innings. He had allowed four earned runs in his last 37 2/3 innings entering 
Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"He got two outs in that (second) inning, and then he gets the fastball up," 
Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
Distefano and LaValliere homered over the right-field wall in the second. It 
was the second of the season for each, who have combined for 15 career home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds' homer in the fifth was his 19th and scored Jose Lind, who had singled to 
start the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Heaton (6-7) won his fifth consecutive decision and held the Cardinals to 
one run in five innings. He is 3-0 with a 1.33 ERA in five starts since 
rejoining the rotation on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have real good command tonight, but I pitched good enough to win," 
Heaton said. "The big thing was the bullpen did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis scored in the fifth when Vince Coleman walked, stole second and 
scored on Pedro Guerrero's single. It was Guerrero's 115th run batted in.

The Chicago Cubs, who never expected it to be easy, missed a chance to clinch a 
tie for the National League East championship Monday night when pinch-hitter 
Jim Dwyer singled with one out in the 10th inning to give the Montreal Expos a 
4-3 victory over the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place St. Louis Cardinals lost earlier Monday night, 4-2 at 
Pittsburgh, and remain four games behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs can clinch the division title outright tonight if they beat the Expos 
and the Cardinals lose to the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson hit two home runs for the Cubs, including a controversial 
inside-the-park homer in the seventh inning to give Chicago a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (11-9) came in to pitch the 10th inning for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Aldrete led off the 10th with a single. Rex Hudler pinch-ran and stole 
second, and Andres Galarraga was intentionally walked. After a sacrifice bunt 
by Marquis Grissom, Mitch Williams came on to face Dwyer, who lined a 1-and-2 
pitch to right field. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs had taken the lead in the seventh inning when Dawson hit a drive to 
left field. Center fielder Dave Martinez made a diving attempt to catch the 
ball at the warning track and appeared to make the play, but second base umpire 
Paul Runge ruled that Martinez trapped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez rolled on the ground, jumped to his feet and fell again in pain, 
having injured his collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
As Dawson circled the bases, Martinez still had the ball in his glove and 
center fielder Tim Raines finally removed it, too late for a play on Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule is cast in stone," Runge said. "The player must voluntarily remove 
the ball from his glove after the catch. 
</P>
<P>
"After he hit the ground and rolled around, I saw the ball roll out of his 
glove and Raines picked it up."

ON PAPER, ORIOLES JUST DON'T STACK UP TO STRONGER BLUE JAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evaluating the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays, two birds of a distinct 
and different baseball species, leads to this overwhelming conclusion on paper: 
There's absolutely and positively no comparison when it comes to measuring the 
talent available. It's a telling contrast. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. The Orioles come off as inferior to the Jays in a 
position-by-position analysis. So what are they doing carrying the battle for 
first place into the last week of the season, conceivably going down to the 
ninth inning of the final day? 
</P>
<P>
It's another reminder, yes, once again, that sports mirrors life itself and 
there's no guarantee the richly endowed will succeed. Why else would the 
multitalented Blue Jays, who should be on top by at least the length of a city 
block, still be trying to hold off the ever-pressing Orioles, who refuse to 
"spit the bit"? 
</P>
<P>
It's not a mirage nor a fantasy. The Orioles have gotten to where they are, the 
upper echelon of the American League's Eastern Division, because of one trait 
-- persistence. Their drive and desire, plus the early surprise aspect of 
shocking other clubs who deceived themselves into believing the Orioles were as 
bad as the shameful last-place record in 1988 indicated, worked in Baltimore's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Now to the lineups, the pros and cons ... 
</P>
<P>
First base -- Fred McGriff over Randy Milligan. More power and consistent 
hitting. There's some similarity on defense. Neither one, in the field, would 
make you forget Joe Kuhel or Mickey Vernon. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Second base -- The Blue Jays make use of Manny Lee and Nelson Liriano. The 
Orioles have employed a troika of Billy Ripken, Rene Gonzales and Tim Hulett. 
It's possible none of the three, an opinion manager Frank Robinson indeed has 
expressed, could make the Blue Jays' squad. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop -- Cal Ripken Jr. Does the job in the middle. There's not a play he 
can't make. Strong, accurate arm. Doesn't have the flamboyance of Tony 
Fernandez, who can carry Ripken's glove but not his bat. Pick: Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Third base -- The only thing Kelly Gruber does better than Craig Worthington, 
who keeps getting better, is run the bases. A close call. Pick: Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Left field -- George Bell over Phil Bradley by a wide margin. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Center field -- It's a standoff between Toronto's Lloyd Moseby and the pair of 
Mike Devereaux and Steve Finley. Toss a coin, if you want, but there's little 
difference. Pick: Even. 
</P>
<P>
Rightfield -- Veteran Mookie Wilson, acquired from the New York Mets, arrived 
at precisely the time when Junior Felix slumped. Joe Orsulak, vastly 
underrated, and Stanley Jefferson largely share the position for the Orioles. 
Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Catching -- Ernie Whitt and Pat Borders rate slightly ahead of Jamie Quirk and 
Bob Melvin. All four have better than adequate arms. The loss of Mickey 
Tettleton to knee surgery hurt Baltimore behind the plate, but his value as a 
designated hitter can't be minimized. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitchers -- John Stieb and Jimmy Key, plus Mike Flanagan, John Cerutti 
and Todd Stottlemeyer, vs. Jeff Ballard, Bob Milacki, Dave Johnson, Pete 
Harnisch and Dave Schmidt. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitchers -- Strength in the middle innings from Mark Williamson, who 
throws double-play balls, gives the Orioles a clear edge on David Wells and Jim 
Acker. As a closer, Gregg Olson is almost unhittable. The Blue Jays, though, 
offer an equally respected reliever in power pitcher Tom Henke, plus Duane Ward 
and Frank Wills, all with outstanding arms. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter -- Mickey Tettleton over anyone the Blue Jays send up. Pick: 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Home field advantage -- The last three games of the season will be played in 
the Blue Jays' park. Pick: Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Psychological advantage -- It's bothersome to the Blue Jays that they have a 
well-earned reputation for being "choke artists". Little was expected from the 
Orioles. Pick: Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
As to team qualities regarding defense, speed, hitting ability, pitching and 
power, give Baltimore the margin only on defense -- they wouldn't be where they 
are without it -- and Toronto the best of it in the other four categories. 
</P>
<P>
So, from the aspect of talent on the field, the Blue Jays should have long ago 
closed out the race, except the Orioles refuse to surrender. The Blue Jays act 
as if they want the title handed to them in gift wrapping. Despite their 
overall superiority, they usually find a way to lose, which continues to play 
on their psyches. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the race doesn't always go to the swiftest nor the fight to the 
strongest.

JAIL DOESN'T QUIET GADFLY WHO NETTLED CITY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past few years, 54-year-old William Hayes has appeared with other 
gadflies at Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency meetings to perform what 
they see as their "job" as public watchdogs over the big developers and 
redevelopment officials who are carving up and laying out the new downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sept. 15, Hayes was sentenced to 155 days in jail for disrupting an 
August meeting of the agency. At the meeting, Hayes so angered one 
redevelopment official by speaking beyond his three-minute time limit and 
throwing an audiotape onto a table that CRA Commissioner James Wood performed a 
citizen's arrest and had Hayes taken away by police. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time Wood had placed Hayes under arrest since late last year 
and it capped an escalating feud between the graying, reed-thin minority rights 
activist from Watts and the powerful city agency. 
</P>
<P>
Wood first arrested Hayes last year after the gadfly read aloud for more than 
an hour at a CRA meeting, complaining that the agency owed him $3,100 in 
relocation fees from 1985, when his apartment was razed for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a jury convicted Hayes on a misdemeanor charge of public disturbance. 
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Lois Anderson-Smaltz gave Hayes a suspended 
sentence and placed him on probation, but last week the judge ruled that Hayes 
had violated probation and ordered him to jail for breaking CRA rules at the 
August meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who denies that the agency owes Hayes relocation fees, said Hayes is so 
unruly "that I have no choice but to press this, because if I give in to his 
demands, his harassment will never end." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gloria Molina, who chairs the council's Community Redevelopment and 
Housing Committee, said that the events leading to Hayes' jailing "are 
unfortunate" and that she will investigate whether the court's sentence and 
Wood's actions were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unheard Of' 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she learned that during Hayes' probation hearing last week, when 
Smaltz asked whether he would stop badgering the CRA if released, Hayes 
replied, "No," so the judge jailed him. A spokesman for the judge said she 
would not comment because the case is on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called the arrest and sentence "unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
"When we have people who are arrested for shooting, for stabbing, for selling 
drugs . . . and who don't even get 30 days in jail, this sounds to me like a 
case for Amnesty International," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a release time of just before Christmas, Hayes sat in his prisoner 
fatigues at the Hall of Justice jail last week, wondering "what sort of city 
Los Angeles has become." 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to backlash and backfire," he said, "because most people are 
aghast at this kind of sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Articulate and well-read, William Tut Hayes is a familiar figure in Watts and 
founder of the People's United Freedom Forum, a weekly community gathering in 
South-Central Los Angeles at which current events are discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployed Hayes has picketed a CRA commissioner's home and has repeatedly 
accused the agency of "railroading" the Watts community into accepting an 
ambitious 1,900-acre redevelopment zone that will transform some black 
neighborhoods into commercial and industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Feud 
</P>
<P>
Although the feud between the CRA and Hayes dates back years, the animosity 
increased last winter after Wood first arrested the activist. Wood made his 
second citizen's arrest of Hayes for speaking out of turn at a May 17 CRA 
meeting, but a Van Nuys judge threw out those charges. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Hayes was arrested a third time by Wood after he disputed Wood's 
declaration from an earlier meeting that the United States had honorably dealt 
with Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
According to transcripts of that CRA meeting, Hayes either dropped or threw an 
audiotape onto a table near Commissioner Frank Kuwahara, heatedly urging 
Kuwahara to listen to it. The tape was of a protest by local Japanese over the 
U.S. government's continuing failure to pay reparations. 
</P>
<P>
Wood arrested Hayes for violating the CRA's three-minute speaking limit and 
accused him of assault for throwing the audiotape. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who acted as his own attorney throughout his case, managed a grin when 
asked what it all means. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Wood has never run up against a relocatee who was pushed out of his home 
by the CRA and who can fight like I can," Hayes said. "I'm Wood's Achilles' 
heel." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Littman, a spokesman for the CRA, said the agency has paid Hayes $13,392 
for relocation expenses and for replacement of camera equipment, a van and 
other belongings Hayes claimed were lost during his 1985 fight against the 
CRA's eminent domain procedures. Hayes was legally locked out of his apartment. 
The CRA stored his belongings for 21 months at a cost to the agency of $35,362, 
Littman said. The building is long gone. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA has offered binding arbitration to settle the dispute, but Littman said 
he feels that Hayes "prefers to battle with us instead of work with us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show of Force 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Sandy R. Kriegler, who threw out charges stemming from Hayes' 
second arrest in May, said CRA officials appeared "in force" at his Van Nuys 
courtroom the day he heard the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew nothing about the case, which had been transferred to me," Kriegler 
recalled, "but all these CRA board members are there, and I say to myself, 
'Gee, this must be really outrageous -- he must have really torn up the 
meeting.' Then I looked at the evidence and said, 'What the hell's the big deal 
here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts show that two other gadflies -- not Hayes -- hotly accused CRA 
officials of lying about a deal the agency is working out with Los Angeles 
County to build a massive new county complex in the Civic Center area. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was not exceptionally rowdy, but Wood, known for his frequent 
wrangling with critics, warned the hecklers that he "was not in the mood" for 
their interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes spoke up only once, according to the transcript, as Wood directed another 
speaker to use a microphone. "There's one on the table," Hayes said. Wood then 
arrested all three gadflies. 
</P>
<P>
One official familiar with that arrest said the city attorney's office 
reluctantly prosecuted Hayes at the CRA's insistence and was "relieved" when 
Kriegler ruled for the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Chris Lee, who prosecuted the case, could not be reached for 
comment. However, Wood said he has made it "very clear to my staff, and they 
have conveyed to the city attorney, that this entire case is very important to 
us. We disagree with (Kriegler's) ruling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pretty Strange' 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, a CRA critic, said that while he believes in public 
order, "the idea of arresting a citizen who may have some deep concern, unless 
he is really destroying property or something terrible, is pretty strange. When 
Mr. Wood is in a bad mood he ought to let somebody else run the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, a CRA defender, said the jailing may be 
justifiable because of Hayes' March conviction and past disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing for people to speak out when they feel something is wrong, but 
there is a process to do that," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, Hayes' five-month sentence is by far the longest in the 
memory of city or county officials who cope with gadflies and hecklers. 
</P>
<P>
Larry J. Monteilh, executive officer of the County Board of Supervisors, said 
the rowdiest audience members are simply ejected, "and I can't recall any 
arrests except one 16 years ago, when (a gadfly) spent a night in jail." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for City Council President John Ferraro said that in rare cases 
when unruliness persists, the sworn officer can physically escort people from 
the council chambers and even arrest them. In one such case, a nude "streaker" 
was arrested about a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Officer 
</P>
<P>
But CRA officials said theirs is one of the few -- if not the only -- 
controversial public bodies that has no law enforcement officer at meetings to 
keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said Police Chief Daryl F. Gates has repeatedly turned down CRA requests 
to send a police officer to the meetings, even though Wood said he is willing 
to pay for a police presence. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some good will come of this whole controversy if we can get a sworn 
officer that we've been asking for," Wood said. "It would solve the whole 
problem to have one present." 
</P>
<P>
But Hayes said he and the other watchdogs will remain at the CRA's heels. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's got to do it."

50 PUPILS, 4 TEACHERS INJURED BY FUMES; 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN 700 FLEE VAPORS FROM ILLEGALLY DUMPED GASOLINE 
</P>

Fifty students and four teachers at a San Fernando Valley elementary school 
were treated at hospitals for minor injuries Monday after they inhaled fumes 
from gasoline that was illegally dumped in a nearby sewer line, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando police and Los Angeles Fire Department emergency crews were called 
to O'Melveny Elementary School, in the 700 block of Woodworth Street, about 10 
a.m. after several students and teachers became ill from exposure to the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no serious injuries reported, the students and teachers 
were treated for nausea, dizziness, eye irritation and headaches at local 
hospitals, Los Angeles Fire Inspector Ed Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
730 Students Evacuated 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the student body, nearly 730 students, was evacuated to nearby San 
Fernando High School as a Fire Department hazardous materials team tried to 
find the source of the fumes, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of homes near the school were not evacuated, but were advised to stay 
inside and to keep their windows and doors closed. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they traced the source of the gasoline vapors to a sewer 
line that runs under the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody in the area apparently had some unwanted gasoline and poured it into 
the sewer system," Reed said. "We don't know where the gasoline was actually 
dumped. It could have been some distance from the school." 
</P>
<P>
The inspector said it was not determined how much gasoline was dumped, but that 
it was a "large amount." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the gasoline fumes apparently caused a "low-grade" explosion in the 
sewer line that runs under the school, creating "enough pressure to force fumes 
into toilets, water fountains and sinks at the school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Stomach Started Hurting' 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-grader Melissa Real said "when I came out for recess, my stomach started 
hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after she told her teacher that she was feeling ill the school was 
evacuated, the 9-year-old said as she sat inside an ambulance with several 
other children waiting to be taken to a nearby hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Another student, 11-year-old Amy Guerrero, said "my eyes kind of got watery and 
my head was hurting" from breathing the fumes. Amy, who did not have to be 
hospitalized, said she started feeling better after students were taken to the 
high school two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
There, the children were treated to a lunch of hot dogs, milk and Popsicles. 
Afterward, the students watched a movie as they waited for their parents to 
pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Reimann, a school district official, said he spoke to several parents as 
they arrived at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just thankful that the kids were OK," Reimann said. "They were 
really appreciative of the way everything was handled." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department Battalion Chief Jack Monroe, who was supervising the hazardous 
materials operation, said workers from San Fernando's Department of Sanitation 
flushed the sewer system with water from high pressure hoses late Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Continues 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando police said they were trying to determine who is responsible for 
dumping the gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be conducting a follow-up investigation," said Sgt. Bill Miron. "But 
at this particular time we have no leads."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CARE HOME ACCUSED IN SUIT OF NEGLIGENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood nursing home's negligence led to the rape of a semi-paralyzed 
patient who became pregnant, a lawyer argued Monday in San Fernando Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Elian Rose, of North Hollywood, is seeking $20 million to $30 million from the 
Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital on behalf of her granddaughter, a long-term 
patient who suffered massive brain damage in a 1969 car accident. The woman 
became pregnant in 1982, had an abortion and was sterilized to prevent further 
pregnancies. Authorities say it is not clear who assaulted the woman. No one 
has been charged criminally. 
</P>
<P>
During the opening argument of the civil trial, Alan Jule Schultz, representing 
Rose and her granddaughter, said that Laurelwood's insufficient security, 
negligent hiring practices, and indifference toward a sexually aggressive 
patient, one of several suspects in the case, led to the woman's rape -- 
perhaps repeatedly over a period of time -- and eventual impregnation. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the nursing home and its parent company, ARA Services, said 
they took reasonable security precautions and argued there was no way 
absolutely to have prevented the rape. 
</P>
<P>
Paralyzed on the left side of her body, the woman requires total nursing care, 
is unable to communicate and must be fed through a tube.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: APARTMENT PROJECT MOVES TOWARD OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large North Hollywood apartment complex aimed at attracting entertainment 
industry professionals moved a step closer to reality Monday when a Los Angeles 
City Council committee approved its financing. 
</P>
<P>
The 248-unit Lincoln Academy Village Apartments would be part of an ambitious 
25-acre complex of offices and retail stores in the heart of North Hollywood's 
redevelopment district. The cornerstone of the venture would be the 
headquarters of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan submitted to the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, 
the apartments -- planned for the corner of Magnolia Boulevard and Blakeslee 
Avenue -- would be completed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of the project are applying for $23 million in state bonds to build 
the apartments. They need approval of the full City Council before they can 
submit their application to the state. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement reached earlier this month with the Community Redevelopment Agency 
calls for reserving 50 of the apartments for very-low-income tenants for at 
least 15 years.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL UNMOVED BY PLEA FOR FOOT PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Community activists failed on Monday in a second attempt to revive support for 
the $2.5-million police foot patrol program vetoed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 38 years old and I feel highly threatened," Beverly Christianson, a 
Koreatown resident, said at a meeting of the City Council's Public Safety 
Committee. "I feel like a child myself that I have to sit here and plead with 
you. . . . I'm real. I'm not a robot. I don't take bullets." 
</P>
<P>
Christianson and two other residents of the Koreatown area who spoke at the 
meeting had hoped to persuade the committee to endorse a measure calling for an 
override of the mayor's veto. 
</P>
<P>
No formal vote was taken, but Councilman Richard Alatorre said he would 
recommend that the veto be upheld by the full council. No date for that vote 
has been set. 
</P>
<P>
In his veto, Bradley urged the council to support a $750,000 pilot program to 
be funded by surplus police salary funds. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who attended the meeting Monday, said the 
surplus salary account money has already been earmarked for other police 
expenses.

COUPLE BACK HOME WITH THEIR EMBRYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A smiling couple stepped off a commercial airplane at Los Angeles International 
Airport Monday night toting an unusual piece of carry-on luggage: a tan, 
two-foot-high tank containing a fertilized human egg. 
</P>
<P>
The egg, produced by the woman and fertilized with sperm from her husband by an 
infertility clinic in Norfolk, Va., had been the subject of a four-month, 
cross-country legal wrangle. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from American Airlines Flight 75 from Washington, Risa Adler York and 
her husband, Dr. Stephen York, looked pleasantly surprised at the size of the 
crowd of reporters and camera crews that were there trying to catch glimpses of 
the unusual container and pressing the couple for details of their efforts to 
win "custody" over the fertilized egg from the Howard and Georgeanna Jones 
Institute for Reproductive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couple Delighted 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted to be back home," Stephen York said, his arm around his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been quite an ordeal for us," he said. "But at last we have 
established that couples -- not their physicians or anyone else -- have the 
right to determine their own reproductive futures." In 1985, the Yorks, then 
residents of New Jersey, had gone to the Norfolk clinic, one of the oldest and 
most famous reproductive centers on the East Coast, to get help in conceiving a 
child through an in vitro fertilization program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the couple moved to Sherman Oaks, where York practices as an internist 
and his wife is a graduate student in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
After three unsuccessful attempts at implanting 11 eggs that had been 
fertilized in petri dishes, the Norfolk clinic froze a 12th embryo belonging to 
the Yorks. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorks, however, tired of their semiannual cross-country trips and decided 
to have the final embryo implanted by a physician in Los Angeles at the 
Hospital of the Good Samaritan, which the couple believe has a better success 
rate at impregnating women with frozen in vitro fertilized eggs than does the 
Virginia clinic. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the Virginia clinic, however, denied the Yorks' request to transfer 
the frozen embryo. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorks' lawyers argued that the couple had a right to what they considered 
was their "potential child." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Running Out 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they said, time was running out. Risa York was 39 years old in June, 
and the embryo was more than two years old. No embryo frozen for more than 38 
months has ever survived to mature into a delivered infant. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had initially filed suit not only to get custody of their embryo but 
also to claim $200,000 in damages for emotional stress against the clinic. Last 
week, the parties reached a voluntary settlement, in which the clinic was 
released from any liability and the couple dropped the $200,000 claim. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Yorks, they have now earned 60,000 frequent-flyer miles in 
their cross-country trips and spent more than $35,000 in medical fees alone. 
</P>
<P>
Describing their flight as "remarkably uneventful," the couple praised the 
airline for its cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"No one insisted on opening up the tank or on X-raying it," Stephen York said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Ticket 
</P>
<P>
"We bought a ticket for it," Risa York said. "We strapped it into the seat next 
to me really carefully. I put a pillow in front of it so it wouldn't jostle. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little precious cargo with us," she said beaming. 
</P>
<P>
The couple left the airport for the hospital, where the embryo will be stored 
until it can be implanted, which they hope will be sometime within the next two 
weeks.

LONG BEACH ORDERS MAN TO PAY $3,094 FOR CLEANUP OF SMALL PAINTING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the freshly painted trim outside his house is bright blue, Martin 
Luyben is seeing red these days over the city of Long Beach's reaction to a 
$100 home-maintenance project. 
</P>
<P>
Luyben has been ordered to pay $3,094 for the cost of a professional hazardous 
materials crew sent by the city to clean stains from the curb near his house, 
where paint-tainted water collected after Luyben's painter washed off his 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in here in their moon suits, like something out of 'Ghostbusters,' " 
said the 28-year-old Blackthorne Avenue resident. "They were wearing masks and 
gowns like they were getting ready for surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Luyben vows that he will not pay the bill, which he received from the city in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
It's not so much the money, he said (though there are things he'd rather do 
with the $3,000). It's the principle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiny Amount 
</P>
<P>
He said the tiny amount of water-based paint that washed into the street's 
gutter from the brush was nontoxic and barely visible. And besides, he said, 
city officials never bothered to ask him to clean it up before sending in the 
heavy artillery. 
</P>
<P>
But adamant City Hall leaders say they are prepared to use their legal muscle 
to collect the money. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they acted properly by quickly stopping the blue paint from 
trickling into the city's storm drain system, which empties into the city's 
waterfront. Because of the potential danger, they said, they did not have time 
to get Luyben to clean the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
The paint dispute began May 5 when Luyben said he paid a handyman $100 to touch 
up the wood trim with a half-full can of latex paint from his garage. 
</P>
<P>
When the paint ran out, the painter washed off his brush in the driveway with a 
garden hose. The bluish-colored water flowed out of the driveway and about 100 
yards down the street's gutter, Luyben said. 
</P>
<P>
Luyben said he returned home from his job at his family-run mortuary that 
evening and was firing up the back yard barbecue when professional toxic-waste 
removers called in by the city showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member cleanup crew never asked what the substance in the gutter was, 
Luyben said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, they said nothing to him at all, except to ask to borrow his 
garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
"All the neighbors came out to watch. They couldn't believe what was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, director of the Long Beach Department of Health and Human 
Services, said an anonymous caller notified authorities about the pale blue 
slick, which had spread 2 1/2 blocks by the time the call came in. She said 
city inspectors feared that toxic, oil-based paint had been dumped into 
Luyben's gutter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sensitive to the environment because we're a coastal city," Deputy City 
Manager John H. Williams said. "We want to protect the integrity of the water 
in the bay here." 
</P>
<P>
Luyben said he could not believe it when he got the city's detailed bill about 
a month after the paint job. It itemized every glove, the truck and the vacuum 
pump used by the city-contracted hazardous materials ("hazmat") team. According 
to Luyben, city officials told him not to worry about paying the bill when he 
telephoned them the next day to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the city manager and he started laughing hysterically. He said, 
'Don't lose any sleep on this -- we'll get it taken care of,' " Luyben said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Hankla could not be reached for comment. But other officials 
denied laughing at the incident. They said the city has no intention of paying 
for Luyben's cleanup out of municipal funds -- although they have asked the 
cleanup company to recalculate the bill and reduce it by about $500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Mistake Was His' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad about his predicament. But the mistake was his, not the city's," 
Mayor Ernie Kell said. "Either he pays or the rest of the citizens do. I can't 
see having the rest of the taxpayers pay for it. If he doesn't pay it . . . it 
will go to the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Bonta of the health department said state law requires inspectors to consider 
"any colored material in a gutter" as hazardous waste until it is 
satisfactorily identified. Luyben's vacuumed-up paint was not analyzed in a 
laboratory because of the city's desire to keep his cleanup bill down, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kell and Bonta said Luyben's expensive experience has caused Long Beach to 
re-evaluate its procedure for hiring private "hazmat" crews. Future cleanup 
contracts will be awarded through a different bidding process, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Back on Blackthorne Avenue, however, some still believe that the city was 
giving Luyben's paintbrush complaint the brushoff. 
</P>
<P>
Delivery truck driver Jim Obbema characterized the city's cleanup efforts as 
overkill. "It's sad the little guy always ends up paying," Obbema said.

Joe McNaull, a 6-10 center from Monte Vista, will commit to San Diego State to 
play basketball, Monte Vista Coach Zach Peck said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting SDSU, McNaull made one other recruiting trip, to Arizona State, 
before making his decision and canceling trips to Nevada Las Vegas, Utah and De 
Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"At San Diego State there was a chemistry," McNaull said. 
</P>
<P>
McNaull averaged 18 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots a game as a 
junior last season. Peck said he is a strong shooter and covers the floor well 
for a big man. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to get stronger to be able to deal with the wear and tear 
of college basketball," Peck said. "He's got a lot of growing to do." 
</P>
<P>
McNaull, 17, plans to contribute as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could play right away at SDSU," he said. "I just need to gain some 
weight and gain some confidence."

CHAIN CREW AT CHULA VISTA HOME GAMES IS MEASURING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are members of a Chula Vista chain gang. They're the four women who serve 
as the chain crew for Chula Vista High School's home football games. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the women, Pat Morgante and Mary Aubuchon, have been doing this for 13 
and 10 years, respectively. Three years ago, Morgante's daughter, Anna Marie, 
joined the crew and Anna Marie's friend, Patricia Morris, joined this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We belonged to the booster club and my husband, Tony, is a referee. He told me 
that if we were to get four people together, he'd show me what to do and I 
could be in charge of (the chains)," Pat Morgante said about how the original 
crew was formed. 
</P>
<P>
"Being football-minded, I already had some idea of what to do. And he said we 
could do this each week as a part of our contribution to the football program." 
</P>
<P>
The Morgantes' sons played on the football team so Pat didn't begin working the 
chains until after they graduated. After all, she wouldn't have been allowed to 
cheer from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Morgante said that having an all-female crew this year produced some "funny 
looks" from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of weeks ago, Anna Marie overheard a coach say, 'Well, it looks like 
(the players) have their mothers out there,' " Morgante said. "Anna Marie 
(who's 26) said, 'Do I look like I can be one of their moms?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pat said that over the years, she has never been harassed by a coach but she 
has received a complaint, as do most men who have worked on a chain crew. 
</P>
<P>
Aubuchon, whose sons graduated from Chula Vista, got started on the crew when 
the booster club was looking for help. Her husband, Bud, is Mar Vista's 
athletic director and former football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Our husbands are busy on Friday nights so we thought we should be too," 
Aubuchon said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat said that being on the chain crew has its rewards, such as recognition. 
Once, when Chula Vista made the playoffs, the chain crew got its names in 
lights on the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a really good rapport with the coaches," Morgante said. "They're 
almost the same as when our sons played. And we've gotten to know all the 
referees. We have a good reputation and the linesman knows when he walks out on 
our field that he will have a competent chain crew." 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive year, Army-Navy Academy will play host to the 
California School of the Deaf in Riverside Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The School for the Deaf has a person on the sidelines beating a giant drum to 
begin plays. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw this I forgot I was coaching," Army-Navy Coach Steve 
Simmons said. "They're trying to play what is considered a listening man's 
game. They're trying to mainstream the kids into society and they do this 
through athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Army-Navy, which has won the two previous games, always plays host to the game, 
which will be followed by a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's neat to see our kids interact with their kids," Simmons said. "This is 
what high school athletics is all about." 
</P>
<P>
After sweeping the high school tennis championships her first two years at Our 
Lady of Peace, two-time singles champion and San Diego Section player of the 
year, Angelica Gavaldon, is taking a year off from OLP to play in professional 
tournaments. Because of her extensive traveling, Gavaldon is completing her 
junior year through independent study. 
</P>
<P>
"I was traveling a lot and OLP is such a good academic school that it was hard 
to keep up my studies," Gavaldon said. "This way I can make more of a 
commitment to tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, 15, who became only the second player since 1979 to win two 
consecutive singles championships, is testing the professional circuit before 
turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing in pro tournaments to see how I do," Gavaldon said. "When I'm 
ready I'll turn pro. I want to be sure." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Gavaldon defeated Ros Fairbank in the first round of the $75,000 
Virginia Slims before losing to Gretchen Magers in the second round. Fairbank 
and Magers both had reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased," Gavaldon said. "I think I did pretty good this summer." 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon isn't sure yet if she will return to Our Lady of Peace for her senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma snapped Rancho Buena Vista's 16-game winning streak Friday night 
with a 42-35 victory. RBV ranked fourth on the all-time San Diego Section list 
for consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Point Loma outplayed us," RVB Coach Craig Bell said. "We just weren't as ready 
to play as they were." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista played catch-up the first half and tied Point Loma, 21-21, 
at halftime. The Longhorns jumped to 35-28 lead but Point Loma pulled ahead 
late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Danny White completed 14 for 20 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns for 
Point Loma. Brett Callan had eight receptions for 117 yards and a touchdown for 
the Pointers and Kevin Perreira had 14 carries for 91 yards and one touchdown.

CORONADO'S POSH LA MERIDIEN BEING SOLD TO TOKYO COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In yet another transaction involving the sale of a Southern California resort 
property to Japanese investors, the 300-room Le Meridien San Diego at Coronado 
luxury hotel is to be purchased by Chiyoda Finance, the hotel's seller said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The sale price was not disclosed. Derek Thomas, director of real estate 
consulting at Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in San Diego said, however, that the 
deal may be comparable to the $280,000 per room price that Japanese investors 
paid for the Dana Point Resort in July. At that price, Le Meridien would be 
worth about $84 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is Park at Coronado, a San Diego-based limited partnership whose 
general partners include George Codling, Alan Greenway, Malin Burnham and 
Thomas James. The partnership owns the hotel structure but leases its 16-acre 
bayfront site under a 50-year agreement with the San Diego Port District. 
</P>
<P>
Open since June, 1988, the hotel fronting San Diego Bay on Coronado Island is 
managed under a 20-year contract by the French-owned Le Meridien chain, Codling 
said. No changes in management are planned by the prospective owners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Le Meridien is the third major resort project in San Diego County to attract 
Japanese investors in recent years. Sport Shinko of Osaka bought the La Costa 
Resort Hotel in Carlsbad for $250 million in 1987. Earlier this year, TSA 
International, a Honolulu-based firm controlled by a Japanese businessman, 
acquired a major ownership stake in the $100-million Four Seasons Aviara resort 
soon to start construction in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the 350-room Dana Point Resort in Orange County was sold to Tokyo 
Masuiwaya California Corp., the investment arm of Japan's leading kimono 
manufacturer, for a reported $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are starting to realize that the trophy and primary properties in 
Los Angeles have already been bought out," said Kenneth Leventhal's Thomas. 
"The word we get is (Japanese investors) are focusing on prime properties 
outside of Los Angeles up and down the coast. So, in San Diego we can expect 
several more acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
The stock in Chiyoda Finance is held by six private Japanese corporations and 
six publicly owned corporations, including Nippon Credit Bank, Nippon Steel, 
Daiwa Bank and Ohbayashi Construction, Codling said. 
</P>
<P>
Chiyoda also recently acquired the 478-room Marriott Hotel in Torrance and a 
30,000-square-foot office building in Palo Alto. Escrow for the Le Meridien 
sale is scheduled to close by late next month and is subject to approval by the 
port district at a meeting scheduled for Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Le Meridien hotel property includes three pools, six tennis courts, meeting 
space and two restaurants, Marius and L'Escale. Most of the rooms go for $145 
to $205 a night, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Codling said the hotel owners did not intend to sell the property until it set 
out recently to secure permanent financing to replace a $44-million 
construction loan. In the course of pursuing the longer-term loan, the owners 
came into contact with the Japanese group that was "persistent" in its desire 
to acquire the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs became a price that we felt was an economically viable proposal for us 
to consider," Codling said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenway at first secured rights to develop the choice Coronado hotel site in 
the early 1980s by winning a design competition conducted by the port district. 
He later joined forces with Burnham, Codling and James in order to finance and 
develop the site. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is chairman of First National Bank of San Diego. Burnham, Codling and 
James are partners in ADI Properties, a San Diego real estate development firm 
that has built more than 1.75 million square feet of industrial and office 
space since its founding in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Although ADI has no hotel projects on the drawing board, Codling said the firm 
plans a 400-acre business park in Poway south of Poway Road and 3 miles east of 
Interstate 15.

VENTILATOR FIRM BETS ON AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The aging of the U.S. population and the corresponding increase in lung cancer 
and other respiratory ailments have helped create a respiratory health care 
market worth $2 billion a year. Infrasonics, the Sorrento Valley-based 
manufacturer of hospital ventilators, is responding with a newly expanded 
product line. 
</P>
<P>
Ventilators are devices for patients who have limited ability to breathe on 
their own. Connected to a user by plastic tubes, they pump and deliver oxygen 
into the lung passageways. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Infrasonics had only one product, the Infant Star, an $8,000 
ventilator designed for babies born prematurely. Since its introduction in 
June, 1985, more than 2,000 units have been sold to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 months, the company has invested $2 million to develop four 
new respiratory products, including the Adult Star ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Market Expected to Double 
</P>
<P>
As the average age of Americans has risen, Infrasonics has turned its attention 
to the adult market, anticipating the increase in demand for respiratory care 
equipment, according to James Hitchin, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from lung cancer patients, as many as a third of all U.S. adults over age 
45 suffer from some form of chronic lung disorder, according to industry 
officials. The annual respiratory health care market is expected to double to 
$4 billion by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"The senior population is rising, air quality seems to get continually worse, 
there's still a lot of people who smoke," said Larry Selwitz, director of 
research at Newport Beach-based Cruttenden &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant advantage of the Adult Star, which sells for $15,250, is 
that it is computerized and provides information in digital display, allowing 
physicians to obtain more accurate information quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Little had been done in terms of technological advances," said John Boettiger, 
first vice president of Rotan-Mosle, a Houston-based brokerage firm. "Until 
Infrasonics introduced its products, most hospitals were using ventilators that 
you had to turn knobs or look at needles to evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended June 30, Infrasonics posted $5.4 million in revenue, 
up 29% from 1988 revenue of $4.2 million. However, the company posted a loss 
this year of $154,000, or 1 cent a share, an improvement from the loss of 
$788,000, or 6 cents a share, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company is now targeting the adult market, Hitchin says 
Infrasonics has no intention of abandoning its original niche. Indeed, 
according to industry analysts, the infant respiratory care market is growing 
as well. The fact that women are bearing children later in life increases the 
chances of premature babies needing respiratory aid, Boettiger said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 500,000 premature infants born each year, and respiratory failure is 
the leading cause for their deaths," he said, and increased drug and alcohol 
abuse are producing more infants born "at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of Infrasonics' HFV Infant Star ventilator may help counter 
such mortality rates, Hitchin said, adding that the company expects to receive 
FDA approval for that device any day now. The $14,500 ventilator delivers 
oxygen to an infant at a higher frequency than existing models, resulting in 
better oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of completely inflating and deflating lungs, which causes great 
strain, especially for an infant's fragile lung tissue, the HFV delivers oxygen 
in small puffs -- always providing oxygen for the lungs, but never blowing them 
out," Boettiger said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Adult Star, Infrasonics has introduced the Star Calc, a 
$40,000 pulmonary function tester that helps physicians diagnose lung disease 
and analyze breathing patterns. Since its introduction in late 1988, the 
company has sold about 20 units. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Infrasonics also received FDA approval for its $3,500 Star Sync, a 
device that allows a ventilator to be responsive to an infant's breathing 
needs. Existing models allow doctors only to estimate an infant's breathing 
rate and then select a fixed machine rate. The Star Sync automatically adjusts 
its operating rate to the infant's constant and naturally changing breathing 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sole Manufacturer 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Infrasonics is the sole manufacturer of such advanced ventilators, 
but industry officials say competing products could be introduced within the 
next two years. Such competition could come from a handful of larger companies, 
including Siemens, a giant West German conglomerate that manufactures medical 
equipment, and Puritan-Bennett, an Overland Park, Kan.-based manufacturer of 
specialized equipment for the safety and health care industries. 
</P>
<P>
Hitchin founded Infrasonics in 1982 and took the company public two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent hours in the library researching several industries" to enter, said 
Hitchin, who earned a physics degree from San Diego State University and worked 
at Cubic Corp., a local high-technology firm, before launching Infrasonics. 
"This one kept coming back and coming back to me. It's a large market that's 
getting bigger, and one in which new technology was not being introduced." 
</P>
<P>
Infrasonics plans to capture an even larger section of that growing market by 
introducing ventilators suitable for use at a patient's home. "As more and more 
of the elderly are treated at home, it's a market we'll definitely address," 
Hitchin said. 
</P>
<P>
Infrasonics employs 74 people. Its Sorrento Valley corporate headquarters and 
manufacturing plant occupy a 26,000 square feet.

SPEAR FINANCIAL CHASING SUCCESS IN SMALL PARCELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles M. Spear was recently at a party when a woman approached him and asked 
if he was the man who runs Spear Financial Services in Glendale, a small 
discount stock brokerage that also sells annuities and other insurance 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Spear, chairman of the company, confirmed that he was. Then the woman told him 
that her husband had invested his life savings in Spear Financial's stock at $6 
a share. Today, the stock sells for $3. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she thought it might be good for me to look her in the eye," Spear 
recalled. "I haven't done very much for them." 
</P>
<P>
It's not wise investment strategy to put your life savings into any one stock, 
and Spear surely would like to see Spear Financial's stock go higher -- he owns 
about 8% of the shares himself. But Spear, a stocky, 46-year-old Cleveland 
native, makes no apologies for his company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
After starting the firm in 1983, he built Spear Financial's revenues to $14.1 
million by 1987, when the company earned $1.7 million. But in the aftermath of 
the 1987 stock market crash, when small investors were scared away, Spear's 
sales were knocked down to $11.5 million in 1988, producing a $1.1-million 
loss. Now the company is again profitable and Spear predicts that its sales 
will climb to $20 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25,000 Active Accounts 
</P>
<P>
Still, few would confuse the bearded Spear with that other Charles of discount 
brokerage, Charles Schwab, whose Charles Schwab Corp. is the nation's biggest 
discount broker. Schwab maintains 1.2 million active accounts versus 25,000 at 
Spear, has 2,200 employees to Spear's 200 and revenue in 1988 that totaled $392 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab also spent nearly $12 million on advertising last year to draw more 
clients; Spear spent about $500,000. But Spear isn't convinced that advertising 
is as cost-effective in getting new customers as simply buying other brokerages 
with established customers. To keep growing, Spear has gone shopping, buying 
even tinier discount firms in California -- such as Chris Harris Securities, 
First Los Angeles Discount Securities and Kall &amp; Co. -- often at prices of 
less than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Spear's brokerage services stand out? "I don't have anything 
special," he said. Spear Financial tries to offer strong service, he said, but 
then all companies try to do that. His minimum commission on a stock trade is 
$38, just under Schwab's $39. But Quick &amp; Reilly, another discounter, has a 
$35 minimum, and Kennedy, Cabot &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills charges just $20 on 
some trades. 
</P>
<P>
But Spear does not see brokerage services as his key to success. Selling 
insurance-related investments and other financial products, such as mutual 
funds, through banks and savings and loans is where Spear sees his future 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Some banks and S &amp; Ls can sell annuities and other insurance products 
directly, but often they simply refer customers, in exchange for a fee, to 
another firm that specializes in such products. Spear owns just such a firm, 
James Mitchell &amp; Co., which he purchased a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assumed, Paid Debt 
</P>
<P>
In the Mitchell deal, Spear assumed or paid off $2.2 million of Mitchell's 
debt, and will pay Mitchell himself a yet-to-be decided amount of Spear stock 
based on Mitchell's performance. (Spear said Mitchell likely will end up owning 
a bigger stake in the company than he does.) 
</P>
<P>
The annuities that Mitchell sells are issued by an insurance company, which 
then pays a fee to Mitchell. Mitchell in turn splits its fee with the bank or S 
&amp; L. Mitchell and the financial institution can each earn a few hundred 
dollars for each transaction, depending on the size of the annuity or other 
investment sold. 
</P>
<P>
Annuities are contracts in which a person makes an up-front lump payment with a 
guarantee of receiving payments in the future, usually at retirement. Yields 
earned by the annuity in the meantime are typically tax-deferred. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance business provides higher profit margins (about 15 cents per sales 
dollar before taxes) than a discount brokerage and has stronger growth 
prospects, Spear said. For example, last year, Mitchell had pretax earnings of 
$333,000 while Spear's brokerage business had a pretax loss of $1.85 million. 
And in the first six months of this year, Mitchell accounted for $5.6 million, 
or 55%, of Spear Financial's $10.1 million in total revenue, which yielded a 
modest overall net profit of $43,569 for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Spear figures that the discount brokerage business will usually show a profit, 
but the Mitchell insurance business "will outpace the growth of anything else 
I've got around here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Praised 
</P>
<P>
Spear director Donald Weeden, who led the fight for deregulating brokerage 
commissions in the mid-1970s, praised Spear's move into insurance because it is 
tied to banks and S &amp; Ls. Those institutions are likely to be more 
deregulated in the coming decade, which will prompt them to look for new 
investment products to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more banks will want to get into that business and will find Jim 
Mitchell is probably as good as any vehicle," Weeden said. 
</P>
<P>
Spear also is in the specialist business on the Pacific Stock Exchange. Three 
years ago, he bought four specialist seats. A specialist is the person who 
actually handles trades and keeps an orderly market in certain stocks on the 
floor of an exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Spear's approach does have its critics. J. Anthony Forstmann, a former Spear 
Financial director and general partner of the money-management firm 
Forstmann-Leff Associates in New York, complained last year that Spear could 
probably make more money as an investment banking firm, which services big 
institutional customers. And because Forstmann held nearly 16% of Spear 
Financial's stock, his unhappiness worried Spear. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann did not return telephone calls requesting comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendly Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann finally bailed out by asking Spear to sell his stock. Spear last 
month found a friendly buyer in Keystone Provident Life Insurance, a provider 
of many of Mitchell's products, which paid the then-market price of $2.375 a 
share, or $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Spear's foray into insurance was in keeping with his reputation for trying 
different tactics within financial services -- even though they don't always 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Spear formed his company to offer brokerage services only to investors with 
personal computers, enabling them to trade electronically, and was one of the 
first to do so. The business grew very slowly -- prompting Spear to become a 
traditional discount broker for investors with or without computers -- but now 
Schwab, Fidelity Investments and other big investment firms offer the same 
computer service. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Spear also introduced a service enabling individual investors to trade 
certain stocks 24 hours a day. Such off-exchange "third-market" trading is 
mainly reserved for large institutional investors. But the New York Stock 
Exchange soon forced Spear to abandon his service, and Spear acknowledged that 
it drew few customers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very innovative firm," said Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president of 
Charles Schwab Corp., although Spear "doesn't affect what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Spear earned a business degree from Ohio University and a law degree from Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1968. He went to work for First 
National Bank of Chicago, ostensibly as a lawyer, but eventually became its 
head trader of stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bolster Performance 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, two partners of Trust Co. of the West brought Spear to Los Angeles to 
bolster its investment performance, then Spear decided to open his own firm two 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
He started by merging his firm with an obscure, publicly held shell company 
whose stock was worthless. Then he sold stock to investors for $2 a share, or 
$3 million. The stock quickly jumped as high as $8.75 a share, even though 
Spear wouldn't earn his first profit until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
With his stock again in the $2 range, the question is whether Spear's firm will 
become a takeover target. Just as Spear grew by acquisition, firms such as 
Schwab have lately added customers by purchasing smaller brokerages. Quick 
&amp; Reilly, for instance, recently agreed to buy OvestMarine from Marine 
Midland Banks. 
</P>
<P>
But Spear said his firm is not for sale and claimed that his two biggest 
stockholders -- Keystone Provident and Sanyo Securities of Japan, which 
together own about 35% of the stock -- would support him in battling an 
unwelcome bid. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, they would have a responsibility to consider an attractive offer 
regardless of their fondness for Spear. But Spear said that "if somebody tried 
it, I'd fight like crazy."

VALLEY EARNINGS: DIODES INC. EARNINGS DIP 83% IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diodes Inc., a Chatsworth-based electronic components company, said its fiscal 
first-quarter profit tumbled 83% from a year earlier on a 14% decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended July 31, Diodes' net income fell to $17,990 from 
$106,481 a year earlier. Its sales dropped to $3.20 million from $3.70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Diodes attributed the lower results to strong competition, a "marked decline" 
in demand for rectifiers and other electronic components, and the recent 
weakness in the U.S. dollar against Asian currencies, which has increased the 
cost of making Diodes' products overseas.

FOR DISABLED SPECIALIST, SOUND IS NO BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It happened in a flash as James LeBrecht was leading the way to the booth where 
he designed the sound for "Measure for Measure" at the Old Globe Theatre. He 
halted his wheelchair before a small flight of steps, jumped out, crawled up, 
dragged the wheelchair up behind him and was back in his wheelchair -- all 
without breaking pace. 
</P>
<P>
LeBrecht, the 33-year-old resident sound designer for the Berkeley Repertory 
Theatre for the last 10 years, may have been born with spina bifida, a spinal 
cord defect in which the spine is partly exposed, but he never stops for 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't find out until I was in my mid-teens that I shouldn't have made it as 
far as I did," LeBrecht said. "I wasn't supposed to grow up to age 2, and then 
4 and then 10. All I knew is that I wasn't walking and I would go to the 
doctors a lot." 
</P>
<P>
In the sound booth, with the keyboards and amplifiers all within reach, 
LeBrecht is in his element. He trained for this since his days as an 
undergraduate at UC San Diego. LeBrecht showed how he used a digital sampling 
keyboard to change the pitches of a tape of a howling puppy for "Measure for 
Measure." Setting the pitch above the original recording made it sound like sea 
gulls. Setting it below made it sound like a wolf howling. 
</P>
<P>
He demonstrated with his hands how he set up a fishing line from which he hung 
an old ammo box, a gas cap and metal pipes to provide "a palette of sounds" for 
the late John Hirsch when the director came to the Old Globe to do "Coriolanus" 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
LeBrecht described his delight at creating one of his favorite moments in sound 
design -- the time when, for just an instant, the crickets suddenly stop 
chirping in the La Jolla Playhouse production of "War Babies," at the moment 
when, unknown to the characters on stage, the nuclear bomb drops far away. The 
effect was subtle enough, said LeBrecht, that you sensed something was 
different, without being quite sure what you didn't hear. 
</P>
<P>
With 90 professional theater productions to his credit, he stressed, "I am not 
a disabled sound designer. I am a sound designer with a disability." 
</P>
<P>
He has managed to not only limit the impact of his disability on his job; he 
has, over the years, minimized its effect on his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forced to Adapt 
</P>
<P>
Since he was a child, LeBrecht's parents expected him to adapt to their 
split-level house in Westchester. He grew up crawling around the house, 
clambering up as many as three flights of stairs with eight or nine steps 
apiece. From mid-first grade on, he attended public schools rather than schools 
for the disabled. He didn't get his first wheelchair until he was almost ready 
for school. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were not very overprotective, which is the downfall of a lot of 
disabled people. In their own way they were preparing me for the real world," 
LeBrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does LeBrecht live alone in his Berkeley apartment, he does a great 
deal of driving in a customized van he uses to go collecting the sounds he 
needs for his work. For "Measure for Measure," he drove out near Cuyamaca Lake, 
just north of Pine Valley, to tape bird sounds to create the feel of "the walls 
of the theater melting away." 
</P>
<P>
His interest in theater began in church, where a family friend, Ed Bryce, who 
played Bill Bauer on "The Guiding Light," helped his father put on shows for 
the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
By the time LeBrecht was ready for college, he had decided to major in audio. 
After his first class, when he realized audio meant studying physics rather 
than producing sounds, he switched to a theater major and studied sound design. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre soon after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as he is the first to admit, it hasn't been easy. 
</P>

"I had a very rough row to hoe," he said. "And I'm not just talking about 
getting a job. I'm talking about getting a date. Or going to the beach."

<P>
Overcoming Doubters 
</P>
<P>
LeBrecht has had to work hard to convince others that his disability was not 
going to impede his work. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Des McAnuff, the artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse, wanted 
LeBrecht to design the sound for his off-Broadway play, "The Death of Von 
Richthofen as Witnessed from Earth." Robert Woodruff, the director of the 
project, also wanted LeBrecht. But the production manager for the show 
presented more of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to convince the production manager for 45 minutes on the phone that I 
could get up and down steps," LeBrecht recalled. LeBrecht persuaded him and was 
hired to create the sounds of flying for McAnuff's story about a WWI flying 
ace. He wound up using the sound of a Gatling gun and a lawn mower -- to 
suggest the plane's engine -- for the opening scene dogfight. 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight in his career came when he was hired by the Old Globe Theatre 
last year to design the sound for "Love's Labour's Lost." Studying at UC San 
Diego, he always fantasized about working at the Old Globe. And LeBrecht 
couldn't imagine anything more inspiring -- or intimidating -- than working 
under the direction of Craig Noel, whom LeBrecht describes as "a legend." 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to make good," LeBrecht said. "I feel like I have a 
responsibility not to fail. I feel if I do people will say he failed because he 
was disabled. You feel there's an added onus when you have a disability. 
</P>
<P>
"When you feel you are really integrated you have the freedom to fail, which 
means you have the freedom to stretch yourself and try much harder. We're still 
a long way off from that," LeBrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, despite his words, he is still taking chances. 
</P>
<P>
He recently left his full-time position at the Berkeley Rep to explore 
free-lance work in theater and film. His upcoming project at Fantasy Films, 
part of the Saul Zaentz Film Center in Berkeley, is "Madhouse," starring 
Kirstie Alley of "Cheers." It's a story about a cat who dies and comes back to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he leave what he calls "one of the best sound jobs for theater in the 
country"? 
</P>
<P>
He gives the wheel on his wheelchair a playful spin that rolls him from side to 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to give it a shot," he said with a grin.

COMPETING TAX PLANS SEEN OFFERING DUBIOUS BENEFITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and Democratic congressional leaders are wheeling out their big 
guns for a major political confrontation on the House floor this week over 
whether to cut the capital gains tax rate or expand tax breaks for individual 
retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
But when the two sides argue the economic consequences of their proposals, they 
are mostly shooting blanks. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Republican claims, there is little evidence from impartial economic 
research that a lower capital gains tax rate would do much to spur innovation, 
stimulate the economy or significantly boost government revenues in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Democratic counterproposal -- to pay for more IRA tax 
breaks with a higher tax rate on upper-income taxpayers -- probably offers 
equally dubious benefits for savings and investment. Although there is no 
consensus, many economists argue that most money socked away in tax-sheltered 
IRAs would have been saved even without the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an economic debate," said Barry Bosworth, a leading economic 
analyst at the Brookings Institution. "This is a political showdown. The 
problem is that both sides grossly exaggerate the benefits from the tax changes 
they advocate." 
</P>
<P>
The political rhetoric escalated Monday, with White House Budget Director 
Richard G. Darman accusing congressional Democratic leaders of following a 
"kamikaze approach to national politics" aimed at creating budgetary chaos 
designed to force a tax hike. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) dismissed 
Darman's attack as "nonsense" and "unworthy of him." 
</P>
<P>
The economic arguments, while not so shrill, carry more potential significance 
for the country. Nearly all economists agree that additional savings -- the 
stated goals of both the Republican and the Democratic tax proposals -- would 
help the economy by making more money available at lower cost for the 
investment that helps ensure rising prosperity in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But the measures Congress is considering show little promise of moving the 
nation any closer toward those goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with all these claims about the benefits of tax incentives is that 
other things going on in the economy are so much more important," said Edward 
Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. "Any tax 
changes are almost insignificant by comparison." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the federal government has been experimenting with 
different ways to stimulate higher savings and investment. It has had little 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1978, Congress approved several reductions in the top capital gains 
tax rate -- on profits from stocks, real estate and most other assets -- to a 
low of about 20% by 1983. At the same time, lawmakers expanded tax breaks for 
individual retirement accounts, opening them to all working taxpayers in the 
major tax cut of 1981. The lower tax rates, combined with Congress' decision to 
deregulate interest rates and the Federal Reserve's tight-money policy, drove 
the after-tax return on savings to unprecedented levels in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Several economists, including Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of 
Economic Advisers, had predicted that savings would rise significantly in 
response to the promise of higher returns. But it did not work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, private savings by Americans, which had been remarkably stable at 
about 9% to 10% of the national economic output from the 1950s through the 
1970s, plunged to a low of about 6% in 1987. Most economists concluded that 
savings do not respond significantly to higher returns and are much more 
sensitive to demographic trends and changes in wealth. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the huge federal deficits of the 1980s -- caused in part by 
sharply expanding tax breaks -- aggravated the problem by absorbing U.S. 
savings that might otherwise have gone to private investment. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the failure of incentives was that after Congress removed the 
special tax breaks for capital gains and IRAs in the sweeping 1986 tax revision 
law, both savings and investment began to rebound. And even if that seemingly 
paradoxical reaction was unrelated to the tax reforms, it is further evidence 
that such tax law changes carry little weight in the giant, complex U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a good case that the higher income tax rates of the 1970s 
hurt economic growth, advocates of cutting capital gains taxes today carry the 
argument much further. 
</P>
<P>
Even though federal tax rates are much lower now than they were in the 1970s, 
supporters contend that capital gains taxes should be cut below ordinary income 
tax rates to reward entrepreneurs for starting new businesses. They say that 
the relatively high capital gains tax rate puts the United States at a 
disadvantage against its major trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is: Does lowering capital gains produce more productive investment?" 
Darman asked rhetorically during a briefing with reporters Monday. "Generally, 
the answer . . . is yes." 
</P>
<P>
Darman, his tongue only partly in cheek, added that "a vote against capital 
gains is a vote against farmers, small owners of timber stands, people who 
raise Christmas trees, a father who builds a little steak submarine sandwich 
business." 
</P>
<P>
To Darman's critics, that points up the key problem with relying on a capital 
gains tax cut to stimulate the economy. To provide some modest benefits for new 
investment, a cut in the capital gains rate showers billions of dollars in 
extra tax savings on those who are simply cashing in past investments or 
reshuffling existing assets. 
</P>
<P>
"For successful entrepreneurs, the returns are so high that small differences 
in the rate of taxation are simply irrelevant," concluded Michael Barker, an 
economic analyst formerly with the moderate-to-conservative Democratic 
Leadership Council, after extensive research on the capital gains issue. 
</P>
<P>
And Barker disputes the claim that other countries are better off because they 
avoid most capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Has the absence of a capital gains tax stimulated the emergence of a venture 
capital industry in Japan or West Germany?" he asks. "Has it made the young 
people of either country entrepreneurial? No way." 
</P>
<P>
Similar problems bedevil the claim that tax breaks for IRAs add significantly 
to the nation's pool of savings. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies, including a recent report sponsored by Merrill Lynch, claim that 
as much as 80% of the money put into IRAs during the 1980s represented extra 
savings rather than money that was simply transferred from another source. 
</P>
<P>
But Brookings' Bosworth, who has closely studied the savings debate, calls the 
Merrill Lynch conclusions "a joke. They made no attempt to control for 
substitution effects." 
</P>
<P>
Other research, by Harvard economist David Wise and Stephen Venti of Dartmouth, 
found that IRAs may have produced a net gain of 20 to 25 cents in extra savings 
for every $1 added to an IRA. But Bosworth says that the much more modest claim 
of Wise and Venti may also be questionable because no research actually tracked 
the behavior of savers over a multi-year period.

RIGHTISTS BLAMED FOR WAVE OF VIOLENCE IN GUATEMALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

GUATEMALA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alleged right-wing extremists have unleashed a campaign of kidnapings, 
assassinations and bombings in the worst wave of political violence to strike 
Guatemala since civilian President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo took office nearly 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, 10 San Carlos University students were abducted in the 
capital. Five were later found dead with signs of having been tortured, while 
the other five are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala's former ambassador to Spain, also a leader of Cerezo's Christian 
Democratic Party, was assassinated by unidentified gunmen, as was one of the 
nation's wealthiest bankers. 
</P>
<P>
And in the provinces of San Marcos and Quetzaltenango, where the army is 
fighting a small guerrilla insurgency, at least 21 peasants have been kidnaped 
and killed or have disappeared after being abducted this month, according to 
diplomats and human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very serious," said Peter Kooijmans, a U.N. official who 
arrived in Guatemala last week to investigate human rights abuses. "The groups 
of society affected by the violence are very widespread, which contributes to 
the atmosphere of terror in the country." 
</P>
<P>
After the killings, scores of labor leaders and political activists who had 
begun to organize under the civilian government fled the country or dropped out 
of sight in fear. For example, seven of the 11 board members representing the 
Federation of State (employees) Union quit their posts, according to a union 
leader, and only four of 12 remaining leaders of the San Carlos University 
Students' Assn. are still active. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Charge d'Affaires Philip Taylor has condemned the "terrorist crimes," and 
in the wake of bomb and grenade attacks on public buildings in the capital, the 
U.S. State Department this month issued a strongly worded travel advisory for 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan officials blame the violence on rightist businessmen and former 
military officers who they say are trying to create chaos so there will be a 
popular clamor for a return to strongman rule and a coup. 
</P>
<P>
"These are rightist groups or people who have been involved in coup attempts in 
the past," Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan said in an interview. 
"Obviously, there are former military men in the scheme." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Current Intelligence 
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats and human rights groups assert that the killers appear to be 
operating with current military intelligence, which would seem to implicate 
active-duty army officials. 
</P>
<P>
They agree that the violence is not official government policy, but they charge 
that Cerezo's is a "lame-duck" government that has failed to take action to 
stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's attitude is worse than impotence -- it's indifference," said 
one Western diplomat who asked not to be identified by name. "Guatemala is 
swooping into the bad old days, and all the prognoses are that it's going to 
get worse. Cerezo is perceived as having decided not to do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
The government has arrested two civilians and is looking for a third, allegedly 
responsible for directing the violence. But diplomats do not believe they are 
the real leaders behind the violence. 
</P>
<P>
While on the rise, the violence has not reached levels of the early 1980s, when 
the army, in a brutal counterinsurgency campaign, reportedly killed tens of 
thousands of Indian peasants and labor, church and community leaders, including 
many Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
After that period, Guatemala was internationally isolated and economically 
bankrupt. A succession of four generals ruled the country for 16 years through 
coups and fraudulent elections before the military agreed to hold fair 
elections in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Cerezo won the vote by a landslide and took office in January, 1986, agreeing 
not to tamper with a last-minute decree of the outgoing regime granting amnesty 
to military personnel for any crimes committed in the counterinsurgency 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Cerezo's defense minister, Brig. Gen. Hector Gramajo Morales, believed that the 
leftist guerrillas, numbering only about 1,000 by early 1986, had ceased to be 
a military threat and were a political challenge instead. Human rights abuses 
decreased during the first years of Cerezo's administration. 
</P>
<P>
But some sectors of the military bristled when the government attempted to 
negotiate with the rebels last year under a Central American peace plan and the 
talks were broken off. The guerrilla movement has since picked up steam with 
increased attacks over a broader area, including urban operations within 25 
miles of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Rightists restricted early government efforts to undertake tax and agrarian 
reform, but they were unable to keep labor unions, students and human rights 
groups from taking advantage of a civilian government to organize among the 
nation's poor -- more than two-thirds of the population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations became commonplace, and teachers went on a two-month strike 
starting in July, while postal workers shut down mail service. 
</P>
<P>
Three serious coup attempts -- in May and August, 1988, and again last May -- 
have whittled away at Cerezo's power and room to maneuver, diplomats say. At 
the same time, he has lost popularity because of public insecurity and eroding 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Many people say Cerezo's only major accomplishment is that he is still 
president. But even that is too much for some groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who have been trying to oppose the whole process openly and 
frontally through coup attempts have changed their strategy now," said Edmond 
Mulet, a congressman from the opposition National Union of the Center party. 
</P>
<P>
"That didn't work, so they are attacking different flanks, trying to create 
friction between different sectors of society. They're on the path of what they 
want to achieve. A lot of people say democracy is not working, that it is not a 
guarantee of their lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the solutions that rightists have offered is the candidacy of retired 
Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, an evangelical Protestant who took power through a coup 
in 1982 and ruled for 18 of the bloodiest months in modern Guatemalan history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Sign? 
</P>
<P>
While political observers give Rios Montt little chance of success, they say 
his campaign is a sign of the conservative mood. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students, labor leaders and human rights workers report receiving a 
multitude of death threats over the telephone or in anonymous envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Armando Ruiz, one of the four remaining coordinators of the University 
Students Assn., said he no longer sleeps at home, rarely attends class and 
varies his schedule so that no one can anticipate his route. But Ruiz, who was 
out of the country when his colleagues were abducted, talked to a reporter in 
the Student Assn.'s campus office, which he said will remain open and staffed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't stop working. That's what they want," he said. "If we stop using the 
office, we would be clandestine, and to be clandestine in Guatemala is to be a 
dead man. They would consider us the enemy, communists, guerrillas." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear why those who have been killed were targets and if the assassins 
were the same in all killings. In each case, theories abound about the victim's 
enemies, alleged involvement in Guatemala's growing drug-trafficking business, 
links to guerrillas or intentions to expose corruption. Rumor and fear have 
been substituted for information. 
</P>
<P>
The spate of violence began Aug. 1 with the assassination of former Ambassador 
to Spain Danilo Barillas. His was the first high-profile political 
assassination in many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights Figure Disappears 
</P>
<P>
Soon, bombs and grenades began to explode -- at a fancy hotel, an upscale 
shopping center and warehouses. On Aug. 15 a bomb exploded at the offices of 
the Mutual Support Group, or GAM, a human rights organization, and the 
following morning GAM member Maria Rumualda Camey was kidnaped by unidentified 
gunmen in Escuintla. She has not been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
GAM board member Miguel Morales was kidnaped on Aug. 23, blindfolded and held 
for 40 hours before he was released by unidentified men who said they had 
"mistaken him for someone else." The students began to disappear over about two 
weeks starting in late August. The five dead are: Carlos Humberto Cabrera 
Rivera; Carlos Leonel Chuta Camey; Victor Hugo Rodriguez and his wife, Silvia 
Maria Azurdia Utera, and Eduardo Antonio Lopez Palencia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banker Slain 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 25, Industrial Bank President Ramiro Castillo Love was assassinated by 
gunmen at his home. 
</P>
<P>
In a murkier case this month, three shoemakers were found dead in the capital 
with their hands hacked off. The government arrested a suspect who was said to 
have confessed to the killings because the men allegedly raped his wife. But 
human rights workers are suspicious of the case because of the mutilations, 
which are typical of political torture cases. 
</P>
<P>
Six people died on their way home from a funeral in Escuintla on Sept. 14. 
Officials said they were caught in cross-fire during a rebel attack on the 
local military commissioner's house. 
</P>
<P>
Also this month, 21 peasants have been kidnaped and killed in various villages 
of San Marcos province, according to Factor Mendez, director of the Center for 
Study and Promotion of Human Rights. A Western diplomat said he had the names 
of 21 people killed in San Marcos, but did not know details. He said four 
others were found dead in neighboring Quetzaltenango. 
</P>
<P>
There are no overall reliable figures on killings and disappearances, but it is 
generally agreed that the numbers are going up. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded letter last month, the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference 
wrote of the "feeling of desperation and fear" among Guatemalans. 
</P>
<P>
"Guatemala does not want to and does not deserve to live another horrendous 
experience," the Roman Catholic bishops wrote. They declared that the country 
"is falling precipitously into chaos, anarchy or a situation of extreme 
violence."

KING HOSPITAL FACES LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials notified Martin Luther King Jr./ Drew Medical Center Monday 
of plans to cut off millions of public health care dollars to King on Dec. 21 
-- effectively closing down the hospital -- unless scores of serious 
patient-care deficiencies are corrected immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration threatens about $60 
million in annual funds received by the hospital from the Medicare and Medi-Cal 
programs that pay the health care bills of the elderly and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Closure of the hospital would cause chaos in the county's health care network, 
as hundreds of thousands of people would be forced to seek care elsewhere. King 
is the only county-operated hospital in South-Central Los Angeles, shouldering 
an enormous patient load, including about 1,200 emergency ambulance runs a 
month. About 70% of the time, the hospital's resources are stretched so thin 
that the emergency room has to be closed to all but walk-in patients. 
</P>
<P>
In threatening to terminate funding, federal officials cited major break-downs 
in six fundamental areas of care that "seriously limit the facility's capacity 
to furnish an adequate level or quality of care," according to the letter 
delivered to King on Monday. Hospital and county health officials were not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government is not in the business of terminating hospitals," said 
Gerald Moskowitz, regional administrator at the Health Care Financing 
Administration in San Francisco, "but we do expect the quality of care to be at 
an adequate level, and at King, it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials at the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance said they 
have opened an investigation of doctors at King who provided questionable 
medical care to patients whose cases were detailed in a series of articles 
published in The Times earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
And officials at the Chicago-based Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations, which accredits more than 5,000 hospitals nationwide, 
said that they, too, will investigate charges of poor health care at the 
430-bed, county-owned hospital in Watts. The commission has accredited King in 
the past, but federal officials said Monday that regardless of the commission's 
action, they will disregard the past accreditation and no longer rely upon the 
commission's inspections. Instead, federal officials will do their own 
investigations of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Two reports prepared by state health officials earlier this month have cited 
King for massive, wide-ranging health care deficiencies in six areas: quality 
assurance, infection controls, nursing, dietary services, administrative 
leadership and physical environment. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors cited instances in which patients at King languished for hours 
in the emergency room without care. Others, believed to have infectious 
diseases, were not properly isolated, it was reported. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment had fallen into disrepair and one piece in the pediatrics unit was so 
filthy that the odor alerted investigators. There were cases in which drugs 
were left unattended, patient records were misfiled and inexperienced nursing 
students were called upon to care for acutely ill patients, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The reports by the state Department of Health Services were prompted by a 
national study released in January that analyzed death rates of elderly 
Medicare patients nationwide and ranked King among the bottom 50 of 5,577 
hospitals surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz said that teams of state health inspectors were dispatched to write 
reports on the 11 worst-ranking hospitals in California. King is the only one 
that has been hit, as a result, with the threat of losing its funding because 
"the problems at King were in a variety of different areas," Moskowitz said. 
"They're systemic and more serious than the ones we found at other hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he hopes King officials will be able to prove to his 
satisfaction that the hospital has made necessary corrections by the December 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz noted that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which is 
faulted in the state reports for its lack of leadership and oversight of the 
hospital, has scheduled a private meeting for today to discuss personnel and 
management changes at King. 
</P>
<P>
"One would hope that the necessary actions to bring the facility into 
compliance would be taken," Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum requested the meeting, according to his senior 
deputy, Judy Hammond, because county officials "have known for a long time that 
there are operational problems at King -- that it's not just a funding problem, 
but that there's a need for a shift and change in management." 
</P>
<P>
After reports of fiscal mismanagement at King last year, the health department 
attempted to rotate King's veteran hospital administrator, William Delgardo, to 
another county post, according to county officials. But Hammond said that two 
supervisors, whom she would not name, blocked the move after protests in the 
community to keep Delgardo at King. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have asked the health department to investigate "serious 
charges of substandard health care" at King raised by articles in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said in an interview Monday that he will urge the 
supervisors to expand the investigative team to include medical and health care 
experts outside the county health department. 
</P>

"I don't think they should rely on the hospital, the health department or the 
state Board of Medical Quality Assurance to rectify the problem. At stake is 
whether the community is receiving substandard care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's office reviewed 31 cases of questionable medical care at King two 
years ago, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed Feldman, but there was not enough 
evidence to bring criminal charges against any particular physician. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "there is support for the view that there are too many 
instances of poor care, inadequate care and failures in care." 
</P>
<P>
In instances where the deaths were "particularly tragic and questionable," he 
said, there was often a problem with incomplete and missing medical records.

Health workers were the first to see it coming. They sensed it on the street 
corners where prostitutes loitered. Behavior was changing. Prostitutes were no 
longer bothering with motels. They were out on the curb hailing tricks, working 
hastily out of cars. 
</P>
<P>
People coming into the sexually transmitted disease clinics could not remember 
their partners. More and more seemed to be out of work or using drugs. Despite 
warnings about AIDS, health workers sensed a desperate recklessness afoot -- 
brought on by upsurges in cocaine, poverty and social decay. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it's a matter of time until you see the statistics," recalled Sibyl 
Howard, a public health nurse with Los Angeles County. "When you're out in the 
field and you sense people's despair, you can say, 'Look, this is what's 
happening.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Silent Epidemic' 
</P>
<P>
What Howard intuited during those years in the mid-1980s is now an alarming 
national fact. There is a "silent epidemic" of sexually transmitted diseases. 
They are spreading rapidly with no sign of a slowdown. And they are falling 
hardest on the young and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 million Americans will develop sexually transmitted diseases this 
year. Eighty-five percent will be under age 30. As many as 100,000 women will 
become infertile as a result of infections. Thousands of babies will be born 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
Organisms barely heard of 10 years ago appear to be rampant. More than 20 
viruses and bacteria are now known to be spread by sex. Meanwhile, many 
inner-city neighborhoods have become permeated with syphilis, a disease long 
thought a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It is increasingly apparent that the cities of North America are more and more 
resembling the cities of developing countries," Dr. King K. Holmes, a prominent 
researcher of sexually transmitted diseases, said in a talk at the 
international conference on AIDS earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Powering the grim statistics are a mix of forces, the most notorious of which 
is the spread of crack cocaine, the uncommonly addictive drug that has spawned 
a life style centered on swapping sex for drugs, inadvertently spreading 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safe Sex Message 
</P>
<P>
Many inner-city heterosexuals have not learned the safe sex message of the AIDS 
era. In addition, urban and suburban teen-agers are having sex earlier and more 
often. Many use no protection, despite the spreading epidemic among their age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, resources for controlling sexually transmitted diseases, other than 
AIDS, have remained flat or declined. Many public clinics have had to cut their 
hours. New diseases have outsmarted old disease-control tactics. Research 
funding has barely grown. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a scourge of suffering borne disproportionately by women 
and children. Many of the diseases are linked to other conditions, including 
cervical cancer, and some carry with them the risk of birth defects and brain 
damage for babies born infected. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, some sexually transmitted diseases now entail an added danger. 
They appear to increase one's risk of AIDS, either by causing sores through 
which the AIDS virus can be transmitted or, some researchers suspect, by 
accelerating the course of the fatal syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we can allow to happen today is continued spread of those STDs 
which have been implicated as risk factors for sexual transmission of the 
(AIDS) virus," Holmes said. " . . . We must put control of these diseases back 
on the public health agenda." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century ago, there were for the most part just two well-known 
venereal diseases: syphilis and gonorrhea. Now, new diagnostic techniques have 
made it possible to identify and characterize more than 20 organisms spread 
through sex. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are chlamydia trachomatis, a cause of a painful inflammation of the 
urethra; incurable viruses like herpes, hepatitis B and human papilloma; the 
bacterium that causes genital ulcers, once rare in the United States, and 
various fungi and protozoa. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers, being accumulated by federal agencies and researchers, are 
stunning: 
</P>
<P>
* Chlamydia infection, barely known a decade ago, has become the most common 
bacterial infection in the United States. There are as many as 4 million new 
cases a year. Up to 2 million new cases of gonorrhea occur annually, one 
quarter of them among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
* There are half a million new cases of genital herpes each year; 30 million 
Americans are believed to be affected by the often-painful, incurable disease. 
Studies suggest that the number of cases of chancroid, a rare bacterial 
infection, increased sevenfold between 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of doctor visits each year for treatment of genital warts has 
jumped more than sevenfold since 1966. An estimated 750,000 cases are diagnosed 
annually. The virus that causes warts, human papilloma virus, may also be 
linked to cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* The largest leap in cases of infectious syphilis in a quarter century in the 
United States occurred in 1987. The number of babies reported to have been born 
with congenital syphilis, a potentially fatal condition, climbed from 150 in 
1983 to nearly 700 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had asked me two years ago would the day ever come that you'd see 1,000 
cases of (infectious) syphilis in Connecticut," said Gordon Joachim, director 
of the state's sexually transmitted disease control program, "I would have bet 
my house that that would never happen." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the burden of disease appears to be spreading unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
Among whites, syphilis rates have dropped in this decade, thanks largely to 
safer sex among gay men. But among blacks, the incidence of the disease has 
jumped sharply since 1985. Among black women, the rate is now 50 times higher 
than among white women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gonorrhea Peaked in 1975 
</P>
<P>
Gonorrhea peaked in the United States in 1975. Among whites, it has declined 
steadily since. But among blacks, the decline reversed itself in 1985, and by 
last year the reported incidence among black women was 21 times higher than 
among whites. 
</P>
<P>
Similar patterns appear to be occurring with chancroid and a vaginal infection, 
trichomoniasis, according to Holmes. Like syphilis and gonorrhea, those are 
among the more easily detectable and treatable of the sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Some viruses, on the other hand, such as herpes and human papilloma viruses, 
appear to be moving quickly among whites and the middle class. They are 
currently incurable, though their symptoms can be treated. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, traces the 
growing concentration of disease in the inner cities to several factors -- from 
economic and demographic shifts to drug abuse and the growing pinch in 
resources devoted to public health. 
</P>
<P>
Black and Latino populations are growing faster than the white. Meanwhile, 
poverty is increasingly concentrated in certain pockets of the United States. 
More and more blacks and Latinos find themselves living in those communities, 
plagued by abuse of drugs like crack. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, funding for public clinics and other health services catering 
to those communities has failed to keep up with the workload. Health care 
resources have shifted steadily away from the public to the private sector, 
Holmes and others contend. 
</P>
<P>
"I attribute the increase in syphilis to two things, one of which is drug use," 
said Dr. Robert Rolfs of the federal Centers for Disease Control. "The second 
reason is that in a number of areas . . . there's a real problem of access to 
STD care." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia was one of the first cities to see a dramatic increase in 
infectious syphilis. In 1985, there were just 317 reported cases. That number 
has leaped every year since, to 1,293 in 1988, a figure expected to nearly 
double this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reported gonorrhea cases also increased -- from 17,345 in 1985 to 22,976 in 
1988. The actual numbers may be higher since public health officials believe as 
many as 50% to 80% of all syphilis and gonorrhea cases go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, city support for sexually transmitted disease control 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The sole public clinic for sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment 
in Philadelphia reduced its hours by 20% between 1986 and 1988. With clinic 
registration stopping earlier and earlier and more patients being turned away, 
patient visits dropped nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of demand," said Martin Goldberg, senior public health 
adviser with the city's Department of Public Health. " . . . It's a reflection 
of the limited number of hours. What increases is the number of patients turned 
away without service." 
</P>
<P>
There have been similar problems in Los Angeles County, where the infectious 
syphilis rate climbed from 1,558 in 1984 to 2,770 in 1986 to 4,198 in 1987. The 
syphilis incidence per 100,000 population in Los Angeles County was 55.6 in 
1988, nearly four times the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the funding problem, officials say, is traceable indirectly to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, AIDS has dominated sexually transmitted disease control 
funding. Money for other diseases has remained virtually flat. Many health 
workers and researchers trained in sexually transmitted diseases have shifted 
to the fight against the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that both in terms of financial resources and human resources, there 
is no question that the AIDS epidemic has been a mixed bag," said Dr. Judith 
Wasserheit of the federal National Institute on Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, which conducts sexually transmitted disease research. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a real siphoning of funds from STD control to HIV-related 
work," said Wasserheit, chief of the sexually transmitted disease branch. "I 
think that is reflected as well in the availability of people to provide STD 
services." 
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that research funding has remained flat and has not been 
actually cut. 
</P>
<P>
Some physicians, too, have let down their guard. Routine screening for syphilis 
ceased in many places during the 1970s when it appeared to many to be no longer 
a threat. Now that it has resurfaced, some have responded slowly. Cases have 
gone undetected. 
</P>
<P>
For example, congenital syphilis can be prevented if diagnosed early in a 
woman's pregnancy; it can also be treated successfully if the newborn is 
tested. But pregnant women are going untested, despite laws requiring testing, 
and babies are going untreated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Tested in Prenatal Care 
</P>
<P>
A review by Los Angeles County health officials of the 75 reported cases of 
babies born with syphilis in 1988 turned up a disturbing fact. Some of the 
mothers had received prenatal care but appeared never to have been tested for 
syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
In 20 cases, the mothers had tested positive for syphilis. But the opportunity 
to cure the baby was missed at delivery. The babies, born without obvious 
symptoms, went untested or untreated, developing symptoms only after leaving 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The county study also found two babies born symptomatic by mothers who had been 
treated improperly. They had been given erythromycin, an antibiotic that does 
not cross the placenta well and therefore cannot be counted on to cure syphilis 
in the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
"The management of syphilis is kind of a lost art," said Dr. Deborah Cohen, who 
headed the county study. " . . . I think there's still a lot of physicians that 
don't know what all the tests mean and how to interpret the lab results." 
</P>
<P>
The burden of the epidemic falls disproportionately on women and children. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million American women a year develop pelvic inflammatory 
disease when infections like chlamydia spread into the uterus and Fallopian 
tubes. According to federal statistics, most of the women are under age 25 and 
have not yet had children. 
</P>
<P>
The disease leaves them 10 times as likely as other women to experience a 
pregnancy occurring outside the uterus. The rate of so-called ectopic 
pregnancies per 1,000 reported pregnancies in the United States has nearly 
quadrupled since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Pelvic inflammatory disease is also linked to infertility; one in four women 
with the disease lose their ability to conceive. Sexually transmitted diseases 
account for one-fifth of all cases of infertility, a condition affecting 2.4 
million married couples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk of Cervical Cancer 
</P>
<P>
Another possible risk for women may be cervical cancer, long suspected to be 
linked to sexually transmitted diseases -- in particular, several strains of 
human papilloma virus, the virus that causes genital warts. 
</P>
<P>
Infants face some of the gravest risks. 
</P>
<P>
Most organisms spread by sex can be passed on to a fetus, often with 
debilitating consequences. Congenital syphilis, for example, can result in 
fetal death, prematurity, blindness, neurological disease and abnormalities of 
soft tissue and bone. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure to herpes in the womb can in some cases result in growth retardation 
in the uterus and prematurity. And some babies exposed to human papilloma virus 
develop a potentially life-threatening obstruction of the upper airway. 
</P>
<P>
Only with screening and treatment can such cases be averted. 
</P>
<P>
One morning recently in the living room of a bungalow in South-Central Los 
Angeles down the street from the Little Flock Primitive and Greater Revelation 
Baptist churches, a 58-year-old woman sat, ankles folded, on a piano bench 
discussing her 14th child. 
</P>
<P>
Lula Chism raised 13 children of her own. At age 57, she was not expecting 
more. But when she went to visit her daughter and new granddaughter at Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center 16 months ago, the county sent the baby home 
with Chism. 
</P>
<P>
The baby had been born carrying the bacterium that causes syphilis. According 
to Chism, her daughter is a cocaine addict who had not sought prenatal care. 
The infant would probably recover, the nurses said, if Chism would ensure she 
got daily shots of penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 days, Chism took the child across town to a county clinic. The child is 
healthy and appears to have suffered no permanent harm. But Chism regrets 
bitterly that her grand-daughter's introduction to the world included those 
daily clinic visits. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me feel bad that it had gotten into my family," said Chism, who places 
the responsibility squarely with her daughter. " . . . If my daughter would 
take care of her body and be careful who she goes out with, it could have been 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd have had anything to do with it, she would have used birth control and 
not got pregnant to begin with. Maybe they get this cocaine and don't think 
about this sort of thing."

KREMLIN VOWS TO CUT MILITARY, AID CONSUMERS

<P>
Through sharp cuts in defense spending and capital investment, the Soviet 
government Monday promised its citizens better supplies of food, clothes, 
medicine and other consumer goods in the coming year in what officials 
described as a fundamental reorientation of the country's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Premier Lev A. Voronin told the Supreme Soviet, the national 
legislature, that the government plans a massive shift of resources to develop 
agriculture and light industry in response to widespread complaints that four 
years of perestroika (restructuring) have not improved the daily lives of most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who opened the autumn parliamentary session, 
reminded deputies of the popular dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"High and even exceptional importance is attached in society to this session," 
he said. "People expect it to produce significant results, answers to many 
vital questions and major decisions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Urgent measures are needed both to lift social tension and to advance 
perestroika decisively in every area, most notably the social and economic 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Changes Promised 
</P>
<P>
Outlining government plans to pay more for agricultural produce, to open new 
consumer goods factories, to convert munitions plants to civilian production 
and to import more from abroad, Voronin promised significant changes within the 
next 12 months, including an end to some of the Soviet Union's chronic 
shortages of many basic products. 
</P>
<P>
But Voronin also acknowledged that consumer demand will continue to outstrip 
supply as the government attempts to transform the centrally planned economy, 
with its state-owned industries and huge bureaucracy, into one that would 
operate on the principles of "market socialism," which are still difficult to 
define. 
</P>
<P>
"We are carrying out a massive and broadly based transfer of the economy to a 
regime in which the solving of social problems has priority," Voronin said, 
detailing what he called a "sharp change of direction" after another year of 
serious economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, the government will pay farmers in dollars, rather than Soviet 
rubles, for increased production, hoping to stimulate substantial growth in 
farm output. Virtually all farm earnings will also be reinvested rather than 
being turned over to the state as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In industry, the production of consumer durables is scheduled to jump by 20% 
and of other consumer goods by 11%, according to the plan. Overall retail sales 
are expected to grow about 10% next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1.1% Growth Expected in 1990 
</P>
<P>
But the economy is expected to grow about 1.1% next year in terms of national 
income, the value added to production through labor and processing, because of 
the severe cutbacks in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The government's budget deficit, now $185 billion at current exchange rates, 
will be reduced by half through raising more money and trimming expenditures, 
according to Valentin V. Pavlov, the finance minister. Overall, the Soviet 
budget will amount to $751 billion next year. 
</P>
<P>
In an initial effort to develop a capital market, the deficit will be financed 
by public borrowing, Pavlov said, rather than a government demand on the State 
Bank of the Soviet Union to finance its shortfall out of deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The government's domestic debt already amounts to about $615 billion; its net 
foreign debt to about $50 billion, including $45 billion owed Western banks. 
The foreign debt is so large, Pavlov said, that it grows simply through 
deferred repayments of principal and interest without any further loans. 
</P>
<P>
Military spending will be reduced 8.3%, from $119 billion to $109 billion, as 
part of a previously announced plan to cut defense expenditures by 14% by 1991, 
Pavlov said. Spending on weapons development and military construction is to be 
cut more sharply, he said, and production of tanks, military aircraft and 
helicopters will be reduced substantially. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Consumer Goods 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, defense industries are to increase their production of consumer 
goods by 35% next year to $62 billion, according to the plans submitted to the 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Although characterized largely as "emergency measures," intended to meet 
popular demands for an improved living standard, the state budget and 
development plan are the first tangible steps in the country' economic 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Far-reaching legislation will come before the Supreme Soviet during its 
two-month session that Gorbachev said would lay the foundation for a new 
economic system, which will become the heart of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 80 items on the agenda are new laws that will allow private 
entrepreneurs and cooperatives to compete on equal footing with state 
enterprises. The new laws will authorize the leasing of state-owned factories 
to their workers and managers and will permit the ownership and sale of land 
and other natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Other laws will establish the rules by which Soviet companies operate and 
provide for collective bargaining by workers with their employers. The laws 
will institute corporate, income and turnover taxes in place of a system in 
which the state has taken all profits. 
</P>
<P>
Voronin and Pavlov, however, said the government's immediate task was to halt 
the country's economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Production Declines 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, according to Voronin, production had declined in about a 
third of the 178 key areas -- among them oil, coal, gasoline, synthetic fibers, 
sugar, canned food, paper, socks and stockings -- that the government tracks in 
its efforts to assess the state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The dynamism of the economy has been steadily falling in many major areas this 
year," Voronin said, his remarks contrasting sharply with the traditional 
upbeat appraisals delivered by his predecessors. "Social tension has increased, 
and the national economy has been losing its balance. Against the background of 
these trends, deficits on the consumer market and in production have grown." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Budget Deficit 
</P>
<P>
The goals of the 1990 plan consequently were to reverse the negative trends, 
including the large budget deficit and resulting inflation, and to stabilize 
the economy, he said. With the fiscal improvement, more resources could be 
devoted to production of consumer goods and ultimately to satisfying consumer 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually absent from Voronin's outline of development plans were announcements 
of increased capital investment -- he called for a cutback -- and of the 
greater industrial capacity that the Soviet Union has regarded as the measure 
of real economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Tough decisions will be required in both the adoption of the state budget and 
development plan and in the broader economic legislation, Gorbachev told the 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"We must convince our people why they are necessary and show them what 
consequences they will have in the near future, and what we shall face if these 
decisions are not made," he said.

ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN WARNED BY GORBACHEV TO END THEIR QUARREL

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday gave the two southern Soviet republics 
of Armenia and Azerbaijan two days to stop their quarreling, to end 
Azerbaijan's blockade of Armenia and to agree to talks to settle their feud 
over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, the 
central government will have to intervene. He said the situation in the region 
is of "the greatest concern" to the country. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by a dispute that has cost more than 100 lives and thrown into doubt 
the Communist Party's ability to rule, Gorbachev made it clear that his 
patience -- and that of the entire Soviet leadership -- has run out. 
</P>
<P>
"If the situation does not stabilize, the Soviet government with republican 
authorities must, I think, make concrete proposals to untie that knot," he told 
the Supreme Soviet at the opening of its autumn session. "We shall wait and see 
a day or two, but let the government be prepared, if the need arises, to make 
its proposals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refrained From Using Troops 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev did not disclose what action the government might take. Until now, it 
has refrained from using troops to avoid bloodshed. But clearly, he sees the 
situation as a test of political will and a challenge to the party's new policy 
on ethnic relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that our society understands that intolerance and force are 
not methods for solving problems," Gorbachev said. "One can, on the contrary, 
only move away from the solution of a problem and complicate it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the conditions of a democratic state under the rule of law that we are 
striving for, there cannot and must not be any method of political action 
except reliance on law and the desire to resolve any problems first of all 
through consensus." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a series of government measures, including direct rule of 
Nagorno-Karabakh by Moscow, the 20-month dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
has worsened, Gorbachev said, and now threatens the stability of the country as 
a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia has been under a nearly total economic blockade by Azerbaijan for three 
weeks. Azerbaijan has halted rail and road traffic to and from the neighboring 
republic to support its claim to Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia normally receives 
about 85% of its supplies through Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widespread Shortages 
</P>
<P>
Food and fuel are both in short supply now in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, 
and in many of the republic's larger towns. Fresh produce is available from the 
countryside, but sugar, salt, cheese and pasta have disappeared, according to 
Armenian journalists, and traffic is limited to emergency vehicles. Most 
factories have stopped working because of shortages of raw materials and 
energy. They said that reconstruction in the areas devastated by last 
December's earthquake that killed 25,000 has come to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
The blockade is unprecedented in Soviet history, and the Armenian Parliament 
appealed to the central government last week to intervene in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani Parliament responded by passing a law declaring that its 
present territory is indivisible, underscoring its determination to retain 
Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of Armenian Christians in Muslim Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Past efforts by Moscow to settle this quarrel -- Armenia wants to annex 
Nagorno-Karabakh -- have failed. The region, under effective martial law, is 
ringed by elite troops, supplied by air and administered by a representative of 
the central government with plenipotentiary powers. 
</P>
<P>
Afraid of bloodshed and an even sharper conflict, the government has refrained 
from ordering troops to break the blockade, which was established by the 
militant new Azerbaijan Popular Front on all the railways and roads leading to 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The blockade is "shameful for the Communist Party, shameful for the country," 
an Armenian deputy, Sergei Ambartsumyan, rector of Yerevan State University, 
told the legislature. "I believe our (national) Parliament must give guarantees 
against occurrences like this anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
A woman deputy from Azerbaijan said that both sides are probably to blame for 
the prolonged dispute. She urged reconciliation. An Armenian deputy replied 
that who is at fault may not be clear, but that only his republic is under 
blockade and that it must be lifted if there is to be progress on the broader 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the country's ever-deepening ethnic crisis, Gorbachev said the 
situation has worsened since the Supreme Soviet concluded its summer session in 
late July. Last week's discussion of ethnic questions at a special meeting of 
the party's policy-making Central Committee, and the adoption of a new party 
platform on the matter, has made no apparent difference, he said, so the 
nation's political will and his reform policies are now being tested. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in Armenia and Azerbaijan as "extremely tense," 
especially in Nagorno-Karabakh, Gorbachev said repeated efforts have not "eased 
the tight knot of problems," especially the blockade. But he reported that 
freight trains are starting to run again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
System Based on Law 
</P>
<P>
The overriding concern, however, is the establishment of a political system 
based on law and the conciliation of differences, he said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"The actual strengthing of legality is assuming increasing importance. No law, 
even the best, will be worth anything if it remains only on paper, if the state 
fails to ensure its implementation, if citizens do not comply with it 
conscientiously." 
</P>
<P>
Armenians had appealed earlier this month to the United Nations to send 
peacekeeping troops to Nagorno-Karabakh, asserting that the Kremlin has failed 
to protect them from Azerbaijani attacks despite the presence there of more 
than 4,000 troops from the Soviet Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"For long months now, this tiny Christian region . . . has been under the 
harshest of blockades," a council representing the Armenian majority in 
Nagorno-Karabakh said. "Regular killings and actions of violence are being 
perpetrated against it, and now there is talk of deporting the native 
population. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We now appeal to you to do everything possible for the security of the 
Armenian population of Karabakh, including even the dispatch of a contingent of 
U.N. soldiers should this become necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Although government officials said in Moscow that a way around the blockade has 
been found through neighboring Georgia, local authorities said Monday that 
virtually nothing has arrived by this route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newsprint Allowed In 
</P>
<P>
"During the last 24 hours, only trains with construction materials and 
newsprint were allowed into Armenia," the Azerbaijan Popular Front said in a 
statement received from Baku. "The rest of the freight is not being let 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh was described by the official news agency Tass as very tense, 
with supply convoys still being attacked by Azerbaijanis. One soldier was 
seriously wounded in an attack in the regional capital of Stepanakert, 
according to Tass. 
</P>
<P>
"Troops are guarding wells and oil storage plants, providing for the delivery 
of food and mail, and unloading helicopters and accompanying convoys with food 
to Armenian and Azerbaijani settlements," Tass reported from Nagorno-Karabakh.

The Arab League's peace envoy to Lebanon narrowly escaped shelling that hit his 
hotel in a village near Beirut on Monday in the first serious breach of a 
two-day cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian gunners fired more than 80 shells into Christian-controlled areas about 
10 miles northeast of Beirut, security sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Arab League peace negotiator Lakhdar Ibrahimi was awakened by the shell blasts 
that shook his hotel room in the village of Beit Meri and immediately contacted 
officials to stop the firing, the sources reported. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said one shell smashed through the wall of the hotel where he was 
staying, breaking windows and spraying shrapnel into the walls. 
</P>

The seaside highway into Christian East Beirut was jammed Monday with cars and 
buses -- tents and bedding piled high on their roofs -- bringing back refugees 
from the relative safety of remote Christian villages.

EX-AIDE TOOK CAMPAIGN FUNDS, DYSON SAYS

Rep. Roy Dyson (D-Md.) said Monday that he has made "mistakes in judgment" 
while in office and that his former top aide who committed suicide had 
improperly pocketed campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson also said he was returning $18,000 in campaign contributions made by 
officials connected to Unisys Corp., one of several defense contractors under 
investigation for suspected violations of contract procurement regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said his former top aide and campaign manager, Tom Pappas, improperly 
pocketed nearly $7,300 in campaign funds. Pappas wrote $7,275 in checks to 
other Dyson staff members and told them to give him the cash, Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in judgment because Tom 
Pappas was my campaign manager," Dyson said. "I was not aware . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Pappas committed suicide in May, 1988, by jumping from a New York hotel after 
newspaper reports that were highly critical of his management of Dyson's 
congressional office.

RED TAPE SLOWING AID FOR HURRICANE AREA

Frustrated that desperately needed generators were sitting at an Army base 
three hours away while 75,000 residents in Charleston were without power, Sen. 
Ernest F. Hollings called the White House shortly before midnight on Sunday to 
demand more speedy help for South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu promised to cut through the red tape, 
and late Monday the Democratic senator's aides were optimistic that the 
equipment would soon reach the suffering historic port town. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just incredibly difficult and time consuming to get anything done," said 
Laura Morris, a Hollings aide. "It has taken us 48 hours just to get the 
authorization to move the generators. Things are incredibly slow." 
</P>
<P>
Four days after Hurricane Hugo moved across the Caribbean and plowed into 
Charleston, efforts to aid the tens of thousands of victims are still being 
hampered by poor communications and bureaucratic bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
Phone lines were still down in many places, and, where they were working, it 
took hours to get through. But officials were encouraged by a rush of help from 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers from Montana and Washington, electrical crews from New York, a 
firefighting crew and 40 traffic lights from Norfolk, Va., and light trucks 
from Babylon, N.Y., poured into the city as part of the mix of military and 
civil disaster workers helping in the aftermath of what the Red Cross called 
"one of the costliest storms in . . . relief history." 
</P>
<P>
The Marines also pitched in. Lt. Gen. E. T. Cook Jr., commander of the Atlantic 
Fleet Marine Forces, arrived in Charleston Monday. Marine engineers and units 
with electric-generating and water filtration equipment were already in the 
field. Cook said his men would also aid in search and rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Offers of help are pouring in," Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said. 
"They are coming in from all over. Now, the problem is organizing the 
donations, the contributions and personnel." 
</P>
<P>
But Riley said that, for many victims, basic needs are hard to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We have situations like 500 people in a housing project huddling in the rain 
with nothing left but the shirts or dresses they had on their backs when the 
hurricane hit," he said. "We don't have enough supplies and we need help." 
</P>
<P>
"We need heavy equipment and manpower desperately so we can push away trees," 
said Linda Lombard, Charleston County's top elected official. "We need big 
ticket items. We're not talking about rebuilding, we're talking about getting 
in and helping people." 
</P>
<P>
A 225-person team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency began accepting 
applications from residents for grants, low-cost loans and special unemployment 
benefits. But food and shelter still took up most of the agency's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our programs is providing temporary housing," said a 
despondent-sounding Clem Shamus, surveying splintered houses and storm-tossed 
debris. "There isn't any around to speak of." 
</P>
<P>
The entire regional Red Cross network of disaster trucks has been mobilized to 
transport medical supplies, food and clothing to Charleston and the surrounding 
areas. More than 200 workers from outside of the area also were sent in. The 
Red Cross sheltered about 13,000 people Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Damaged airports and clogged harbors complicated the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Brice Kenny, a Coast Guard spokesman in Charleston, said the Coast Guard has 
been working around the clock "exercising every mission short of ice-breaking." 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, the Caribbean islands hit by the storm are still suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is flying disaster relief supplies to the Caribbean daily. 
Deliveries have included 106 portable generators to Puerto Rico and seven to 
St. Croix. The Air Force has even delivered portable airport control towers to 
Puerto Rico and St. Croix. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 tons of Red Cross supplies and 30 tons of medical supplies have been 
delivered to the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has sent six ships to the Caribbean, with more en route, loaded with 
telephone poles and generators. Private aid includes a Virginia firm's offer to 
ship 20,000 gallons of bottled water to Puerto Rico.

PANEL KILLS PLAN TO BAN JUNK MAIL SENT BY CONGRESS

A House-Senate conference committee voted Monday to spend at least $83 million 
on mail to constituents next year, even though both the House and Senate 
favored cutting the perk and using the savings for pregnant women addicted to 
crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The conference committee vote retaining mass mailings came just two hours after 
the House voted 245 to 137 to instruct House negotiators to cut the 
congressional perk. The House vote was non-binding. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Senate voted 83 to 8 to stop the newsletters and spend 
the savings on reducing the number of babies born addicted to crack. Proponents 
on the House side said it was time for them to make a contribution to the fight 
against narcotics by eliminating mass mailings of newsletters and town meeting 
notices that traditionally have been sent to every postal patron in a 
congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opponents' Argument 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, mostly Democrats, argued that the Senate should not be allowed to 
decide how the House allocates funds for postage or whether congressional 
newsletters are essential to communicating with constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), sponsor of the Senate provision that sailed 
through, hailed the House action as a victory for his campaign against Capitol 
Hill junk mail. But he correctly predicted it would not survive a conference 
committee vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be surprised if the use of tax funds for these thinly veiled campaign 
ads is too strong an addiction to overcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), the chief House negotiator in the conference, 
made plain his cool attitude toward the instructions approved by his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure demagoguery but it's great politics," Fazio told reporters. "Pete 
Wilson's in his element."

WITH NO PENNANT SINCE '45, CUBS SURPRISE EVEN THEMSELVES

<P>
On Fan Appreciation Sunday, a capacity crowd at Wrigley Field is on its feet, 
showering thunderous appreciation on the Chicago Cubs, who have been recalled 
from the clubhouse after their final home game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs are the toast of the city and about to toast, it appears, with the 
real thing. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet taste of champagne might soon relieve some bitter memories, among 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A complacency laced disintegration from National League East champion in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 9-23 spring that led to expressions of self-doubt and predictions that 
the 1989 Cubs would finish fifth or sixth in the East, losing 100 games, 
perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
How to relate now to the improbable and accelerated transformation from lovable 
loser to wacky winner on the verge of claiming a division title? 
</P>
<P>
Holy cow! One way is to seek out Harry Caray, the unabashedly parochial 
broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Dodgers of 1988," Caray said. "Everything we do is right." 
</P>
<P>
A distant memory, the Dodgers' unexpected pennant and World Series victory were 
what? Part fluke? Part celestial intervention? Part Orel, Kirk and a little 
talent? 
</P>
<P>
So, too, with the Cubs, and no one here -- Bleacher Bums excepted -- is trying 
to make more of this than it is. 
</P>
<P>
They cringe at mention of a fluke and contest it some, saying they have become 
a better team than the critics are yet willing to acknowledge, but they also 
recognize the reality of their accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Said General Manager Jim Frey: "If someone had said to me in March that we 
would have a four-game lead with a week to go, I would have probably said, 
'Wouldn't that be some miracle?' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Manager Don Zimmer: "If I had predicted we would be in this position, 
people would have said I'd lost my mind, and they would have been right. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you now that when we left Arizona and went to Minnesota to play a 
couple exhibitions before the season started, Jimmy and I sat down and tried to 
be realistic and we felt that if we could win 81 games, if we could play .500 
and improve on last year, we'd have had a good year." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs were 77-85 last year and 76-85, 70-90 and 77-84 in the three previous 
seasons. Now this unlikely mix of rookies, role players and veterans seems 
likely to win more than 90 games as well as the title in a division that 
includes a pair of consistent winners, the New York Mets and St. Louis 
Cardinals, in addition to the talented Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Now, too, the 58-year-old manager, fired in San Diego, Texas and Boston, seems 
destined to supplant Tom Lasorda as the National League's manager of the year 
and dieter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer has lost 30 pounds using a national reduction system that he now 
endorses, as he does a fried-chicken chain, which would seem an incompatible 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
But who would dispute his or his team's chemistry in this year of the Cubs, 
saluted on a hot-selling T-shirt as "The Boys of Zimmer." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest thing that's happened in my career," Zimmer said of the 
team's success. "If people want to say it's a fluke, fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't resent it when they said we'd finish fifth or sixth and lose a 
hundred games. It's all just opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"We were awful in spring training, but this isn't the same team that opened the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frey: "We're not necessarily the greatest team on paper, but sometimes 
talent comes together and does the job. Things happen you can't account for. 
People who were legitimate question marks have done a lot of good things for 
us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Dodgers last year. They weren't supposed to beat the Giants, 
weren't supposed to beat the Mets, weren't supposed to beat the A's. Sometimes 
the best teams don't win." 
</P>
<P>
So how are the Cubs doing it, going from 24 out last year to the brink of 
another battle with the demons of their past? 
</P>
<P>
How have the Cubs -- with one title in the 20 years of division play and no 
pennant since 1945 -- mounted this challenge to the Dodgers' 1988 record for 
overachievement? 
</P>
<P>
"You would have to write a novel to mention all the things that have been 
important to this club," Rick Sutcliffe, the veteran pitcher, said. "There were 
so many things that made us believe. I mean, every time we needed a lift, we 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
They got it in the trade for bullpen closer Mitch Williams; the arrival of 
rookie outfielders Jerome Walton and Dwight Smith; the continued maturation of 
first baseman Mark Grace, shortstop Shawon Dunston and pitcher Greg Maddux; the 
ongoing brilliance of second baseman Ryne Sandberg; the quiet leadership of 
Andre Dawson; the 17 victories of 30-year-old Mike Bielecki, who had never won 
more than six games in a major league season, and the contributions of the 
largest cast of role players east of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
They got it, as well, from Zimmer's unpredictable strategy and the game plan 
with which Frey has attempted to improve the quality and quantity of the 
pitching while transforming a sour, overpaid team of slow-footed sluggers into 
a young and hungry team that has the speed and defense necessary to win on the 
road, as well as in the friendly confines of Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs wound up 48-33 at home and are 41-35 on the road. They are 62-51 on 
grass and 26-17 on artificial surfaces. Their eight regular starters, including 
three rookies, total only 32 years of major league experience, with 20 of that 
belonging to Dawson and Sandberg. Big names and no names dot the roster. Or as 
third base coach Chuck Cottier said while watching the Cubs do stretching 
exercises the other day: "Tell me, do you recognize half those guys?" 
</P>
<P>
Frey does, of course. And so would his predecessor, Dallas Green. It was 
Green's scouting department that drafted Walton and Smith, who are expected to 
be 1-2 in rookie-of-the-year balloting, as well as Maddux, Grace, Dunston and 
the three catchers: Damon Berryhill, Joe Giraldi and Rick Wrona. It was also 
Green who traded for Sandberg, Sutcliffe and Sanderson, and signed free agents 
Dawson and Les Lancaster, who has become a valuable setup man for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Is this Green's team, or Frey's? Or does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
It does to Zimmer, who has been Frey's pal since they were classmates growing 
up in Cincinnati and who was the third base coach for then-manager Frey when 
the Cubs won in '84 and when they were both fired by Green in June of '86. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer's eyes bulged to the size of the tobacco chaw in his right cheek as he 
spat: "This team wouldn't be anywhere near where it is if it wasn't for Jim 
Frey's trades. I'm tired of hearing Dallas Green this and Dallas Green that." 
</P>
<P>
Green paid a heavy financial price in building the surprising winner of 1984. 
Injuries to a millionaire pitching staff prevented a 1985 repeat, then desire 
also came up disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The fired Frey, a victim of the high-salaried complacency, returned as a 
broadcaster in 1987, then was asked to replace Green in the front office in 
November, one aspect being the parent Tribune Company's clear distaste for the 
Cubs' financial direction. 
</P>
<P>
Frey hired Zimmer and set out to purge payroll and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came back as a broadcaster and traveled with the club in '87, I saw too 
many things I didn't like and heard too many things I didn't like," Frey said. 
"And when I got this job I knew I had to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Frey said there were several holdovers from the 1984 team who had become 
negative influences. He cited a disturbing combination of too many high 
salaries and too much age, individualism and bickering. 
</P>
<P>
Soon traded were Lee Smith, Keith Moreland, Leon Durham and Jody Davis. Only 
Sutcliffe, Sandberg and Scott Sanderson remain from the '84 team. A payroll of 
about $20 million has been cut in half. Only Sutcliffe, Sandberg and Dawson are 
in the millionaire class. Rookies Walton and Smith make the $68,000 minimum. 
The comparatively modest salaries of pivotal role players such as Domingo Ramos 
at $130,000, Lloyd McClendon at $91,000, and Luis Salazar at $400,000 
characterize the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple years here, we were dealing with bad attitude and bad 
ability," Sutcliffe said. "Now we've got guys who were making $1,500 a month or 
less in the minors and are thrilled to be here making $70,000." 
</P>
<P>
The turnover, Frey said, had more to do with that bad attitude than budget 
edict, but he acknowledged that there is inherent motivation when players are 
fighting for a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Take that motivation away and some guys can't get their motor running except 
when they're in their option year," Frey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the players from the '84 team had become too comfortable. Now we've 
got guys with the same desire those players (from the '84 team) had five years 
earlier. I don't know much about chemistry, but I've liked what I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
All of that improved desire would have been wasted, however, if the Cubs hadn't 
been able to hold a lead. They blew 27 save opportunities last year when they 
were 11th in a 12-team league with 29 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Williams alone has 35, two shy of Bruce Sutter's single-season club record. And 
the Cubs have set a club record with a league-high 52 saves, contributing to a 
50-35 record in games decided by one or two runs and a 10-5 record in extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was acquired from the Texas Rangers in a nine-player December trade in 
which the Cubs gave up a proven hitter, Rafael Palmeiro, and were roundly 
criticized for it, even by Dawson, who later retracted his opinion that the 
Cubs should have traded Grace instead of Palmeiro. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is general agreement that Williams' acquisition has proved to be the 
most important factor in the Cubs' unexpected success. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wrote that Texas got the best of it because we gave up the 
next Lou Gehrig and Williams hadn't established himself," Frey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Palmeiro is definitely a good hitter, but we took a chance on a young, strong 
kid who had 18 saves last year and seemed certain to get better, and if I had 
to pinpoint one thing that really gave the club a sense of confidence it was 
Mitch's early success." 
</P>
<P>
Only 24, Williams tends to be unpredictable on and off the field. The Wrigley 
organist initially played "Wild Thing" when he came in from the bullpen, but 
pitching coach Dick Pole felt it underscored his control problems. Now the 
organist plays "Thriller." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Williams' save of a 5-4 victory over Philadelphia in the season 
opener set a tone. He gave up three hits, loading the bases in the ninth 
inning, then struck out Mike Schmidt, Chris James and Mark Ryal. 
</P>
<P>
"Right away we had the feeling that this year could be a little different," 
Sutcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
There was more, some of it born of desperation, Frey acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, for instance, was asked to make the jump from double A and has improved 
the center-field defense while adding speed and an unexpectedly consistent bat 
to the leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the equally fleet left fielder who is something of a defensive 
liability, was sent to triple A after a disappointing spring, was recalled in 
May and is batting .322 as the No. 3 hitter, sandwiched between Walton-Sandberg 
and Dawson-Grace. 
</P>
<P>
If the Cubs caught lightning with Walton and Smith, how much can the bottle 
hold? They are still learning. 
</P>
<P>
Among the examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- McClendon, acquired in a December trade with Cincinnati, got off a plane 
from Iowa when Grace was put on the disabled list in June, hit a three-run 
homer in his first at-bat an hour or so later and remains in the high .280s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lancaster, recalled early in the second half, did not give up a run for 30 
2/3 innings and has a 1.41 earned-run average through 40 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salazar, acquired Aug. 30 in a five-player trade with the San Diego Padres, 
was hitting a mere .350 for the Cubs, beefing up production at third base, 
weak-hitting Vance Law having been benched. 
</P>
<P>
It was Salazar, in fact, who supplied two of the season's biggest hits. 
</P>
<P>
They came on Sept. 9, the day after the Cardinals had delivered a shocker, 
overcoming a 7-1 lead and cutting Chicago's first-place lead to 1 1/2 games to 
one-half. 
</P>
<P>
With the Cubs' trailing the Cardinals, 2-1, Salazar singled off Dan 
Quisenberry, tying it in the eighth. Then he singled off Ken Dayley to win it 
in the 10th. The Cardinals lost six in a row and haven't been closer than 1 1/2 
since. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about your 24-man efforts," said Steve Wilson, the Cubs' rookie pitcher. 
"I think every player here feels he's contributed." 
</P>
<P>
Fluke? Perhaps. But consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cubs have consistently met the challenge, going 27-22 against the Mets, 
Expos and Cardinals, including 15-5 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They have displayed resilience and depth, overcoming the loss of their 
entire outfield in May, the absence of Grace for three weeks in June and a torn 
rotator cuff that shelved Berryhill for the season in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The offense, with Walton, Smith and a third rookie behind the plate, ranks 
first in the league in team batting and second in runs. Only three teams have 
made fewer errors. And the pitching staff, despite recent ineffectiveness by 
Sutcliffe compounding the absence of reliable fourth and fifth starters, has an 
ERA of 3.47, the league's sixth best. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, as well, that both Whitey Herzog and Buck Rodgers, managers of the 
Cardinals and Expos, respectively, recently said the Cubs have the league's 
best everyday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there's Zimmer's hot hand, as illustrated by his pinch-hitters' .318 
average, the 11 runs scored on squeeze bunts, the seven consecutive runners 
thrown out on pitchouts called from the dugout, and the four-game winning 
streak that ended in Montreal Monday, a streak born, perhaps, of a clubhouse 
meeting in which Zimmer blistered the pitchers for losing aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Like Zim himself says, he can call the plays, but it's up to the players to 
put the bat on the ball or make the throw," Sutcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's been amazing to watch kids with limited experience get it done in 
front of capacity crowds as if this was nothing more than Peoria." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frey: "Zim will try anything at any time, and the players seem to have 
responded to it. They seem to be having fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
It can be said, in fact, that a funny thing happened to the Cubs on their way 
to the frustration again predicted for them. 
</P>

A ROUGH START FOR AIKMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
IRVING, Texas 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after quarterback Troy Aikman had been pulled from the football game 
early in the fourth quarter Sunday, Babe Laufenberg walked over to the Cowboys 
rookie and whispered a few words of consolation. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Troy, you don't ever pull the other 10 people out, you pull out 
the quarterback,' " said Laufenberg, the vagabond backup who is No. 3 here now 
and didn't even put on a uniform Sunday against one of his former teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you have a car with a flat tire, and you change tires and you 
roll on down the road. It ain't that easy in football. Troy knows that. When 
you play the position, you accept it. If things are going badly, you're the guy 
who has to go." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman insisted he had no problems with Coach Jimmy Johnson's decision to give 
backup Steve Walsh some work, particularly after Aikman managed only six 
completions in 21 attempts for 83 yards, was intercepted twice, sacked four 
times and harassed as long as he played in a 30-7 loss to the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problems with that," Aikman said of the switch to Walsh. "Any time 
the offense is struggling, you make a change. ... I understand the nature of 
pro football. We weren't moving the football. I understood when he made me the 
starter there would be days like this. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you don't put points on the board, as a quarterback you feel like 
it's your responsibility. ... But there's a lot of football left this season. 
We have to work harder. Everybody knew it wasn't going to be easy, that we'd 
have some bad times before we got better." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, for the Cowboys, these are the worst of times. They are 0-3 for the 
first time since 1963, and they are reeling. It's also not going to get much 
better, with a home game next week against the undefeated Giants and the 49ers 
arriving two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
They also must contend with a very unhappy football coach. Johnson was talking 
gloom and doomsday Sunday evening, starting off his postgame news conference by 
saying the obvious: "We're not a good football team right now. It's not a good 
feeling. We will not accept being a poor football team. We'll work and do 
whatever it takes. Anyone who is not willing to work, let me know. I feel sure 
they will work." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would try to avoid discussing Sunday's debacle, Johnson snapped: "I 
don't want these players to forget how awful they looked. We are not a good 
football team and they shouldn't fool themselves into thinking otherwise. ... 
They've got to realize they have to move up to a new level. We can't live with 
it. I certainly can't live with it. ... We have to work harder. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll spend more time on the field, more time in the meeting room, more time 
running after practice." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said Aikman would continue to be the starter and he did not hold 
him entirely responsible for an offense that managed only 10 first downs, 190 
yards and 3.2 yards per play. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, meanwhile, was simply grateful for the chance to play a bit. It was his 
first action of the regular season, and he has made it known he would prefer to 
be playing regularly elsewhere by the time the NFL's trading deadline comes on 
Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys have talked to a number of teams about Walsh, but also are asking a 
steep price, a No. 1 pick and at least two players who can come in and play 
right away. Johnson has said he does not want to trade Walsh, who played for 
him at the University of Miami, and the backup said Sunday, "I don't expect 
them to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I want to say about the whole thing: I never demanded to be traded. 
But I do feel with the trading deadline coming up, it's an opportunity, an 
option the Cowboys have." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he was delighted to get a little playing time, even with his team 
hopelessly out of the game by the time he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was done more to give me some experience. I'm grateful for that and 
I felt really good about some of the things I did, and I could have done some 
other things better. ... When you get out there, everybody is more intense and 
things happen quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"But Troy's the number one quarterback, and I don't really expect" to be 
challenging for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys also didn't expect to score their only points on yet another 
bizarre play yielded by the Redskins. It came midway through the first quarter, 
when quarterback Mark Rypien was hit from the blind side by free safety Ray 
Horton and fumbled. The ball was picked up by defensive end Jim Jeffcoat and 
returned 77 yards for a touchdown and a 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an all-out blitz on, and we had good coverage," Horton said. "I made 
the hit and the ball popped loose." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeffcoat: "When I saw Ray Horton coming from the back side, I was going to 
shed my tackle because I thought Rypien was going to scramble my way. When I 
shed him, Ray had just hit him and the ball came out. I just picked it up and 
ran. ... I knew it was there. Any time I get an open field, I'm going to 
score."

AN OLD WARRIOR; 
</P>
<P>
MCLARNIN, 81, RECALLS HARD DAYS OF BOXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They shared hard times, those tough, rock-hard young men of America's 
Depression, and they fought one another savagely. 
</P>
<P>
Their names alone evoke a richness of the American melting pot and the American 
dream: Canzoneri, Ross, McLarnin, Petrolle, Apostoli, Zivic . . . and maybe the 
greatest of them all, Henry Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
They're nearly all gone now, the great welterweights and middleweights of the 
Depression era. Tony Canzoneri, Barney Ross, Billy Petrolle, Fred Apostoli, 
Fritzie Zivic and Armstrong . . . all gone. 
</P>
<P>
Still with us, however, is Jimmy McLarnin, two-time welterweight champion, who 
at 81, is happy, wealthy and wise. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in the same house on a quiet, leafy Glendale street the last 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy McLarnin is older than the memories of practically everyone who attends 
boxing shows in Southern California today. He fought in Los Angeles before 
there was an Olympic Auditorium. Calvin Coolidge was President when McLarnin 
was a hungry, 16-year-old making his debut at Vernon Arena in September, 1924. 
</P>
<P>
Today, his only concessions to age are arthritic hands, and a nearly empty 
house. His wife of 52 years, Lillian, died last year. His four children live in 
the northwest and British Columbia, and Jimmy talks of selling the old Glendale 
house and moving closer to his children. "I'm in good health; I'm thankful for 
that," he said the other day. "I watch my diet. I'm at 150 pounds now, three 
pounds over my fighting weight. And I walk two to three miles every day." 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin talked about the old days, about a special bond the young battlers of 
the 1930s America shared. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the hundreds of fighters I came in contact with in my life, I can say I 
can't think of a one who I didn't like and who didn't turn out to be at least a 
halfway decent human being," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Boxing is a whipping boy for a lot of people, but look at all the guys who 
made something of themselves with boxing. Look at Jack Dempsey. He was a bum, a 
hobo. And he became a champion, and a pretty decent human being. 
</P>
<P>
"The fighters in those days . . . we all came up hungry together. None of us 
had it easy coming up. Our fathers worked like dogs. In a way, we loved each 
other. I mean, you'd try to beat a guy's brains out in the ring, but before and 
after a fight, I admired all the guys I fought. They'd gone through everything 
I had to go through." 
</P>
<P>
The old fighter showed a visitor his trophy room. He leafed through a stack of 
old photographs. He pulled out a faded photo of a group of about 15 young boys, 
all staring intently into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in this picture," he said. "It's a group of newsboys in Vancouver, when I 
was a little kid. Can you find me?" 
</P>
<P>
It was easy. Last one on the right, second row. There was an unmistakable 
fierceness to the little lean face. The glare from his stare leaped out, from 
70-odd years ago. 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin laughed, and showed some old photos from his golf days at Lakeside 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Bing Crosby. That's Pat O'Brien. Here I am with Spencer Tracy. . . . I 
got my handicap down to three at one point. I was livin' pretty good in those 
days, after I retired from fighting, in 1936." 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin says he doesn't pay much attention to the boxing scene today. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many champions, I can't keep track of what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James Archibald McLarnin turned pro in Vancouver when he was 15 and had 77 
bouts in 13 years. Within 16 months in 1933 and 1934, he won and lost the 
welterweight championship twice. 
</P>
<P>
At Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, he knocked out Raffaele Capabianca Giordano -- 
known then as Young Corbett III -- of Fresno, winning the title the first time. 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin lost the championship a year later to Barney Ross, won it back in the 
rematch and lost it again in the rubber match. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936, he lost and won decisions with Canzoneri, won a decision over Lou 
Ambers, and retired. 
</P>
<P>
The list of McLarnin's opponents reads like a page from boxing's Who's Who. He 
fought 'em all, as they say. But the old champion was stumped when asked to 
single out the toughest man he had fought. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, so many great fighters," he said. "I could never say one guy was better 
than the others. But I will say that Billy Petrolle hit me as hard as anyone 
ever did. He was a tough, tough guy. He hit me so hard in the second round of 
my fight (in 1930) with him that afterward I couldn't remember a thing from 
Rounds 2 through 7." 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin lost a decision to Petrolle in 1930, then defeated him twice in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
"And Louis (Kid) Kaplan -- oh, could he hit. He knocked me down three times in 
1927 and broke my jaw. After the fight (won by McLarnin on a knockout), I 
remember my teeth didn't fit together the same, but I didn't think much about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years later, a dentist asked me: 'How did you break your jaw?' Kaplan 
had broken my jaw and I'd never known it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the meanest guy I ever fought was Bud Taylor. He was a vicious . . . , 
really tough. I fought him in 1925, when I was just a kid and had no business 
in there with him. I remember the first time I fought him, in Vernon, it was my 
biggest payday by far at the time, $1,500. He beat me twice and I won one on a 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
"Barney Ross was a really tough opponent. He was a great boxer and had a great 
chin. I can remember getting him right on the chin with some of the best shots 
I ever hit anyone with and he didn't even blink. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest fighter of my era, but a guy I never fought, was Harry Greb. I 
fought on an undercard of his in Oakland, in 1924. He was blind in one eye, and 
fought you kind of twisted sideways, so he could see you. In his prime, he 
might have been the best there ever was. He was a middleweight and heavyweights 
wanted no part of him." 
</P>
<P>
In talking of the old days, McLarnin frequently refers to the hard work it took 
to be a world-class fighter. It was a work ethic acquired from a hard-working 
father, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was a beautiful man," he said. "He was as hard-working and as 
talented a man as I ever knew. My father could do anything. He never had a lot 
of money, but he raised six sons and six daughters and showed all of us what 
hard work is." 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin was born in Inchacore, Ireland, and was 3 when his father booked 
third-class passage to Canada in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
"We went first to Saskatchewan, where my father got a section of land and 
raised wheat for 15 cents a bushel," McLarnin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We later went to Vancouver. My father was in the lumber business, the 
furniture business and he was a butcher. He could even fix shoes." 
</P>
<P>
In his mid-teens, McLarnin fell under the influence of a popular Vancouver 
boxing instructor, Charles (Pop) Foster, and thus began a relationship that 
endured for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin has a framed portrait of Foster on the wall of his den. When Foster 
died in 1956, he left $200,000 to McLarnin. 
</P>
<P>
"Pop really cared about me, and he brought me along very carefully," he said. 
"No fighter ever had a better manager than I did. I was a natural right-hander 
and he never had to help me with the right. But he spent two years with me 
getting my left jab ready before I turned pro." 
</P>
<P>
One of Foster's tips earned McLarnin his welterweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Young Corbett was a great fighter, but he made one mistake -- he took me for a 
pigeon," McLarnin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Corbett was a defensive fighter, but Pop had noticed he had a habit of leaning 
forward slightly just before he threw his right hand. So we planned to let him 
do that a few times early in the fight, sucker him in, then try to catch him 
with a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's exactly the way it happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 29, 1933. New, three-bedroom homes in West L.A. were going for $3,200. A 
new Ford V-8 cost $490. It cost 25 cents to see "King Kong" at the RKO 
Hillstreet. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 50,000 saw Babe Ruth hit three home runs against the Chicago White 
Sox at Yankee Stadium the day before, and 15,000 saw Jimmy McLarnin win the 
welterweight championship at Los Angeles' Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
The old champion is on his feet now, dancing softly across the carpet. He 
flicks out left jabs, demonstrating the set-up punches for that knockout. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it once (he leans forward), I watched him carefully -- then I let him 
do it again," McLarnin said, from his fighting stance. 
</P>
<P>
"And when he did it the third time -- Bing! (he throws a hard, quick left hook) 
I got him. A perfect punch, a left hook right on the chin. He went down flat, 
got up but could hardly stand. I knocked him into the ropes, and the referee 
stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin smiled broadly at the memory, which has always been a sweet one for 
him because his 71-year-old father, Samuel McLarnin, was at ringside that night 
in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
But then McLarnin grew frustrated at not being able to remember the referee 
(George Blake) who awarded him the title that night. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the fight, The Times started the story -- "McLarnin Is Ring King" 
-- on Page 1, and described near-riotous conditions when deliriously happy 
McLarnin fans tried to storm the ring to reach their new champion. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six years later, both challenger and champion from that night are still 
alive. Corbett is 84, suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and lives in a rest 
home near Fresno. His wife attributes his illness to head injuries suffered in 
an auto accident in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
McLarnin earned between $700,000 and $800,000 in Depression dollars in his 
fighting days. His biggest purse was $60,000 for the final fight against Ross. 
He earned $50,000 in 1929 for beating Sammy Mandell in Chicago. During the 
1930s, he said, he never earned less than $20,000 for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
And earn it he did, he said, proudly. Always, the work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a dollar for my first fight and $25,000 for my last one, and in between 
there was a lot of tough, hard work," he said.

BRUINS MIGHT NOT BE IN RUINS; 
</P>
<P>
DONAHUE IS ENCOURAGED DESPITE LOSS TO MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA, ranked sixth before its opening game, is 1-2 after its third, out of the 
top 25 and out of the race for the national championship before the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Why no long faces in Westwood? 
</P>
<P>
A strong showing against Michigan -- albeit in a 24-23 loss -- has given new 
hope to the Bruins, who seemed on the verge of despair only a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a team Saturday night," Coach Terry Donahue said Monday. "I thought we 
responded, acted, looked (and) behaved like a team. Up until Saturday night, I 
don't think we had gotten that accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just tragic that we came up one point short." 
</P>
<P>
 Tragic? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. 
</P>
<P>
Two losses have taken UCLA out of the running for the national title -- a goal 
that has eluded UCLA since 1954 -- but the Bruins showed against Michigan that 
they are capable of making another strong challenge for the Pacific 10 
Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, after a 24-6 thrashing by Tennessee, Donahue moaned that 
either Tennessee had been grossly mis-evaluated, "or this might be as poor a 
football team as I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
His fears weren't exactly alleviated in a 28-25 victory over lowly San Diego 
State in Week 2. 
</P>
<P>
But the last-second loss to Michigan left him encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we're pleased with the progress we made from one week to another," 
Donahue said. "We played with a great deal of enthusiasm and spirit. Our team 
came together as a group and played together as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that we will build from this point and continue the rest of the 
season at that level of intensity and (maintain the) interest and teamwork that 
we had Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do, I think we'll become a decent-looking team and be successful as the 
season goes along." 
</P>
<P>
The most notable transformation was made by the Bruin defense, which limited 
Michigan to 256 total yards, including only 174 before the Wolverines' last two 
possessions netted 82 yards, nine points and an improbable victory. 
</P>
<P>
In its first two games, UCLA gave up almost 200 yards a game on the ground and 
five yards per rushing attempt. Michigan, playing without four offensive 
starters, ran for 126 yards in 42 attempts, three yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defensive team looked a little different," Donahue said. "Why did it? Was 
it the changes we made? Maybe. Was it the fact we were interested in the game 
and wanted to play well and were a little bit nervous and scared? Probably. Was 
it because Michigan didn't have its first-string quarterback? Maybe." 
</P>
<P>
Three Bruin defenders started for the first time against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kelly, who missed most of training camp with a hamstring injury, replaced 
senior Jon Pryor at nose tackle; Meech Shaw replaced sophomore Stacy Argo at 
inside linebacker, and senior Randy Beverly, who broke a toe last month, 
replaced freshman Michael Williams, a walk-on, at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was especially pleased with the play of Kelly and Shaw. Kelly deflected 
a pass on Michigan's two-point conversion attempt with 1 minute 35 seconds left 
and Shaw, a 6-foot-2, 212-pound redshirt freshman from Ponca City, Okla., led 
the Bruins with 14 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"Jon Pryor has given us everything he has, but Brian Kelly's a bigger, more 
physical player," Donahue said of the 6-5 1/2, 270-pound sophomore, who is two 
inches taller and 20 pounds heavier than Pryor. "He shores up the middle a 
little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, said Donahue, "gives us a dimension of speed and natural linebacking 
instincts. He's a very natural linebacker who feels the ball and feels the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
"He's young and he went the wrong way one time and got his clock cleaned a few 
times, but he also made a lot of plays. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a speed guy. And one of the things we were lacking was speed." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue might not be through tinkering with the defense. "There may 
be a position or two where I'm not convinced that we're where we need to be or 
could be," he said, indicating that more changes in the starting lineup may be 
forthcoming. . . . UCLA opens its Pac-10 schedule at the Rose Bowl Saturday 
against California, which has lost 17 consecutive games against UCLA since 1971 
and is 4-34 against the Bruins since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with the UCLA running attack, which has produced only 2.9 yards a 
carry? "I don't think we're playing as well in the offensive line as we had 
hoped to play," Donahue said. "I think (tailbacks) Shawn Wills and Brian Brown 
should be averaging more (yards) per carry and I think there should be bigger 
and better holes. We should be running the ball more effectively." . . . Wills 
is averaging 4.2 yards a carry; Brown is averaging 3.1. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that Michigan used an illegal technique when it blocked Alfredo 
Velasco's conversion attempt after Bret Johnson's touchdown pass to Corwin 
Anthony gave the Bruins a 23-15 lead with 5:42 left. "You're not allowed to 
block below the waist on kicking plays and a Michigan player (dived at) our 
guard at the knees and took him out," Donahue said. "And then two players 
jumped and blocked the kick. The umpire didn't see it and didn't make the 
call." 
</P>
<P>
Unusual statistic: In UCLA's last two games, freshman tailback Kevin Williams 
has carried four times for no yards and three touchdowns. In his only 
non-scoring run, Williams lost three yards in a carry against San Diego State. 
. . . Linebacker Craig Davis, on Michigan's fourth-quarter onside kick, which 
took a kangaroo hop over the Bruins' front line of defense and was recovered by 
the Wolverines: "We would have had to have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in there to stop 
that."

The Kings put veteran Ron Duguay on the waiver list and assigned rookie goalie 
Robb Stauber to their American Hockey League affiliate at New Haven, Conn., 
along with forward Sylvain Couturier. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are anticipating that because of Duguay's salary -- reportedly about 
$450,000 -- he will clear waivers and can be assigned to New Haven or Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster had said that Stauber would probably start the season in 
New Haven, where he will get more playing time than if he were backing up Kelly 
Hrudey.

METS WILL NOT TRADE STRAWBERRY WHILE HIS VALUE IS AT A LOW POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY NOBLE, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly one year has passed since Darryl Strawberry said he wanted to move his 
show home to Los Angeles and the Dodgers, and no more than 15 seconds have 
passed since the last frustrated New York Mets follower declared trading 
Strawberry is essential if the team is to rebound from this unbecoming season. 
Neither an eventual move by Strawberry to the Dodgers via free agency, nor the 
trading of him by the Mets, would be a solution, and neither is going to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry was naive to think life as one of Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda's 
huggees would be substantially different from what he has experienced thus far 
in the major leagues. It might be different for Willie Randolph, but not for 
Strawberry. His every move and his every word would be recognized and examined 
as it has been here since 1983. Such is the relentless and unforgiving side of 
his celebrity. Strawberry would have to play baseball on another continent 
under an assumed name -- or in Seattle -- to be relatively inconspicuous. And 
if that were possible, his remarkable athletic ability would quickly 
distinguish him and focus attention on him all over again. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Mets recognize that moving Strawberry would be unwise, 
particularly after this, his first truly poor season. His trade value is 
diminished -- granted, only slightly, but still diminished. And even under 
favorable trade circumstances, which club possibly could offer the Mets equal 
value for a 27-year-old left-handed slugger who already has hit 214 
major-league home runs? Fred McGriff and Will Clark are the only players in the 
game who can provide the sort of lefthanded-hitting offense Strawberry 
provides, and neither is being pushed out of his town. Besides, dealing 
exclusively in potential, neither approaches Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Mets could try to deal Strawberry for a package of talent that might 
import a suitable replacement for Roger McDowell, a real center fielder and-or 
a full-time catcher, but the absence of Strawberry's left-handed power would 
destroy the balance of the batting order, to say nothing of reducing the team's 
public appeal. 
</P>
<P>
So he stays. Yes, we all know he could be better. So does he. But until this 
season, what he had provided was certainly acceptable. He is likely to provide 
more very acceptable seasons. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Mets and their followers may think they can't live with him. But 
they need only to look at the team's current position in the standings to 
recognize they can't live without him. He hasn't been Straw-some, as Lenny 
Dykstra used to call him, this season. As a consequence, the Mets rank behind 
two teams with personnel clearly inferior to their own. In a convoluted way, 
Strawberry's value never has been more obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The Bird Is the Word 
</P>
<P>
It has the sound of a sporting goods manufacturer or, perhaps, a new Japanese 
sports car. Instead, it is a means of identifying, with one word, the two 
former Mets now playing for the Blue Jays -- Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson. 
"We both got letters from someone in New York," Wilson said. "I think they said 
their little girl was disappointed that we were gone and when she got a new pet 
-- it was a bird -- she decided to call it 'Mazzookie.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tinkering With Chance 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent urges caution when people think of altering the game. 
"I think I'm wise enough to know," he said recently, "that if you don't 
understand all there is to know about something, you approach it with 
considerable care and very great skepticism in terms of any tinkering." 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola may be nearly as much an American institution as baseball. Vincent 
worked for Coke when the company executed the marketing mistake of the decade 
and removed traditional Coke -- now called "Classic Coke" -- from our 
supermarket shelves. "I was there," Vincent said candidly. "Non-voting, but 
there. It was a mistake. It was planned ... to make the change, but it wasn't 
planned to come out the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting mess reinforced the lesson Vincent had learned about tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
And that mess might never have occurred, Vincent said, if his predecessor as 
commissioner, A. Bartlett Giamatti, had been working at Coke. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart loved this," Vincent said, holding a can of Classic Coke, "but he loved 
it in bottles, those traditional 6 1/2-ounce bottles. He wouldn't drink from a 
can. I got him on the board. Bart and I went on the board of Coca-Cola 
Enterprises when it was started. I recommended him, and Coke put him on the 
board. This was the biggest bottling company in the world. They loved Bart. But 
he kept saying, 'I want it in a bottle. Those bottles are terrific.' 
</P>
<P>
"And when they came back with them, he was triumphant. He said it's something 
to do with the compression going up through the neck. I'd say, 'Bart, you're so 
full of baloney.' He used to keep Coke in his office. I drink from a can, 
because he was wrong. ... Bless his heart, he was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Before Giamatti became commissioner and Vincent joined baseball, they lunched 
with Mets vice presidents Joe McIlvaine and Al Harazin. "We sought their 
advice," Vincent said. "They said, 'Take care of the game. Be interested in 
what goes on on the field. We need people who care about the game.' And they 
urged us to attend games. That was never a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Some observations 
</P>
<P>
If the Baltimore Orioles lose this thing by one game, you think they might 
recall the game they lost to the Yankees in Baltimore on June 14 when the 
decisive hit, a double by Ken Phelps, was lost in the fog? ... If the Orioles 
were to play a team other than the Blue Jays next weekend, there would be a 
chance that the division championship could be clinched by a team being swept. 
Wouldn't that be appropriate for the American League East, the Sub-Division? 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to experience Wrigley Field and the SkyDome in a fortnight and 
justify in your mind that the primary purpose of each arena is baseball. They 
are no more alike than buttons and ice cream. You get the feeling three 
Wrigleys and a Metrodome might fit inside the Blue Jays' new home. If the 
SkyDome represents the future of baseball arenas, well ... it could be worse. 
It certainly is a better place than the Kingdome or Astrodome ... Many players 
have trouble picking up pitches in the newest dome. "You feel like you can 
never get close enough to the plate," Rance Mulliniks said ... Undoubtedly, 
there will be some debate when the people responsible for naming things decide 
how to identify the Orioles' new home, to be completed in 1992. A wonderful 
name already exists. The stadium is to be built in an area called Camden Yards. 
Why not use that? There also is some support for Babe Ruth Stadium, but Ruth's 
name is too readily associated with the Yankees. Hope they stay away from those 
awkward and municipal names, such as Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Give Wade Boggs credit for candor. Before the Boston Red Sox's game in Toronto 
last Tuesday night, he conceded he would not win the batting championship and 
said gaining his 200th hit was foremost in his mind. At least he didn't try to 
convince anyone the Red Sox still had a chance. None of which is to say Boggs 
had begun functioning independently of his teammates or that he had stopped 
trying to win. In the fourth inning that night, he disputed a call at third as 
if the pennant were on the line, and, nine innings later, when he realized his 
fly ball to left would travel far enough to drive in the go-ahead run, he was 
pleased. The pursuit of 200 would have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
No baloney, there's been no salami. The St. Louis Cardinals haven't hit a grand 
slam in 438 games, more than 2 1/2 seasons. But then it's difficult for a team 
to load the bases when its primary MO is to first-and-third opponents into 
submission. The Cardinals' most recent grand slam was hit May 24, 1987, when 
Jack Clark hit what umpire Charlie Williams called a fair ball inside the 
left-field foul pole at the Astrodome. Even some Cardinals thought the ball 
might have been foul. The most recent undisputed slam by a Cardinals player was 
hit one week earlier. Tom Pagnozzi took Guy Hoffman deep in Cincinnati ... Did 
Lenny Dykstra really call some Philadelphia talk show and, without identifying 
himself, defend the Phillies' side of the Juan Samuel trade? 
</P>
<P>
Exclamation Points 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mookie Wilson on whether he would want to manage when his playing career is 
complete: "Only if they told me I had one year to live." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whitey Herzog on whether he would play in the senior league this winter: 
"Why? I was no good in my prime."

MUSIC CENTER: A DREAM COME TRUE CELEBRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a balmy late-summer night, 25 years of Music Center history culminated with 
two hours of performances from its resident companies and the presentation of 
the first Dorothy B. Chandler Performing Arts Awards. 
</P>
<P>
But for a moment on Sunday, the whole city felt like it had come to a stop -- 
at least it did for some of the Music Center's most loyal supporters, including 
dozens of its founders, from Kirk and Anne Douglas to Edward and Hannah Carter, 
Lew and Edie Wasserman to Earle and Marion Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Trekking along a red carpet stretching from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to a 
party at the Walt Disney Concert Hall site on First and Hope streets, the 
black-tie 25th anniversary crowd stopped in its tracks and stared silently into 
the sky as fireworks shot through the city's imposing skyline. 
</P>
<P>
"To see all these people, who have probably seen everything and been 
everywhere, absolutely transfixed, probably summed it up," said Dodger 
announcer Vin Scully. "It's a magnificent anniversary party." Sunday's event, 
more than a year in planning, was the highlight of a weekend of 25th 
anniversary celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, of course, there was no Music Center. For that matter, 
there wasn't even a skyline. "All you saw was a block of old houses boarded up 
waiting for the wrecker's crane," reminisced Bob Hope, who spoke at the Music 
Center's site dedication Sept. 27, 1964 ("I opened the thing," he said), and 
performed this time for a show that was taped for broadcast in January. 
</P>
<P>
The program itself, featuring sequences from "Phantom of the Opera" (but 
without the Phantom, Michael Crawford, who was ill) and "Tosca," was an 
exercise in progress. Music Center patrons aren't exactly accustomed to taking 
in performances with TV cues to applaud like they really mean it or to excuse 
scenes out of sequence, being told the order will be corrected at a later date. 
But even that didn't detract from the evening. "I thought it was so L.A.," 
enthused Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet LA/NY. 
</P>
<P>
Zubin Mehta, former conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, drew a mass 
chuckle when, after a glitch, he informed the audience: "Ladies and gentlemen, 
you don't want to hear a Bach cantata again. This is just a logistical mix-up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner Patrons 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, 1,000 patrons paying $1,000 apiece (do your own arithmetic) 
celebrated over dinner, underwritten by Wolfgang K. Flottl, on the Disney Hall 
site, today a tented parking lot; tomorrow, in the parlance of the evening, 
another cultural temple. "We'll be sitting here five years from now watching 
God knows what," predicted state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, there with his 
wife, Andrea. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep wondering where they'll have the 50th anniversary party," mused Hannah 
Carter, "because this parking lot won't be here." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a buzz in the air, it had to do with a sense of hometown pride. 
"This is a celebration of a city culturally maturing," said Orion Pictures' 
Mike Medavoy. "And it's international in scope, not just national." 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows me that L.A. has reached the major leagues," said Fred Nicholas, 
chairman of both the Museum of Contemporary Art and of Committee for the Disney 
Concert Hall, which he said will open three years from now. "L.A. will then be 
the No. 1 arts center of the world, I believe." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is," emphasized Van de Kamp, "L.A. is intent on becoming the cultural 
capital of the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center's 88-year-old founder, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, who was unable 
to attend the festivities, was represented by her daughter Camilla Frost and 
her husband, F. Daniel Frost. He served as co-chairman of the 25th anniversary 
committee along with Lodwrick M. Cook and Nancy Olson Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw my mother yesterday to tell her everything that's going on, and she 
thought it sounded very exciting," related Camilla. "She was particularly 
excited Zubin made such an effort to be here tonight." Her mother, she noted, 
was head of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when the maestro Mehta was appointed 
music director. 
</P>
<P>
Said Music Center president Esther Wachtell: "They keep telling me in my press 
office I'm not supposed to say this, but tonight marks 25 years of celebrating 
that we made Buff's dream come true. She said it was a lot of work -- a lot of 
hard work -- getting us here today," added Wachtell, who talked with Mrs. 
Chandler earlier in the day. "It's amazing, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
For many, the evening evoked memories of Mrs. Chandler's dogged determination 
in raising the money to build the Music Center. "She was one of the most 
wonderful fund-raisers I've ever known, and the toughest," recalled Prentis 
Cobb Hale, one of the founders. "I'm from San Francisco and San Francisco is 
imbued with music. I asked, why should I support the Music Center? But I did." 
</P>
<P>
Over at table No. 31, everyone raised glasses in a private toast. "My thoughts 
totally focus on Mrs. Chandler," said Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, whose table 
mates included sculptor Robert Graham, Gerald and Robin Parksy and Joan and 
John Hotchkis. 
</P>
<P>
The swagged tent was appropriately theatrical, glowing with tiny lights, silver 
palm trees and masses of white orchids. "It's a little on the glitz side, but 
it had to be for something like this," allowed Terry Stanfill, who took charge 
of the decor. Dinner began with fettucine with Sevruga caviar, chicken breasts 
stuffed with veal and spinach, and peach ice cream with fresh peaches served 
with chocolate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), Mayor Tom Bradley, L.A. 
county supervisors Ed Edelman, Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich, Councilman 
Gilbert Lindsay, state assemblymen Mike Roos and Lucille Roybal-Allard, Music 
Center Board of Governors Chairman J.J. Pinola and his wife Dorie, David 
Murdock, Harriet and Armand Deutsch, Tom and Patti Skouros, Harold Prince, 
Keith and Bill Keischnick, Joanne and Roger Kozberg, Deborah and Tom Tellefsen, 
Marco and Joan Weiss, Wendy Goldberg, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Doug Cramer and 
Ames Cushing, Betsy Bloomingdale, Walter and Pat Mirisch, Wallis Annenberg, 
Leonore and Bernard Greenberg and Sheldon and Sandra Ausman. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening drew to an end, founder John Hotchkis glanced around the tent 
and proclaimed, "They used to think of L.A. as a cultural desert, but not any 
more. Thanks to good old Buff."

UNCLE GASSED IN WORLD WAR I; 
</P>
<P>
AUSTRALIAN'S FIGHT TO ABOLISH CHEMICAL WARFARE IS PERSONAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1939, when Peter Dunn was only 10 years old, he sat at his Uncle Claude's 
bedside in a Tasmanian hospital and watched him slowly die. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Dunn had been among the thousands of Australian troops who had fought in 
the trenches of France during World War I and been gassed with phosgene, one of 
the then-new deadly chemical weapons unleashed by the Germans. More than two 
decades later, after he had been hospitalized dozens of times, the lethal 
chemical finally ate away at his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Left Terrible Impression' 
</P>
<P>
"That experience left a terrible impression on me," Peter Dunn recalled last 
week. "Ultimately, it dictated the course of my life." 
</P>
<P>
It would also have a major impact on Australia and the world at a crucial 
juncture half a century later. After his uncle's death, Dunn, the son of a 
Tasmanian timber farmer, decided to become a chemist. 
</P>
<P>
For more than three decades, the soft-spoken, self-effacing Dunn worked away 
quietly in Australian laboratories, researching and developing defenses against 
poison and nerve gases -- even though they appeared to have been made obsolete 
by a 1925 accord passed in response to the more than 1 million World War I 
deaths from chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn never expected to see a battlefield, much less be confronted with live 
chemical weapons. But, in 1984, he was hastily summoned from vacation in the 
Melbourne countryside. The mission, he was told, was so secret that he could 
not even tell his family. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn ended up in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
He also ended up being exposed to weapons far more deadly than those that 
killed his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his long years of work on chemical weapons, Dunn was appointed to a 
four-man U.N. team dispatched to the Gulf War front to verify Iran's claims 
that Iraq was firing artillery shells and dropping bombs filled with poisons. 
</P>
<P>
Within 48 hours of his arrival, Dunn was facing a 250-kilogram bomb filled with 
lethal poison gas dropped by Iraq on Iranian positions on Majnun Island. The 
bomb had fallen into the swamp and failed to go off. But it was still live. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no time to read the instruction manual. These were not normal 
circumstances. The revolutionary guards were waving guns and shouting (for us) 
to do something. We had to do whatever we could on the spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, surrounded by hundreds of Iranian soldiers, Dunn and a Swiss munitions 
expert donned yellow Playtex gloves and gas masks and "delicately, very 
delicately" defused the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
They then gently extracted the sticky substance which, Dunn said, he 
immediately knew was mustard gas. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn recalled that he did not feel fear at that moment. "I was so overwhelmed 
by the magnitude of what I had found. I knew this was so important on the world 
scene. This would be the most thorough documentation of a chemical weapons 
violation since World War I." 
</P>
<P>
What did make him nervous, however, was the reaction of the revolutionary 
guards. After Dunn extracted his samples, the excited Iranian troops tipped the 
bomb on its side and started pouring the gas -- without precautions -- into 
empty Coke bottles to keep as samples. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said Dunn in a kind of understatement that typifies his speech, "was 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Even a drop of the liquid or a whiff of the vapor can be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Later Horrified 
</P>
<P>
He was later horrified to learn that the Iranians had transported more than a 
dozen similar bombs, also still alive, on aircraft back to Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not the safest thing to do," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
But that was only the beginning. Dunn also visited morgues, where coffins were 
opened for him to see victims, each wrapped in plastic, who had already died 
from asphyxiation. Mustard gas, like phosgene, destroys the lungs. The plastic 
was to protect anyone who might touch a body. 
</P>
<P>
But his biggest discovery was in the simple brown paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
On a second trip to the Gulf War's front lines, Dunn and his U. N. colleagues 
were taken to a hospital in the Iranian border town of Ahvaz. Just looking at 
the 40 victims, Dunn knew that these cases were different. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these people were effectively blind because their pupils had contracted 
to pinpoints. Many of them were also trembling in spasms. They had lost control 
of their muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them were also salivating from the mouth and nose. It was as if they 
had been struck by a hidden virus." 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 40 soon died. 
</P>
<P>
With pride, the Iranians told Dunn that they had collected samples of the 
substance that had caused the injuries. They were keeping them in two small 
pill containers buried in sand in a grocery bag at the hospital's lab. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not something we could walk away from," Dunn said. He and Swedish Dr. 
Gustav Andersson immediately asked for gas masks and syringes. They then 
ordered everyone else out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
The two men laid out a plastic sheet on the floor, sifted through the sand for 
the tiny containers and then, "carefully, very carefully," used the syringes to 
extract the brown murky liquid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nerve Gas' 
</P>
<P>
"We could tell by sight it was nerve gas. It was the most moving experience of 
my life," Dunn recalled. "This was a class of weapons never used before in 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
Two classes of nerve gas -- Tabun and Sarin -- were developed by the Germans in 
the 1930s. But they were never used in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically and scientifically, our work in a small Iranian hospital was a 
momentous event," Dunn said. "It was the most useful thing I have ever done." 
</P>
<P>
Labs in Switzerland and Sweden later verified that the substance was Tabun, a 
potent nerve gas that can kill in seconds after only minimal exposure. Where 
death is prolonged, it is agonizing because of the gradual deterioration of the 
nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence collected for the United Nations in Iran mobilized world public 
opinion and injected new urgency in the disarmament conference on chemical 
weapons that by then had dragged on in Geneva for 13 years. Shortly after the 
release of the U.N. report, then Vice President George Bush flew to Geneva with 
broad new proposals that now form the framework for a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
And Monday, declaring the world "has lived too long in the shadow of chemical 
warfare," President Bush revealed the details of a U.S. proposal aimed at 
spurring the 40-nation conference in Geneva to ban chemical weapons entirely 
within 10 years. In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly as 
President, Bush offered, initially, to slash U.S. stocks of such weapons more 
than 80% provided the Soviet Union reduces to an equal level. "These horrible 
weapons," he said, "are now finding their way into regional conflicts," a 
situation which Bush called "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn may take some comfort that his fact-finding trips undoubtedly played a 
part in development of the U.S. proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleads to Act 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his 19-day trip to Iran so upset him that, upon his arrival back in 
Canberra, he immediately met with Australia's then-foreign minister Bill Hayden 
and other leading officials to plead with them to act. 
</P>
<P>
Because Australia suffered more casualties, proportionately, from chemical 
warfare than any other nation during World War I, Canberra has long been 
outspoken in urging a worldwide ban. But Dunn urged it to go one step further. 
</P>
<P>
The result was the Australia Group, an organization of 19 nations with advanced 
chemical industries, including the United States, that since 1985 has met every 
six months at the Australian Embassy in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn's work in mobilizing Australia to take a lead on a new treaty was 
evidenced last week at an international conference, the largest ever held in 
Australia, which for the first time brought together the world's chemical 
manufacturers and more than 70 governments. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn's fact-finding activities did not end in 1984. After further accusations 
of chemical weapons use in the Gulf War, he made two more trips to Iran and one 
to Iraq in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone told me I was mad to go back. But I had incredible drive to collect 
the evidence," he said. "I had to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Each time he went back, Dunn was even more appalled. On one of seven trips to 
the front, he discovered that Iraq had equipped a multiple rocket launcher, 
capable of firing 40 rounds in a single salvo, with chemical warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The casualties on another visit were so numerous that a Tehran sports stadium 
was converted into a makeshift hospital with 2,000 beds. 
</P>
<P>
And on his last trip, he watched a 4-year-old girl die from mustard gas burns. 
Her 2-year-old sister survived, but will be grossly disfigured for life. 
</P>
<P>
On each trip, Dunn snapped away with his camera, in between inspecting weapons, 
taking samples and visiting victims. He now has more than 300 pictures 
assembled in three thick scrapbooks and three diaries full of his findings. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make sure that we had complete documentation, that no one would 
ever dispute our findings," he said. "Now no one can deny what we found." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Iraq, which sent a delegation to this week's conference in 
Canberra, continues officially to deny that it has chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On the 50th anniversary of his uncle's death, Dunn, now 60, has become one of 
the world's foremost specialists on chemical warfare. For his efforts, he was 
awarded the 1989 Anzac Peace Prize, Australia's domestic equivalent of the 
Nobel, for his contribution to world peace. 
</P>
<P>
Is he optimistic that a treaty, now in its 19th year of negotiation, is 
imminent? 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be," he said. "No nation can afford to allow chemical weapons to 
become legitimized for use in modern warfare.

DOCTORS LAY BLAME FOR GROWING NUMBER OF ORTHOPEDIC CASES

<P>
Say hello to another phenomenon of the '80s: sports injuries in children. 
</P>
<P>
Today's kids, who used to get their bumps and bruises by riding bikes or roller 
skates around the neighborhood, are instead sustaining orthopedic injuries that 
once were the province of adult weekend warriors: overuse injuries caused by 
too much activity of a single type or over too short a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors blame the disturbing trend of sedentary life styles and improper 
coaching, but they also point to modern social phenomena such as the increase 
in two-career and single-parent families, latch-key kids and fear for 
children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
Says Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of sports medicine at Children's Hospital in 
Boston, "I hear repeatedly kids saying, 'My Mom won't let me go outside and 
play. She wants me to come home from school, lock the door and don't go 
outside, and watch television until she comes home from work.' " 
</P>
<P>
Concern about safety and unstructured time makes organized sports more 
attractive than simply allowing young children to get the exercise they need by 
playing freely outdoors, says Micheli. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, parents want their kids to be fit, and organized sports are a 
solution. There are 20 million children in organized, out-of-school sports, the 
National Youth Sports Coaches Assn. estimates. 
</P>
<P>
No organization keeps statistics on children's sports-related overuse injuries, 
and sports medicine for elementary- and junior-high school age children remains 
a rare specialty. But Micheli says that at his clinic, one of the few in the 
nation, overuse or repetitive strain injuries in children quadrupled over the 
last decade, to about 400 children a week. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Childrens Hospital is seeing enough patients that orthopedics 
surgery chief Dr. Vernon Tolo plans to set up a sports medicine clinic within 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
And the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases 
in Bethesda, Md., is considering a major long-term study to see whether sports 
injuries in young children are leading to joint problems such as arthritis in 
adulthood, said Reva C. Lawrence, epidemiology program officer for the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
The new kind of kids' sports injury might take the form of: 
</P>
<P>
* The tendinitis of a 12-year-old pitcher, who plays in fall and spring 
leagues, then goes to an intensive baseball camp in the summer.

"If you have a kid who has been deconditioned by inactivity -- rides the bus to 
school rather than walking . . . less physical activity through the day -- 
their tissues are weaker," Micheli said. 
</P>
<P>
Micheli says such children face a double risk of injury. Not only are their 
bodies unprepared for vigorous exercise but the nature of team sports tends to 
cause them to stress the same muscles, tendons and bones over and over again. 
"The bottom line is kids never used to get these injuries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and others predict the number of overuse injuries will continue to grow 
because parents want their children to be fit but often are unaware they must 
prepare them for the rigors of organized sports. Part of the increase in 
children's orthopedic injuries may be attributable simply to doctors' 
heightened sensitivity to and detection of them, said Dr. Arthur Pappas, a 
University of Massachusetts orthopedic surgeon who serves on the American 
Academy of Pediatrics's sports committee. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been an unequivocal increase, he says, in injuries to 
single-sport athletes who specialize by age 10-12 and train intensively. Ballet 
dancers. Figure skaters. Gymnasts. Tennis players. Swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the kids, who because of a total overload of their physical 
structures, are more likely to start having injuries and musculoskeletal 
complaints," he said. They "go off and start training when they're very young. 
Most bodies aren't meant to take that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preventing Injuries 
</P>
<P>
To protect youngsters, most sports safety efforts have focused on trying to 
prevent impact injuries. In football, great emphasis has been put on players 
wearing proper padding, and "spearing" with the head has been banned because it 
causes neck injuries; in soccer, competitors don shin guards; in baseball, 
batters must wear helmets to protect them from being beaned. 
</P>
<P>
Though baseball organizations have recognized one common overuse problem by 
limiting the number of innings a pitcher can play (Little League allows six 
innings of pitching per week), coaches and parents must do more to recognize 
and avert the types of overuse or repetitive strain injuries now being seen, 
doctors and athletic trainers say. 
</P>
<P>
They recommend limiting practices to two or three times a week and to no more 
than two hours (even less for the youngest children), and they advise against 
letting elementary school children participate in a single sport year-round. In 
junior high, there is increasing pressure for specialization, Micheli noted, 
but he said it is best if children avoid it before age 14. 
</P>
<P>
John Powell, an athletic trainer and orthopedic researcher at the University of 
Iowa Hospital, said a player's slight limp or minor pain can indicate 
"microtrauma," small injuries that can add up over time to cause serious 
problems. The standard treatment is to decrease the child's activity level for 
a few days to allow the body to heal. 
</P>
<P>
When ignored, microtraumas can result in major impact injuries a few days 
later, puzzling onlookers who observe of the child, "he wasn't hit that hard," 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Any sports-related pain that doesn't respond to rest needs a doctor's 
attention, he and others agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and coaches, they emphasized, should not encourage young players to 
continue playing despite pain. This can cause damage leading to joint 
immobility, arthritis and other movement problems later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"When a parent says to a child, 'Don't be a sissy,' the child eventually will 
learn not to go to the parent, and will not go to someone when injury occurs. 
They'll hide it, mask it, try to play through it," said Paul Grace, an athletic 
trainer, researcher and coordinator of sports medicine at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. "The long-term effect of that is we have an athlete 
who has the knees or shoulder or back of a 40-year-old when they're 19." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anatomy of the Problem 
</P>
<P>
Children's rapid growth, particularly near puberty, also makes overuse and 
impact injuries more likely, research indicates. 
</P>
<P>
In a child's skeleton, the bones still are growing. Growth plates at the end of 
long bones in the arms and legs are made of cartilage, which is weaker than the 
adjoining bone and more susceptible to microfractures. 
</P>
<P>
Injury risk also increases during growth spurts that put muscles, tendons, 
ligaments and bones out of balance. Micheli suggests, for instance, that tight 
muscle-tendon structures, a condition that can occur during growth spurts, 
increase the chances of stress fractures in associated bones. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 French study found that, among 11 soccer players with growth plate or 
cartilage injuries, bone development was 15-16 months behind the child's growth 
in overall body size and strength. A 1988 study at the University of Washington 
found that strain in the quadriceps, the large muscle at the front of the 
thigh, was greatest in boy soccer players who were tall but whose muscles had 
not gained proportional strength. 
</P>
<P>
Overtraining, inappropriate training or raising activity levels too rapidly 
during those fast-growth times increases the injury risk even more, doctors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about overuse or repetitive strain injuries comes just as sports 
programs for pre-adolescent children have instituted rules that have helped to 
cut the risk of impact injuries, particularly in football. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1988, the annual number of emergency-room treated injuries 
among 5- to 14-year-old football players decreased 26%, from 173,100 to 
127,250, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reports. In baseball, 
emergency-room treated injuries declined 13% in the same period, to 105,450. 
Soccer injuries rose 7%, to 40,620. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Safety Measures 
</P>
<P>
Some studies have suggested additional measures in baseball and soccer to 
prevent serious impact injuries, particularly among junior high school children 
whose increasing size and strength raise the potential for serious harm. 
</P>
<P>
These include chest padding for batters (children's chest bones are more 
elastic than an adult's, so impact from a pitch can result in a fatal heart 
attack); breakaway bases to prevent knee injuries in slides; and mouthpieces 
for soccer players to prevent teeth injury in collisions. Some also advocate 
protective eye wear for batters and soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
Although such injury questions can be controversial, they are easier for 
coaches and parents to address than overuse trauma: It's self-evident a padded 
helmet will prevent a child's head from damage; it's less apparent that a level 
practice field, appropriate shoes and the right equipment will prevent damaged 
tendons or stress fractures. 
</P>
<P>
A young athlete also needs plenty of sleep, at least 24 hours of rest between 
strenuous activities (often more) and a balanced diet that adds extra complex 
carbohydrates after a practice or game. Grace recommends: "We know that when 
you perform a sport like soccer you do use quite a bit of energy. If you go 
back and you start training in a different activity the next day, and you don't 
have the proper fuel in the body, it's a cumulative effect -- which will foster 
problems later down the line." 
</P>
<P>
He believes every children's sports league should provide parents with 
information about avoiding injuries through proper preparation, and also should 
have a dietitian, athletic trainer or pediatrician who can answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, doctors and trainers emphasize that they aren't arguing 
against sports for children. Properly done, physical fitness training gives a 
child healthier bones and muscles, a stronger heart and life-style habits in 
adulthood that reduce the risks of heart attack, stroke, cancer and other 
chronic disease. 
</P>
<P>
"There is certainly no clear evidence that organized sports are more dangerous, 
or safer, than free play," Micheli wrote in a 1983 paper. "Children can break 
their arms while playing Pop Warner football or by falling out of a tree, and 
the relative risks may be similar." 
</P>
<P>
Said Powell: "That risk, managed properly, is beneficial risk, not detrimental 
risk."

BIG CHANGES BREWING; 
</P>
<P>
COORS IS NEGOTIATING A $425-MILLION DEAL TO BUY STROH BREWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that will put one of the nation's oldest brewery families out of the 
beer business and strengthen the position of another, Adolph Coors Co. said 
Monday that it will buy most of the brands and bottling plants of Detroit's 
Stroh Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement in principle calls for Coors to pay the equivalent of $425 
million in cash and assume an unspecified amount of Stroh debt. The deal 
remains subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval by both 
companies' boards and antitrust clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming completion of the deal early next year, Stroh will cease to be a 
domestic brewer after operating for nearly 150 years. On the other hand, Coors, 
which traces its roots to an 1872 partnership, would become the nation's 
third-largest beer company in terms of sales. St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch 
dominated 1988 sales with 41% of the market, followed by Miller Brewing of 
Milwaukee with a 21.2% share. Stroh ranked third at 10.7%, followed by Coors at 
8.6% and G. Heileman at 7.9%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Plant Not Involved 
</P>
<P>
After integrating the two businesses and shaking out redundant brands, Coors 
will enjoy a consolidated market share of "about 16%," predicted Tom Pirko, 
president of Bevmark, a beverage-marketing consulting firm in Los Angeles that 
counts Coors among its clients. 
</P>
<P>
Not involved in the agreement were Stroh's bottling plants in Van Nuys and 
Memphis, Tenn. Both facilities produce products that will remain with Stroh -- 
California Cooler and White Mountain wine coolers and Sundance Natural Juice 
Sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we have no plans to close those facilities," said George Kuehn, 
Stroh senior vice president and general counsel. The deal, however, also 
provides Coors with an option to buy the plants if they are put up for sale, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gillette, publisher of the Beverage Hotline newsletter in Los Angeles, 
doubted that Stroh would retain the Van Nuys and Memphis plants for long. 
Closing them, he said, "would be in line with a trend occurring in the liquor 
industry as well as in beer: As there are consolidations, they go to capacity 
(production) at their most efficient plants" and close the others. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just too much capacity," Pirko agreed. "It's a tough, tough time to be 
in the beer business." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Coors will acquire Stroh breweries in St. Paul, Minn., 
Tampa, Fla., Winston-Salem, N.C., Longview, Tex., and Allentown, Pa., as well 
as container-making plants in Winston-Salem and Longview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Got to Be Significant' 
</P>
<P>
At a Colorado press conference, Coors Chairman Peter Coors said it is 
"premature to talk strategy" in terms of which brands will be retained or where 
they will be brewed. Some "do not overlap significantly," he noted, but others 
compete directly. For example, Stroh's best-selling Old Milwaukee brand 
competes directly in the low end of the market with Coors' recently introduced 
Keystone. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to be in the beer business long term," Coors told reporters, 
"we've got to be a major and significant competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Both Coors and Stroh were regional brands for much of their long histories. 
Coors now is sold in every state but Indiana, because of its distribution laws. 
Stroh dates from 1850, when Bernhard Stroh, who had emigrated from Germany 
during social upheaval two years before, opened a brewery in Detroit. It has 
been owned and operated by the family ever since, and its stock now is held by 
27 family members. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chairman and Chief Executive Peter W. Stroh, the company in the 1970s 
expanded its product line and, in 1982, vaulted into a national presence and 
No. 3 position in sales by acquiring Schlitz, which included the Van Nuys 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep in my heart I know it's either grow or go," he said at the time, which 
happened to coincide with the start of a persistent downturn in national beer 
consumption. To lighten its debt in the face of falling sales, Stroh has been 
looking for potential partners since February. On Aug. 31, it said it would cut 
300 of its 1,500 office help nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Coors, Peter Stroh said the decision to sell the 
brewing business was "difficult" but called Coors "the most appropriate brewer 
to continue the legacy of Stroh's. Coors, which is still run by the founding 
family, shares my conviction that when your name is on the bottle, the product 
inside must be of the highest quality." 
</P>
<P>
The two family enterprises "were more than just competitors," said Coors 
spokesman George Valuck. "Coors was the Stroh of the West, and Stroh the Coors 
of the East," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Company 
</P>
<P>
Acquired brands include Stroh's, Stroh's Light and Stroh's Signature; Schlitz, 
Schlitz Light and Schlitz Malt Liquor; Schaefer, Schaefer Light, Schaefer 
no-alcohol and low-alcohol brands; Old Milwaukee and Old Milwaukee Light; 
Goebel; Red Bull; Silver Thunder, and St. Barts (a no-alcohol beer). Coors also 
would assume licensing rights to Piels, Piels Light and Augsburger beers, but 
not to California Cooler, which Stroh licenses from Brown-Forman of Louisville, 
Ky. 
</P>
<P>
According to Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry publication published in New 
York, Stroh sales totaled about $1.3 billion last year, about the same as 
Coors. Stroh, a private company, does not report financial data. While the 
Coors family owns all the voting stock of Adolph Coors Co., Coors' nonvoting 
stock is sold over the counter, where shares closed at $23.75, up $1.50.

DOLLAR PLUMMETS 2.5% AS MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS FLOOD CURRENCY MARKETS; 
</P>
<P>
THE FED WAGES ITS BATTLE TO TO STABILIZE CURRENCY FROM A 'WAR ROOM' IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 3:30 a.m. and currency trader Meg Brown is just "getting into the office" 
-- trudging down the austere hallway on the seventh floor of the darkened New 
York Federal Reserve Bank and into the cluttered environs of the Fed's currency 
trading center. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed is preparing for a day of possible turmoil in the foreign currency 
markets, and the trading center is the central bank's war room -- a 
computer-bedecked nerve center from which the Fed conducts skirmishes, 
psychological warfare and, occasionally, major sorties in the markets to 
influence the dollar's rate. 
</P>
<P>
The mission is a critical one that affects virtually every American's 
livelihood. If the dollar rises too far, it makes imports more attractive here 
and makes U.S. goods less competitive abroad, costing jobs here at home. If the 
U.S. currency falls too sharply, it can kindle new inflation. Too many ups and 
downs make business uncertain and tend to stifle trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Calm Jitters 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is the trading room's equivalent of an advance scouting party, is 
assigned essentially to conduct early intelligence operations -- to find out 
what's going on in currency markets around the world, to divine the mood of 
traders and to look for clues of what Fed strategists are likely to face during 
the remainder of the global trading day. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on what she finds, the Fed may intervene in the markets by buying or 
selling billions of dollars, West German marks, Japanese yen and other 
currencies, either to calm the market's jitters or to counter an unwanted 
trend. Whatever is decided is carried out by the New York Fed. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's early morning reconnaissance is the start of a long day of continual 
sounding efforts and strategy sessions that include Fed staffers, bank traders, 
officials of foreign central banks, senior Treasury Department and Federal 
Reserve Board officials in Washington and -- occasionally -- even the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as it happened, the central bank had fired its first salvo even 
before Brown got to the trading room. In a coordinated attack with other 
central banks of other big industrial nations, the Fed aggressively bought 
foreign currencies with dollars in foreign exchange markets both here and 
abroad, to underscore a fresh warning by finance ministers of the seven leading 
industrialized democracies that they do not want the dollar to rise further. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists are skeptical about whether such intervention can have any 
long-term impact on the value of the world's currencies. But John Williamson, 
an exchange rate specialist at the Washington-based Institute for International 
Economics, says it remains the most visible and readily available weapon for 
the seven nations. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Fed can't keep things in check, there's a danger that the foreign 
exchange markets will run amok," said Williamson, who previously was on the 
staff of the 152-country International Monetary Fund. "And once that happens, 
you can't count on very much. The dollar could continue up or down, and things 
could get out of control." 
</P>
<P>
By any standards, the job is not an easy one. Not only must the Fed keep 
abreast of constantly changing market trends, but it also must develop and 
carry out a strategy that will prove convincing to traders here and in other 
countries. And it is not always easy to pinpoint what is forcing the dollar up 
or down. 
</P>
<P>
Two Fridays ago, for example, the dollar gyrated wildly on rumors that several 
big New York banks were in financial trouble; that West Germany and Japan were 
about to raise their interest rates, and that President Bush had been shot. All 
proved erroneous. But the Fed had to contend with them just the same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Markets Volatile 
</P>
<P>
Harvard University economist Richard N. Cooper explains that there is no great 
mystery to the Fed's operations. "The basic idea is simple," he says. "If you 
want to influence any price in any market, you buy or sell that commodity. If 
you want to drive the dollar up or slow its rise, you buy dollars in large 
numbers. If you want to push it down, you sell." 
</P>
<P>
But the markets are so volatile that the Fed's intervention efforts frequently 
take on the intricacy -- and excitement -- of modern-day submarine warfare. The 
central bank's game is to outguess -- and ultimately spook -- the world's 
currency traders into behaving the way policy-makers want. With markets open 
somewhere in the world 24 hours a day, it is a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The war room that Brown opens each morning is sophisticated enough to serve as 
a movie set for "The Hunt for Red October." Two giant video monitors suspended 
over a carousel of computer terminals flash the latest doings in financial 
markets around the world. One, in yellow, green and bright pink, carries 
currency prices. The other -- black on white -- is a financial news ticker. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and seven other currency traders have batteries of push-button hot lines 
to key officials at the Fed and the Treasury, trading rooms of major commercial 
banks and the Fed staffers' own counterparts in central banks in Europe and 
East Asia. Atop the carousel in the center is a giant lazy Susan to help cope 
with any paper work. 
</P>
<P>
Although decisions on whether to intervene technically are shared by the 
Federal Reserve and the Treasury, in practice the final decision ultimately 
rests with the Treasury secretary. The Fed generally has been willing to carry 
out whatever dollar policy the incumbent Administration has set. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed buys and sells currencies -- primarily dollars, marks or yen -- on the 
foreign exchange markets much as any other trader would. 
</P>
<P>
Brown or another Fed trader calls a counterpart at a major private U.S. bank -- 
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., for example. The Morgan trader then calls other 
traders at, perhaps, Commerzbank in Frankfurt, West Germany, or Sumitomo Bank 
in Tokyo, offering either to sell or to buy dollars in exchange for foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break-Even Operation 
</P>
<P>
The transactions -- consummated by telex rather than with wheelbarrows full of 
currencies -- are then either deposited in the Fed's own coffers or the 
Treasury Department's exchange stabilization fund. The intervention is financed 
half by the Treasury, which draws on its $10-billion exchange stabilization 
fund, and half by the Fed, which has the power to create its own money for such 
use. The two agencies hold billions of dollars in foreign currencies, largely 
on deposit in foreign central banks. 
</P>
<P>
Any profits are deposited in the Fed's own accounts, returned to the exchange 
stabilization fund or invested in interest-bearing accounts in other central 
banks, which essentially pay market rates. The Fed is neither a big earner nor 
a big loser. Officials say that over time, the profits from dollar transactions 
essentially balance the losses. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jordan, an economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, 
contends that the Fed is bound to lose big from its current sales of dollars 
because the central bank is running counter to the trend in the market, which 
has been pushing the dollar higher in the face of the tight-money policies that 
the Fed has maintained. Although the Fed's latest report shows that it made a 
profit on its foreign exchange operations in the May-July period, Jordan 
contends that alternative calculations show the central bank to be actually 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the Fed wants to intervene visibly in the markets, to send a clear 
signal in hopes that other traders will follow. Brown and other Fed traders 
openly call banks and brokers to place buy or sell orders. With the markets' 
penchant for gossip, the word spreads worldwide in only a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But occasionally Fed tacticians operate clandestinely, to catch traders off 
balance and -- possibly -- increase chances that they will be able to get more 
bang from their intervention bucks. In that case, brokers may not disclose that 
the Fed placed the order. The moves often catch markets by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Always Work 
</P>
<P>
What gives Brown and other Fed currency traders the edge is that they are privy 
to "insider information" -- ranging from what the statistics that are scheduled 
for publication that day will show to what policy actions their governments are 
about to take. The markets can speculate, but they never know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
For all the Fed's efforts to manipulate the dollar's value, the markets 
sometimes seem to defy explanation. Traders the world over make their decisions 
to buy or sell in seconds, without waiting to see whether their information is 
correct or complete. Often, markets react according to what they expect a 
statistic or announcement to be, not to what it really is. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Fed and the other central banks manage to score a hit, the markets 
remember. Private currency traders are still smarting from the now-famous "bear 
trap" of December, 1987, when the central banks allowed the markets' "bears" -- 
that is, the pessimists -- to drive the dollar down excessively, and then 
struck back with massive intervention that blunted the descent and left many 
speculators burned. 
</P>
<P>
Gretchen Greene, chief of the Fed's currency trading operations, insists that 
there was no actual bear trap -- just "steady intervention" that remained 
"unappreciated" by the markets until it was too late. But outsiders count the 
ploy as one of the Fed's most successful. 
</P>
<P>
Intervention can also depress the dollar's value. David Hale of Kemper 
Financial Services in Chicago argues that the dollar would have been far higher 
now if authorities had not sold dollars in the past few months, when the dollar 
was rising. 
</P>
<P>
One problem facing would-be interveners these days is the sheer size of the 
global currency market. Trading has swelled from a few billion dollars' worth 
of transactions each day in the early 1970s to a staggering $500 billion a day 
now. And the market is still growing about 30% every year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have the Resources 
</P>
<P>
Stephen H. Axilrod, a former senior Fed strategist now vice chairman of Nikko 
Securities International in New York, argues that the volume of transactions 
has become so large that it threatens to swamp the resources of central banks. 
"You really do have to do more in the market" to achieve the same effect, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene insists that the central banks' coffers are still adequate, if only 
because they merely have to influence the markets at the margin and reverse 
prevailing trends. "What we're dealing with is the height of the waves, not the 
depth of the entire ocean," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Just the same, the amount of intervention required still can be eye-popping. A 
recent report by Sam Y. Cross, the New York Fed's vice president for foreign 
operations, showed that the United States sold a staggering $11.9 billion in 
dollars from May to July, the largest U.S. intervention on record. 
</P>
<P>
And Monday's activity suggests that the Fed and other central banks will 
continue to intervene heavily whenever they feel a need to counter what the 
currency markets are doing. And the New York Fed's Brown will still be there 
for the 3:30 a.m. shift.

Wells Fargo to Buy Torrey Pines: Wells Fargo signed a definitive agreement to 
acquire the seven-branch Torrey Pines Bank, headquartered in San Diego County, 
for $74.5 million. The deal, which works out to $31 a share, or 2.7 times the 
book value per share of parent Torrey Pines Group, calls for 52% of shares to 
be exchanged for Wells Fargo stock and the balance to tendered for cash. Torrey 
Pines, with six branches in San Diego County and one in Riverside County, had 
total assets of $443.4 million as of June 30.

Price Misstated -- The price that Wells Fargo has agreed to pay for Torrey 
Pines Group -- expressed as a multiple of book value per share -- was misstated 
in Tuesday's Business section. An official of Torrey Pines, a seven-branch bank 
holding company based in San Diego County, had said the $31-a-share purchase 
price was 2.7 times Torrey Pines' book value. However, Wells Fargo said Tuesday 
that, by the time the deal closes, Torrey Pines' book value will be $13.02 per 
share, making the price per share only 2.38 times book value per share.

RJR SELLS DEL MONTE OPERATIONS FOR $1.4 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
DEAL PUTS COMPANY CLOSE TO LENDERS' FEBRUARY, 1990, DEBT-REDUCTION GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. took a big bite out of its debt 
troubles by selling its Del Monte processed foods business to an investor group 
headed by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. for $1.475 billion in cash, company officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Monte sale is part of a continuing program to cut the enormous debt 
that resulted from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s $25-billion leveraged 
buyout of the company early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lenders who financed the buyout gave RJR Nabisco until February, 1990, to 
reduce the debt by $5.5 billion and an additional six months to bring the total 
cut to $6 billion. Monday's announcement brings RJR Nabisco to within $600 
million of the February requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now up to $4.9 billion," said David Kalis, an RJR Nabisco spokesman. 
"We're almost home. . . . We don't expect any more major divestitures -- by 
major I'm talking in the mega-billions." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Merrill Lynch, other investors include Del Monte senior 
management, Kikkoman Corp. of Japan and Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. In 
addition to its investment, Kikkoman has agreed to purchase a variety of Del 
Monte's assets in the Far East, RJR Nabisco said. 
</P>
<P>
The processed foods business has been for sale for several months, analysts 
say, with Citibank as the major would-be buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"But Citicorp had to reduce its equity stake . . . because the Federal Reserve 
Board had rules limiting banking investments in non-financial companies," said 
Kurt Feuerman, analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert. "That was the major 
roadblock. Merrill Lynch stepped in fairly recently when it was decided that 
Citibank could not have a larger equity portion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Retain Parts 
</P>
<P>
The sale announced Monday includes Del Monte Foods USA, Del Monte Foods Europe, 
the company's processed foods businesses in Mexico, the Caribbean and the Far 
East, and Del Monte's pineapple operations in the Philippines and Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
Not sold were Del Monte/Aylmer Canada, Del Monte's processed foods business in 
Venezuela and Nabisco food businesses in Latin America, which were managed by 
Del Monte. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco's sell-off campaign was made necessary when Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
took control of the company last February in the biggest corporate buyout in 
history. In a leveraged buyout, a company is bought with borrowed money, and 
its own assets are used as collateral. The debt is paid off through cash 
generated by the firm and the sale of assets. 
</P>
<P>
With RJR Nabisco so close to reaching its debt-reduction goals, speculation now 
revolves around what further assests are left to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"When the LBO was set, there were obvious things the company had to do," said 
Marc I. Cohen, an investment analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "They 
had to get management in place and sell assets. They have made great strides on 
the management side. They have also made a lot of progress on the asset 
disposition side. They need to do a little bit more, but they don't have to get 
rid of any big chunks." 
</P>
<P>
One "big chunk" that's left is the company's Planters LifeSavers Co., a snack 
food subsidiary, but industry watchers contend that RJR Nabisco will probably 
hold on to that business. It is more likely to sell off its 20% stake in ESPN, 
its Latin American and New Zealand food units and its Butterfingers/Baby Ruth 
candy division. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say they're really going to slow it down now," Feuerman said. "They're not 
in a position where they have to sell a lot of assets right now, and they're in 
the strong position of having a whole slew of things to get rid of. From here 
on in, the focus of their activities will not be on divesting assets but on 
growing the existing businesses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Deals Earlier 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, RJR Nabisco announced the sale of its worldwide Del Monte 
Tropical Fruit Co. to Polly Peck International PLC, a London-based 
conglomerate, for $875 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The summer was even busier, for the company also sold its India and Pakistan 
biscuit division for $44 million, its Chun King food line for $52 million and 
its European food businesses for $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, we can be strategic about it (divestment)," said Kalis, the RJR 
spokesman. "We can take a look at businesses that might not fit into the 
organization and decide what to do."

A NATURAL STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS; 
</P>

SANDY GOOCH FIGURED OTHER PEOPLE MUST SHARE HER AVERSION TO CHEMICAL ADDITIVES 
AND ARTIFICAL FLAVORINGS. SHE WAS RIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
Don't tell Susan Terry that a whole-wheat Linzer torte sweetened with fruit 
juice tastes as good as the white-flour-and-refined-sugar version. Like others 
shopping recently at the Mrs. Gooch's natural food store in Sherman Oaks, Terry 
knows what she likes -- the sugary one -- but she also knows what's good for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Terry says of Mrs. Gooch herself: "She's done a fantastic job of upgrading the 
world of health food stores." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, plenty of Mrs. Gooch's customers see organic pastries as an example 
of the elevation of health food stores to a gourmet trade. But if there's a 
marketing strategy in that elevation, Sandy Gooch, 52, the founder and 
part-owner of the six-store chain, doesn't like to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Gooch likes to talk about how she started her Sherman Oaks-based chain of 
natural food stores in 1977 after a near-fatal sip of a diet soda that laid her 
out with an allergic reaction to a food additive. She likes to talk about her 
mission and the Mrs. Gooch's philosophy: avoiding chemical additives, 
artificial flavorings and refined sugar -- basically, a big "no" to what most 
people eat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upscale Touches 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with shopping at Vons or Ralph's or Lucky stores? "I don't know 
that anything is really wrong with shopping" at the big supermarket chains, 
Sandy Gooch says. "But if you're concerned about your health, it'll probably 
take a lot longer to shop at those markets." 
</P>
<P>
Gooch and her chief executive, John Moorman, aren't running typical 
brown-rice-and-wheatgerm health food stores. Mrs. Gooch's will do about $75 
million in sales this year. Sure, they sell fresh wheatgrass juice, but the 
clean stores also have subdued lighting, a gourmet deli with barbecued chicken 
brochettes and whole-wheat croissants and a high level of service -- the 
upscale touches that have made Mrs. Gooch's popular in Sherman Oaks, Beverly 
Hills, West Los Angeles and Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For most supermarkets, it takes moving a mountain of meat and potatoes to turn 
a profit. The average profit for full-service supermarkets is a mere 1.5 cents 
per dollar of sales. Gooch claims that her chain averages closer to 2 to 2.5 
cents profit. 
</P>
<P>
That may have something to do with the fact that natural foods are now more for 
yuppies than hippies. 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called baby boom is growing up and realizing they, too, get old and are 
just that much more concerned with exercise and health," said Anthony Harnett, 
the owner of Bread &amp; Circus, a successful $50-million-a-year chain of 
natural good groceries in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Gooch's stores in L.A. are in the same places where there 
are plenty of well-educated, well-to-do people, aged 25 to 50, who are willing 
to spend top dollar on food. But maybe talking about marketing doesn't make for 
good marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Gooch reluctantly admits that her company studies demographics closely. In 
fact, the average neighborhood or city where Mrs. Gooch's are located beats 
countywide average household income figures by about 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Gooch also doesn't like to talk about how much more it costs to shop at one of 
her stores than at a regular supermarket. In a highly unscientific test, a 
pre-selected list of groceries, from steak and broccoli to dish soap, recently 
cost about 30% more at a Mrs. Gooch's store than at a Vons store just down the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
But Gooch said that was a fluke and estimated that a person buying basic brands 
at a typical grocery store would pay only 5% more to shop for natural foods at 
her stores. 
</P>
<P>
For true believers in health food, Mrs. Gooch's has much to offer -- like 
wheatgrass juice (85 cents for an ounce), a brew that Gooch claims is a mixer 
for drinks and that's molecularly similar to human blood. "If somebody wants a 
high, I suggest they try" it, she said. But Gooch admitted someone once told 
her the taste "reminds them of doggie breath." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simulating Junk Food 
</P>
<P>
The trick to marketing natural food to baby boomers isn't in preaching to the 
ranks of wheatgrass juice drinkers, it's in striking a fine balance between 
what average customers think that they should eat and what they crave. The 
lesson was driven home in 1987 to Anthony Harnett, owner of Bread &amp; Circus, 
a successful natural food chain in Boston, when he tried to remove alcohol and 
caffeine from store shelves on the grounds that they are both addictive drugs. 
He was faced with a customer rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Gooch has avoided a similar rebellion by never selling alcohol or caffeine in 
the first place. But she's well aware that she has to offer her customers 
products that at least simulate some of the junk food that they are accustomed 
to eating. "We're not saying people have to walk around with tofu and sprouts 
hanging from their mouths," Gooch said. So her stores sell everything from ice 
cream and cookies (flavored with fruit juices, not sugar) to carob candy bars. 
</P>
<P>
Some big, traditional grocery chains have started imitating natural food 
stores, according to Patricia Heydlauff, executive director of the National 
Nutritional Foods Assn. Stuart Rosenthal, executive vice president for 
marketing for the Vons Companies, Inc., says most Vons stores now sell 
organically grown produce, and like Mrs. Gooch's, Vons is trying to give 
customers more nutritional information -- particularly about fat and 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
But with a 23% share of the Los Angeles grocery market (according to Grocery 
Marketing magazine), Vons isn't looking over its shoulder. "Are we threatened 
by Mrs. Gooch's?" asked Rosenthal. "No."

AT&amp;T Trims Some Rates: AT&amp;T said it is cutting long-distance charges 
slightly within California for competitive purposes, the second time this year 
that it has reduced such rates. The cut, which applies to all rate periods 
effective Sunday, means that a five-minute daytime call between Los Angeles and 
San Francisco will drop to $1.20 from $1.23; a call between San Diego and Los 
Angeles will drop to $1.02 from $1.07. AT&amp;T also will put into effect 
Sunday previously announced cuts for WATS lines and 800 service. The three cuts 
total $37.9 million in annual income for AT&amp;T.

AUTO SALES RISE 12.7% IN MID-SEPTEMBER

<P>
Auto sales by the eight major U.S. manufacturers soared 12.7% in mid-September 
over last year, the companies said Monday, with much of the gain due to a 
strong showing by General Motors Corp.'s light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of GM trucks from Sept. 11-20 were 46% higher than during the same period 
last year. GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said the increase covered nearly all GM 
truck lines. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, cars and light trucks sold at an average daily rate of 37,948 in 
mid-September, compared to a 33,670 vehicle-a-day rate last year. Car sales 
were up 10.2%, and truck sales rose 17.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 38% of the vehicles sold during the period were light trucks, a higher 
percentage than in previous periods. 
</P>
<P>
GM offered its dealers large rebates on some of the trucks and recently boosted 
incentives on some cars, said Bill Meier, general manager of Ray Green 
Chevrolet in Jacksonville, Ill. That's helping move out 1989s to make room for 
1990 models, which are heading off assembly lines and toward dealers now. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Glantz, an analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said 
in addition to the incentives on vehicles made by GM and other manufacturers, 
price increases due on 1990 vehicles also are pushing consumers into buy-now 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has an above average amount of inventory, there are unprecedented 
incentives and a whopping price increase for the 1990s," Glantz said. "(Sales) 
are going to fall off a cliff in October." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, GM on Monday confirmed plans to temporarily idle more than 18,000 
hourly workers at seven U.S. assembly plants for between one and three weeks to 
trim inventories of unsold cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, car and truck sales by the eight manufacturers are down 1.5% 
compared to the same 1988 period. A 0.4% increase in truck sales was more than 
offset by a 2.6% decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
GM's mid-September car and truck sales jumped 21.7% from the same period last 
year, with cars up 11.2% and truck sales climbing 46%.

U.S. LIKELY TO BACK INCREASED FUNDS FOR IMF, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>

The United States is likely to agree soon to back an increase of up to $80 
billion in the International Monetary Fund's resources so it can boost growth 
in poor countries and cushion any economic shocks in the industrial world, a 
top IMF official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding, chairman of the IMF's policy-making Interim 
Committee, said he expected an increase by the end of the year of between 50% 
and 67% in the fund's pool of resources, now $120 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very well possible that it will be 67%," Ruding told a news conference 
after the committee met. 
</P>
<P>
For an increase to occur, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady would have 
to back off from his insistence on Sunday that the IMF had no pressing need for 
more money. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, as the largest economy, has the power of veto in the 
152-nation agency, which makes loans to countries with balance-of-payment 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said he was committed to making a decision on extra resources by the end 
of the year and U.S. officials say they will have more flexibility to ask 
Congress for the money once the 1990 budget has been finalized, probably in 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
Ruding said the IMF had enough cash for now, but added: "From the date of a 
political agreement, it takes up to two years before the necessary 
ratifications can be reached." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto warned Monday that if 
Japan is not given a ranking within the IMF that matches its growing global 
influence, his Liberal Democratic Party may have trouble in getting the 
legislature to continue financial support for international lending agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that Japan should rank second, behind the United States, when 
IMF "quotas" -- deposits by members -- are increased. Japan now ranks fifth.

TASK OF MOVING OUT THE HOMELESS BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY WORKERS START CLEARING AWAY SHELTERS BENEATH SANTA ANA RIVER 
BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wearing surgical masks, protective suits and rubber gloves, Orange County 
workers began removing piles of tattered clothes and stale bedding Monday that 
homeless people had fashioned into makeshift shelters beneath the Edinger 
Avenue bridge over the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Environmental Management Agency deployed a crew of about 20 to 
perform the task after nearby residents complained that those living below the 
roadway littered the Santa Ana neighborhood and frightened people using a bike 
trail that parallels the river. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 2 1/2 weeks, the workers -- jail inmates trading their labor for 
time off their sentences -- will also clean beneath McFadden Avenue and 1st 
Street bridges. Then, all three areas will be filled with heavy rocks and 
cement to make the spaces uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
As they continue to clear out the 40 or so people suspected of living beneath 
the bridges, officials say they will exercise compassion. Any homeless person 
found there will be given a list of assistance centers and 25 cents to make a 
telephone call, said Bill Tidwell, an EMA supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Any clothes and bedding found will be left stacked on the river banks in case a 
homeless person wants to claim them, Tidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want this to be rough on anybody," Tidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
But the evictions were criticized Monday as a short-term solution to the 
county's homeless problem. Scott Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless 
Task Force, said county officials should try to move the dwellers to better 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"The county needs to find a more compassionate way to take care of the 
homeless," Mather said. "They have no long-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 10,000 homeless people in Orange County, but only 600 shelter 
beds, said Susan Oakson, an administrative assistant for the Task Force. 
Families are given priority for the majority of the beds, and there is often no 
room for single adults, Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are at the overpass, it's because they have found they have no 
alternatives," Oakley said. "The overpasses keep them warmer and out of sight 
so they feel safer." 
</P>
<P>
Mather said the county should at least set up a temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to overpasses, it looks like you've stepped into the Third World 
or into another time period," Mather said. 
</P>
<P>
The areas beneath all three bridges are routinely scattered with discards and 
garbage, some floating on the river, some lying on the banks. The occupants 
beneath McFadden and 1st have tried to make their crannies more homelike by 
erecting temporary shelves and using candles for light. But there is broken 
glass where some must crawl to get to their spots. And the air is filled with 
the stench of human waste. Without a source of clean water, the occupants often 
use filthy river water to wash themselves or their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m. Monday, when county workers arrived at the Edinger Avenue bridge, 
anyone who had stayed the night had packed and moved on. Left behind were worn 
mattresses, some old clothing, several pairs of shoes and rusty cans. 
</P>
<P>
The county inmates donned their protective gear because a hypodermic needle had 
been found amid the rubbish, and there was fear of encountering infection. 
</P>
<P>
As the crew started the cleanup, about a dozen homeless people were just waking 
a mile away at the 1st Street bridge. Some splashed their faces in the muddy 
river. Others washed their laundry in brown pools of water. And still others 
were making their way out from the makeshift shelter to look for day jobs, one 
woman said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, who would identify herself only as Lupe, said she was 34 and had lived 
beneath the 1st Street bridge for two weeks. She said she doesn't want to leave 
the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our place. We don't bother anybody," she said. "Where do they want us 
to go?" 
</P>
<P>
Three other homeless people interviewed Monday said they will probably try to 
stay nearby at Centennial Regional Park on Edinger Avenue at least during the 
day. In one parking lot at the park, there were about a dozen homeless people 
staying in their cars Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Lucy, 30, said she had been parked on the lot with her husband and 
two daughters for a week and half. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll probably come here," Lucy said of the bridge people. "Everyone shares 
the space," Lucy said. 
</P>
<P>
The park, however, closes between 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., and the homeless are not 
allowed to stay during those hours, park officials said.

SEX-LINKED DISEASES; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG, POOR SUFFER SILENT EPIDEMIC 
</P>

Health workers were the first to see it coming. They sensed it on the street 
corners where prostitutes loitered. Behavior was changing. Prostitutes were no 
longer bothering with motels. They were out on the curb hailing tricks, working 
hastily out of cars. 
</P>
<P>
People coming into the sexually transmitted disease clinics could not remember 
their partners. More and more seemed to be out of work or using drugs. Despite 
warnings about AIDS, health workers sensed a desperate recklessness afoot -- 
brought on by upsurges in cocaine, poverty and social decay. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it's a matter of time until you see the statistics," recalled Sibyl 
Howard, a public health nurse with Los Angeles County. "When you're out in the 
field and you sense people's despair, you can say, 'Look, this is what's 
happening.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Silent Epidemic' 
</P>
<P>
What Howard intuited during those years in the mid-1980s is now an alarming 
national fact. There is a "silent epidemic" of sexually transmitted diseases. 
They are spreading rapidly with no sign of a slowdown. And they are falling 
hardest on the young and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 million Americans will develop sexually transmitted diseases this 
year. Eighty-five percent will be under age 30. As many as 100,000 women will 
become infertile as a result of infections. Thousands of babies will be born 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
Organisms barely heard of 10 years ago appear to be rampant. More than 20 
viruses and bacteria are now known to be spread by sex. Meanwhile, many 
inner-city neighborhoods have become permeated with syphilis, a disease long 
thought a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"It is increasingly apparent that the cities of North America are more and more 
resembling the cities of developing countries," Dr. King K. Holmes, a prominent 
researcher of sexually transmitted diseases, said in a talk at the 
international conference on AIDS earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, cases of sexually transmitted disease in Orange County have been 
decreasing steadily, public health officials said. For instance, gonorrhea 
cases totaled 5,845 in 1986 but had dropped to 2,873 two years later, declining 
from a rate of 266.5 cases per 100,000 people in 1986 to a rate of 127.1 per 
100,000 by 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the AIDS epidemic, "a fair number of people have changed their 
choices of sexual behavior, reducing the risk of getting AIDS, Hepatitis B, 
syphilis and gonorrhea," said county epidemiologist Thomas J. Prendergast. 
</P>
<P>
"Where that has ceased to happen -- in Los Angeles where the numbers are going 
back up -- they're having a problem with 'crack houses,' with people trading 
sex for drugs. So far we haven't seen that phenomenon in Orange County," 
Prendergast said. "We have not seen a syphilis cluster around a crack house. . 
. . I'm not saying it couldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Powering the grim statistics are a mix of forces, the most notorious of which 
is the spread of crack cocaine, the uncommonly addictive drug that has spawned 
a life style centered on swapping sex for drugs, inadvertently spreading 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Many inner-city heterosexuals have not learned the safe sex message of the AIDS 
era. In addition, urban and suburban teen-agers are having sex earlier and more 
often. Many use no protection, despite the spreading epidemic among their age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, resources for controlling sexually transmitted diseases, other than 
AIDS, have remained flat or declined. Many public clinics have had to cut their 
hours. New diseases have outsmarted old disease-control tactics. Research 
funding has barely grown. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a scourge of suffering borne disproportionately by women 
and children. Many of the diseases are linked to other conditions, including 
cervical cancer, and some carry with them the risk of birth defects and brain 
damage for babies born infected. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, some sexually transmitted diseases now entail an added danger. 
They appear to increase one's risk of AIDS, either by causing sores through 
which the AIDS virus can be transmitted or, some researchers suspect, by 
accelerating the course of the fatal syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we can allow to happen today is continued spread of those STDs 
which have been implicated as risk factors for sexual transmission of the 
(AIDS) virus," Holmes said. " . . . We must put control of these diseases back 
on the public health agenda." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century ago, there were for the most part just two well-known 
venereal diseases: syphilis and gonorrhea. Now, new diagnostic techniques have 
made it possible to identify and characterize more than 20 organisms spread 
through sex. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are chlamydia trachomatis, a cause of a painful inflammation of the 
urethra; incurable viruses like herpes, hepatitis B and human papilloma; the 
bacterium that causes genital ulcers, once rare in the United States, and 
various fungi and protozoa. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers, being accumulated by federal agencies and researchers, are 
stunning: 
</P>
<P>
* Chlamydia infection, barely known a decade ago, has become the most common 
bacterial infection in the United States. There are as many as 4 million new 
cases a year. Up to 2 million new cases of gonorrhea occur annually, one 
quarter of them among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
* There are half a million new cases of genital herpes each year; 30 million 
Americans are believed to be affected by the often-painful, incurable disease. 
Studies suggest that the number of cases of chancroid, a rare bacterial 
infection, increased sevenfold between 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of doctor visits each year for treatment of genital warts has 
jumped more than sevenfold since 1966. An estimated 750,000 cases are diagnosed 
annually. The virus that causes warts, human papilloma virus, may also be 
linked to cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* The largest leap in cases of infectious syphilis in a quarter century in the 
United States occurred in 1987. The number of babies reported to have been born 
with congenital syphilis, a potentially fatal condition, climbed from 150 in 
1983 to nearly 700 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had asked me two years ago would the day ever come that you'd see 1,000 
cases of (infectious) syphilis in Connecticut," said Gordon Joachim, director 
of the state's sexually transmitted disease control program, "I would have bet 
my house that that would never happen." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the burden of disease appears to be spreading unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
Among whites, syphilis rates have dropped in this decade, thanks largely to 
safer sex among gay men. But among blacks, the incidence of the disease has 
jumped sharply since 1985. Among black women, the rate is now 50 times higher 
than among white women. 
</P>
<P>
Gonorrhea peaked in the United States in 1975. Among whites, it has declined 
steadily since. But among blacks, the decline reversed itself in 1985, and by 
last year the reported incidence among black women was 21 times higher than 
among whites. 
</P>
<P>
Similar patterns appear to be occurring with chancroid and a vaginal infection, 
trichomoniasis, according to Holmes. Like syphilis and gonorrhea, those are 
among the more easily detectable and treatable of the sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Some viruses, on the other hand, such as herpes and human papilloma viruses, 
appear to be moving quickly among whites and the middle class. They are 
currently incurable, though their symptoms can be treated. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, traces the 
growing concentration of disease in the inner cities to several factors -- from 
economic and demographic shifts to drug abuse and the growing pinch in 
resources devoted to public health. 
</P>
<P>
Black and Latino populations are growing faster than the white. Meanwhile, 
poverty is increasingly concentrated in certain pockets of the United States. 
More and more blacks and Latinos find themselves living in those communities, 
plagued by abuse of drugs like crack. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, funding for public clinics and other health services catering 
to those communities has failed to keep up with the workload. Health care 
resources have shifted steadily away from the public to the private sector, 
Holmes and others contend. 
</P>
<P>
"I attribute the increase in syphilis to two things, one of which is drug use," 
said Dr. Robert Rolfs of the federal Centers for Disease Control. "The second 
reason is that in a number of areas . . . there's a real problem of access to 
STD care." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia was one of the first cities to see a dramatic increase in 
infectious syphilis. In 1985, there were just 317 reported cases. That number 
has leaped every year since, to 1,293 in 1988, a figure expected to nearly 
double this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reported gonorrhea cases also increased -- from 17,345 in 1985 to 22,976 in 
1988. The actual numbers may be higher since public health officials believe as 
many as 50% to 80% of all syphilis and gonorrhea cases go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Control Drops 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, city support for sexually transmitted disease control 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The sole public clinic for sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment 
in Philadelphia reduced its hours by 20% between 1986 and 1988. With clinic 
registration stopping earlier and earlier and more patients being turned away, 
patient visits dropped nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of demand," said Martin Goldberg, senior public health 
adviser with the city's Department of Public Health. " . . . It's a reflection 
of the limited number of hours. What increases is the number of patients turned 
away without service." 
</P>
<P>
There have been similar problems in Los Angeles County, where the infectious 
syphilis rate climbed from 1,558 in 1984 to 2,770 in 1986 to 4,198 in 1987. The 
syphilis incidence per 100,000 population in Los Angeles County was 55.6 in 
1988, nearly four times the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the funding problem, officials say, is traceable indirectly to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, AIDS has dominated sexually transmitted disease control 
funding. Money for other diseases has remained virtually flat. Many health 
workers and researchers trained in sexually transmitted diseases have shifted 
to the fight against the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that both in terms of financial resources and human resources, there 
is no question that the AIDS epidemic has been a mixed bag," said Dr. Judith 
Wasserheit of the federal National Institute on Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, which conducts sexually transmitted disease research. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a real siphoning of funds from STD control to HIV-related 
work," said Wasserheit, chief of the sexually transmitted disease branch. "I 
think that is reflected as well in the availability of people to provide STD 
services." 
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that research funding has remained flat and has not been 
actually cut. 
</P>
<P>
Some physicians, too, have let down their guard. Routine screening for syphilis 
ceased in many places during the 1970s when it appeared to many to be no longer 
a threat. Now that it has resurfaced, some have responded slowly. Cases have 
gone undetected. 
</P>
<P>
For example, congenital syphilis can be prevented if diagnosed early in a 
woman's pregnancy; it can also be treated successfully if the newborn is 
tested. But pregnant women are going untested, despite laws requiring testing, 
and babies are going untreated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Tested in Prenatal Care 
</P>
<P>
A review by Los Angeles County health officials of the 75 reported cases of 
babies born with syphilis in 1988 turned up a disturbing fact. Some of the 
mothers had received prenatal care but appeared never to have been tested for 
syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
In 20 cases, the mothers had tested positive for syphilis. But the opportunity 
to cure the baby was missed at delivery. The babies, born without obvious 
symptoms, went untested or untreated, developing symptoms only after leaving 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The county study also found two babies born symptomatic by mothers who had been 
treated improperly. They had been given erythromycin, an antibiotic that does 
not cross the placenta well and therefore cannot be counted on to cure syphilis 
in the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
"The management of syphilis is kind of a lost art," said Dr. Deborah Cohen, who 
headed the county study. " . . . I think there's still a lot of physicians that 
don't know what all the tests mean and how to interpret the lab results." 
</P>
<P>
The burden of the epidemic falls disproportionately on women and children. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million American women a year develop pelvic inflammatory 
disease when infections like chlamydia spread into the uterus and Fallopian 
tubes. According to federal statistics, most of the women are under age 25 and 
have not yet had children. 
</P>
<P>
The disease leaves them 10 times as likely as other women to experience a 
pregnancy occurring outside the uterus. The rate of so-called ectopic 
pregnancies per 1,000 reported pregnancies in the United States has nearly 
quadrupled since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Pelvic inflammatory disease is also linked to infertility; one in four women 
with the disease lose their ability to conceive. Sexually transmitted diseases 
account for one-fifth of all cases of infertility, a condition affecting 2.4 
million married couples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk of Cervical Cancer 
</P>
<P>
Another possible risk for women may be cervical cancer, long suspected to be 
linked to sexually transmitted diseases -- in particular, several strains of 
human papilloma virus, the virus that causes genital warts. 
</P>
<P>
Infants face some of the gravest risks. 
</P>
<P>
Most organisms spread by sex can be passed on to a fetus, often with 
debilitating consequences. Congenital syphilis, for example, can result in 
fetal death, prematurity, blindness, neurological disease and abnormalities of 
soft tissue and bone. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure to herpes in the womb can in some cases result in growth retardation 
in the uterus and prematurity. And some babies exposed to human papilloma virus 
develop a potentially life-threatening obstruction of the upper airway. 
</P>
<P>
Only with screening and treatment can such cases be averted. 
</P>
<P>
One morning recently in the living room of a bungalow in South-Central Los 
Angeles down the street from the Little Flock Primitive and Greater Revelation 
Baptist churches, a 58-year-old woman sat, ankles folded, on a piano bench 
discussing her 14th child. 
</P>
<P>
Lula Chism raised 13 children of her own. At age 57, she was not expecting 
more. But when she went to visit her daughter and new granddaughter at Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center 16 months ago, the county sent the baby home 
with Chism. 
</P>
<P>
The baby had been born carrying the bacterium that causes syphilis. According 
to Chism, her daughter is a cocaine addict who had not sought prenatal care. 
The infant would probably recover, the nurses said, if Chism would ensure she 
got daily shots of penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 days, Chism took the child across town to a county clinic. The child is 
healthy and appears to have suffered no permanent harm. But Chism regrets 
bitterly that her grand-daughter's introduction to the world included those 
daily clinic visits. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me feel bad that it had gotten into my family," said Chism, who places 
the responsibility squarely with her daughter. " . . . If my daughter would 
take care of her body and be careful who she goes out with, it could have been 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd have had anything to do with it, she would have used birth control and 
not got pregnant to begin with. Maybe they get this cocaine and don't think 
about this sort of thing."

LEAGUE OF CITIES ELECTS LOS ALAMITOS OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County division of the League of California Cities has elected Los 
Alamitos City Councilman Ronald Bates to the office of first vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, who was elected to the Los Alamitos council in April, 1988, has served 
as second vice president of the league since last October. 
</P>
<P>
"This past year has given me new insights into the complex problems that face 
all of our cities and the role that the league can play in helping to address 
those problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the major problems he wants to address in the next year are growth 
management and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"These issues are crucial to our region and directly affect our quality of 
life," he said. "We need to address them now before a regional crisis 
develops." 
</P>
<P>
Bates will be installed on Oct. 24 at the annual League of California Cities 
Conference in San Francisco.

200 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ATTEND SEMINAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 California law enforcement officials converged in Irvine on Monday 
for a statewide seminar on extradition. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-day seminar, sheriff's deputies, correction officers and 
assistant district attorneys will learn about handling extradition requests and 
orders from interstate and international agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing tendency now for wanted persons to flee the jurisdictions 
of courts," said Al Howenstein Jr., executive director of the governor's office 
of criminal justice planning, the seminar's sponsor. "We want our officials to 
be keen on all the complexities involved in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, this state was engaged in extradition proceedings involving about 
1,600 wanted suspects and prisoners, according to statistics from the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R.-Calif), who was scheduled to deliver the keynote address 
on Colombian drug trafficking, canceled his visit because of a commitment in 
Washington, seminar organizers said. He was replaced by Sacramento Superior 
Court Judge Vance Raye. 
</P>
<P>
Raye, who previously served as Gov. George Deukmejian's legal affairs 
secretary, said: "We decided early on in the administration that we would abide 
by the letter and spirit of the extradition act, and California would not 
become a refuge for those who thought themselves unjustly accused in other 
states."

SUPPORT FOR HOUSING DEMONSTRATION SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Human Relations Commission is urging community groups and residents 
to support a national demonstration called Housing Now in Washington next week 
that is aimed at the problem of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
The commission unanimously endorsed the event and its three major goals: ending 
homelessness, providing permanent affordable housing opportunities and 
restoring federal housing-assistance funds. The goals were announced by the 
national spokesman for the event, Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing that the budget for federal housing assistance has been cut 77% 
over the last eight years, the commission is appalled by the thousands of 
Orange Countians unable to find suitable housing," said Jean Forbath, 
chairwoman of the commission. "This crisis calls for a massive demonstration in 
our capital in order to bring a strong message to the President and Congress to 
make housing a national priority." 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Now event will be held in Washington Oct. 5 to 7. People interested 
in joining Forbath and an Orange County delegation in the Washington 
demonstration, may contact the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force at 
(714) 740-1157.

NUCLEAR-ALERT SIRENS TO BE SOUNDED IN TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents in San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point will hear warning 
sirens Wednesday morning as the devices are given an annual testing. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Barron, spokesman for Southern California Edison Co., said the sirens will 
be sounded twice, for two to five minutes each time, between 10 a.m. and noon. 
</P>
<P>
He said sirens at San Onofre State Park and Camp Pendleton in San Diego County 
will be tested at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The alert sirens are required by federal regulations in case of a nuclear 
emergency, Barron said, and can also be used as warnings for other community 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The sirens are intended to alert residents to turn on their radios or TVs for 
emergency instructions, Barron said.

1 KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN GANG SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men driving through Centennial Regional Park looking for a friend were 
mistakenly shot by gang members who approached their car and opened fire, 
killing one of them, Santa Ana police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they do not believe that the two men who were shot, or a third 
uninjured man sitting in the back seat, belong to a gang. But when the 
unidentified assailants approached their white Suzuki Samurai just before 8 
p.m. Sunday, they demanded that the occupants disclose their gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
When they responded that they were not members of a gang, one of the assailants 
opened fire with a handgun at close range, according to Maureen Thomas, a 
Police Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Ulloa, 22, of Santa Ana was shot in the head and chest. The driver, 
whose name was withheld by police, was shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
The victims immediately drove Ulloa to a local hospital where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 16, in another fatal gang attack in Orange County, a 4-year-old boy 
and a youth were shot to death in neighboring Garden Grove in what was believed 
to have been a gang retaliation. Law enforcement officials have said there are 
about a dozen fatal assaults in Orange County each year attributed to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said there were "quite a few" people in the park at the time of the 
shooting, but none claimed to have been a witness. Thomas said police did not 
have a suspect or a description of the gunmen and are asking anybody with 
knowledge of the incident to contact investigators Ron Reid or Phil Lozano at 
(714) 647-5168.

MISSION VIEJO TO BAR ALCOHOL AT CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE PITS SENIOR CITIZENS AGAINST PARENTS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGIE LUCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I will never have on my conscience the death of a child or anyone else due to 
drinking and driving," said Mayor William S. Craycraft before casting his vote 
to keep alcohol out of the Oso Viejo Community and Senior Center and all other 
city-owned facilities. "It's important we be consistent in our policy across 
the board." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Norman P. Murray, who cast the dissenting vote, said, "I'm 
personally convinced that grandma and grandpa are not the problem in this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of allowing consumption of alcoholic drinks at the Community and 
Senior Center has pitted angry parents whose children go to school near the 
center against seniors who want alcoholic drinks available at their club 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol has its place and our city parks are not that place," said John 
Landgard, a father of four students who attend nearby Fred Newhart Elementary 
School, told council members. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Eileen Fallman added: "We think the city and senior citizens need to set 
an example for our young people by saying, 'Yes, we can have social activities 
without alcohol.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Sought 
</P>
<P>
Seniors had sought council approval to allow alcohol to be served at the center 
by nonprofit groups able to provide proof of insurance and a refundable deposit 
of $250. The new policy, however, would not have allowed the sale of alcohol. 
And consumption of such beverages would be restricted to the senior wing of the 
community center, said city Parks and Recreation Director Wayne Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
For Holly Kunkle, a mother of two and a spokeswoman for the parents' group, the 
issue is not one of age but of alcohol consumption near a park and the Newhart 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the site is unworkable for the recommendation," she explained. 
"(The center) is surrounded by playgrounds and playing fields. My family uses 
the park and my children attend the school." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Kearns, a senior who frequents the community center, said he believes 
opponents of the proposal are discriminating against seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (opponents) are more concerned that seniors (who would drive after 
consuming alcohol) would be jeopardizing their kids than they are with alcohol 
in a park," explained Kearns, who also is commander of the Region 58 chapter of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. "That is a fallacy on their part." 
</P>
<P>
"(The seniors) are upper-middle-class people with children and grandchildren 
and they know the responsibilities of driving," he said. "They're not going to 
drink a gallon of wine and go out driving." 
</P>

RAM DEFENSE DOES ITS PART IN NFL TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday's pinball game between the Rams and Green Bay Packers made you wonder if 
there is such a thing as great defense in the National Football League anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams thought they had something special with their Eagle, yet through three 
winning weeks the defense has been burned for four long touchdown passes while 
allowing opponents an average of 393 total yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing the Rams' offense is doing the same unto others. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Clifford Hicks' heels were so hot from getting burned Sunday he 
needed to soak them in ice water. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks isn't alone, though. Look around the league. Everybody is getting 
scorched. Three of the supposed best defenses in the NFL -- Buffalo, Minnesota, 
Chicago -- gave up 41, 27 and 27 points respectively. 
</P>
<P>
There's something funny in the air. It's the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an interesting phenomenon going on," John Robinson said Monday. 
"Whether it goes on throughout the year, I really don't know. I'm very curious 
about it. I think the kind of defense we're playing and other people are 
playing has precipitated this." 
</P>
<P>
Is this the curse of Buddy Ryan's 46 defense? In 1985, the Bears rolled to the 
Super Bowl championship with Ryan's attacking, blitz-the-quarterback schemes. 
Copycat defenses quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan took his act to Philadelphia where Sunday, his Eagles gave up 38 points 
and 428 passing yards to quarterback Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Offenses have turned the tables on the new defenses with all-out aerial attacks 
of their own. The Don Majkowskis of the world are routinely throwing for 300 
yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson concedes that teams with schemes that involve crowding the line of 
scrimmage and attacking the quarterback are paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams are coming out and saying, 'To hell with you. If you're going to stop 
the run on first down we're going to throw all the time,' " he said. "There's 
some good things about it, because it's exciting football, but there's some bad 
things about it. Green Bay turned the ball over five times." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay was also unstoppable in the second half of Sunday's 41-38 loss, 
outscoring the Rams, 31-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It's making the game wild and out of control," Robinson said. "I think it's a 
dangerous way to play, but it certainly is an exciting way to play. It's a 
successful ploy if you can maintain the ability to run the ball as well. If you 
can go out and throw it 45 times and then come back and run it pretty well, I 
think that's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams salvaged Sunday's game with two time-consuming, fourth-quarter drives 
led by tailback Greg Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson isn't ready to scrap the Rams' Eagle defense, though he's plenty 
worried about what has happened in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insists that his team's problems are not conceptual, but stem rather 
from breakdowns in fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tackling stunk from beginning to end," he said of the Packer game. 
</P>
<P>
But what of those missiles being launched over the cornerbacks' heads? 
</P>
<P>
Blame part of it on inexperience. Hicks is only in his third year. And in the 
Eagle, cornerbacks must be able to cover receivers one on one. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been victimized a little bit by this, as all young corners are," Robinson 
said. "That's what happens when you're a new guy on the block and they come and 
get you. Our confidence in his (eventual) success is certainly not diminished. 
We just have to ride this out with him. The trouble is there are some guys that 
you run stride for stride with that are absolutely fantastic athletes. That 
Sharpe is big time." 
</P>
<P>
That Sharpe was rather Sterling, who finished with eight catches for 164 yards 
against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is really worried because he has actually pulled back the reins on the 
Eagle in recent weeks and is still getting burned deep. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball's going up over us, even when we're playing zone," he said. "It isn't 
so much that we're playing with some gambling, wide-open thing." 
</P>
<P>
Help may be on the way. LeRoy Irvin returns from his substance-abuse suspension 
this week and will probably start for Hicks at right cornerback this Sunday 
against the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson no doubt is hoping for a great defensive struggle, a 34-30 game 
perhaps. Are the days of the Steel Curtain gone forever? What exactly is a good 
defense? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the criteria for what that is is going to change," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Greg Bell Fan Club is growing by the minute. Robinson, who had never use 
the word great to describe his latest star tailback, finally found it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed with what he's done so far this year," Robinson said. "And 
the way he's doing it. He's a major part of what we're doing offensively, and 
he certainly deserves to be considered one of the really great backs in this 
league. Because of the circumstances, I don't know why exactly, those words 
haven't been used to describe him. But he's certainly earning that kind of a 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Bell rushed for a career-high 221 yards Sunday and leads the NFL with 417 yards 
in 76 carries, a 5.5 yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>

Cleveland Gary should finally make his Ram debut this week after a long summer 
holdout and a minor car accident. The question is: With Greg Bell around, will 
it matter? The leading runner after Bell this season is Robert Delpino, who has 
23 yards in five carries. And has anyone seen Gaston Green lately? 
</P>
<P>
Why has the Rams' pass rush been missing lately? Two theories: The Rams aren't 
blitzing as much and they miss Gary Jeter as an inside pass rusher. Jeter was 
lost to Plan B free agency in the off-season. Fred Strickland may be the answer 
at defensive tackle when his knee mends completely, but first pick Bill Hawkins 
hasn't made much of an impact at the other spot. "He did not play well 
yesterday," Robinson said of Hawkins. "But he had lots of company." 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Irvin is expected to return to the active roster Wednesday. Based on 
Monday's first press release, rookie cornerback Alfred Jackson will go on 
injured reserve with a knee injury to make room for Irvin. The team obviously 
jumped the gun on the roster move and later amended the release.

Answering Coach John Robinson's challenge of "restoring the running game" after 
a pass-happy win over Indianapolis the previous week, the tailback responded 
with the best day of his six-year career against the Packers. His 46-yard run 
in the game's final minutes not only brought his game total to 221 yards, but 
gave the Rams a crucial first down while holding a precarious 41-38 yard lead. 
With 417 yards in three games, he's well on his way to matching his 1,212-yard 
total of '88.

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN'S PAPAZIAN HAS GENTLE NATURE, BUT THRIVES ON CONTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Papazian, a football player, wrestler and kickboxer, thrives on contact 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
As a fullback/linebacker for Whittier Christian High School in La Habra, 
Papazian says the best part of playing football is the fact that "you get to 
make some incredible hits. You get to inflict pain." 
</P>
<P>
But Papazian also is a soft-spoken 17-year-old senior seeking a less 
troublesome, more virtuous life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really been struggling lately in my attitude and the way I act," he said. 
"A lot of my friends have been praying for me lately." 
</P>
<P>
Papazian looks up at the visitors beside him and says solemnly: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
If Papazian sees an irony between his love of contact sports and his search for 
virtue, he doesn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just 'cause you believe in God and you're a Christian doesn't mean you're a 
pansy," Papazian said. "Just like we proved Saturday night (in Whittier 
Christian's 24-14 victory over California High School). I mean, we went out and 
just destroyed 'em." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-2, 215 pounds, Papazian, who is being recruited by USC, UCLA, 
Nebraska, Washington and University of the Pacific, is one of the strongest, 
most aggressive players in the Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough, tough kid," Orange Lutheran Coach Bob Dowding said. "It takes 
two or three guys sometimes to take him down." 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true at Master Frazier's Taekwondo Studio in La Habra, where 
Papazian takes kickboxing lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian, who noted that his favorite forms of entertainment are "all those 
movies with blood and guts and killings -- they're the best," said the movie 
"Bloodsport" drew his interest to kickboxing. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I saw it, I wanted to do it," he said. "When I was 9, I took karate 
with my sisters. I always wanted to box, so this is a combination of the two." 
</P>
<P>
Papazian hopes to perfect his moves -- such as the spinning backward kick he 
performed at a visitor's request -- in order to earn a black belt at Master 
Frazier's. Currently, he holds an orange belt, six levels away from black belt. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very good talent and very strong; he has no problems in here," said 
Hideki Frazier, who owns the studio. "Ron has really good flexibility, his size 
is good. (Kickboxing) takes thinking about what you're doing, and being able to 
visualize what your opponent is going to do. It takes a lot of concentration 
and he has that." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Papazian has been concentrating on his moral substance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a real mischievous type of person," he said. "I'm always getting into 
trouble, just doing stupid things, getting in fights and things. I know it's 
wrong, but sometimes you go out with friends and end up in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
His father, Ron Papazian, admits his son has a tendency to get in fights -- 
"I'm not going to say Rony's an angel," he said -- but is confident in his 
son's ability to discern right from wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"As with any teen-ager, it's a constant fight for Rony to stay centered," the 
elder Papazian said. "Rony is a mischievous kid. . . . (But) fortunately, with 
all the hoopla around him, he takes it in stride. . . . He has a terrific sense 
of balance about these things. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) his concept of getting into trouble is pranks that he might pull at 
school: throwing mud balls against the wall at school, pulling a girl's hair, 
whistling at a girl, the things every young teen-ager does. He's not at the 
point where he's setting off bombs in his locker or blowing up the school, but 
I have to chuckle because he does a lot less than I did when I was in high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
As for football, Papazian rushed for 1,051 yards and scored 25 touchdowns last 
year as a junior -- third highest in the county. In three games this season, he 
has gained 455 yards in 49 carries, a 9.3-yard average, and scored seven 
touchdowns, including three in Saturday's victory over California. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestling also is something of a hobby for Papazian. Asked whether he competed 
at the Southern Section level last year, he shrugged and said, yes, but he only 
got as far as the quarterfinals, as if being two matches away from a section 
championship wasn't much of an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian, who added 15 to 20 pounds since last year with increased weight 
training, said he still is too small to play football at a Pacific-10 school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really trying to pour the heat (weights) on right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to do everything I can to take care of myself."

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DESPITE THE PAIN, EL DORADO'S BURK WON'T STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Vicky Burk has become the top player on her El Dorado High School team 
in only her second season, volleyball has become a pain. 
</P>
<P>
That's not pain as in an added aggravation to a daily schedule -- it's more 
like getting kicked on the shins. 
</P>
<P>
Burk, The Times' Athlete of the Week, has shin splints that limit the number of 
running drills in which she can participate. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Burk, a senior, has emerged as El Dorado's physical and emotional leader. 
</P>
<P>
"She makes up for (the lack of running) by doing other drills like riding the 
bike," El Dorado Coach Sue Halsted said. "In volleyball, you need conditioning 
in both aerobic and anaerobic. She could probably be in better shape, but she's 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
Burk had 15 kills and two blocks to lead El Dorado to a 15-11, 15-8, 9-15, 
15-8, victory over Diamond Bar last Tuesday and was a top player at the 
Fullerton tournament last weekend. Burk has become the main force on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be aggressive," Burk said. "I think that each time we play, we know 
we can win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Halsted: "She's our captain and I think she enjoys being in a position of 
leadership. If we're having trouble, we tend to send the ball her way." 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Burk can spike, pass and block well. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she wants to spike, pass and block, which may be her only problem 
outside of shin splints. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes she's so aggressive that she will take another player's ball," 
Halsted said. "But I'd rather have that kind of mistake than others. Her 
aggressiveness has made her a better player." 
</P>
<P>
So has playing on the Magnum club team. It might be the main reason she 
developed into a quality volleyball player in just two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in my game was really strong (before playing on Magnum), and now I am 
happy with my game," Burk said. "The coaching there has really made a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Burk played two years of basketball before her chronic shin splints forced her 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always interested in playing volleyball, so when I found out that I 
could play it without the pain, I started playing," Burk said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the pain, Burk does not look forward to the off-season for rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to play year round," Burk said. "It would be nice not to have the 
pain, but I love volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS Jenny Hoffman had 15 kills to lead Calvary Chapel to a 15-6, 
6-15, 15-11, 15-4, victory over Bethel Christian Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's Cindy Kuragami swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, in a 13-5 loss to 
Tustin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley Thurston swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to lead Villa Park to a 14-6 
victory over Magnolia Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's doubles team of Nikki Turner and Laura Oleson swept its matches, 6-0, 
6-0, 6-0, Wednesday to help the Chargers defeat University, 72-71, in games.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
FOR TITANS, NEVIN IS THE CLOSEST THING TO A SURE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy can be a gambler, but this time 
there was no temptation. 
</P>
<P>
With only enough time remaining for one play from the San Diego State five-yard 
line Saturday, the decision to send Phil Nevin in for a field goal and a 41-41 
tie was simple, Murphy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't no deliberating, he's gonna kick it," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans could have tried to score the touchdown, which would have pulled out 
a victory and given Fullerton a 2-2 record entering its Big West Conference 
opener against Nevada Las Vegas at noon Saturday in Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton already had failed to get into the end zone on two plays from the 
10 or closer. If they failed once more, the Titans would go into the conference 
season 1-3, with their esteem down around their ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Go for it? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Say we went for it and didn't make it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He let his expression speak for him. With a loss, it would be hard to 
rejuvenate the team for the conference season, the one Murphy says really 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
There were other plays to look back on. There was Nuygen Pendleton's punt 
return for a touchdown, nullified by a clipping penalty -- a penalty Murphy 
disputed Monday. There was the second chance San Diego State got on a missed 
point after touchdown after Chris Wright was called for being offsides, another 
call Murphy questioned. The Aztecs made the second one. 
</P>
<P>
There was Murphy's own call, a decision to punt instead of bringing Nevin on 
for what would have been about a 54-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Murphy's disappointment in Tony Dill and Tim Byrnes, who didn't 
head straight for the sidelines to get out of bounds and stop the clock after 
making catches on the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
"You go back and look and say if we would have done this and if we would have 
done that, we would have won the game," Murphy said. "But you do that every 
Saturday night and it will drive you bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Murphy went for the closest thing to a sure thing the Titans have. He 
called on Nevin. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy had watched his team let a 13-point lead get away Saturday, but he had 
to be a bit amused when San Diego State called a timeout as Nevin prepared to 
kick the last-play field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"(They) think this guy is an ordinary freshman," Murphy thought.

Murphy knew better. He turned to find Nevin, the remarkable kicker who has been 
flawless in four games after spurning professional baseball for college 
baseball and football. The Aztecs were trying to make him think it over, trying 
to unnerve his 22-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy found Nevin was scanning San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, taking in the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"He's thinking he'll play baseball here one day," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary freshman? 
</P>
<P>
"(One Titan player) thinks he's a graduate student," Murphy said. "He's an 
unbelievable 18-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
The field goal was Nevin's fourth of the game, and his seventh in seven tries 
this season. He made it look like a cinch, but then, he made a 54-yarder 
against Cal State Northridge look like a cinch, too. 
</P>
<P>
He also has made 10 of 10 PATs, and has a 40-yard punting average. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pringle, who rushed for more than 100 yards for the third game in a row 
Saturday, had 302 all-purpose yards against the Aztecs but fell from first in 
the nation to second. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon, formerly of La Habra High School, is first in 
all-purpose yards with a 245-yard average. Pringle (240.3) is second, and San 
Jose State's Sheldon Canley (221.5) is third. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle is averaging 118 yards a game rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan Speltz did not throw an interception Saturday for the first 
game this season, completing 25 of 32 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas has multiple injuries after a victory over New Mexico State 
Saturday, including starting tailback Tommy Jackson (sprained knee) and 
starting quarterback Chuck Price (possible fracture of right ring finger). 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Titan volleyball team plays top-ranked Hawaii in Titan Gym at 7:30 tonight. 
. . . Susan Herman ranks third in the nation in hitting percentage and the 
Titan team ranks eighth. Hawaii is sixth. . . . The soccer team plays host to 
top-20 ranked Fresno State Sunday.

PEOPLE: SAMURAI SALES PLUNGE SPARKS SHUFFLE AT AMERICAN SUZUKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
American Suzuki Motor Corp., staggered by a catastrophic decline in Samurai 
sales and weakness in its other automotive lines, said Monday that its 
president has been reassigned to corporate headquarters in Japan, and the three 
top officials of the auto division have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Kenji Shimizu, chairman of Brea-based American Suzuki since July and a longtime 
executive and managing director of the Suzuki Motor Co. conglomerate in Japan, 
will replace Toshiyuki Arai as president of American Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshi Fujii, another longtime Suzuki executive from corporate headquarters in 
Hamamatsu, Japan, has been named to the new position of executive vice 
president of the American Suzuki automotive division, which markets cars and 
sports vehicles. Other American Suzuki divisions market motorcycles and such 
miscellaneous products as outboard motors and snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman said no replacements have been named for the three U.S. 
automotive division executives who resigned Monday: Doug Mazza, vice president; 
John Dorsey, sales director, and Larry Messelt, national sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
Mazza and Dorsey were hired in 1985 to create American Suzuki's auto division, 
the same year Suzuki introduced the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
The Samurai quickly caught on with younger drivers interested in low-cost 
sports vehicles, and sales soared to 81,349 cars in 1987. But in June, 1988, 
Consumer Reports magazine criticized the Samurai as being susceptible to 
rolling over, and sales began to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a federal study has since concluded that the Samurai is no more 
prone to rolling over than are similar vehicles, sales slumped to about 50,000 
in the first eight months of 1988, and in the first eight months of this year, 
just 3,399 Samurais have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Suzuki's other vehicles -- a line of subcompacts and another sports 
vehicle introduced within the last year -- have also been hurt by the 
publicity. As of Sept. 1, Suzuki had sold just 21,389 cars and sports utility 
vehicles in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In American Samurai's only statement about the management changes, spokeswoman 
Laura Segall said the company "has undergone significant changes in the past 
year." 
</P>
<P>
"When Mazza and Arai started in 1985, they had only one automobile product, the 
Samurai, and the goal was to establish a following for and generate sales of 
the Samurai, which they did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now Suzuki is in a situation where we have a full line, including the 
Sidekick and the Swift passenger cars. The complexion of the company has 
changed, and there are different goals and philosophies on how best to run what 
essentially is a new company." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, American Suzuki announced its 1990 automobile lineup. The Samurai 
is being de-emphasized, with fewer models and options being offered. Meanwhile, 
the Sidekick -- a squat version of the Samurai with a lower center of gravity, 
is being offered in several new configurations. As last year, there will be 
three models of the Swift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHAKE-UP AT AMERICAN SUZUKI

American Suzuki Motor Corp., based in Brea, reorganized its executive suite 
Monday amid a continuing sales slump. 
</P>
<P>
Kenji Shimizu 
</P>
<P>
Chairman since July, will assume the additional title of president.

The situation: A U.S. air base has just been battered by enemy rockets and its 
runways are now pockmarked and littered with wreckage. But the runways must be 
cleared before American jets can take off to launch retaliatory strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: How do you quickly repair the runway damage without putting 
servicemen's lives in danger from another enemy attack? 
</P>
<P>
The solution: Send in the robots. 
</P>
<P>
To test the feasibility of such a situation, the Air Force has granted a 
contract to Odetics, an Anaheim technology company, to study how robots could 
be used to do the job. The firm is developing a system, dubbed Rapid Runway 
Repair, in which remotely controlled robotic vehicles would be used to clear a 
runway within two hours after an attack, Odetics officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force believes robots may offer several advantages over using humans 
for the same tasks. Those benefits include "a reduction in manpower for repair 
operations, savings of vehicles and facilities maintained for runway repair and 
the removal of personnel from the hazards of working in a post-attack 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Odetics said it expects to complete the study early in 1990. The company did 
not provide a specific dollar value for the Air Force contract. Compiled by

REPORT CRITICIZES ARIZONA UTILITY SDG&amp;E HAD HOPED TO MERGE WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucson Electric Power, the utility that San Diego Gas &amp; Electric had hoped 
to merge with in 1988, has repeatedly ignored its customers while attempting to 
reward its managers and shareholders, a recent Arizona Corporation Commission 
report claims. 
</P>
<P>
TEP has shown an "emphasis on shareholder and management compensation and 
disregard for its customers," according to ACC Hearing Officer Jerry Rudibaugh. 
TEP has "a very unhealthy attitude for a regulated company," Rudibaugh 
concluded. The comments were part of a 70-page report that recommended against 
granting TEP a 31% electric rate increase. Rudibaugh recommended that TEP's 
rate increase be limited to 11.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The report was welcomed by some local observers who believe that San Diegans 
would be better served if SDG&amp;E abandoned a proposed merger with Southern 
California Edison and resurrected last year's aborted merger with TEP. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report hits hard at current and past management, it does not take 
issue with the fact that TEP is a relatively small utility with a short-term 
glut of generating capacity and a highly desired web of transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Better Bargain 
</P>
<P>
"I would be concerned . . . if Tucson were to take over SDG&amp;E," said 
Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San 
Diego-based consumer group. "But if SDG&amp;E were to take over Tucson, they'd 
take over the resources and transmission lines that are available, not the 
management team." 
</P>
<P>
"If Tucson Electric Power was a good bargain last year, then it's an even 
better bargain this year," said Peter Navarro, a University of San Diego 
professor and chairman of Prevent Los Angelization Now, a San Diego-based 
consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger with TEP, which was announced in June, 1988, fell apart in 
November shortly after Rosemead-based Southern California Edison made a 
surprise bid for SDG&amp;E. TEP was unwilling to get involved in what was sure 
to be a long and costly effort to fend off Edison's bid. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening negotiations with TEP "is the single most important thing the City 
Council could be doing, outside of its regulatory hearings," Navarro said 
Monday. "It's very important that the council send an emissary to both the 
regulatory authorities and the company in question to explore that 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro believes that San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor should "get on the phone 
to (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom Page's equivalent at TEP" to determine if the 
utility wants to reopen merger talks. Council members could then "pass a 
non-binding resolution recommending that SDG&amp;E reopen discussions," Navarro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shames and Navarro want merger talks reopened, they have found little 
support at the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC has not included an 
SDG&amp;E/TEP merger in a list of scenarios that regulators will study along 
with the proposed merger between SDG&amp;E and Edison. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their review, commissioners have ordered the utilities to explain 
what would happen if the merger were not completed and what would occur if 
SDG&amp;E were simply to buy power from Edison rather than merge. "We've been 
pushing for (a second look at the TEP merger) but the commission is reluctant," 
Shames said. "I think it's a viable scenario. In fact, it's more viable now 
than it ever was." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E spokesman Dave Smith declined to comment on the Arizona commission 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Rudibaugh's report is but one step in a complex rate-making procedure that the 
Arizona utility must complete before adding generating plants and other 
facilities to its rate base. Shareholders would be forced to make up the 
difference if regulators determine that a new facility would not benefit 
ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Select Decisions 
</P>
<P>
TEP has taken several actions that are counter to the interest of TEP 
customers, according to Rudibaugh, who has recommended that the commission trim 
TEP's $80-million rate increase to $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
His report hit hard at those select decisions. "We cannot and will not permit 
ratepayers to pay for unneeded power resulting from imprudent decision," 
Rudibaugh stated. 
</P>
<P>
Rudibaugh also has demanded that TEP shareholders absorb $850,000 in management 
bonuses because the company's "management compensation already exceeded the 
industry average." In a related development earlier this summer, Einar Greve, 
TEP's former chairman unexpectedly resigned just days after selling most of his 
TEP stock. 
</P>
<P>
Rudibaugh also took issue with TEP's plan to have customers absorb the 
$32.5-million purchase of a coal mine. Rudibaugh determined that the mine 
purchase was "imprudent. . . . It is not clear that it will ever be used to 
benefit ratepayers."

BONDHOLDERS SEEK SHARE OF ANY DAMAGES RECOVERED; 
</P>
<P>
CREDITORS GROUP SEES LINCOLN SUIT AS BOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The recent federal racketeering lawsuit against the former operators of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan opens the door for bondholders and other creditors of the 
thrift's bankrupt parent to recoup $363.1 million in debts, according to papers 
filed Monday in federal courts in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The committee for unsecured creditors in Lincoln's parent, American Continental 
Corp., contends that if the government's racketeering allegations are true, 
then Irvine-based Lincoln was a perpetrator, not a victim, so creditors are 
entitled to share in any damages recovered by S&amp;L regulators on behalf of 
depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's motion, filed in U.S. District Court and in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, seeks to consolidate Phoenix-based American Continental's bankruptcy 
proceedings with those of 11 Lincoln subsidiaries and with Lincoln's 
receivership as well. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental and the Lincoln subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy 
protection April 13, and regulators seized Lincoln the next day. In early 
August, regulators declared the S&amp;L insolvent and put it in receivership. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators on Sept. 15 sued Charles H. Keating Jr., American 
Continental's chairman, and six other corporate executives, alleging that they 
devised a racketeering scheme to siphon $1.1 billion in federally insured 
deposits from the S&amp;L for their own use. The suit also accused them and 30 
other defendants of bank fraud and other wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the government's racketeering allegations are true," said 
Donald Gaffney, an attorney for the unsecured creditors. "But if the government 
is right, then the remedies run to all the bondholders, just as they run to the 
depositors." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion, 
making the S&amp;L failure the biggest ever. Regulators are hoping to recoup 
some of the cost of the failure from the sale of the assets of Lincoln and its 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for regulators said they will fight efforts by American Continental's 
creditors to recover losses from those assets. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Manning, a Kansas City lawyer who led the legal team in designing the 
racketeering suit for regulators, called the effort by the committee's lawyers 
"pretty sophomoric" and suggested that "they sit down and study the 
(racketeering) complaint." 
</P>
<P>
The creditors committee, a group usually formed in bankruptcies, includes about 
22,000 people who bought nearly $200 million in American Continental debt 
securities through Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. Most were elderly 
depositors who believed mistakenly that the securities were insured by the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to consolidate the 12 bankruptcies and the Lincoln receivership is 
aimed at halting regulators from liquidating Lincoln and at turning the 
S&amp;L's operations over to a third party to conserve assets while 
reorganization plans are determined. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court, meanwhile, is scheduled to hear arguments Friday on a 
motion by regulators to dismiss the bankruptcy petitions of Lincoln's 
subsidiaries.

AT LONDON AUCTION, ART'S NOT REAL, IT'S MEMOREX

A man from Barcelona who copies famous works of art brought 244 of them to 
London and sold them all Friday for $238,600. 
</P>
<P>
"They represent the work of about six months in my studio," said the painter 
Miguel Canals in an interview during the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an artist and this is my hobby, but as I am a Catalan, people say it's my 
business," he confided as auctioneer Nicholas Bonham briskly rattled through 
the copied Titians, Monets, Goyas and van Goghs. 
</P>
<P>
They took from 20 to 40 seconds to sell for a few hundred to a few thousand 
dollars each in the packed Bonhams salesroom in Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy with the prices," said Canals, a short, dark man in his mid-50s, 
watching the sale impassively with his wife Fernanda. 
</P>
<P>
From across the floor the Renaissance Madonnas, Dutch interiors, English 
hunting scenes, life-size portraits and sun-kissed impressionists looked very 
much like their celebrated originals. 
</P>
<P>
Some had been treated to look aged, and tiny, deliberate mistakes could 
sometimes be spotted, "so that future experts will be able to distinguish them 
from the originals," said Bonham. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, a copy of the world's most expensive painting, Vincent van Gogh's 
"Irises," was there. The original sold for nearly $54 million at Sotheby's in 
New York in 1987 but the copy cost only $4,080 after 40 seconds' bidding on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Top price was $7,500 for a canvas after Claude Monet of the bridge over the 
artist's famous waterlily pool in his garden at Giverny near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The Canals are the same size as the originals, in the same media -- oil, 
pastel, crayon or watercolor -- and set in elaborately gilded plaster or wood 
frames. On a quick glance they appear to be the real thing. Each is stamped on 
the back, "From the Studio of Miguel Canals." 
</P>
<P>
Among the buyers were interior decorators who said the pictures would look good 
in smart homes and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Irish rock singer Bob Geldof looked in and said: "I think these are a good buy. 
After all, half the paintings hanging on the walls of the world's museums are 
fakes." 
</P>
<P>
Merle Birkmyre, a Londoner, said when asked why anyone would buy one of the 
paintings from Spain, said: "I feel people will buy a copy of a painting after 
growing up with a print of it which they love." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who specified that he not be identified -- "because I have two van 
Gogh original drawings" -- said he bought a "van Gogh" and a "Seurat" because 
"they look authentic and they will look very nice, and most of my friends won't 
know the difference from the originals by midnight." 
</P>
<P>
One copy of a familiar beach scene by Eugene Boudin, was miscatalogued as 
"After Eugene Canals." 
</P>
<P>
"That's wrong," said Bonham to giggles from the floor. "This is definitely a 
Boudin." 
</P>
<P>
It went for $600. 
</P>
<P>
Bonham said later that Canals' clients include owners of very expensive works 
of art who commission him to paint a copy for the wall while they keep the 
original in a safe. 
</P>
<P>
Canals has half-a-dozen assistants who may all work on one painting as each is 
a specialist in something -- faces, dresses, flowers, trees or ships. 
</P>
<P>
He said, yes, he also paints originals -- "but it is not important."

The Costa Mesa City Council has named four of seven members to the board of 
directors of the newly created Costa Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Corp., an 
agency formed last month that could generate millions of dollars for the city's 
arts programs. The members, all Costa Mesa residents, are Susan Krause, Frank 
Cole, Mike Chitjian and Ronald Bauer. None is affiliated with local arts 
organizations, but Chitjian serves on the city's Cultural Arts Committee, said 
Ann Gyben, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Three other board members, including two to represent the city's hotel 
industry, will be named at Monday's City Council meeting. The full board 
eventually will determine the new corporation's overall goals, spending 
policies and its funding mechanism, now being developed by City Council staff. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Costa Mesa arts groups received $159,000 from the city. The new 
corporation, which may be funded through fees charged hotel and motel guests, 
could bring in $2 million annually for arts and tourism, city officials have 
said.

PASSAGE IN CHINA TRAVEL BOOK OFFENDS NEWPORT PATRON

Public complaints about the content of certain books is not limited locally to 
the Fullerton Library's current exhibit on the history of literary censorship. 
The Newport Beach library system recently received a complaint at one of its 
branches regarding a passage in "Riding the Iron Rooster," a 1988 travel memoir 
of China written by Paul Theroux. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tom Johnson, the city's assistant librarian, a patron objected to 
a passage with a translation from a Chinese book including "a rather graphic 
sexual incident" that Theroux was reading while riding a Chinese train called 
the "Iron Rooster." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson would not identify the patron or the branch where the written complaint 
-- actually a "request to reconsider" -- was filed. The patron did not 
specifically ask that the book be removed from the shelves, but after 
researching the book and the passage, a written response from the city library 
was sent to the individual explaining that the library would continue to make 
the book available. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, Johnson said, the response said that "we judge books on their 
merits in their entirety" and that, in this case, "we do recommend that it 
isn't of everyone's taste." Johnson said the library has its own "banned books" 
display on exhibit at its Newport Center branch. MARK I. PINSKY

CENSORSHIP'S ROLE EXAMINED IN FULLERTON COLLEGE DISPLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, buddy. Wanna get your hands on a real hot book? This baby's a sizzler. . . 
. We're talking inflammatory. Been banned almost a dozen times, you know. 
</P>
<P>
The title? "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" by Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised? Strange as it may seem, Samuel Clemens' children's classic -- like 
thousands of books through history -- has had a reputation for raising some 
folks' ire. Shortly after it was published in 1885, a librarian in Concord, 
Mass., banned it from her shelves, labeling it as "trash . . . suitable only 
for the slums." In 1905, objecting to Huck's unconventional attitudes, an 
administrator of the Brooklyn Public Library pulled the book from its 
children's collection because "Huck not only itched, but scratched, and . . . 
said sweat when he should have said perspiration." Libraries from Winnetka, 
Ill., to Houston banned the book in the 1960s, '70s and '80s on the complaint 
that Twain's portrayal of the runaway slave Jim was racist. 
</P>
<P>
"Huck Finn" is among more than two dozen books featured in Fullerton College's 
"Banned Book Display," a collection of historic and contemporary titles that 
have been banned, burned or bad-mouthed by libraries, school districts and 
special-interest groups worldwide. The exhibit, curated by senior library 
assistant Julie Dillon, continues through Saturday in the school's William T. 
Boyce Library. 
</P>
<P>
"Huck" keeps some unusual company in the show. Other books on display include 
"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" and "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female," 
a pair of hefty tomes released in 1948 and '53 by the Institute for Sex 
Research at Indiana University (both were banned at U.S. Army post exchanges in 
Europe for having "no worthwhile interest for soldiers"), Roald Dahl's 
children's story "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (for encouraging 
greediness), John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" and Lewis Carroll's "Alice in 
Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
"Censorship is something that inevitably happens," said Michele Fitzsimmons, 
the school's public services librarian. "There's always going to be something 
that someone doesn't like and wants removed. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that people like that think they're doing all of us a favor, 
but instead they're making decisions for the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton College exhibit dovetails with National Banned Books Week this 
week, an 8-year-old public-awareness effort sponsored in part by the American 
Library Assn. and endorsed by the Library of Congress's Center for the Book. 
According to campaign literature, the week's purpose is "to emphasize that 
imposing information restraints on a free people is far more dangerous than any 
ideas that may be expressed in that information." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fitzsimmons, book banning can be documented as far back as 387 BC 
and continues at a brisk rate today. 
</P>
<P>
"When most of us think of bannings, we imagine Hitler and the book burnings, 
the restrictions of Communist Russia, (or) the Inquisition," Fitzsimmons said. 
"You think it has to be better today, but really it's a constant thing. Some of 
(the banning attempts) make it to '60 Minutes'; some never make it beyond the 
library." 
</P>
<P>
The American Library Assn.'s Office of Intellectual Freedom reports about 500 
incidents of censorship each year, added Fitzsimmons, with most complaints 
centering on political or religious content, obscenity and objectionable 
language. 
</P>
<P>
J.D. Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye" has the dubious distinction of being among 
the most-criticized books in the United States, receiving an average of four 
complaints each year since its 1951 publication. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more recently banned books on display is Shel Silverstein's "The 
Giving Tree," the tale of a boy and a tree who is willing to give all she has 
to make him happy. As the boy ages, he demands more and more of her until there 
is little left to give. In the end, the boy -- now a bitter, lonely old man -- 
returns to her and finds comfort and a resting place on her stump. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the New York Times Book Review hailed it as a "parable on the joys of 
giving," and according to Dillon, the book is often used in Sunday schools to 
teach generosity. In 1988, a Colorado librarian at the Boulder Public Library 
officially ousted "The Giving Tree" from its collection on the grounds that it 
was "sexist." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Walker's novel "The Color Purple," from which the hit movie was drawn, 
earned the broadest range of complaints of any book in the show. School 
officials from Oakland to Newport News, Va., accused it of, among other things, 
presenting "troubling ideas about race relations, man's relationship to God, 
African history and human sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
Sex and religion are always good for controversy, so Dillon has dedicated an 
entire case to books on those topics that have been banned or challenged: The 
Koran and the Revised Standard Version of the Old Testament share shelf space 
with "God, the Universe &amp; Hot Fudge Sundaes," a young adult novel by Norma 
Howe that touches on evolutionism and creationism. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton College's Banned Book Display continues through Saturday at the 
William T. Boyce Library, 321 E. Chapman Ave. in Fullerton. Library hours are 
Monday through Thursday, 7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Admission is free. For information, call (714) 992-7061.

SHEVARDNADZE SAYS SOVIETS JOIN U.S. ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS, ISSUES NEW CHALLENGE

<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, going a step further than 
President Bush, said today that Moscow will match U.S. reductions in chemical 
weapons and he challenged the United States to ban the devices completely and 
to halt nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, in a speech to the General Assembly, said Moscow will join the 
United States and "radically reduce or completely destroy" all the chemical 
weapons it has stockpiled. 
</P>
<P>
But he also issued a new set of challenges. He said the Soviet Union will stop 
production of chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and stop making 
weapons-grade plutonium and uranium -- all if Washington reciprocates. 
</P>
<P>
The speech was a prompt reply from Moscow to Bush's proposal before the General 
Assembly Monday to drastically reduce chemical weapons stockpiles. The proposal 
was given to the Soviets during the weekend and announced by Bush in his U.N. 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Bush offered an 80% cut in U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles if the Soviets 
reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates in the hall, including Secretary of State James A. Baker III and 
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, gave Shevardnadze a warm round of applause 
after his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Baker met with the Soviet foreign minister for about seven minutes after the 
speech, but declined to say what they talked about. 
</P>
<P>
He said Shevardnadze's speech was "very responsive to the President's 
statement." He said he had to study it more closely but does not think the 
proposals went beyond those of the President. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to delegates of 159 nations, Shevardnadze said Moscow "is ready to 
reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions any day and hour, if the 
United States reciprocates." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has declared several such moratoriums, which the United States has 
declined to join. U.S. officials said the Soviets initiated such moratoriums 
after completing a series of tests.

RAPE SUSPECT SKETCH RELEASED; 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH VICTIM, 12, INTERVIEWED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and DAN WEIKEL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police today released a composite drawing of the man they believe raped a 
12-year-old girl he abducted over the weekend from an exclusive gated community 
in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Police also said there had been three burglaries since August at the Sea Cliff 
on the Greens complex that may have been related to the Sunday morning 
kidnaping and rape. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Bruce Young said police made the composite drawing Monday after 
reinterviewing the girl, who was pushed nude from her abductor's truck about a 
mile from her home. (Story, Part II, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is described as white, with dark, curly hair and a mustache. He is 
about 5-foot-8 and has a slim build. Young said the suspect drives a white or 
off-white compact pickup truck that is dirty and dented and bears blue and 
white California plates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Link Investigated 
</P>
<P>
Although police were unsure whether there was any connection between the girl's 
abduction and the three earlier burglaries at the complex, they were 
investigating any potential link between the various cases. Cash was taken in 
the three earlier burglaries but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"To date there are no substantial leads from the burglaries or the rape," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the kidnaper entered a two-story condominium in the 6000 block of 
Panorama Drive owned by the girl's father. The abductor slipped through an 
unlocked sliding glass door and confronted the girl, who was sleeping with a 
girlfriend on a living-room sofa bed. 
</P>
<P>
As the girlfriend slid under the covers and pretended to sleep, the man grabbed 
the victim by the arm, covered her mouth with his hand and carried her in her 
nightgown from the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was awakened by screams and ran to an upstairs window to see his 
daughter being carried away. Young said the father at first did not understand 
what was happening, suspecting that it might have been some prank by the girls, 
who were playing hide-and-seek and other games late the night before. The 
father called police after he talked with the girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our belief he really didn't really comprehend what had happened," Young 
said. "He looked for her around the complex, but he didn't have any suspicions 
until he talked to her friend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help From Public Asked 
</P>
<P>
Eight investigators have been assigned to the case and the public is encouraged 
to call Huntington Beach Police Detective Don Howell at 960-8811 or 969-2272 
with any information on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The girl is now staying with her mother, who lives outside Huntington Beach. 
The parents are divorced and the girl was visiting her father when the incident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
When police first tried to interview her, the girl was in shock and could 
provide only sketchy details, Young said. But her recollections of the incident 
had vastly improved when the girl was reinterviewed Monday. She provided 
numerous details for the composite drawing of the assailant, whom she did not 
know, and other aspects of the crime, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said several sections of the complex are still under construction, 
allowing ready access to the community despite the security gates. If anything, 
he said, the gates and fences had only given residents "a false sense of 
security." He urged that residents be more aware of suspicious activity.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica beach lifeguard was accosted on his watchtower this morning by a 
transient who demanded money and stabbed him with a corkscrew when he refused, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The lifeguard, Terry Hearst, 34, fell about 10 feet from the tower railing onto 
the sand as he tried to back away from the transient's weapon, which left a 
three-inch gash on his chest, Lt. Al Bonner said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year veteran lifeguard was treated at Santa Monica Hospital Medical 
Center and was undergoing X-rays to determine whether he suffered any back or 
neck injuries in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The transient, described only as an unshaven, barefoot white man in his early 
30s, escaped.

Officers used tear gas to quell a jail riot early today and then negotiated an 
end to a standoff with 150 other inmates who barricaded themselves in their 
dorms with piled-up furniture, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Six officers and six inmates were taken to a hospital as a precaution, but no 
serious injuries were reported in the uprising at the 2,700-inmate jail on 
Rikers Island, said Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 inmates set fires and blockaded their dorm with mattresses, 
complaining that one of two men removed earlier from the unit for fighting had 
been unfairly punished, Ryles said.

Forty-eight hours of tapes secretly recorded by former President Richard M. 
Nixon will be released in April unless Nixon or others involved in the 
recordings object, National Archives officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The new tapes are among more than 4,000 hours of recordings made on a secret 
White House monitoring system between 1971 and 1973, at a time when abuses of 
power were being committed that led to Nixon's political downfall and the 
jailing of many of his aides. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon resigned the presidency in August, 1974, under threat of impeachment in 
the Watergate scandal.

An East German emissary today told 1,200 East Germans holed up in the West 
German Embassy that they can legally emigrate to the West but first must return 
home, a spokesmen for the refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Vogel arrived today to speak to representatives of the East Germans 
who have crowded the garden of the West German Embassy in the hope of obtaining 
safe passage to the West. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Vogel, 50 or 60 East Germans boarded a bus that reportedly 
took them to a Prague railroad station for the trip back to East Germany. The 
others, however, remained in the embassy quarters and it was unclear if they 
had refused the East German offer. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel is an East Berlin lawyer who has close contacts with the East German 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees who took part in the negotiations told reporters waiting outside the 
embassy that Vogel gave them a personal guarantee they may emigrate once they 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
Already, more than 20,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany via Hungary, 
which incensed East Germany's Communist leaders when Hungary opened its border 
to the West on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, Poland, dozens of other East Germans arrived Monday outside the 
closed West German Embassy to seek passage to the West. Some said they swam 
rivers by night or walked through forests on the Polish-East German border.

KILLINGS MAR QUAYLE VISIT TO MANILA;

Gunmen believed to be Communist rebels ambushed and killed two American 
civilians working at a U.S. air base today shortly before Vice President Dan 
Quayle arrived to discuss the future of U.S. military installations here, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
As Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, arrived, hundreds of leftists burned his 
effigy and an American flag while chanting, "Bases out! Quayle go home!" 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon statement in Washington said the victims were civilian employees of 
Ford Aerospace Corp., a contractor at Camp O'Donnell. The camp is a U.S.-run 
facility about 50 miles north of Manila and 12 miles from the U.S. Clark Air 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presidential Guard Killed 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, gunmen killed a member of President Corazon Aquino's presidential 
guard, about a mile from where she will meet with Quayle on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks followed a series of bombings this month and came amid growing 
opposition to U.S. military installations in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans, whose names were not immediately released, slowed their car as 
they approached a dump truck and a jeep blocking a highway near Capas, 60 miles 
north of Manila, police said. Six men sprang from the jeep and riddled the 
Americans' car with gunfire, according to Police Lt. Pepito Pimentel. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants then opened the car door and pumped bullets into the victims, 
Pimentel said. The attack occurred about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Florentino Amorabon, a spokesman for the Philippine Constabulary in 
central Luzon island, said the assassins were believed to be members of the New 
Peoples Army, which operates in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James Rowe as he was driving to the 
headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military Assistance Group in Quezon City, near 
Manila. In October, 1987, rebels killed three Americans in simultaneous attacks 
outside Clark Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
The United States operates Clark, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller 
installations in the Philippines, but there are increased calls for an end to 
the U.S. military presence. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle arrived in Manila about 7:30 p.m. from Japan for a visit expected to 
focus on the future of the bases, which operate under a lease that expires in 
September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Foreign Secretary Manuel Yan said Quayle was bringing a letter from 
President Bush believed to include a proposal to begin talks on extending the 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noisy Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before Quayle's arrival, about 150 members of the League of Filipino 
Students and the Youth for Nationalism and Democracy reached the airport 
terminal and began a noisy demonstration against the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters shouted, "Quayle go home, bases out!" and "Yankees go home!" They 
carried banners reading, "Quayle visit -- a curse." 
</P>
<P>
After negotiations with police, the group agreed to pull back about half a mile 
away along the main road into Manila. Police estimated that the crowd grew to 
nearly 1,000 by the time Quayle arrived.

A subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Whittaker Corp. and two former executives 
pleaded guilty today to charges they bribed a Marine Corps contracting official 
to increase the value of Pentagon electronic contracts their company obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker Command and Control Systems pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud 
the government and two counts of bribing former Marine Corps official Jack 
Sherman with nearly $75,000 between 1982 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines, civil penalties 
and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Scott M. Lamberth, 59, the former head of the subsidiary, and John F. Van 
Tassel, ex-director of operations at its Fayetteville, Ark., facility, also 
entered guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
The plea by the Whittaker subsidiary is the third by a corporation since the 
investigation began last year. Teledyne Electronics and Hazeltine Corp. have 
both entered guilty pleas for their roles in the procurement scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaware of Scheme 
</P>
<P>
According to court papers, officials of Whittaker Corp. were unaware of the 
bribery scheme, which began before the company acquired the subsidiary in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The bribery scheme allegedly began in 1982 when the company was known as Lee 
Telecommunications and continued two years after its acquisition by Whittaker. 
</P>
<P>
Lamberth was a stockholder of the company and became head of the subsidiary 
following its acquisition by Whittaker. Court papers said Lamberth hid the 
scheme from Whittaker officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lamberth faces a possible 20-year sentence and fines up to $500,000. Van Tassel 
could be sentenced to up to 15 years and fined $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton scheduled a Dec. 15 sentencing proceeding for both defendants, who have 
agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

The Rice Growers Assn. said today it will cut 61 jobs as part of a major 
restructuring of its operations designed to save the co-op $2 million in the 
current crop year and improve returns by up to $4 million for the 1990 crop. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the cooperative to close its two landmark mills in West 
Sacramento and exercise options to either expand operations of its mills at 
Woodland and Biggs or utilize excess processing capabilities available in the 
California rice industry. 
</P>
<P>
RGA President and Chief Executive Officer David Long said 40 union workers and 
21 administrators will lose their jobs under the change in operations.

Orders for "big ticket" durable goods, boosted by robust automobile sales, 
rebounded a strong 3.8% in August for their steepest advance this year, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items expected to last 
more than three years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $126.7 billion, their 
biggest increase since a 7.4% advance last December. 
</P>
<P>
The August advance came after a bigger decline than previously thought in July. 
July orders fell 2.5% rather than the 1.9% originally reported. Orders had 
risen 1.3% in June. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods orders, a bellwether of the economy's performance, have bounced 
up and down throughout the year.

Britain today notched up its third worst monthly current account deficit -- a 
gap of $3.2 billion in August. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit was a fractional improvement over a revised shortfall of $3.54 
billion in July but was much larger than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The pound fell on the news by almost one cent to $1.6050 but recovered soon 
afterward and by mid-morning in New York was trading at $1.6210. 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said the deficit in the current account -- a balance of 
payments for imports and exports and invisible items such as banking, insurance 
and tourism -- was a blow to the Conservative government's hopes of cooling the 
economy through its policy of high interest rates.

In a final snub to his estranged daughter, the murdered father of runner Zola 
Budd has barred the South African-born athlete from his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Budd gave instructions in his will, which was read today, that Zola and 
her two sisters should not be allowed at the graveside.

<P>
Budd, 56, was shot dead last week in his farmhouse home near the Orange Free 
State town of Bloemfontein. A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Budd became estranged from the rest of the family around the time she took 
British citizenship to evade anti-apartheid boycotts and take part in the 1984 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Budd's sister, Joyce Evans, told state radio that her brother had 
since made peace with his children and would have changed his will had it not 
been for his untimely death.
