Beverly Hills police might have nominated Zsa Zsa. Casual pot smokers would 
certainly have voted for L.A. Police Chief Daryl Gates. Some L.A. County 
residents would have opted for malathion. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the above made Spy Magazine's prestigious 1990 list of "The 100 
Most Annoying, Alarming and Appalling People, Places and Things." 
</P>
<P>
It's not really surprising. You know how snooty Eastern publications tend to 
ignore the West. But even Spy had to include Raiders wheeler-dealer Al Davis 
and junk-bond crook Mike Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Keser's car doubles as a mobile personal ad.

<P>
"Wife Wanted," blares a sign on the back of his VW Rabbit. In smaller print, it 
adds, "Or Live-Together Mate." There's also a phone number for the Lovelorn of 
the Lanes to jot down. 
</P>
<P>
Keser, a 39-year-old aspiring actor who has been married previously, said, "I 
haven't had much luck finding a woman the regular way. I mean, I could pick up 
someone in a nightclub. But if I marry her that's where she's gonna be (in a 
nightclub) when I'm working at night." Keser, who said he's displayed the sign 
"off and on" since January, reports he's heard from "a few women" as well as 
several pranksters. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I also hear from other guys who say they wish they had the courage 
to do what I'm doing. They ask if they can have some of my leftover phone 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
The license plate frame on L.A. City Fire Engine No. 43 says: "This is the 
E-Ticket Ride." 
</P>
<P>
The freeways are more congested than ever and the price of gasoline is ticking 
ever upward. But one oil company wants to help out the motorist, as only an oil 
company can. Local Shell outlets are offering "Cruisin' Classics" tapes for 
"$1.99 each, with 8-gallon fill-up." The cruisin' hits include "Ventura 
Highway" by America. Really puts you in the mood to burn up $1.40 per gallon in 
rush-hour traffic, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the Let-the-Computer-Do-the-Thinking attitude, Lynn Dickhoff 
of Topanga cites the postal clerk who informed her that the cost of mailing two 
small calendars would be $103.80. 
</P>
<P>
Before the mistake was discovered -- the computer hadn't cleared the previous 
customer's $99 money order -- Dickhoff commented that $103.80 seemed a bit 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the tax," the clerk said.

ALL THAT ANYONE CAN ASK FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected Thursday to approve the nomination 
of Judge David H. Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court and send it to the Senate 
floor. There, his confirmation seems virtually assured. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the only serious opposition to Souter's nomination has come from 
feminist and other civil rights groups concerned over his refusal to declare 
his position on any challenge to Roe vs. Wade. To those who hold that 
reproductive rights are a fundamental human liberty -- and The Times is among 
them -- Souter's reticence on this question is troubling. But, in this instance 
at least, such anxiety should not be decisive. 
</P>
<P>
Americans invest more confidence in their judges, particularly those on the 
Supreme Court, than any other people on Earth. We expect them to exhibit "the 
wisdom of Solomon," forgetting that in the most celebrated of the cases Solomon 
adjudicated, he got lucky. If the mother in that famous dispute had been half 
as lacking in conscience as her opponent, king and litigants would have been 
left looking at a dismembered baby. But Solomon, having thought deeply on the 
nature of maternal love, trusted that, at the moment of truth, it would reveal 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Historical experience suggests that the selection of Supreme Court justices 
entails just such an informed leap of faith. Senators must determine whether 
the nominee holds to humane and legally sound principles of constitutional and 
human rights, then trust that the future justice will apply them in an 
intelligent, unbiased and open-minded fashion. To do otherwise would be to 
return the court to the turbulent days of the 19th Century, when the Senate 
rejected more than one in four nominees, often for vindictive and venal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Souter has affirmed his basic belief that "the due process clause of the 
14th Amendment does recognize and does protect an unenumerated right to 
privacy" to which he attaches a "fundamental importance." Similarly, his other 
responses mark him as a well-qualified and pragmatic centrist, fully in the 
mainstream of American legal thought. 
</P>
<P>
At this moment, that is all a Senator, or anyone else, has a right to ask.

DE KLERK DESERVED TO BE HEARD; 
</P>
<P>
BUT CONGRESS WILL RIGHTLY INSIST ON MORE MOVES FROM HIS GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederik W. de Klerk can take great pride in becoming the first South African 
president to be welcomed at the White House in 42 years. But he needs to 
realize that his chief political problem in America is not with President Bush, 
who extended a warm welcome to the head of state, but with Congress. Many 
legislators are unconvinced that it's anywhere near time to modify or suspend 
economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the President was playing good cop to the "bad cops" that are sure to 
dominate any debate in Congress over prematurely relaxing the Comprehensive 
Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. That law requires South Africa to meet five 
conditions to gain relief from economic penalties. It also gives the President 
the discretion to relax sanctions if fewer conditions are met, but only if 
South Africa demonstrates substantial progress toward dismantling apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk does deserve great encouragement for releasing Nelson Mandela, 
unbanning the African National Congress and other political parties, freeing 
some political prisoners, allowing exiles to return home and lifting the 
oppressive state of emergency in all but the troubled Natal province. Those 
actions satisfy two of the terms imposed by Congress, but more must be done to 
trigger the easing of economic penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty million black South Africans are still legally classified -- and 
pervasively penalized -- by race from cradle to grave. The pillars of 
apartheid, such as the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act, 
remain on the books. These and other laws restrict voting rights, education and 
even where a person can live on the unfair basis of race or color. 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the spirit and the letter of the anti-apartheid act, the South 
African government must rescind all racially restrictive laws, free all 
political prisoners and guarantee every adult a full voice in the government. 
That level of change will demonstrate irreversible progress toward a nonracial 
democracy. That level of progress will merit the lifting of sanctions.

AIR FORCE CHIEF FIRED FOR REMARKS ON IRAQ STRIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Dugan was fired for candor, for saying in public what is evidently said at 
the White House and Pentagon in private. I find this approach to Dugan 
stupefying because his nonsensical ideas were his real problem, not his candor. 
</P>
<P>
Crudely put, he argued that the U.S. military lost the Vietnam War because it 
was constrained in its use of air power. If these constraints were lifted in a 
war against Iraq, the U.S. military could this time obtain a quick and decisive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Gen. Dugan has time on his hands, I suggest he re-learn the history of 
the Vietnam War. His military colleagues, as well as those in the White House, 
Congress and the press could also benefit from the same lessons. 
</P>
<P>
In order to "bomb them back to the Stone Age," the U.S. government relied 
heavily and ineffectively on massive aerial bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia. 
Facing outmoded air defenses, it engaged in carpet bombing of North Vietnam and 
totally destroyed rural agriculture in Cambodia. Furthermore, air power was 
also used for napalm, Agent Orange and cluster bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy not only failed, it backfired. More than 3,000 planes were shot 
down and more than 500 surviving crew members captured. Nevertheless, the 
resolve of the Vietnamese was hardened and the chaos we created in Cambodia 
brought the Khmer Rouge to power. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan is now gone, but Washington's other born-again hawks ought to mull over 
this history before they so eagerly march more young men and women off to war.

'REFORMS' THAT AREN'T; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SOME PROPOSALS WOULD JUST MAKE CAMPAIGNS MORE BORING, WHEN AMERICANS 
ARE BUSIER THAN EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN E. SCHIER, Steven E. Schier is a professor of political science at 
Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This campaign autumn is justifiably called a "silly season" for two reasons. 
One is the traditional surfeit of posturing, distortion and outright lies by 
candidates for office. The second reason, more evident than usual, is the 
abundance of campaign reform ideas that are just plain dumb. 
</P>
<P>
One would think, from the fevered cries of Common Cause and various members of 
Congress, that our electoral system had hit new depths of corruption that no 
sensible citizen could tolerate. Such gross exaggerations win headlines for 
lobbyists and lawmakers but ignore the real reasons why steadily fewer people 
bother to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The simple fact is that citizens are busier and more distracted from politics 
than at any previous time in the history of the republic. As two-paycheck 
marriages become the norm, mom and dad have less time for the children and 
perhaps none at all for politics. The same applies, double, to ever-increasing 
single-parent households. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Americans in the past worked hard, but for our forebears politics 
was often a raucous spectator sport. No more. Why bother with the droning of 
candidates when cable television, professional sports and Nintendo are at hand? 
The simple fact is that Americans have at their disposal more immediate 
entertainment. Is it any wonder that politics seems less important, 
particularly to the young, who wallow in electronic distraction? 
</P>
<P>
Given this situation, proposals to restrict political commercials to a "talking 
head" format or to ban the notorious 30-second spots would only reinforce mass 
indifference. The solution to electronic politics is not to make it more 
boring, though certainly that is what many prim reformers have in mind when 
they ask for more "serious discussion of the issues." 
</P>
<P>
Many reformers also claim that too much money is spent in election campaigns. 
The recently passed Senate campaign reform bill operates on that premise by 
establishing spending limits. But why, when electoral politics is already 
crowded out by distractions, try to limit its ability to reach people through 
the media? Unless candidates are granted big blocks of time to use as they 
wish, less spending on TV will mean that even fewer voters will learn anything 
about who is running and why. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly some reforms are needed. Access to money for competing candidates 
needs to be made more equal, and political consultants need to chastise 
miscreants in their trade more severely. But keep the race lively and very much 
on television, or voters will keep deserting the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The elite interest groups and politicians dominating the debate on campaign 
reform have forgotten the circumstances of the average voter. Unless campaigns 
touch more people where they live -- by the television -- in a engaging way, 
our polling booths will gather dust.

DIPLOMACY: SAUDI ARABIA ASKS THE JORDANIAN MONARCH TO EXAMINE HIS NATION'S PAST 
ACTIONS BEFORE HURLING CRITICISM AT HIS ARAB NEIGHBOR.

By BANDAR IBN SULTAN, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan is the Saudi ambassador to the 
United States. This is excerpted from a speech delivered Tuesday on CNN. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You say, Your Majesty, that the Holy places in Saudi Arabia have been 
desecrated by friendly forces and those forces must leave immediately. But 
those forces are actually hundreds of miles away and with tens of thousand 
Muslim and Arab forces (of which your forces are not among them) between those 
friendly forces and the holy places. And all those forces are dedicated to 
helping defend Saudi Arabia and are respectful of its custodianship of the holy 
places, and will not leave until your friend Saddam Hussein leaves Kuwait, 
which we hope will be peacefully and immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Tell us, Your Majesty, what you have done to safeguard the Al Aqsa Mosque and 
the Church of the Holy Sepulcher that you lost to the Israelis in 1967. Is that 
the kind of protection that you want us to give to the holy places in Saudi 
Arabia? 
</P>
<P>
Your Majesty, the holy places in Saudi Arabia are protected only by your 
brother Muslims, and no non-Muslim is anywhere around, as millions of Muslims 
can daily attest. And you know that to be a fact. 
</P>
<P>
And, Your Majesty, you claimed to defend the Palestinian people's right to self 
determination and a state of their own. And I support you in that. 
</P>
<P>
But you were responsible for the Palestinian homeland on the West Bank from 
1948 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Why in all that period did you not give them their rights and statehood? And 
how would the occupation of Kuwait give our brother Palestinians their 
homeland? 
</P>
<P>
Facts are stubborn things. 
</P>
<P>
You talk of "haves" and "have-nots." Saudi Arabia's record as one of the 
"haves" is clear in helping the "have-nots," and we are proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
Just turn to the records of your finance minister, and see how much has been 
given to you and your country for many years by Saudi Arabia, willingly and 
happily as brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Are not facts stubborn things? 
</P>
<P>
When you needed Saudi troops to help you, they came and spent 10 years in your 
country at your asking. And we did not question why or why not, nor raise ifs, 
ands or buts, as you do now. 
</P>
<P>
Facts are stubborn things. 
</P>
<P>
You are a very intelligent man, Your Majesty. And you have a fine memory. 
</P>
<P>
You say the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border is disputed and based on a historical record 
created by colonial British. 
</P>
<P>
Your Majesty, you should be the last one to say that. Not only all your 
borders, but your whole country was created by the colonial British. 
</P>
<P>
Facts are stubborn things indeed, Your Majesty. 
</P>
<P>
And do you remember when the British troops were invited by you into your 
country in 1958? We did not object or question your motives and judgment over 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Facts are stubborn things. 
</P>
<P>
You tell us that the situation today is like 1924 when the world was going to a 
war it did not want but could not stop, which led to World War I. 
</P>
<P>
That is not true. Your Majesty, we are today like the 1930s, when a madman 
decided to annex his neighbor and the world did nothing, which led to World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
These are facts. Facts are stubborn things.

<P>
Over the course of history, all land price bubbles have collapsed. In the past 
three decades, Japan has created the largest one by far. What happens when it 
bursts? The world is now so tightly connected that a serious impact will be 
felt in the capital markets everywhere. Most economic activity would be 
promptly inhibited. 
</P>
<P>
The total valuation of all the land in Japan is estimated at $20 trillion or 
more, an amount that could buy all the land in North America more than twice 
over. The Japan Land Agency reported a rise of 13% in the July '89-June '90 
period alone. The price of land in Japan is 3 to 30 times the global norm. 
</P>
<P>
The high prices were created by low taxes, speculation by corporations with 
high cash flows, a society-wide preference for landholding and home ownership, 
and regulations that prevent downside shifts. Administrators and academics in 
Japan have now begun to consider the stability problem seriously, but no 
solutions emerge. All recognize that any precipitous action would damage the 
economy. Restrictions have been placed on borrowing that uses? land as 
collateral, and more realistic taxes are being discussed. But such actions 
would only prevent further escalation of prices. Reductions in land price of 
10% to 15% per year are being considered, but there is no precedent for 
maintaining control over an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
Although the action to be taken is painful, it should result in some long-term 
benefit. Highly leveraged landholders could be asked for more collateral, 
leading to distress sales. The government might then set a price floor by 
creating a land bank, which is badly needed for urban redevelopment. It could 
halt the slide in price by offering to purchase land, for, say, half the 
appraised value before a set date, and then again pay half of the new appraised 
value in the same manner. This could be repeated until a new plateau is found. 
This policy would cause inflation, but it would simultaneously reduce rents to 
levels comparable to the rest of the world and reduce the likelihood of 
hyperinflation. Extensive public landholding would later allow the construction 
of urban environments better suited to a highly educated populace. 
</P>
<P>
Various triggers could set off a collapse in land price. A Tokyo Stock Exchange 
drop perhaps double or triple the size of the one experienced in August, a very 
sharp adjustment in the price of petroleum or a severe earthquake would be 
sufficient. Quite likely the trigger will be some event not yet imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Once a steep slide has begun, the effects build up quickly when so much wealth 
is at risk. More collateral is demanded on loans. Some land is put out for 
immediate sale. Quoted prices may be stable, but real transaction prices that 
take into account side payments would slide. Rumors magnify; concerns spread 
rapidly. Mortgage holding institutions scramble for liquidity. Suddenly the 
dimension reaches a scale that causes paralysis. Deal-making halts first in 
Tokyo, then New York, London and elsewhere because the ubiquitous Japanese 
financing is questioned. The exchange rate skids despite supports. 
</P>
<P>
In America, the cash to pay for Middle East oil is suddenly missing when 
Japanese purchase of U.S. bonds first halts, and then selling begins. The 
pressure on medium-term interest rates causes them to jump sky-high. American 
financial analysts have sometimes worried about such a stoppage, but no one has 
made sufficient preparations. All kinds of improvised crisis action will be 
attempted. If a depression results, it will be like no other the world has 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is considering preventive action, but the policy shift 
required by the scale of the problem is so drastic and unprecedented that it 
appears politically unfeasible. The expected asset value loss is about 50 times 
the S&amp;L debacle in the United States, and it would have to be accommodated 
in a much shorter time span. No one in Japan seems to have thought through the 
global consequences. Normal international contingency plans would be swamped by 
the scale of such a debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Other scenarios are possible but in our opinion less likely. It should be noted 
that Japanese manufacturing for export seems to be in good shape. In a 
financial storm it could serve as an employment stabilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Institutions worldwide should reduce their own vulnerability accordingly. Doing 
nothing is like not wearing a seatbelt when the warning sign goes on for 
unprecedented turbulence ahead.

Rourke, Otis Settle: Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis, co-stars of the steamy movie 
"Wild Orchid," have reached an agreement with the movie's producers over the 
selling of nude photos of the pair to Playboy magazine. The actors each filed 
suit in May seeking general and punitive damages against Vision Entertainment 
for the alleged unauthorized release of movie photographs that were printed in 
Playboy in June and in the April issue of the German magazine Kino. No details 
of the settlement were disclosed. SHAUNA SNOW

Soap Ends Story Line: NBC has acknowledged "unfortunate and misleading 
stereotypical portrayals" and abruptly ended a "Santa Barbara" story line that 
featured two warring Arab rulers, both of whom were holding Americans hostage. 
The acknowledgement came in response to a letter from the American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee, which demanded an end to that plot line and 
asked to meet with NBC producers. Amal Benedict, a spokeswoman for the Arab 
group, said that since the Persian Gulf crisis, "there is definitely more focus 
on Arabs in network drama, and they're being portrayed as villains. . . . The 
stereotyping that has gone on is just not factual." SHAUNA SNOW

Discrimination Called: Actors Danny Glover and Robert Guillaume lashed out at 
the entertainment industry Monday at the inaugural Robert Guillaume Script 
Writing Awards, charging that discrimination against blacks is a persistent 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the three awards, which went to students from Prairie View 
(Texas) A &amp; M University and Chicago State University, Guillaume said: "Our 
main hope here was to open doors that might not have ever been opened for 
minority writers. The way things stand now, there's no such thing as equal 
opportunity . . . in the entertainment industry." More than 100 colleges and 
universities participated in the screenwriting contest. SHAUNA SNOW

BRENDA RUSSELL GOES SLUMMING AT THE STRAND 
</P>

<P>
What is Brenda Russell doing singing stupid songs like "Stupid Love"? She's not 
Paula Adbul. Such bouncy pop-funk fluff is beneath her. 
</P>
<P>
At the Strand on Sunday, the singer-songwriter's set was punctuated with 
danceable throwaways that had commercialism written all over them. These songs, 
like "All-American," are from her latest album, "Kiss Me With the Wind." 
Russell is obviously hit-hunting, which is quite understandable. But she missed 
the mark with these up-tempo songs. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of material doesn't suit the dignified, elegant Russell, and she 
didn't really immerse herself in those get-down, funky songs. She seemed 
distant from them -- as if she were slumming. 
</P>
<P>
Russell is noted for intimate story songs -- "Dinner With Gershwin," "Night 
Train to Leningrad," her big hit "Piano in the Dark" -- that are filled with 
insightful observations and clever lyric touches. She might have been very 
successful earlier in the century, back when Porter and the Gershwins were 
active. 
</P>
<P>
With her high, rich voice backed by an instrumental quintet and three support 
singers, Russell scored on dramatic, emotion-drenched ballads. She has a strong 
sense for this kind of material and knows how to interpret it most effectively. 
Clearly, she felt comfortable with the ballads. 
</P>
<P>
Now if she'd just choose her up-tempo material more carefully.DENNIS HUNT

L.A. COUNTY PLAN TO EASE OBSTETRIC SYSTEM CHAOS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDI-CAL: PRIVATE HOSPITALS WOULD BE PAID DIRECTLY FOR SERVICES AS PART OF 
PROPOSAL TO EASE OVERCROWDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a novel program, Los Angeles County health officials have joined forces with 
the private sector in a plan to divert thousands of pregnant women to private 
hospitals to ease the tremendous overcrowding of the county's obstetrical 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the county has offered to cut Medi-Cal red tape for private 
hospitals and doctors by paying them directly for their services, then claiming 
reimbursement from the state under Medi-Cal guidelines. The plan also offers 
the incentives of filling empty obstetrical beds at some of the private 
hospitals, and of bringing some order to the current chaos in obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 21 private hospitals -- which collectively can provide about 300 
additional obstetrical spaces per month -- have agreed to participate. If all 
goes well, officials say the plan could be implemented within two months. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every hospital, public and private, is struggling with the problem of 
women showing up in labor in their emergency rooms without a doctor or any 
record of prenatal care. Overcrowding in the county health-care system -- from 
neighborhood health centers to the county's five hospitals with obstetrical 
services -- is largely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Things were so bad one Saturday last month at the county's Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center in Torrance that an exhausted staff obstetrician simply stopped 
admitting patients, even as they arrived at the hospital in labor. Instead, he 
handed them road maps, saying they would be better off delivering their babies 
elsewhere. Private hospitals in the area were marked on the maps. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed hospital administrators quickly declared the doctor's actions to be 
contrary to policy, and said no such diversion of patients would be attempted 
again, no matter how busy things were in the obstetrical unit. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Charles Brinkman, Harbor-UCLA's chief of obstetrics, will not guarantee 
that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a judgment about whether the conditions are safe," he said. "We are 
running at 130% above our designed capacity. We are staffed for 17 deliveries a 
day and are routinely hitting 25 to 35 a day. . . . The staff here are heroes 
in my eyes, and I am really upset that the community hasn't helped us out." 
</P>
<P>
The plan being formulated is just such a community effort, which is what makes 
it unique, local officials and the American Hospital Assn. say. Besides the 
county Department of Public Health, the major players are the Los Angeles 
County Medical Assn. and the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the crisis coming. We can see very clearly that the county is over 
capacity," said David Langness, the council's vice president for community 
relations. "What we are attempting to do is apportion out the overflow births 
from the county system to the private hospitals that are willing and able to 
deliver." 
</P>
<P>
The plan has two goals: to provide for the orderly use of existing hospital 
facilities for deliveries and to get women into care early in their pregnancies 
so they and their babies have the best chance. 
</P>
<P>
For the program to work, planners say, staff doctors at these hospitals must 
also be willing to participate. The medical association has given the health 
department the names of nearly 5,000 private obstetricians, pediatricians, 
anesthesiologists and family practitioners, all specialists involved at some 
point in the care of pregnant women and the safe delivery of their babies. 
</P>
<P>
The county mailed contracts to the doctors on the association's list earlier 
this month, accompanied by a letter of endorsement from medical association 
President David Chernof. It is still too early to predict how many will sign 
up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county health officials are negotiating with Medi-Cal authorities 
for approval of the plan's financial aspects. Both sides say agreement is near. 
</P>
<P>
Early prenatal care has not been an option for many poor women in Los Angeles 
County, particularly as the public health care system has seen its funding 
reduced while the number of people depending upon it for care has increased. 
The burden in obstetrics is especially acute because few private obstetricians 
are willing to accept Medi-Cal insured patients. This is a major factor in the 
current imbalance, with five county hospitals handling a crushing load of the 
county's 190,000 annual births while obstetrical units in some private 
hospitals have empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
Too much paperwork, slow reimbursement and outright refusal of claims are the 
reasons most cited by doctors and hospitals for washing their hands of Medi-Cal 
-- and the poor patients it serves. Last June, Medi-Cal stopped paying its 
bills altogether because of legislative delay on a supplemental appropriation. 
The program resumed payments in July, but the incident was yet another black 
mark on a record that already made the program a tough sell to health-care 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hitch, though. Medi-Cal requires hospitals receiving its money to 
offer a full range of care to publicly insured patients, not only single 
services such as obstetrics. Of the 130 hospitals in Los Angeles County, 70 
have Medi-Cal contracts, not enough to make the obstetrical program work. 
</P>
<P>
(In San Diego County, the obstetrical care issues are different, because most 
hospitals here do have Medi-Cal contracts, said Linda Bethel, project 
coordinator for the Perinatal Access Project, set up last year by the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
(Consequently, the main problem isn't getting the deliveries done, but trying 
to assure that women get prenatal care so they don't show up in emergency rooms 
at all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
(Bethel has been involved in discussions in which the county is trying to find 
a way to make it more attractive for obstetricians to care for patients. The 
proposal would have the county assume some of the responsibility for billing 
and other red tape of caring for Medi-Cal patients.) 
</P>
<P>
Few outside the system want to join, but a good number of these are willing to 
help out in a limited fashion in the obstetrics area, according to Langness. 
</P>
<P>
Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia is one. Its president, 
Frederick C. Meyer, said the pressure to join the obstetrical safety net came 
from doctors on the staff who knew of the "terrible overcrowding" at nearby 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
When the Hospital Council of Southern California pitched the cooperative plan, 
he readily signed up. 
</P>
<P>
The county medical association's Chernof, who has brought single-minded 
enthusiasm to the project, confesses to some dismay at how long it has taken to 
put the plan together. His involvement began last September. He worries that 
the incident at Harbor-UCLA, however unsanctioned, may scare hospitals and 
doctors who might otherwise participate in the program.

Cambodian resistance leaders said they are ready to reconvene a meeting to move 
their country closer to peace but are still awaiting agreement from the 
Vietnamese-backed government. Ek Sereywuth, a spokesman for resistance forces 
loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, said the resistance hopes that the Supreme 
National Council, which brings together all four warring Cambodian factions, 
will be able to reconvene in Bangkok, Thailand, this week to push forward a 
U.N. peace plan. The spokesman said that although Sihanouk agreed to Phnom 
Penh's demands for an extra seat on the council in return for naming him 
chairman, the resistance coalition is determined not to give in to Phnom Penh's 
demands that Premier Hun Sen be named council vice chairman.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is striking many more children than 
previously thought, the World Health Organization reported. The U.N. agency 
said in Geneva that the HIV virus that causes AIDS will probably infect 10 
million children by the year 2000. Already about 400,000 cases, or a third of 
the 1.2 million estimated cases of AIDS worldwide to date, are believed to have 
occurred in children under age 5.

National Medical Enterprises Inc.: The Santa Monica-based health-care services 
firm said first-quarter net income rose 19% to a record $59.6 million, while 
revenue dipped 10% to $894.8 million. The current quarter does not include 
revenue from domestic long-term care operations, which were spun off into a 
separate company called Hillaven Corp. in January. The firm attributed the 
profit performance to NME's General Hospital Group and ongoing profit growth in 
the Specialty Hospital Group.

SUSPECT'S PLANS FOR FAST ESCAPE WERE OUT OF LINE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DOUGLAS GIRARD WANTED TO 'BLEND IN' WITH THE CROWD AT A LA VERNE 
MCDONALD'S. INSTEAD, HE FOUND HIMSELF SADDLED WITH 20 HOSTAGES.

<P>
At the age of 10, Douglas Eric Girard was arrested for stealing a coop full of 
pigeons from the roof of a fish market. Like the birds he filched, his criminal 
career never quite took off. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's true, crime does not pay," he recently told a probation officer, 
noting that he has "made enough money to get by but not to get rich." 
</P>
<P>
Even his turn in the spotlight Monday, as the central figure in a 6 1/2-hour 
hostage incident, apparently was a result of a botched attempt to elude La 
Verne police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An officer responding to the robbery of a children's clothing store saw Girard 
and a companion, Frank M. Teresi, get into line at a nearby McDonald's, 
investigators said. If the two suspects were trying to blend in, they failed. 
Both were heavily tattooed, and wads of money bulged in their socks. Girard, 
witnesses said, carried a gun in his back waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the employees were huddling in the basement, customers had hit the 
floor and Girard had 20 captives, whether he wanted them or not. He paced, 
smoked cigarettes, changed his shirt and shrugged helplessly from time to time 
until sheriff's deputies stormed the restaurant shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
No one was harmed. "He never pulled the gun out," said Ramiro Gironas, the 
restaurant's assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a thief, but not a violent one," said Girard's younger brother, Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Girard -- known to his friends as "Dougie" -- has spent most of 
his life in and out of youth camps and jails. Police and court records say 
Girard and Teresi are both heroin addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Teresi, described by police as the alleged "driver of the getaway car and 
possible lookout," is a burly 38-year-old who weighs about 250 pounds and has a 
history of several convictions. 
</P>
<P>
He was captured by police in 1983 after accidentally shooting himself in the 
leg with a derringer. He pleaded guilty to three counts of armed robbery in 
March, 1984, and served three years of a six-year prison sentence, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Girard is a short man, with slicked-back, reddish brown hair, the fourth of six 
children. He was born to a mechanic and a housewife in Waco, Tex. The family 
moved when he was a youngster to Los Angeles' South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Phyllis Hernandez, said in an interview Tuesday that she was 
separated from her husband. "We were poor, real poor. We had to live in bad 
neighborhoods," Hernandez said. "We did have a roof over our head, but it was 
always scrounging." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Girard said his brother's first brush with the law occurred at age 10. 
He was arrested, along with some others, for stealing pigeons from a cage on 
the roof of a Wilmington fish market. The charges were later dropped, the 
younger Girard said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Girard kept stealing bikes and breaking into cars, his brother said. 
"All we knew was crime," Vincent Girard said. "Your surroundings make you what 
you are. And once you put a kid in jail, that's it. He just gets harder and 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Girard attended Miller Kilpatrick High School at a county Probation 
Department camp in the Malibu hills. 
</P>
<P>
Court records reveal almost annual convictions since 1976 for burglary and 
theft of, among other things, televisions, cameras, jewelry and videocassette 
recorders. When he was not in custody, a probation report said, he was a 
self-employed painter. 
</P>
<P>
In April, he was released on his own recognizance in a Riverside County 
burglary case. He was required to stay on 24-hour home detention with his 
mother and stepfather in San Jacinto, a small town about 25 miles southwest of 
Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He divided his time between his mother's house and that of a friend, Kathleen 
Newman, across the street. Girard "was thinking about going to school," Newman 
said. "He wanted to . . . just get something going for himself." 
</P>
<P>
In June, he was discharged from state parole. On July 11, he pleaded guilty in 
Riverside County Superior Court to one count of burglary. Sentencing was set 
for Sept. 17, but Girard did not show up. The judge issued a warrant for his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Then Monday, Newman said, she asked Girard to go to the store for her in her 
Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
He did not return, even though he had promised his mother to clean the bathroom 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Early the next morning, Vincent Girard called his mother into the room where he 
was watching television. There was Douglas on the screen, with blood on his 
shoulder and a puffy face. His brother had recognized him by a tattoo on the 
right side of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Douglas Girard phoned from jail. "I guess I'm not going to be able to do 
your bathroom," he said. 
</P>

HIGH RISK, LOW SECURITY AT FAST-FOOD STANDS; 
</P>
<P>
DANGER: NOT MUCH IS DONE TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, EXPERTS SAY. SOME 
FIRMS REFUSE TO GUARD THE RESTAURANTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Open all day and night, accepting only cash, fast-food restaurants are easy 
targets for armed robbers seeking a quick hit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the frequency of fast-food robberies -- several hundred last year in 
Los Angeles alone -- law enforcement authorities and safety experts say that 
customers and employees get little in the way of security. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's hostage standoff at a McDonald's in La Verne began with a suspect 
trying to escape a robbery rather than hold up the business, but the incident 
powerfully illustrates just how vulnerable fast-food restaurants can be. 
</P>
<P>
"If (a robbery) happens while you're inside one of these places, our advice is 
to stay alert and attentive to what the suspect is wearing and what kind of 
weapon he has," Los Angeles Police Detective Jerry Lafrois said. "Otherwise, do 
what he says. If he wants you to burn the place down, burn it down." 
</P>
<P>
Lafrois also pointed out that "very, very few fast-food restaurants have 
security guards on the premises. Only a few more are monitored by time-lapse or 
video cameras." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some security firms refuse to contract with fast-food establishments 
because of the risk they pose to guards and the potential liability the 
security company could face from anyone injured during crimes on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not handle fast-food restaurants at all," said Tom Reddin, former Los 
Angeles police chief and owner of Tom Reddin Security Services. "Our insurance 
company would blow its head off if they heard we took on a chain of fast-food 
restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, "A security guard carrying a weapon isn't necessarily the 
best-trained person in the use of that weapon," Reddin said. "If you're in a 
restaurant with an armed security guard and shooting starts, dive for the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
Argus Security, which provides guards for restaurants, including the bustling 
24-hour Tommy's Original World Famous Hamburgers downtown, is one of the 
handful that consider fast-food restaurants worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our security guards are armed -- they have to be because of the 
gangs," said Anna Perkins, a spokeswoman for Argus. "We have drive-bys and 
customers who get mean if they don't get their hamburgers fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a dispute over the slow delivery of food at a Compton taco stand in 
February led to a shoot-out during which an armed security guard and a 
suspected gang member were shot to death and a third person wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-food stands have been hit by violence ranging from robberies to a madman's 
reign of terror: 
</P>
<P>
* Twenty-two people were shot to death in a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro 
in 1984 by gunman James O. Huberty, who was killed by a police sniper. 
</P>
<P>
* Three suspected robbers were killed and a fourth was wounded Feb. 12 by nine 
police officers who watched the men force their way into a closed McDonald's in 
Sunland and rob its manager at gunpoint. After the robbers climbed into the 
getaway car, the officers fired 35 shots into the late-model Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
* A 17-year-old Lynwood girl who hesitated to hand over her ring to an armed 
robber was killed in August while waiting in line at the drive-up window of a 
Taco Bell. It was one of three shootings in one week at fast-food restaurants 
in Compton, and prompted city officials to call for armed guards to patrol the 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the violence and robberies of fast-food restaurants are "not confined 
to high crime rate areas," Lafrois said. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbers aren't stupid -- they know those restaurants in high-crime areas are 
so barred up they can't be robbed," Lafrois said. "Fast-food robberies are 
countywide." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Carl A. McMahan, who specializes in personal-injury cases, said that 
when violence erupts in these businesses, security guards -- rather than owners 
of the business -- become primary legal targets in lawsuits seeking 
compensation for injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"The duty of convenience-store owners depends upon the foreseeability of a 
crime occurring in their store with injury to a customer," McMahan said. "But 
that duty would be less strong than that of a private security company 
contracted to assume that responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Only the largest fast-food chains, such as Burger King and McDonald's, can 
afford security programs. But these companies acknowledge that this security 
often provides more "customer comfort" than protection. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, chain restaurants are equipped with sophisticated alarm 
systems. Their managers are advised to keep less than $75 in their cash 
registers and to "eyeball customers." 
</P>
<P>
"Good managers eyeball every customer that comes in the door," said the manager 
of a McDonald's restaurant who asked that his name not be used. "Most robbers 
case a joint first. If they see a manager slacking off, they'll do what they 
came to do." 
</P>
<P>
Added Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zwotow: "We have a security plan that we are 
constantly refining to protect our employees and our customers. We do our best, 
but every restaurant is vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
It is officially known in police circles as a "light and sound diversion 
device," but for members of police special weapons teams around the country it 
is usually called a "flash-bang grenade." The device, a five-inch-long 
cardboard cylinder filled with explosives, is designed to disorient a suspect 
with a deafening blast coupled with a bright flash of white light that can 
blind a suspect for several seconds. The device has been a standard tool in 
police arsenals and is most commonly used to break siege and hostage 
situations. The flash-bang is not designed to injure, but only to provide a 
powerful, momentary diversion.

POLICE LINKS TO GENTILE, MAINE INVESTIGATED; 
</P>
<P>
PROBE: FIVE OFFICERS AND A FORMER OFFICER ARE UNDER SCRUTINY IN THE MURDER OF 
ONE PROSTITUTE AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force is investigating at least five San Diego 
police officers and one former officer who may have associated with murdered 
prostitute Donna Gentile or her missing friend Cynthia Maine, two sources close 
to the investigation told The Times Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gentile and Maine were both police informants and both served time in jail. 
Gentile was found murdered in 1985, shortly after she testified against two 
police officers. Maine, also a prostitute, disappeared just after her 1986 
release from jail, where she had been serving four months for writing bad 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force is trying to find out where (Maine) is, but they believe she's 
dead," one source said. "They are thinking it's more than a coincidence that 
these six officers had some involvement with one prostitute who is dead and one 
who is missing." 
</P>
<P>
Task force spokesman Bonnie Dumanis confirmed Tuesday that investigators are 
looking at police officers who may have been linked to either woman. But she 
declined to say how many officers are under investigation or provide any 
details. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at anybody who had contact with Gentile or Maine, and that 
includes police officers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dumanis said she would like anyone with information about Maine to call the 
task force headquarters at 260-6400. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the task force searched the San Diego home of Sgt. Sal 
Salvatierra, who worked in internal affairs until Tuesday but has been 
transferred to the special projects unit. The Times reported Tuesday that the 
task force also searched Salvatierra's car, work locker and desk looking for 
photographs linking police officers with Gentile and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra could not be reached for comment. But his attorney, Everett 
Bobbitt, said his client is cooperating with the investigation. He said there 
is no evidence to link his client to Maine's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
A source told The Times that Salvatierra is among five officers under 
investigation for possible ties to Gentile and Maine. The source said another 
officer is John Fung, who had been working with the narcotics task force and 
used Maine as a police informant. Maine's family said she had been intimately 
involved with Fung for more than a year before her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Fung could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The former officer is Dennis Sesma, who resigned from the force in 1989, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Sesma said Maine used his name on a form that allowed 
jail officials to know that she was a police informant. Sesma said he had no 
relationship with Maine, other than dealing with her as a police informant who 
made undercover drug buys. He also defended Fung against the Maine family's 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"All John did was show concern for the lady," Sesma said. "He gave her money, 
sometimes from his own pocket, and he was like a surrogate father to her, 
helping her know what was right and wrong. It's not unusual for informants to 
develop an attraction to these guys." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police would not comment about the possibility that the task force is 
investigating their officers in regard to Maine's disappearance or Gentile's 
death. They referred all questions to the task force. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Maine was sentenced to a four-month jail term that 
began in September, 1985, for writing a series of bad checks to Mervyn's 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, San Diego Police Capt. Mike Tyler wrote the district attorney's 
office asking that Maine be released from the County Jail at Las Colinas by the 
end of that month. She was released with about two months left on her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Maine's probation report describes an abused heroin addict, who told her 
probation officer that she was molested by her grandfather from the time she 
was 5 to age 12. She worked in various jobs, including automobile sales and an 
animal hospital. Married in 1979, she filed for divorce in 1985 and gave birth 
to a son who is now 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Her father is former Police Officer Kenneth Maine, who died of a heart attack 
in late 1982 and had served on the force between 1967 and 1973. He was 
sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and fined $5,000 for his role in the 
scandal of a financial company operated by San Diego financier Joseph Bello. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Maine, who also went by the names Cindy Coleman or Cynthia Smith, told 
her probation officer in 1985 that she passed bad checks to buy merchandise and 
then have a friend take the purchases back in exchange for cash. She and her 
boyfriend would then use the money to buy heroin. Sometimes, she spent as much 
as $50 a day on the drug, Maine told her probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her disappearance, the brown-haired, blue-eyed Maine was 26 
years old. She was 5 feet tall and weighed 105 pounds. A source said she was 
close to Gentile, who was found murdered in 1985, her mouth stuffed with 
gravel. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Gentile's death in 1985, investigators from the San Diego 
Police Deparment, San Diego County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's 
office formed the homicide task force. They are investigating the murders of 43 
women, mostly prostitutes and transients, since Gentile's murder. Last month, 
the state attorney general's office was added to investigate possible police 
corruption associated with the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Maine's mother, Lynda Coleman, said she remembers her daughter crying over a 
newspaper article about a woman's death. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Coleman said her daughter started working as a police 
informant in 1984 despite her objections. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said that, for about a month in 1984, Fung and Sesma gave her daughter 
a phony ID so she could work in a defense plant in San Diego. Coleman can no 
longer remember exactly what company her daughter worked for. 
</P>
<P>
She was paid by the defense plant for a month and worked as an informant to 
tell the police who was supplying drugs to the defense plant workers. 
</P>
<P>
Fung would often fix a tape-recording device to Maine and send her to buy 
heroin, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good way to get yourself killed, and that's what I told her," she 
said. "These police officers are asking you to do something that they don't 
(want) to do. Nothing good can come of this, and if you get yourself killed, 
they won't even come to your funeral." 
</P>
<P>
Maine met Fung in 1984 after she was arrested for prostitution, her mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said her daughter was in love with Fung and agreed to become an 
informant at his insistence. 
</P>
<P>
"She did it out of love," she said. "'He flirted with her and told her he cared 
for her, that's how he got her to do it." 
</P>
<P>
She said that Fung sometimes came by their house to visit, and dropped off 
cards outside when they weren't home or at night when they were asleep. Fung 
and her daughter had an affair, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He acted like he cared for her," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
When they first met, Fung used to come over daily and they would sit outside in 
a car and visit or he would come inside for coffee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said she didn't discourage the relationship because she thought it 
might help her daughter straighten out. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was a man who's anti-drug and a cop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When Maine disappeared in 1986, Coleman said, Fung stopped returning her 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said she spent a year driving up and down neighborhood streets looking 
for her daughter and plastering her picture on city buses. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said she took it upon herself to search for her daughter because the 
police weren't helping. 
</P>
<P>
Police once told her: "We don't actively look for these kinds of people. 'Look, 
lady, you turned in a missing-person's report, what do you want us to do, tell 
a 26-year-old woman that her mom is looking for her?' " 
</P>
<P>
Coleman guessed that Maine stopped being an informant when she started serving 
her time at Los Colinas. Two months after being released in November, 1985, she 
was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Maine met Fung in the summer of 1984 when he arrested her for lewd acts. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said she is disgusted with the way police have handled her daughter's 
investigation, given that her father had been a San Diego police officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has been so mishandled, I am furious. To say that they are actively 
investigating Cindy's disappearance is a joke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since her daughter has been missing, Coleman said, she has had to give the 
police copies of her daughter's dental records five times because they are 
continually being lost or misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
The police told her last year they would try to match Maine's dental records 
with every unidentified female murder victim since February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I have yet to hear from them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About her daughter getting involved in prostitution: "What else can a girl 
who's hooked on heroin do to support her and the jerk that got her started? How 
else do you make $700 a day?" 
</P>
<P>
Maine has an 8-year-old son whom Coleman has helped raise since he was 3. Maine 
and her son lived with Coleman the last year that she was seen. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very bright little boy and he has gone through lots of therapy to 
understand why he doesn't have a mom or a dad," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the boy's father -- the man who first introduced Maine to heroin in 
1980 when they met -- lives downtown "in a gutter near a methadone clinic."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY FINDS RTD HAS MOST BUS RIDERS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District carries on the average more bus 
passengers than any other public transit system in the nation, a federal study 
released Tuesday showed. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Patsaouras, president of the RTD board, announced the findings in Los 
Angeles during the first of his planned quarterly "State of the District" 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
The study of the nation's leading transit systems, conducted in 1988, found 
that the RTD carries an average of 18.1 passengers per bus at any given time, 
compared to 15.4 passengers for New York and 15.3 for Chicago, its two nearest 
competitors in the category. 
</P>
<P>
In the study by the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration, the RTD 
surpassed the other 19 largest bus operators in total passenger miles. 
</P>
<P>
"We carry more people that any other system, excluding New York and Chicago 
which have both bus and rail service," Patsaouras said. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said that although RTD ridership has seen a steady decline since its 
peak of nearly 500 million passenger trips in 1985, the latest figures indicate 
the trend may be reversing.

COUNTY WILL PAY $1.7 MILLION TO MOTORIST INJURED BY SPEEDING DEPUTY; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: THE SETTLEMENT REPRESENTS 20% OF THE RESERVE FUND USED TO PAY FOR 
UNEXPECTED EMERGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A retired Vista man who was seriously injured when his car was struck by a 
speeding deputy sheriff's patrol car two years ago has been awarded nearly $2 
million in an out-of-court settlement with San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement represents 20% of the county government's unallocated reserve 
funds, which are set aside for unexpected emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The money will go to Paul Campo, a former Vista Unified School District trustee 
and the retired environmental director at the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base, 
and to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're pleased," Campo said, adding that the accident, long recovery 
and subsequent litigation created great stress on his family. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement calls for $1,025,000 to be set aside by the county, $525,000 of 
which the Campos will receive immediately. The balance will be set aside in an 
annuity that, over 20 years, will total another $1,175,000 in monthly payments, 
estimated the couple's attorney, Louisa Porter. She described the entire 
settlement as $1.7 million over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they agreed to the settlement, which was approved by 
Superior Court Judge James Milliken last week, out of concern that a jury might 
award even more money if the matter went to trial. Campo had sought $5.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Campo said he settled out of court to avoid what probably would have been years 
of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it: I'm 68 . . . and frankly I'm getting too old," he said. "We 
were a little disappointed, but let's just say I'm satisfied with the 
settlement and we're ready to move on with life." 
</P>
<P>
Campo said he will use the money, in part, to pay medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel George Brewster said the settlement is one of the largest 
ever paid by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Campo was driving his passenger car on Meadowlark Lane in Vista on Aug. 19, 
1988, and, after having stopped at a stop sign, was crossing East Vista Way 
when the driver's side of the vehicle was rammed by the patrol car being driven 
on East Vista Way by Deputy Paul Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Campo, who was extricated from his vehicle with a hydraulic-powered tool, 
suffered a broken hip, a fractured leg and internal injuries. Despite having 
undergone several surgeries, he can walk only with the aid of a cane, and faces 
additional reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster said the follow-up investigation showed that Rose was traveling at 
least 55 m.p.h. without using his emergency lights or siren. The posted speed 
limit on the street is 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Rose later said he was pursuing a car whose occupants he believed were 
suspected of brandishing weapons several days earlier. Porter disputed that 
contention, arguing instead that the explanation was contrived by Rose to 
justify his speed. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, a 12-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, remains on the force and 
is assigned to traffic patrol in the Vista substation. Brewster said he could 
not comment on whether Rose was disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was approved behind closed doors by the county Board of 
Supervisors several weeks ago, approved by the judge and made public now by 
Campo's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"In every lawsuit, we take a gamble going to trial, regardless of what our 
position may be," Brewster said. "We never now how the facts will lay out to a 
jury. In this case, we found some facts that were not real favorable to the 
county's position, and that if there was a finding of liability by the county, 
there was a good chance the damages could be pretty high." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate settlement and the mechanics of the annuity were negotiated 
between the two parties on the eve of trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Deputy Rose said he was going after a vehicle he suspected may have been 
involved with a brandishing of weapons charge several days prior," Brewster 
said. "The car he was tailing fit the description of the vehicle the deputies 
had been alerted to. He was trying to get a closer look at the car, and did so 
without paying a lot of attention to his speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the roadway he was on is curvy. Mr. Campo was on Meadowlark, 
and pulled out from a stop sign onto Vista Way, right into the path of Rose's 
vehicle," Brewster said. "The question was, did Campo violate Deputy Rose's 
right of way and was partly at fault? That's the position the (Sheriff's) 
Department took. Deputy Rose had no stop sign or stop light. So it was a jury 
decision as to whether he was reasonably traveling down Vista Way. 
</P>
<P>
"But looking at skid marks and from Mr. Campo's viewpoint, we felt there was a 
risk that the deputy might not have been acting reasonably." 
</P>
<P>
The county, as is typical with many government entities, does not carry 
liability insurance, nor does it set aside funds every year into a kitty from 
which to pay out settlements. Rather, settlements that are approved by the 
Board of Supervisors are paid from the county's fund of unallocated reserves. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the county set aside $5 million -- a mere 0.2% of its entire 
operating budget of $1.66 billion -- for contingencies such as this, said 
Manuel Lopez, director of financial management for the county. With this 
settlement, the fund is now down to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster said the Campo settlement is the largest "in recent memory" generated 
by a traffic accident involving a deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hartnett of the county's claims office said the county paid a settlement 
of about $2 million about three years ago, after a person was killed in a 
traffic accident and the resulting lawsuit alleged that the county had 
improperly maintained the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, a $1.2-million settlement was reached after several 
people were injured in a traffic accident that they blamed, again, on a poorly 
maintained roadway, Hartnett recalled.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN BURSTS INTO HOME, KILLS 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman burst into a South Los Angeles home Monday night and fired repeatedly 
at a group of people sitting in the living room, killing two men, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Lemuel Combs, 28, was hit 11 times and died at the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
His landlord, 62-year-old Leon Jefferson, was hit once and died less than an 
hour later at California Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police were looking for two women they believe were sitting with the victims in 
the house in the 1100 block of East 23rd Street during the 10 p.m. shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson owned the house and had a rental arrangement with Combs, who was 
paroled from state prison in August, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At the house, police found hypodermic needles, crack cocaine pipes and a 
substance they believe to be cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"The shooting may . . . be narcotics related," said Detective Bernie Skiles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOKA UNIVERSITY TO HOLD MEETINGS ON 
EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators at Soka University in Calabasas have invited neighbors to 
meetings tonight and Thursday night to discuss plans for expanding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based university formally announced in April that it wants to expand 
from an 80-student English language center for Japanese exchange students into 
a 5,000-student, international liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the university cemented that intention by announcing it had acquired 
332 additional acres, more than doubling its holdings in the Santa Monica 
Mountains to almost 600 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond saying they hope to reach full capacity by 2015, the administrators have 
been vague about what they call their vision for the campus. However, 
invitations to this week's meetings indicate they now have more specific plans 
to be shared with the community.

CAUSE OF RENO BUS CRASH PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: RAIN APPARENTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE COLLISION THAT INJURED DOZENS OF 
NORWALK SENIOR CITIZENS AND KILLED AN OFF-DUTY PATROL WOMAN. TWELVE PEOPLE 
REMAIN HOSPITALIZED.

Twelve members of a Norwalk senior citizens group remained hospitalized in Reno 
Tuesday as investigators tried to find out why a car driven by an off-duty 
Nevada Highway Patrol officer strayed into the path of a tour bus carrying 44 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, Lynne T. Hammill, 52, of Carson City, was fatally injured in the 
collision on U.S. 395, about 10 miles south of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dyer, 69, of Norwalk remained in serious condition with a head injury at 
Washoe Medical Center in Reno, hospital spokeswoman Wendy Knorr said. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven other injured passengers were in satisfactory or good condition with 
broken ribs, back injuries, cuts and bruises at Washoe and two other hospitals. 
Thirty-three others, including the bus driver, were treated for minor injuries 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
Washoe County Sheriff's investigators said Tuesday that Hammill's 1986 sedan 
crossed from the southbound lanes into the northbound lanes and was struck by 
the tour bus at about 5:30 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hammill, a 22-year-veteran who worked court cases, had left work in Reno and 
was on her way home when the accident occurred, said patrol Capt. Ronald 
Forshey. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol transferred the accident investigation to the county Sheriff's 
Department because one of its officers was involved. 
</P>
<P>
A rain-slick highway was at least partially responsible for Hammill's car 
crossing the median of the four-lane highway, Sheriff's Lt. James Ganyon said. 
</P>
<P>
"When it rains sometimes it's easy to hydroplane," Ganyon said. "For some 
reason she lost control of the vehicle and crossed into the northbound lanes." 
</P>
<P>
The Norwalk Senior Citizens Center, which is funded by the city of Norwalk, 
chartered the bus from Majestic Tours of Redondo Beach. The bus left Norwalk 
Monday morning and was to return Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was en route to Bally's Resort Hotel. It had been raining 
intermittently, and the bus's windshield wipers swept off a light sprinkle just 
before impact, said bus driver Gregory A. Armenta, 27, of Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed a car coming southbound . . . started fishtailing a little bit," 
Armenta said. "This vehicle just lost all control and went into a spin and came 
at me." 
</P>
<P>
Armenta said he lost control after the collision sent the bus onto the highway 
shoulder and down an embankment. The bus hit a tree and a utility pole before 
crashing on its side, Ganyon said. 
</P>
<P>
Eduarda Perez, who helped organize the tour, was sitting with her husband, 
Hector, in one of the front seats. Perez said she was pinned in a stairwell as 
the passengers on the left side of the bus spilled onto those on the right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"When the bus rolled over a man fell right on my chest," Perez said Tuesday 
from her hospital bed. "I kept saying, 'Please get up, get up, get up,' and he 
finally got up from my chest." Perez suffered a fractured sternum and was in 
stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, city officials in Norwalk scrambled to make arrangements for the 
seniors to return home. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Luigi A. Vernola said some would return by plane and others by bus 
provided by Majestic Tours.

destroyed a Chatsworth neighbor's house Monday night. Letizia's family reported 
the fire after seeing smoke from a blaze that caused an estimated $220,000 
damage. Investigators for the Los Angeles Fire Department believe fireworks 
shot off a few houses away landed on the shake roof of the residence at 10210 
Lubao Ave. at 10:40 p.m. and burned through the attic. It took firefighters 35 
minutes to control the blaze, spokesman Greg Acevedo said. One firefighter 
suffered an eye injury and was treated at Granada Hills Community Hospital.

GOVERNOR VETOES COUNTY AIRPORTS' EXEMPTION FROM TOUGH LAND-USE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have exempted 
Los Angeles County airports -- including Palmdale, Burbank and Van Nuys -- from 
a law designed to control growth around the state's airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, Los Angeles County planners have until 1992 to fashion 
comprehensive land-use plans to ensure that commercial and residential 
developments are compatible with flight safety and noise control regulations 
around the county's 15 airports. 
</P>
<P>
"Without such planning, airports and the businesses surrounding them may be 
forced to close as development encroaches" because the increasing population 
would put the airports in violation of state law, Deukmejian said in vetoing 
the exemption bill. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he does not believe "that the county should be completely 
exempted from provisions of this act, which will assist in preserving necessary 
airport facilities." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action is the latest twist in a controversy that surfaced in 
1989 after Deukmejian signed a bill to put teeth into a 20-year-old requirement 
for land-use planning around airports statewide. That measure prompted an 
outcry from a number of Los Angeles County cities, which complained that their 
planning authority around airports would be usurped by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption proposal was introduced by state Sen. Robert Beverly (R-Manhattan 
Beach), who earlier this year successfully pushed through legislation to give 
Los Angeles County an extra six months to comply with the law. But Deukmejian 
said he would not allow the law to be eased any more. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy Leland -- a lobbyist for Los Angeles County, which pushed for passage of 
the exemption measure -- said he was unsure if the exemption proposal will be 
revived next year. 
</P>
<P>
Leland described the current law as "so vague, so general, it doesn't tell you 
what you are supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics of the current law have argued that Los Angeles County's Regional 
Planning Commission, designated by state law as the airport planning agency, 
does not have the staff to handle the workload involved in planning around 
airports. Other opponents say that most airports in Los Angeles County already 
are surrounded by development. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann Blue, a lobbyist for the city of Los Angeles, said the governor's 
action means "that the county will have to take on the responsibility of doing 
land-use plans around airports." She said the city opposed the Beverly bill 
because in many cases, including Palmdale, residential development already is 
coming too close to airports and preventive action is needed soon. 
</P>
<P>
One source familiar with the legislation predicted that Los Angeles County 
cities, worried that the county will begin to control local zoning decisions 
around airports, will go to court to challenge the constitutionality of the 
current law and regain power over airport planning for itself.

DEVELOPER KILLED IN CRASH LEFT LEGACY OF CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: EZRA RAITEN WAS INVOLVED IN DISPUTES WITH ENVIRONMENTALISTS OVER PLANS 
TO DEVELOP THE 320-ACRE PARAMOUNT RANCH IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.

<P>
A Northridge developer killed in a plane crash in San Luis Obispo Monday was 
known in the San Fernando Valley for generating controversies as both a builder 
and a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years Ezra Raiten, 38, and his companies were involved in disputes 
with environmentalists over his plans to develop the scenic Paramount Ranch in 
the Santa Monica Mountains and accusations that he had little regard for trees 
and a possibly historic structure on another property he was developing. 
</P>
<P>
As a pilot he was cited last year for making illegal landings in his company's 
helicopter, and the Federal Aviation Administration was seeking to revoke his 
pilot's license on grounds that he had falsified his application by leaving out 
his convictions on criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten and three others, including his 17-year-old son, Amir Raiten, were 
killed early Monday when Raiten's private jet crashed while attempting to land 
in heavy fog at San Luis Obispo Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mucho, chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board's 
office in Los Angeles, said Tuesday that the cause of the accident still was 
not known. The Cessna Citation crashed into eucalyptus trees in a field three 
miles northwest of the airport shortly after the pilot radioed the tower to say 
he was on a landing approach. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit two large trees in heavy fog but we are still working on why," Mucho 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unknown whether Raiten or another victim, Ofer Shamir, 28, of San Luis 
Obispo was in control of the 12-seat jet when it crashed, Mucho said. Both men 
were certified pilots. The fourth victim was identified as Warren P. Callaghan, 
18, of Northridge, a friend of Raiten's son. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten was head of Paramount Ranch Estates, owner of the 320-acre property in 
Agoura where the Renaissance Pleasure Faire formerly was held. His development 
company's plans to build luxury houses on the parcel have been vigorously 
opposed by neighbors and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
What impact, if any, Raiten's death will have on the project was not known 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After the County Board of Supervisors approved the 150-house development last 
year, opponents who contended that the project's environmental review was 
inadequate sued the county. The suit, filed by the Sierra Club, the Las 
Virgenes Homeowners Federation and Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains, 
claimed that the county had been misled about the identity of the project's 
owner and by a financial analysis of the project. 
</P>
<P>
In July, a Superior Court judge ruled that the county acted legally in 
approving the project. Ann Carlson, the opponents' attorney, said she has filed 
notice that she intends to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth B. Bley, an attorney who represented Raiten in the suit, said Tuesday 
that he did not know whether the development would be built now that Raiten is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter unrelated to the Paramount controversy, Raiten was criticized 
earlier this year by City Councilwoman Joy Picus for improperly removing three 
large oak trees at a development in West Hills and bulldozing an old ranch 
house before the city could determine if it had historic value. 
</P>
<P>
"This developer has a record of disregarding the law," Picus said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten also made news last year when he was cited by the Los Angeles Fire 
Department for landing a helicopter in his back yard without a city permit. 
Neighbors had complained that there had been several takeoffs and landings by 
the helicopter in the residential area in the 17000 block of Lassen Street. 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, the Federal Aviation Administration learned that Raiten 
had falsified his application for a pilot's license in July, 1988, by stating 
that he had no criminal record, FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
But according to court records, Raiten was convicted in 1983 of forgery and 
check fraud and served five months in Chino State Prison, and in 1986 pleaded 
guilty to vandalism after an incident in which he tried to run down his 
mother-in-law and her boyfriend with a car and then vandalized the boyfriend's 
car. He was fined $1,000 and placed on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Brekke said the FAA notified Raiten on Oct. 3, 1989, that the agency was 
seeking to revoke his license. Raiten appealed the FAA action and an NTSB 
hearing was scheduled for next month. Meantime, Raiten was legally allowed to 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the controversies that followed Raiten in recent years, the 
developer attempted to keep a low profile. Neighbors who were upset about the 
loss of trees at the West Hills development said Raiten refused to meet with 
them or return their phone calls.

COUNCIL SPARS OVER ABSENT MAYOR'S CONTROL OF MEETING DOCKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
With Mayor Maureen O'Connor in Japan on the first of several foreign trips 
planned in coming months, several San Diego council members Tuesday suggested 
curtailing the mayor's control of the council docket -- perhaps by shifting 
some of that authority to the council itself. 
</P>
<P>
While the plan's supporters argue that it would expedite council consideration 
of some issues and smooth the weekly flow of business, its detractors 
characterized it as a "cheap shot" against an absent Mayor Maureen O'Connor and 
an attempted power grab by the council's five-member majority. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they'd love to set the agenda, but that's one of the mayor's 
prerogatives," said O'Connor press secretary Paul Downey. "They may not like 
it, but that's kind of too bad, because she is the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, several council members had traded caustic ripostes over the 
proposed procedural change and O'Connor's aides were seething over what they 
viewed as an attempted sneak attack on her powers -- reinforcing the enmity 
that developed during this summer's bitter redistricting dispute. Relations 
between the council's so-called "Gang of Five" and its four minority members -- 
a bloc that includes O'Connor -- have deteriorated markedly in the aftermath of 
the protracted debate over the redrawing of council district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old petty, little game they're playing, and I'm just tired of 
it," Councilwoman Judy McCarty said. "Let's just go about our business and stop 
trying to hurt one another." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's debate -- which grew more acerbic and personal after the council 
session -- was initiated by Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, who, as deputy 
mayor, chaired the meeting in O'Connor's absence. 
</P>
<P>
With O'Connor leading a city trade mission to Japan, Tuesday's council docket 
was unusually light -- as it often is whenever the mayor is out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that O'Connor plans to visit Mexico City, New York City and France in 
the next several months, Wolfsheimer and several others suggested that the 
mayor's absences could seriously impede council action by largely restricting 
its agenda during those trips to routine, non-controversial matters. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's gone, she purposely stops the normal routine of business," City 
Councilman Bob Filner said. "That may have been OK when she was only gone once 
in a while, but now that she's going to be gone every month, that's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Under the City Charter, the council's weekly docket is prepared by the 
consultant to the council's Rules Committee -- a position filled by a mayoral 
appointee, according to Assistant City Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, those charter provisions -- combined with the fact that 
few issues that come before the council must by law be addressed within a 
specified time -- give the mayor's office wide discretionary authority in 
developing the council's agenda, which typically is prepared two weeks in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated that Tuesday morning's council session lasted only about a half 
hour, Wolfsheimer argued that such abbreviated meetings "place the city in 
gridlock" both by limiting the council's action in the mayor's absence and 
clogging future dockets with items held over until she returns. 
</P>
<P>
"When the city faces many, many issues . . . we need to not spend 15 minutes at 
a time here," Wolfsheimer complained. "Maybe it's time to look at changing some 
of these docketing procedures." Either the city clerk's office or the council 
itself, she said, perhaps should have a more direct hand in preparing the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty, however, emphasized that O'Connor is "not off in a snit fit," but 
rather on city business, and Councilman Bruce Henderson said later that he was 
"unaware of any important city business being delayed or disrupted" by mayoral 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
"The only trip I know of that has been disruptive was Mrs. Wolfsheimer's," 
Henderson said. "It always amazes me when the critic is the worst offender." 
</P>
<P>
In July and August, Wolfsheimer took a three-week European vacation that 
effectively left the council deadlocked, 4-4, in its efforts to resolve the 
redistricting dispute. During that impasse, Wolfsheimer's trip drew occasional 
sniping from O'Connor and other council members, and a federal judge even 
suggested that she curtail her vacation to return to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned as scheduled, Wolfsheimer joined Filner and the other "Gang 
of Five" members in adopting a since-revised council redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
"For Abbe Wolfsheimer to criticize anybody for being out of town -- especially 
when the mayor's away on city business -- is the height of hypocrisy," said 
mayoral spokesman Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Such criticism came as no surprise to Wolfsheimer, who said she anticipated 
that O'Connor and her staff would interpret her suggestion as an encroachment 
on mayoral authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's an extremely sensitive human being," Wolfsheimer said. "This is 
not intended to do anything to crimp the mayor. It's intended to keep this 
council moving ahead regardless of whether the mayor's present." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond any scheduling problems posed by the mayor's absence, council members at 
odds with O'Connor also have often complained that those differences hamper 
their ability to docket items of interest to them. If a member is out of favor 
with O'Connor or if she opposes his issue, they contend, that item is unlikely 
to quickly appear on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you're asking for her support -- just the chance to discuss 
something," Filner said. "But if you're not in her good graces, you can forget 
it. What we have is government by whim." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Filner noted that he has been unable to proceed for more than 
four months with appointments to a San Ysidro revitalization board because of 
O'Connor's refusal to docket the issue. 
</P>
<P>
When the mayor declines to docket an item, several options are available to 
council members who wish to pursue their efforts to do so, city attorney 
Fitzpatrick explained. If four members request that an issue be placed on the 
docket, that must be done within 30 days. Five members may request a special 
meeting -- as the majority did during the lengthy redistricting battle -- and a 
six-vote, two-thirds majority enables the council to bring up "emergency" items 
that meet certain criteria without the mayor's support. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's debate, Wolfsheimer noted that, until several years ago, the 
council's weekly Tuesday docket, which typically is devoted to land-use issues 
-- as opposed to the Monday meetings' broader agenda -- was organized primarily 
by the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
That policy was changed in early 1988, however, at the request of O'Connor's 
aides, who argued that allowing the Rules Committee consultant to also oversee 
that docket, as he does that of the weekly Monday meetings, insured better 
coordination. Before the change, the mayor's staff and some council members 
were displeased by what they regarded as insufficient notice of major land-use 
matters on the docket. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not originally a power grab by the mayor's office, but after we had the 
power, we certainly used it," said Chris Crotty, the Rules Committee consultant 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Cervantes, the current Rules consultant, said that in preparing the 
dockets, he routinely consults with the city manager's office and the Planning 
Department, as well as reviews requests from individual council members. 
Estimates of how long each item might take for the council to dispense with it, 
he said, are a major factor in assembling the dockets. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the time, I make the decision myself about what goes on the 
docket," Cervantes said. "On the rest, I might talk to others on the (mayor's) 
staff with expertise to get their input." 
</P>
<P>
That description, O'Connor's council critics argue, is simply a diplomatic way 
of admitting that the mayor can orchestrate the council's schedule and shape 
its docket to her liking, both in her presence and absence. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's aides and her supporters concede the point, but hasten to add that 
she is simply taking advantage of the authority given to her by the charter and 
behaving as the chair of any organization would. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the prerogative powers of the chair of any group is the power to create 
the agenda and determine when and in what order the various issues that come 
before it are addressed," Henderson said. "When the chair's in the minority, 
the majority naturally would like to take away some of that docketing 
authority. So I don't see this as being as much of a shot at the mayor as it is 
a question of raw power, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was unable to gain sufficient votes for the council to discuss her 
idea Tuesday, Wolfsheimer said that she intends to circulate a memo among her 
colleagues asking that it be reviewed at a future meeting. 
</P>
<P>
For that to happen, of course, it must be docketed.

RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FOR PRISONERS IS OPPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
STUDIO CITY: ELDERLY TENANTS OF A RETIREMENT COMPLEX WOULD BE REPLACED BY 
NONVIOLENT LAWBREAKERS IN A WORK-FURLOUGH PROGRAM. BUT A PLANNING OFFICIAL SAYS 
THE LOCATION IS WRONG. 
</P>

<P>
A controversial plan to convert a Studio City retirement home into a residence 
for prisoners participating in a work-furlough program has been rejected by a 
city planning official, who found the proposed Ventura Boulevard site 
ill-suited to a neighborhood with nearby houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the proposed facility would serve a beneficial purpose to the public 
at large, such purpose could be served as well or better in a nonresidential 
setting," hearing examiner Richard M. Takase wrote in a recommendation to the 
Los Angeles City Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled to vote on the issue Thursday at the Van Nuys 
Woman's Club. 
</P>
<P>
Takase's recommendation was based on an Aug. 20 hearing during which about 20 
Studio City residents and business owners voiced concern about convicted 
criminals in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Carl E. Curtis, Los Angeles County's work-furlough director, said Tuesday that 
he would still urge the commission to approve the Studio City program, which 
would be run by a private, Long Beach firm called Working Alternatives. The 
facility, part of an effort to ease crowding in the County Jail, would be the 
second of its kind if approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their fears are unfounded," Curtis said. "We carefully screen the 
individuals who get into work furlough. They are not dangerous individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, elderly residents of the Ventura Retirement Villa at 11201 
Ventura Blvd. would be replaced by nonviolent lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
The program would allow the participants, mostly convicted of misdemeanors, to 
continue working while serving their sentences, and make jail cells available 
for more serious offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Participants would be screened by the county Probation Department and approved 
by a judge. They would be allowed to leave the facility only for their jobs and 
would be closely monitored by staff and routinely tested for drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
However, they would not be under lock and key, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Takase, in issuing his recommendation against the plan, noted the fears of area 
residents and the fact that an estimated 63 participants -- most of them 
convicted drunk drivers who have lost their licenses -- would have contact with 
the public at neighborhood bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
Takase also found that the 146-bed retirement home lacked adequate parking for 
a work-furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
The home has 49 parking spaces -- not enough for an estimated 70 driving 
participants plus work-furlough staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Takase added that the county's first privately run work-furlough program, 
opened early this year at 89th and Main streets in South Los Angeles, had been 
a drug-rehabilitation center and halfway house for paroled inmates for 12 
years. Its conversion to a more restrictive work-furlough program, in which 
residents' freedom to come and go is limited, was welcomed by the neighborhood 
as an improvement, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Ward, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., welcomed his 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the program is not the program itself, but they wanted to 
place it in an inappropriate location," Ward said. "I'm very pleased."

VICTIM TRACKS ROBBERY SUSPECT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A RESTAURANT OWNER CALLS DEPUTIES ON A NEIGHBOR'S PORTABLE PHONE. 
AUTHORITIES FIND THE MAN IN A CLOSET AFTER AN EIGHT-HOUR STANDOFF. 
</P>

<P>
A Lake Los Angeles man was arrested Tuesday morning after being followed home 
by an owner of a restaurant he allegedly robbed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Alfonso Manfredonia, 39, about 5 
a.m. after an eight-hour standoff. Deputies fired tear gas into Manfredonia's 
house in the 40300 block of 164th Street in the small desert community near 
Palmdale. Manfredonia was found hiding in a closet and was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Manfredonia allegedly had robbed the nearby King Richard's Pizza, Etc. of about 
$500 and fired a shot at Kevin Eldredge, who followed him to his house, Deputy 
George Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge, 24, a computer consultant whose family owns the restaurant, was 
temporarily working there at the time of the robbery. He was unhurt -- and 
unshaken -- by the episode. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of mad," Eldredge said. "I work hard for my money and it seems 
someone is always trying to take it away. I have a bad attitude about people 
like that. After thinking about it, if it happened again I think I would do the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 8:45 p.m. Monday when a masked gunman walked into the 
pizza shop at 17051 E. Ave. O and ordered Eldredge to empty the cash register. 
Afterward, the man ran to a pickup truck and drove away. Eldredge said he ran 
to his own car and began following with his car's lights out. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept a safe distance," Eldredge said. "He was actually stupid enough to go 
to his home." 
</P>
<P>
After the robber appeared to go into the house on 164th Street, about half a 
mile from the pizza shop, Eldredge drove slowly by the house. Suddenly, he saw 
the gunman run back to his pickup and heard a buzzing sound he believes was a 
bullet zipping past his car. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup truck pulled out into the road about 100 yards behind Eldredge but 
stopped. Eldredge said the driver got out and walked down an alley to the rear 
of the house. A neighbor who saw the commotion gave Eldredge a portable phone 
to call deputies. The restaurant manager watched the house until deputies 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department Special Weapons Team surrounded the house but 
Manfredonia refused to come out. 
</P>
<P>
After hours of fruitless negotiations by phone and bullhorn, deputies set off 
two diversionary devices -- explosives that emit a loud, disorienting blast -- 
in front and behind the house at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, tear gas was fired into the residence. When Manfredonia 
still did not come out, deputies entered the house and found him in a closet. 
He was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being held at the jail in the 
department's Palmdale station. 
</P>
<P>
Homes on all sides of the house were evacuated and traffic into the 
neighborhood was barred during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies did not find the gun allegedly used but planned another search of the 
house and area around it, officials said.

POLICE AGAIN BEEF UP SERIAL SLAYING TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six detectives have been added to the force investigating the 
Clairemont-University City serial killings, bringing the total number of 
officers involved with the case to 34, San Diego police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a morning press briefing, Capt. Dick Toneck said the detectives were added 
late Monday, increasing to 27 the number of full-time investigators assigned to 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Toneck, Deputy Chief Cal Krosch, Lt. Gary Learn and four sergeants 
are overseeing the case for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck called the case, in which five women have been stabbed to death inside 
their homes, the department's "No. 1 priority" and the "highest-profile" murder 
investigation he has experienced as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, of the 27 detectives working the case, only five are part of a 
full-time homicide team. He said that, of the department's six full-time 
homicide units, only one -- a five-person contingent headed by Sgt. Ed Petrick 
-- is assigned exclusively to the serial killing. 
</P>
<P>
He said that officers from departments other than Homicide had been 
commissioned to work on the case, "and in this situation, we've made them 
homicide officers." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck was asked about reports that a man fitting the description of the 
suspect's composite was seen driving away from an area near the Honors Drive 
home in University City where Pamela Gail Clark, 42, and her daughter, Amber, 
18, were killed Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anyone who has said they saw this person leave the crime 
scene," Toneck said. "We don't have anybody (any witness) who says they saw 
this person come out of the house. If we knew anything, we'd tell you. We'd be 
happy to tell you we had a suspect, but we don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had something to report, but there's nothing new. I'm sorry there's 
nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
Police describe the suspect, who was seen running from the Clairemont apartment 
where Holly Suzanne Tarr was killed April 3, as a dark-skinned man, 5-foot-7 to 
5-foot-10, with a light build and short, dark, curly hair. 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said Monday that police had received more than 1,100 tips from the 
public, 140 of which were "class A, priority one leads." He said another 472 
had been earmarked for follow-up and telephone contact made on another 200 to 
300. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday he said he had "no new information" about the total number of tips. 
</P>
<P>
A police helicopter was dispatched to University City Tuesday afternoon after 
callers said they had seen a man in their neighborhood who matched the 
description of the suspect, as depicted in the composite drawing. 
</P>
<P>
But the calls were a "false alarm," police said.

BUILDER OF LUXURY HOTEL GETS OK TO BRING IN NEW MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winner of a competition to build a resort-style hotel on Harbor Island won 
approval Tuesday from the Board of Port Commissioners to bring in the 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. as the new hotel manager. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, developer R. Barry McComic officially dropped Stouffer Hotel 
Management Corp. as the luxury hotel's management partner. 
</P>
<P>
Port District Director Don Nay said he was reluctant to endorse the change. He 
noted that McComic and Stouffer as a team had won out over several others last 
year in a stiff competition to build on the last remaining hotel site on the 
picturesque island in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
He said McComic, through his Boulder Creek Co., and Stouffer had submitted a 
specific plan and hotel design and that switching partners would be contrary to 
the rules of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nay said McComic now wanted substantial changes in the design of 
the hotel to accommodate Ritz-Carlton, which was one of the losers of last 
year's competition and is set to operate a new hotel in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
But McComic said he was unable to reach a satisfactory management agreement 
with Stouffer and stressed to commissioners that he wasn't "shopping around" 
his development option. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new hotel, which on the outside is very similar to the original 
design, will cost $100 million instead of $75 million, which was the cost of 
the Stouffer facility. McComic said much of the additional expense will be used 
to upgrade the interior of the hotel to Ritz-Carlton standards. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said they weren't particularly concerned with the change to a new 
hotel operator, but wanted to make sure the design would be as close as 
possible to the one approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless Mr. McComic can produce what we agreed to, (then) we have to consider 
the possibility of (another competition)," Commissioner Ray Burk said. "The 
issue isn't one of design, it's one of fairness."

DRIVER IN CRASH WAS 'TRYING TO GET AWAY'; 
</P>
<P>
DEATHS: IN A PRETRIAL HEARING, A MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING TWO STUDENTS DURING A 
POLICE CHASE SAYS IN TAPED INTERVIEW HE WAS AFRAID OF RETURNING TO JAIL.

A Palmdale man accused of causing a crash that killed two teen-agers when his 
pickup truck ran a red light during a police chase later told investigators he 
"was just trying to get away. I was scared. I didn't want to go back to jail," 
according to court testimony Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Vargas Servin, 22, also said he knew he was endangering others when he led 
police on the chase, which ended when he crashed into another vehicle at 
Chatsworth Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Such knowledge is required for 
prosecutors to prove Servin guilty of second-degree murder under the theory 
that he acted with wanton disregard for human life, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie 
Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Servin made the statements during a taped police interview about four hours 
after the June 1 crash, in which Aracely Hernandez, 18, of San Fernando and 
Uriel Fernandez, 16, of Pacoima were killed. A third occupant in the victims' 
car, Juan Melendrez, 16, suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The three students were on their way home from a high school football game when 
their car was struck broadside by Servin's truck. Fernandez was a star pitcher 
for the San Fernando High School baseball team. Hernandez was a cheerleader and 
a member of the softball team at Sylmar High School. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was being chased by a San Fernando police officer who saw the vehicle 
near an area where two or three gunshots had been fired. Servin later told 
police he fired the shots in the air to scare off another man who pointed a 
sawed-off shotgun in his direction during a fight at a gathering in San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
He said he tried to flee because he didn't want to return to prison after 
recently completing two sentences for robbery and joy-riding convictions, 
Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Servin ran off and hid in some bushes before being discovered 
by police and arrested, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Servin told detectives he had drunk more than three 
six-packs of beer in the five hours before the crash. A .38-caliber revolver 
with three spent shells was found under the dashboard of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to facing two counts of second-degree murder, Servin is charged 
with causing death while evading police, Samuels said. If convicted, Servin 
faces a maximum sentence of 38 years in prison, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of the June 2 interview was played in Van Nuys Superior Court Tuesday 
during pretrial proceedings to determine whether it and other evidence could be 
admitted in trial. Judge James M. Coleman ruled that most of the tape was. 
</P>
<P>
Servin wept quietly while a videotape depicting the accident scene and the dead 
bodies was played in court. After his arrest, Servin told police: "I did care 
for those people that I hit."

NEIGHBORS TO HEAR SOKA PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ADMINISTRATORS OF THE TOKYO-BASED UNIVERSITY WILL MEET WITH 
CALABASAS RESIDENTS ABOUT THE CAMPUS'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators at Soka University in Calabasas have invited neighbors to 
meetings Wednesday and Thursday nights to discuss plans to expand the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based university formally announced in April that it wanted to expand 
from an 80-student English-language center for Japanese exchange students into 
a 5,000-student, international liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the university cemented that intention by announcing that it had 
acquired 332 additional acres, more than doubling its land holdings in the 
Santa Monica Mountains to nearly 600 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond saying they hope to reach full capacity by 2015, the administrators have 
been vague about what they call their vision for the campus. But invitations to 
this week's meetings indicate that they have translated "our visions into 
concepts" and are ready to share them with the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to share this with our neighbors first," campus spokesman 
Jeff Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 years, through three owners, the National Park Service has wanted to buy 
the mountain-ringed meadow for use as its park headquarters. Those efforts 
continue as parks officials search for other government land to offer the 
university in exchange for the Calabasas site. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club voted to oppose the proposed 
expansion and back the parks' efforts to acquire the land. 
</P>
<P>
Soka University also has been criticized for its connections to Soka Gakkai, a 
neo-Buddhist sect that critics liken to a cult. University administrators have 
attempted to distance the university from the sect, although they acknowledge 
that the university was founded by Soka Gakkai leader Daisaku Ikeda and that 
most of the students are members. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try to make it clear to the community people that we don't want to 
teach religion," Ourvan said. "We don't have any kind of hidden agenda." 
</P>
<P>
The meetings will be at 7:30 p.m. both nights on the campus, 26800 West 
Mulholland Highway, near Las Virgenes Road.

HAHN URGES MORE POOL INSPECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said Tuesday that Los Angeles County's 16,700 public 
pools ought to be inspected at least once a year, even if annual pool licensing 
fees have to be raised to hire more inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn issued a press release two days after The Times reported that the county 
has just eight pool inspectors -- the same number as it had 20 years ago when 
there were half as many public pools. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent of the public pools in the county have not been inspected for 
at least three years; almost 5,000 pools have not been inspected for at least 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he will introduce a motion at Tuesday's board meeting calling for 
county staff to prepare a report by Oct. 16 on the situation, including 
recommendations for fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Unsafe conditions at any county facility cannot be tolerated and every effort 
must be made to ensure public safety," Hahn said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Florian Talbott, assistant plant manager at the former Stroh Brewery 
Co. in Van Nuys, has died at his Sepulveda home. He was 65.

<P>
He is survived by a son, Tom Talbott of Lancaster; a daughter, Candy Vanderham 
of Valencia; a brother, Donald Talbott of Frazier Park, Calif.; a sister, Lucy 
Graham of Las Vegas; one grandson and one granddaughter. His wife died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park-Glendale, 
1712 S. Glendale Ave., with burial to follow. Forest Lawn Mortuary in Glendale 
handled the arrangements. Donations can be made in Talbott's name to the

BILL SIGNED TO CREATE L.A. RIVER PARK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday signed a bill that supporters describe as a 
first step toward turning the 58-mile-long Los Angeles River flood control 
channel into a park and recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
The measure by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) gives the state Coastal 
Conservancy the authority to prepare a master recreational plan for the 
concrete-lined channel, which begins in the San Fernando Valley and flows into 
San Pedro Bay at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Gordon, a Torres aide, said other state agencies will be called upon to 
provide help in reviewing the river's bird habitats and hydrology. Also, the 
study will determine whether operating a monorail along the channel would be 
compatible with turning the river channel into a park.

MUNITIONS TRAIN FROM WEAPONS STATION DERAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An nine-car freight train carrying military artillery shells from the Seal 
Beach Naval Weapons Station derailed here Tuesday evening, prompting 
authorities to close roads and call in military explosives experts. 
</P>
<P>
But officials stopped short of a full-scale evacuation of nearby homes and 
businesses after safety officials determined there was no danger of an 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say this had the potential to be devastating had the munitions 
exploded," said Battalion Chief Allan R. White of the Westminster Fire 
Department, noting that an evacuation could have affected an estimated 1,000 
residents within a mile of the derailment. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of locomotives leading the train and two boxcars -- including one loaded 
with crates of 2-foot-long, 38-caliber military projectiles -- jumped the 
tracks just south of Westminster Boulevard at about 6:45 p.m., causing a diesel 
fuel spill from one of the engines. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews managed within hours to mop up the spill from the second of the two 
Southern Pacific locomotives, which dumped hundreds of gallons of fuel onto the 
tracks. Nearby streets were closed to traffic, but police did not evacuate any 
residents from the surrounding area, which is ringed mostly by light-industrial 
buildings and small shops. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific officials said it remained unclear what caused the derailment, 
which left the front locomotive twisted on the tracks. None of the cars flipped 
over, but the steel rails were twisted nearly to a 90-degree angle by the force 
of the accident. About 300 feet of track was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The only injury reported involved an unidentified naval weapons worker who 
tripped while examining the ammunition, fell down an embankment and suffered a 
sprained ankle. The worker was taken to Westminster Hospital.

GEBHARD AMONG TOP PADRE GM CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Gebhard, vice president/player personnel of the Minnesota Twins, has been 
established as one of the leading candidates to fill the Padres' vacant general 
manager position, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhard, 46, is being interviewed a second time by the Padres in San Francisco, 
and was in attendance Tuesday night during the Padres' 3-1 loss to the San 
Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown who is conducting the interviews in San Francisco, but Gebhard 
told two people that he has been interviewing the past two days. Keith Matson, 
one of the general partners, is the only Padre owner who has attended the past 
two games, according to Padre officials. Yet, it's possible that other owners 
took flights to San Francisco and left before the games. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhard and Dan Duquette, assistant general manager of the Montreal Expos, are 
believed to be only the candidates who have twice been interviewed by the 
Padres. Gehbard also was interviewed about 2 1/2 weeks ago in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates who have been interviewed once, according to sources 
within and outside the Padre organization, are: Gordon Ash, assistant general 
manager of the Toronto Blue Jays; Roger Jongewaard, vice president/scouting and 
player development of the Seattle Mariners; and Walt Jocketty, director of 
baseball administration of the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhard, according to several baseball administrators outside the Padre 
organization, is the most experienced and perhaps most viable of the candidates 
interviewed. A former major league pitcher and pitching coach with the Twins, 
Gehbard has been a minor league coordinator, and director of minor league 
operations since joining the Twins front-office in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Cripes, who could be better qualified than Geb?" said Andy MacPhail, Twins 
executive vice president/baseball. "It'd be a huge blow to us, but there comes 
a time when you know a guy's ready, and I'm telling you, he's ready. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the ideal background and qualifications for the job, and I'm sure 
that's why the Padres are so interested." 
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, right fielder Danny Tartabull of the Kansas 
City Royals revealed in a telephone interview that he has requested a trade to 
the Padres, Angels or Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull, 27, said Tuesday that he informed Royal General Manager John 
Schuerholz of his request two months ago. Dennis Gilbert, Tartabull's agent, 
confirmed that he telephoned Schuerhholz, telling him that Tartabull is unhappy 
in Kansas City, and will leave as a free agent at the end of the 1991 season if 
he is not traded. He also said that the only three teams with which Tartabull 
is willing to sign a long-term contract are the three Southern California 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be the happiest kid in the world if I got traded to San Diego," said 
Tartabull, who lives in Malibu in the off-season. "They know I want out of 
here, and they know I want to be in San Diego. That'd be ideal for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I know (Padre Manager) Greg Riddoch from my days in Cincinnati, and I'd really 
love to play for that guy. It's also a thing where I like the guys on the team 
there, I love the ballpark, and I'd be close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"Reggie (Jackson) was talking to me the other day, saying how he's pushing the 
Angels to trade for me, which would be nice too. But San Diego, that's my first 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull, who has been hampered by groin and calf injuries this season, is 
hitting .300 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in just 300 at-bats. Jack McKeon, who 
was fired Saturday as Padre vice president/baseball operations, attempted 
several times in the past three seasons to trade for him, including once this 
summer, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that the Padres will have any trade discussions with the Royals 
until they have a general manager in place, but when asked about Tartabull, 
Riddoch said: "You'd be crazy not to want a player like that. You just don't 
know what it would take to get him." 
</P>
<P>
As for the game Tuesday, well, let's just say the most exciting aspect was the 
earthquake that occurred in the fifth inning, registering 3.3 on the richter 
scale, and knocking out a bank of lights at Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
And the loudest ovation generated by the crowd of 10,195, was in response to 
the scoreboard notification that the Oakland Athletics had clinched the 
American League West title, drawing a loud mixture of boos and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the Padres lost their seventh consecutive game, with Andy Benes 
(10-10) surrendering home runs to rookies Steve Decker, his second, and Mike 
Benjamin, his third. Mark Dewey, pitching in relief of Rick Reuschel, won his 
first major league game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult aspect of Manager Greg Riddoch's daily routine? Just finding 
warm players to fill out a lineup. The Padres played Tuesday's game without the 
services of third baseman/outfielder Bip Roberts (sore knees), outfielder Fred 
Lynn (pulled groin), second baseman Roberto Alomar (strained left elbow) and 
outfielder Tony Gwynn (fractured finger), leaving them with 23 able-bodied 
players. "It's a skeleton crew right now," Riddoch said. "I wish we had called 
up a few more guys from Triple-A. That'll change next year, let me tell you." . 
. . One player who was ruled out, but has made a dramatic comeback, is catcher 
Tom Lampkin. Lampkin was declared to be out for the season in August when he 
suffered strained ligaments in his right thumb, requiring a cast. But the cast 
has come off, rehabiliation began, and there he was Tuesday, taking batting 
practice, and grounding out to third in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter. 
Lampkin is scheduled to even start a game in Cincinnati. "I feel pretty good, 
actually," Lampkin said. "I thought I could play maybe a week ago, but the 
doctors just gave me clearance today. I'm ready when they're ready." . . . Lynn 
said he initially sustained his injury Monday while running in the outfield, 
which is torn apart because of Sunday's football game. "It's right there with 
the worst conditions I've played on," he said. "When you have sod just thrown 
on dirt out there, you're asking for trouble." . . . Giant left fielder Kevin 
Mitchell was kept out of the lineup because of extreme pain in his right wrist, 
and said Tuesday that he will have surgery once the season ends. "This is just 
killing me," said Mitchell, who's in a five-for-38 slump. . . . Giant pitcher 
Steve Bedrosian, who has endured a season while his three-year-old son has been 
undergoing treatment for leukemia, was selected by his teammates Tuesday as 
winner of the Willie Mac Award, signifying him as the Giants' most 
inspirational player. Bedrosian, 32, received the plaque from Willie McCovey, 
the Giants Hall of Famer, in pre-game ceremonies . . . The Padres will play the 
final game of their three-game series against the Giants at 12:35 p.m. today. 
Dennis Rasmussen (11-14) and Don Robinson (10-7) are the scheduled starters.

PASQUALE TURNS SPECIAL TEAMS INTO AN ASSET; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS YEAR AND LAST IS LIKE NIGHT AND DAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The difference between last year's special teams coach for the Chargers and 
this year's is told in their selection of agents. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Madden, last year's special teams coach, was in need of a travel agent at 
season's end to get him out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Pasquale, this year's special teams coach, has a publicity agent who has 
been hired to make him an NFL head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a plan for Larry," said agent Stephen Austin, who is based in 
Alexandria, Va. "We have publicity kits that will go out to 120 members of the 
media in the next few weeks to introduce him to the football world at large. 
And we will be sending videotapes to a select group of 30 or so." 
</P>
<P>
The work of last year's special teams coach also was captured on videotape, and 
copies of "Football Follies" may be obtained by contacting NFL Films. 
</P>
<P>
Last year and this year. It's like comparing Steve Ortmayer with Bobby 
Beathard. Mickey Mouse with Mickey Mantle or the San Diego Padres with the 
Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
It was so bad last year, that when it came to this year, the Chargers were 
willing to make Pasquale, who just had been fired by the lowly Jets, the 
highest paid special teams coach in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a better paid special teams coach," Austin said, "I don't know who 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
Pay him more. Give the miracle man whatever he wants. If he wants to be a head 
coach . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale's special teams presently rank fourth in the NFL in covering kickoffs. 
That's fourth, and mighty special in comparison to last year's slapstick 
27th-place showing. 
</P>
<P>
They also rank fourth in returning kickoffs, and that's without using Anthony 
Miller, who was pressed into action last year when the team slipped to 28th. 
</P>
<P>
Last season they went through two punters, twice as many punt returners, and 
opted not to rehire their place kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a few problems last season," Pasquale said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, and the Titanic just had this little hole down under. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really know the situation until we started practicing," Pasquale 
said. "I can tell you some of the players initially were very reluctant to be 
on these special teams. They were afraid to fail, and we had to get them over 
that hump." 
</P>
<P>
That hump, however, was Rocky Mountain tall. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we had to do was work to make sure we didn't lose games 
because of special teams," Pasquale said. "And then we began to make a strong 
effort to get us to the point where we can help win some games." 
</P>
<P>
It took three weeks. Elvis had a better chance of being spotted than that 
happening, but Sunday in Cleveland the miracle man's kickoff coverage team 
figured prominently in the Chargers' success. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Metcalf began Sunday as the NFL's leading kick returner with a 34.3-yard 
average. He had run back the opening kickoff 98 yards a week earlier for a 
touchdown, but against the Chargers, he would have been better off letting the 
officials bring it out to the 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Logically, you'd say, you wouldn't kick off to that guy," Pasquale said, "but 
we had no fear." 
</P>
<P>
Five times Metcalf accepted Fuad Reveiz's kickoff, and five times he was 
treated like a horse thief run down by the posse. He averaged 12.8 yards a 
return, and thanks for the grand memories, he went from No. 1 in the NFL to No. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
"On his last kickoff, he physically just stopped at the 10-yard line," Pasquale 
said. "He was totally confused because guys were coming from areas they should 
not have been coming from. You're talking about a great athlete who didn't know 
what the hell to do. 
</P>
<P>
"When I stepped into that huddle on that last kickoff, I had 22 eyes looking 
right at me. 'Make the call, coach, and we'll kill him.' Those were the exact 
words, and that was the confidence they had at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Why aim to be a head coach when there's a chance to be president in two years? 
</P>
<P>
"He really knows his business," Beathard said. "I mean guys who work in this 
business as long as Larry has develop a reputation. It's good or bad, and his 
is terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning has given Pasquale the opportunity and the freedom to build 
on that reputation, and armed with more ideas than you would expect a football 
coach to think of, he's come on strong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we do," Pasquale said. "It works." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being one of the few assistant coaches in the NFL with his own 
agent, Pasquale has the title of coordinator, has his own full-time assistant 
coach in LeCharls McDaniel, and three times a practice he has the Chargers 
working on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
If he asked, he could probably also get his own parking place downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who wants to succeed has got to put themselves out front and produce," 
Austin said. "Larry took a throw-away position 10 years ago, and has made it 
into a science." 
</P>
<P>
So far he's been a regular Wizard of Oz, but as he or his agent will tell you, 
Larry Pasquale is in search of so much more. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many parallels to special teams and being a head coach," Pasquale 
said. "I was a position coach, a receivers coach with the Jets before taking on 
special teams, and I coached six people. I had minimum input, and no contact 
with the total squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning. As special teams coach, I'm preparing myself to be that guy some 
day -- a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
He's one step ahead of some people already. If he ever takes on Dallas, and has 
a four-point lead in the fourth quarter, you can bet he won't call for a fake 
punt.

SAN DIEGO COLLEGE NOTEBOOKUCSD PLAYERS TOOK LONG DROP WHEN THEY WENT DOWN UNDER

Tom Marshall, the men's basketball coach at UC San Diego, expects his players 
to be able to jump, but on a recent trip to New Zealand and Australia, the 
Tritons went a bit overboard. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Joe Lindsay got the bug first. Then one-by-one, he convinced teammates, 
Marshall and even Lindsay's 51-year-old mother to go bungee jumping. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, bungee jumping. And these guys are supposed to be highly 
educated. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe started it all, and by the time the trip was over, the entire team had 
gone, including the coaching staff, including Joe's mom (Millie). Our team 
doctor even went and did it," Marshall said. "I'm not sure if it's something 
I'd do again, but it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said that a crane device with a large bucket attached hoisted jumpers 
out over a cliff with a body of water some 150 feet below. The rest was up to 
the individual and a 120-foot bungee cord. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marshall, who did some parachuting in the Army: "It's a little different 
in that you don't have that feeling of security strapped around your chest." 
</P>
<P>
From a basketball standpoint, UCSD's trip was eventful, too. The Tritons won 
five of six games. Tim Rapp averaged 25.5 points per game, Gordon McNeill 13.3 
and Rick Batt 12.8. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Gordon and Tim probably set themselves up to go back and play 
professionally when they're through with college," Marshall said. "They've 
already been told they have contracts awaiting them if they want to play 
there." 
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in six years Marshall has taken UCSD players overseas. 
In 1987, the Tritons went to Sweden and Denmark. In 1984, UCSD made history by 
becoming the first American team allowed inside the Guongdong Province of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was fun," Marshall said "Some of (the Chinese) had never seen people 
with blond hair before. But it was scary, too. We weren't used to walking 
around where everyone had an Uzi." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa graduate Mike Picotte left last week for UCLA, where he has a partial 
four-year swimming scholarship. According to his mother, Suzy, Picotte has been 
training all summer and was particularly happy to swim against Mark Spitz, who 
won seven gold medals in the 1972 Olympics and is staging a comeback for the 
Games in 1992, when he will be 42. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so excited," she said. "He beat Mark in two workouts." 
</P>
<P>
But Picotte, the defending national short-course champion in the 200-meter 
freestyle, needs to work on his distance swimming. At the La Jolla Rough Water 
Swim Sept. 9, Picotte didn't participate. 
</P>
<P>
"He was afraid he couldn't make the mile-swim in rough water," Suzy said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
She added that her son has been promised a full scholarship if he finishes in 
the top eight in his middle-distance freestyle events at the NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Chen, the University of San Diego's top woman cross-country runner the past 
two years, is stationed on the Mercy, a 250-bed Navy hospital ship in the 
Persian Gulf. Chen, 38, a Navy nurse for 17 years, attended USD the past two 
years to work on a bachelor of science degree in nursing. 
</P>
<P>
There's a sequel to The Night the Lights Went Out in Torero Stadium. Just six 
days after shutting down for 30 minutes before USD's football game with 
Occidental Sept. 8, the lights again went out. This time, it was during a 
USD-Washington soccer match. The delay was about 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Football Coach Brian Fogarty said electricians believe they located and solved 
the problem after the second incident. A main breaker appeared to have shorted 
out, causing the whole system to overload.

FARMER MAKES BIG PROFIT RAISING INSECTS THAT DEVOUR CITRUS PREDATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Reed Finfrock of Fillmore has realized a lifelong goal, to own his own farm. 
His four-acre Grand Avenue spread is a bug farm. 
</P>
<P>
Finfrock and his wife, Jan, raise Aphytis melinus, a tiny insect that preys on 
a common citrus pest called red scale. 
</P>
<P>
The operation seems worlds apart from tending a herd of dairy cows or a grove 
of fruit trees. But far from driving him buggy, Finfrock's Sespe Creek 
insectary feeds a fascination with insects that began "as soon as I was old 
enough to carry a butterfly net." 
</P>
<P>
The beneficial bug business has proved profitable as well. Citrus growers 
statewide constantly battle the red scale pest, which scars fruit and can 
damage trees. Diminutive winged Aphytis melinus is so successful in controlling 
red scale that "the demand is going through the roof," Finfrock said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the insectary is shipping an average of 1.75 million bugs a day to 
customers from Riverside to Tulare counties, nearly double 1989 production. 
</P>
<P>
Farming miniature "livestock" has its advantages. Instead of rows of outdoor 
pens, the Finfrocks house their charges in a temperature-controlled room, where 
millions of the insects mature in specially designed wooden cabinets. It's a 
tidy and compact arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
To feed the Lilliputian predators, the Finfrocks raise ivy scale, a less 
virulent cousin of the red scale. Cultured on banana or acorn squash, the ivy 
scale is grown in its own air-conditioned building. When mature scale covers 
the squash, it is carried to the predator room. In Jan Finfrock's estimation, 
the operation uses 50 tons of squash annually. 
</P>
<P>
The critters of Sespe Creek are too numerous to name or number. But Finfrock, 
whose background includes a degree in biology from the University of Redlands, 
is intimately familiar with every phase in the life of the little bugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The female does this kind of dance," Finfrock said. "It actually measures the 
scale, decides how many young it can support and lays that many eggs." 
</P>
<P>
In the next two weeks, the young devour the soft inside of their scaly host and 
emerge, ready for harvesting. No picking crews or giant combines are required; 
while still in a drawer with the squash, the adult flies are dosed with carbon 
dioxide to immobilize them. 
</P>
<P>
The harvesting table resembles a chemistry lab. Graduated cylinders are used to 
measure the number of inert insects as they are counted out and dumped into 
quart containers. 
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 bugs go into every quart container that the Finfrocks use in 
delivering the insects to their customers. The containers, which sell for $35, 
are also temperature controlled, since the pampered predators are sensitive to 
extreme temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Similar methods are used by Ventura County's two cooperative insectaries, which 
serve citrus protective districts in Fillmore and Santa Paula. The only other 
commercial insectary in the county, Rincon-Vitova, specializes in fly and aphid 
control. 
</P>
<P>
To run the self-styled "mom and pop" operation, the Finfrocks rise before dawn 
seven days a week during the February to October insect-growing season, and 
often work 10-hour days. Finfrock dreams of giving up the delivery route and 
hiring additional help. But even bugs are risky business, and he hesitates to 
predict the future. 
</P>
<P>
Like any farmer, "We're at the mercy of the weather and the market," Finfrock 
said.

15% FACE PENALTIES FOR EXCEEDING WATER ALLOCATION LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 15% of Ventura's water users are exceeding their allocations under a new 
conservation program and will have to pay penalties, city officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city also released a new rate structure that was approved in concept by the 
City Council in June. Under the new rates, which are retroactive to July 26, 
the average residential water bill for a two-month period will go up by $7 to 
$10 unless customers reduce usage. 
</P>
<P>
Under a water conservation ordinance adopted in March, single-family houses are 
allowed 294 gallons per day and multifamily residences are entitled to 196 
gallons per day. Institutional users such as the city have to cut back by 20% 
and businesses and industries by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
City public works spokeswoman Carol Green said two-thirds of the city's water 
customers have been billed since the adjustment period of the conservation 
program ended in July, and 15.4% of them have exceeded their limits, Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
First-time violators are penalized at four times the normal water rate for 
every gallon they consume beyond their entitlement. Repeat violators have to 
pay 10 times the normal rate for excess use. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a customer who uses 1,500 gallons more than his entitlement in a 
two-month billing period would pay a $15.84 penalty, according to a city 
handout. 
</P>
<P>
Among the violators so far are four schools, six businesses, eight churches and 
47 government agencies. Residential violators so far total 2,168. Green would 
not identify the violators until she verifies her numbers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The total penalty assessment against the city's violators is $270,759, but the 
violators could recoup their losses if they make up for their excess use in the 
next 12 months. If they do, the penalties will be credited to their water 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Green also said preliminary August estimates show that city residents overall 
are conserving, but total water conservation compared with last year will drop 
below the 20% mark for the first time since the program went into effect. 
Venturans cut down water use by 26.1% in June and 22.1% in July. 
</P>
<P>
The city's goal is to cut water use by 30% to make up for the effects of four 
years of drought that has depleted water reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Green said she believes that the slide in conservation efforts is only 
temporary and is related to an especially hot summer. 
</P>
<P>
Green said she is pleased that 85% of the city's water customers are complying 
with the water ordinance. "I think it's terrific," she said. "But there's some 
people who need to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
The water-rate increases are intended to offset the cost of the city's water 
conservation program and the loss of revenues from the expected decrease in 
water use. 
</P>
<P>
Green said residents who succeed in their conservation efforts will not see any 
increases in their utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, a customer whose previous water use was 2,700 cubic feet 
paid $24.99 under the old fee structure. An allocation of 2,700 cubic feet 
under the new rates costs $36.53, an increase of 46% over the old rates. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, the same customer reduced water use by about 30% and used only 
1,900 cubic feet, he would pay $24.29 under the new fee structure.

LANDMARK STATUS URGED FOR CLUB HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai Historical Preservation Commission has recommended its first landmark 
in several years. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member advisory panel, formerly called the Cultural Heritage Board, 
has unanimously recommended that the Ojai Valley Woman's Club meeting hall be 
declared a historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has not set a date to consider the designation, but it could 
come before the end of the year, said Elaine Willman, assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a new historical preservation ordinance last month that 
more clearly defines property owners' rights and responsibilities. During the 
four years it took to revise the ordinance, the commission continued to survey 
potential city landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
The Woman's Club, a nonprofit social and service club claiming 100 members, 
owns the building itself. It has sought landmark status to recognize the 
center's contributions to the community and to seek grants for repairs, 
spokeswoman Betty Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Located at 441 E. Ojai Ave., the one-story, redwood clubhouse was built in 1911 
in an early Craftsman style used before the mission motif became popular in 
Ojai. It has changed little over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen plumbing dates to 1911, the floors and other items need restoration 
and termite work will cost about $10,000, Metcalf said. The hall is rented out 
for weddings, concerts and community events. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1899 as the Daughters of the Kings, the club changed its name in 
1915. Its members, who welcomed valley newcomers and once bought a cow for a 
needy family, now help high school students with scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
The clubhouse has lodged fire and flood victims and out-of-town nurses during a 
1917 flu epidemic and even served as a classroom for students spilling out of 
the public schools. Six churches claimed sanctuary there before finding their 
own buildings, and 11 other service groups have regularly met in the hall over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
If designated, the clubhouse will join three other official city landmarks: the 
original Presbyterian Church building, Edward Drummond Libbey's former home and 
the Theodore Woolsey House, a former stagecoach stop that is now a bed and 
breakfast. THIA BELL

<P>
A Fillmore woman filed a $1-million police brutality lawsuit Tuesday against 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, alleging that three deputies beat her 
one night in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Marie Gonzalez filed the suit in Ventura County Superior Court, alleging 
that three sheriff's deputies came to her home in the 400 block of 2nd Street 
at 11:15 p.m. on Aug. 5, 1989, to ask about her son. 
</P>
<P>
While Gonzalez was warning the deputies about her dogs, the deputies grabbed 
her head, pinned her against a van, pulled her hair and kicked her in the 
stomach, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Deputy Harold Laubacher and two deputies whose full names 
are not known attacked Gonzalez and violated her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
None of the deputies could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Larry Carpenter said he remembers discussion of the incident in 
his office, but he said he did not know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and her attorney, David Kurtz, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for $1 million in punitive damages, plus legal fees. MACK REED

WATER-WASTING BAN GETS INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council gave first-round approval Tuesday to a water 
conservation ordinance that would ban water-wasting practices such as hosing 
off driveways and would impose fines and cutoffs for repeat violators. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
A second reading and vote on the ordinance is scheduled for sometime next 
month, and it would take effect 30 days after that. 
</P>
<P>
Although Oxnard is hooked into to the State Water Project, city officials said 
the ordinance will help avoid future shortages. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would also prohibit the following: watering lawns between 9 a.m. 
and 5 p.m., allowing water to run onto streets and sidewalks, and serving water 
at restaurants unless requested by a customer. It bans carwashes that do not 
recycle water, decorative fountains that do not recycle, and broken or damaged 
water fixtures that are not repaired promptly. 
</P>
<P>
Violators will be warned on their first offense. A second offense within 12 
months will result in a fine equal to 25% of the most recent utility bill or 
$25, whichever is higher. A third offense within 12 months would result in a 
fine equal to 50% of the most recent bill or $50, whichever is higher. 
</P>
<P>
If a fourth violation occurs, the city will install a water restriction device 
on the violator's line. 
</P>
<P>
If a customer violates the ordinance more than four times within 12 months, the 
city will cut off water service. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is patterned after one adopted in Camarillo in May. HUGO MARTIN

COUNCIL APPROVES FIRE SPRINKLER LAW 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance on Tuesday that will 
require installation of automatic fire sprinklers in every new building and in 
every building undergoing major modifications. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, proposed by Fire Chief Richard Smith, affects commercial and 
residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
A major modification is defined as an addition or alteration that exceeds 60% 
of the structure's replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
Similar ordinances have been adopted in 37 other cities in California, 
including Napa, Anaheim, Burbank, Glendale and San Luis Obispo. 
</P>

The ordinance has already won the support of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old law, automatic sprinklers were required only in structures larger 
than 5,000 square feet or taller than 35 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council, Smith said automatic fire sprinklers are the most 
efficient fire protection available. Considering the department's tight budget, 
he said, sprinklers are preferable to hiring more firefighters and building 
more fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, insurance rates for homes and businesses that install 
sprinklers are usually reduced 10% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"They are, without question, the most efficient and cost-effective 
fire-protection system ever designed," he said. "Only sprinklers actually 
extinguish the fire where it starts." HUGO MARTIN

VENTURA MAN BEATEN AT TELEPHONE BOOTH

A Ventura teen-ager using a telephone in a Camarillo shopping center Monday 
night was assaulted by a group of young men who said he did not belong in town. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Medeiros, 18, was at a telephone booth at the Crossroads Shopping 
Center in the 4000 block of Las Posas Road when a car containing about seven 
young men approached him, said Sgt. Paul Oechsle of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men asked Medeiros where he was from. When he answered that he was 
from Ventura, they said, "You're in the wrong town," Oechsle said. 
</P>
<P>
The young men got out of the car and beat Medeiros, Oechsle said. Medeiros 
suffered cuts on his face and a two-inch cut on his wrist, Oechsle said. 
Medeiros, who said he thought he saw a green-handled knife, was treated at 
Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Oechsle said the attackers might be the same young men, believed to belong to a 
gang, who approached Derick Williams, 19, of Oxnard as he walked in Dos Caminos 
Park Sunday night. When Williams refused to fight, one member of the group 
pulled out a knife and slashed Williams' wrist. He was treated at Pleasant 
Valley Hospital, Oechsle said. CAROL WATSON

In a settlement in Ventura County Superior Court, Ford Motor Co. has agreed to 
pay $1.7 million to the families of two oil field workers who were killed four 
years ago when the brakes on their truck failed and sent them over a cliff just 
north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Ford agreed to pay $1 million to the family of Leonard Herman and $750,000 to 
the family of Edward Myers, both 29. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives sued the auto maker for negligence in the men's deaths. The company 
also agreed to pay $25,000 to Rex Thomas, a co-worker who jumped to safety but 
sued, claiming psychological trauma, said Jonathan Zackey, an attorney for 
Herman's family. 
</P>
<P>
Herman and Myers were driving out of a Conoco oil field on San Miguel Road 
between Ventura and Carpinteria about 4 a.m. on Nov. 16, 1986, when the brakes 
apparently failed, said Jonathan Zackey, an attorney for Herman's family. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-pound, 1979 Ford LN 7000 flatbed truck gained speed down the winding 
road, ran through a barrier and plunged over a 350-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
Ford attorney Ray Kolts declined to comment. MACK REED

COUNTY CITED FOR MISSING DEADLINE ON PLAN TO REDUCE WORKER TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air pollution officials cited Los Angeles County on Tuesday for failing to meet 
a deadline for implementing a plan to reduce worker travel but encouraged the 
county to begin charging employees to park downtown. 
</P>
<P>
A South Coast Air Quality Management District inspector served the county with 
a "notice of violation" warning that it faces fines of up to $25,000 a day for 
missing a Sept. 17 deadline for implementing a traffic-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
The fines will grow until a plan is submitted by the county and approved by the 
district, an AQMD spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Sept. 18 voted to begin charging 8,000 Civic Center 
workers $70 to $225 a month to park in spaces now provided free. The parking 
fees, designed to discourage employees from commuting to work alone, are in 
response to an AQMD directive for major employers to reduce worker travel and, 
in turn, smog and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The parking fees are due to begin Monday. But in a letter to the county's chief 
administrative officer, AQMD Executive Director James Lents complained that a 
$70-a-month transportation allowance the county will give to employees will not 
be included in paychecks until Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD considers that to be the implementation date and, by that reckoning, 
the county will miss the deadline by two months. The county was first notified 
in December, 1988, that it must come up with a plan. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made on assessing fines. "We're reviewing our legal 
options," Eichhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich called the AQMD act "an outrage." He 
attributed delays to legal requirements for the supervisors to negotiate the 
traffic-reduction plan with county labor unions.

FASHION: L.A. PREVIEW SHOW OF SPRING LOOKS EXPANDS ITS VISION BEYOND THE 
CLOTHING INDUSTRY FOR A PEEK AT SOME RELATED FIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lookwest '91 began as a plan to augment the well-established, annual 
presentation of Los Angeles fashion designers' spring collections. But, typical 
of this city's erratic fashion industry, it became the only preview of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
This is something like replacing a week's episode of "The Cosby Show" with 10 
minutes of home videos about the TV series' producers. It's not the same as 
seeing a "Cosby.' But judged on its own merit it might turn out to be quite 
impressive -- as Lookwest did. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Los Angeles members of Fashion Group International -- a business 
network for women in the industry -- Monday night's event went well beyond the 
typical fashion show to explore photography, food, fine and graphic art, 
architecture, advertising, beauty and the entertainment industry, as well as 
clothing design. It was an effort to explore how these worlds relate and how 
Southern California is the raw material that inspires them all. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion segments included as few as one, and seldom more than six outfits 
by any one designer, and did not supply anything close to full coverage of the 
local fashion market. But the show did capture the eclectic assortment of 
youthful, playful, and often costume-like clothes the world looks to this city 
to supply. And the range of designers -- from the very well-established Bob 
Mackie, Nolan Miller, Georges Marciano for Guess and Robin Piccone for Body 
Glove, to newcomers Eddie Lowrie, Arrastia and Ofelia -- offered the most 
comprehensive capsule view yet of what Los Angeles fashion is all about. 
</P>
<P>
The complex presentation cut from videotaped street scenes of ethnic 
neighborhoods to live fashion showings to taped interviews with leaders in the 
designated fields. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion segments featured about 100 designers, whose spring '91 styles 
worked into certain categories chosen to reflect aspects of Los Angeles: "Wheel 
City," "Cross Culture," "Hollywood" and so on. In a more democratic show, this 
would never do, since no designer's complete idea about fashion's next 
direction was fully represented. But the Fashion Group never pretended this was 
an objective or encompassing show, and that was their prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
Maggy Barry and Stephen Walker for Van Buren were among the best represented 
designers, with a number of '60s-inspired slip dresses and body-gripping 
unitards appliqued with leather and sequined peace symbols and flowers, as well 
as an assortment of leather jackets and pants covered with stars and stripes, 
during the "Wheel City" segment of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Kevan Hall's evening wear was younger spirited than usual. His long dinner 
jacket mixed natural linen with iridescent silk and topped a brief, chiffon 
swing skirt. A short, tangerine-colored chiffon dress with illusion sleeves had 
a kicky, '60s tent-dress feel to it, seen in the Hollywood segment. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Albers showed fresh and energetic white bodysuits cropped at 
mid-thigh and topped by full cut, navy cardigan jackets of the same length 
during the "Solar Action" segment. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Brantley's crisp silk patio outfits included a glamorous, 
fuchsia-color bathrobe dress over short shorts, for "L.A. Spectrum," a segment 
about the colors of the city. From Michael Hoban of North Beach Leather, bright 
color bomber jackets were appliqued with traffic signs or "Highway 101" road 
markers. 
</P>
<P>
The latest from Body Glove beach wear was a silver neoprene fencing jacket 
covering a black Lycra romper cut to mid-thigh, with a halter top. Brenda 
Welch's evening swim wear and after-swim wear included glitter-appliques on the 
leg of crushed velvet capri pants or the center of a strapless bra top. For 
Guess, Marciano branched out from a kicky little blue denim skort (a takeoff on 
a tennis skirt) to what qualifies here, if nowhere else, as evening wear: 
silver hot pants and a sheer, slate gray man-tailored shirt. Bob Mackie offered 
several body-paving sequined evening gowns. In the true L.A. spirit, both he 
and Marciano were part of the Hollywood segment. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than try to articulate what fashion has to do with works by other 
creative forces, the producers allowed videotapes to do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
With wonderment, restaurateurs Wolfgang Puck and Barbara Lazaroff, best known 
as creators of Spago, talked about bok choy, fresh corn and other produce 
available here year-round. Artist David Hockney described his painterly 
evolution from isolated cube forms to swirling line compositions as a result of 
nothing more than a change in home address, from the flats of South Hollywood 
to the curving landscape of the Hollywood Hills. Choreographer/singer Paula 
Abdul described her early days as a typically unorthodox Los Angeles 
entrepreneur, explaining that her mother was her first agent, posing as such 
when Paramount Studios dug out then Laker Girl Abdul's home number from the 
phone book and called inquiring about her day rate as a choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
T-shirt clad, world-traveling fashion photographer Phillip Dixon remarked, 
"There's all the sophistication you need (in this city), if you want to go find 
it." Jay Chiat of Chiat/Day/Mojo Advertising, known for his sports 
photography-inspired Nike ads, recalled how athletes dress in such ads and 
noted, "A lot of fashion is either followed or generated by advertising." April 
Greiman described her sophisticated method of making high-tech graphics and 
said, "When I came to Los Angeles I was a little shocked by the lack of 
culture. The lack of tradition. But the greatest weakness is the greatest 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
And architect Jon A. Jerde, who designed the new Fashion Institute of Design 
&amp; Merchandising where a pre-show cocktail party was held, concluded: "There 
is no L.A. It's a great eclectic collision." 
</P>
<P>
The evening generated proceeds enough to finance fellowships in six categories: 
Advertising (John Butler and Mike Shine), architecture (Julian Reid), fashion 
photography (Christopher Reisig), fine art (Ian Falconer), graphic art (Lise 
Mardon) and restaurants (Mike Payne, Anne and David Gingrass). An additional 
$48,000 went to the Fashion Group's Rudi Gernreich Memorial Scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Fox and Paddy Calistro co-chaired the event, and James Watterson 
produced the fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneering spirit and overall success aside, the evening did have its problems, 
from the most practical to the more earthmoving. Some 150 members of the press 
attended the show, and many complained that they could not tell which designer 
created which outfit, since the usual list in order of appearance, the "run of 
show," was not supplied. 
</P>
<P>
An ill-conceived segment on hairstyles and makeup would have worked better as a 
video segment. Top stylists included Cristophe, Laurent Dufourg of the Jose 
Eber salon, Lemaire, Aniko of Elle, and Mitsu and Mario of Joseph Martin. The 
leading look was the short feather cut with high crown of the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
More disconcerting is the fate of the fall press week, which the California 
Mart, a building in downtown L.A. where fashion designers lease show room 
space, has traditionally sponsored. Several months ago, Mart official David 
Morse announced there would be no press week this fall, suggesting first that 
it might be incorporated into other Mart activities later, then canceling the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Among other repercussions, there will be no Designer of the Year, no Rising 
Star, no Photographer of the Year awarded this season, which has helped 
generate national business in the past. And designers will not get the national 
press coverage they usually receive. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the future holds it will have to include a rethinking of how Los 
Angeles collections are presented for review by retailers and the press.

DAREDEVIL COMPETITORS IN THE FLEDGING SPORT CALLED 'DRY LAND LUGE' HIT 80 IN 
THE ILLEGAL, DEADLY, FEET-FIRST PURSUIT OF . . . ;

<P>
DOWNHILL THRILLS

A trio of beach-bound young surfers, boards stacked in their VW convertible, 
screeched to a stop at a turnout, craned their necks and peered back in 
disbelief. "Those guys up there friends of yours?" one asked. Then he grinned. 
"PSYCHO!" 
</P>
<P>
Rolling back into sight, feet first -- at about 60 m.p.h. -- around a curve on 
Encinal Canyon Road, high above Malibu, were four men on skateboards, their 
bodies prone, only an inch or two off the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
They are pioneers, who, after six years on the fringe, are seeking legitimacy 
for their sport, a hybrid of ice luge, the popular Olympic event, and 
skateboarding. Some call it downhill skateboarding; they prefer "dry land 
luge." 
</P>
<P>
For maybe a decade, underground racers have been experimenting. For Ken Kinnee, 
28, and Bob Pereyra, 27, it started one spring day in 1984, as they sat on 
Mulholland Highway, listening to music and pondering the meaning of life. Only 
a few months before, Pereyra's brother had been killed near the spot in a 
motorcycle accident. "We made a pact," Kinnee recalls. He told Pereyra, who had 
raced cars and motorcycles professionally, "I don't want to be your friend if 
you keep doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Together they hit on the idea of dry land luge. On their first attempt, they 
stood on the boards; that idea was scrubbed after Kinnee took a bad spill on 
Mulholland. Then they tried sitting, holding their feet and head up. That 
lasted a few months, Kinnee recalls, "until our stomach muscles couldn't take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the two made longer boards. Over the years, a skinny aluminum sled, 7- to 
8-feet-long, with urethane wheels, evolved. Depending on the skill and daring 
of the "pilot," it has a downhill potential of close to 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a suicide mission, unless you're safety conscious," acknowledges Scott 
Sotebeer, a free-lance marketing consultant who has been brought in to help 
sell dry land luge as another Southern California-bred craze. 
</P>
<P>
Early on a Sunday morning, a handful of devotees meet at a Jack-in-the-Box in 
Agoura, boards atop their cars, black and red leather jumpsuits and helmets 
inside. Destination: The crest of Encinal Canyon Road, from where it's downhill 
all the way to Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The group includes Pereyra, an auto detailer; Kinnee; Jeff Levy, 23, a 
carpenter; Rob Munsey, 26, a print shop employee, and his friend, Lisa 
Guardino, 22, a floral designer. 
</P>
<P>
The two-lane highway that curves and twists down to the ocean is their race 
course. They speak of the beauty of their sport, of how it can be done on any 
mountain road. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a road they must share with two-way traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The lugers suit up, pulling on their "leathers" and high-top canvas shoes with 
rubber soles and, finally, full-face fiberglass helmets. Pereyra, tying his 
shoe, says, "For somebody who has the want to go out racing, this sport is the 
most feasible. There's no chance of falling and hurting yourself." 
</P>
<P>
He smiles and says, "You can't get attached to a pair of shoes. You'll lose 
them by the end of the day." He doesn't mean lose them, exactly; he means burn 
them out. These boards, which cost about $175, have no brakes; boarders stop by 
dragging their feet on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Gravity is their motor. They steer by leaning, which they refer to as "hanging 
a leg" or "hanging a shoulder," sometimes dragging a shoulder on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
It is quiet up here, very quiet. No engines, no fuel smells. 
</P>
<P>
The lead car, a black Jeep, pulls onto the highway and, behind it, four lugers 
roll out, flat on their boards, pushing off with gloved hands. As their speed 
builds, the sound of wheels on pavement builds to a loud rumble. 
</P>
<P>
Behind them, a chase car guards their patch of highway. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a race; it is practice. By midday they make three or four runs, the 
last an uninterrupted five-mile, five-minute thrill ride to the bottom, with 
Kinnee riding in the shadow of the Jeep, at one point touching the bumper with 
his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Cars come up the hill slowly; their passengers gawk. 
</P>
<P>
The lugers are used to this. Most people think they are motorcyclists who have 
fallen, and they wonder what happened to the cycles. Some are horrified -- 
"You're animals!" Others are titillated. Pereyra says, "Once we had a car full 
of elderly people go by and as they passed us they were clapping." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "We've had people ask if the Highway Patrol knows about this. But 
we've never been yelled at, 'Get off the road, you maniacs!' " 
</P>
<P>
He emphasizes, "We're not out here just joking around. We're out here to do 
something serious." Without hesitation, he adds, "We are the Indianapolis of 
our sport." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But, because of a lack of funds -- and, so far, major corporate 
sponsorship -- this Indy is without a course on which to practice. Closing a 
road and hiring off-duty officers costs money and the Land Luge International 
Racing Assn., which Kinnee has formed as the official sanctioning body, is in 
its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
So, for now, they must share the road with the cars. It is necessity, not some 
devil-may-care streak, that dictates this arrangement, says Kinnee, the father 
of two small sons. He, as much as anyone, understands the dangers of the open 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, zipping down Encinal Canyon, he came out on the short end in a 
run-in with a three-quarter-ton truck. He describes what happened: 
</P>
<P>
"We were skating on the road when this truck came down in front of me," pulling 
out from a side road. He figures he was doing 70 m.p.h., the truck a little 
faster, when the driver waved him around. After that, the details are fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I remember is a tire was coming down over the top of my 
helmet. . . . I got spun around under the truck. I guess the guy hadn't noticed 
he'd run me over." 
</P>
<P>
The front wheels ran over Kinnee, then, as he tried desperately to maneuver his 
board between the rear wheels to escape, he was run over again. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnee wound up on the other side of the road, lying across his board, feet 
uphill. "I broke my arm in about 30 places, broke both shoulder blades, my 
right ankle and my left knee." Six weeks later, he was out of his casts -- and 
back on his skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
He is philosophical. "I was doing something I should not have been doing" -- 
skating in front of an inexperienced chase-car driver who let another vehicle 
in, and passing a car on his board. "That's a no-no," he says. "Nobody does 
that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling down the highway at 60-plus m.p.h. may get the adrenaline pumping, but 
is it legal? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly not," says Sgt. Terry Enright of the California Highway Patrol's 
Malibu station. He points out a county ordinance prohibiting skateboarding in 
any form on a county road with more than a 3% grade or in excess of 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost suicide, is what it is," says Sheriff's Deputy Wayne Encinas, who 
works out of Malibu. "People driving their vehicles, they can't even see these 
guys coming downhill because they're prone to the highway. It's outrageously 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Enright says the CHP has issued citations to the skateboarders for interfering 
with traffic, but he is not aware of any vehicular accidents caused by them. 
"It hasn't been a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "Typically, someone riding a skateboard downhill on a canyon road has 
picked a spot that is somewhat remote . . . and we don't have the statistical 
data that establishes that we should be in the canyon roads looking for 
skateboarders. In the Malibu area, we have a lot of major accidents on Pacific 
Coast Highway and the major canyon roads." 
</P>
<P>
In his view, it's "only common sense that someone lying on a very low device on 
the roadway is not going to be highly visible to motor vehicle traffic. 
Certainly, that is an incredible hazard. There's also a danger to the 
skateboard rider if they just fall off. That's two counts against them, their 
low visibility and the possibility of them colliding with a 3,500-pound car." 
</P>
<P>
Kinnee worries that onlookers will spot one skater, take their eyes off the 
road and fail to see other skaters. "I like making eye contact" with oncoming 
drivers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnee has heard of one fatality -- out of state -- and he knows of one other 
skater who was run over. He and his team -- Max Racing -- were clocked at 86 
m.p.h. during a night run on Kanan Road, a world record. "That's too fast," he 
says -- unless the road is closed to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the dry land lugers gained a reputation as daredevils, an image they 
are eager to shake. Thus, they turned down a request from a national tabloid to 
do something crazy, like skate through a blazing hay bale; they did agree to 
skate under a monster truck. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a sideshow," Pereyra says. The thrill of the road, skaters say, is 
not ducking automobiles; it is speed and control and camaraderie and trust. He 
looks for the day when the downhill skateboarders can practice and compete on 
safe, sanctioned courses, perhaps ski resorts in summertime. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't sure it will ever be a major spectator event, reasoning it lacks the 
sex appeal of crashing cars. But in "dream time," he envisions major 
sponsorship and major television coverage and maybe even an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnee points to tattoos on both his arms and notes, "The biggest mistake I 
ever made. I was 14 years old." Major corporate sponsors like squeaky clean 
images, not tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
But he is thinking big. He still does some auto detailing (a Motley Crue 
member, he says, was a client). Mostly, though, he's banking on dry land luge, 
having sunk $30,000 into promoting it. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, he says, "I'd be disappointed if we weren't on an equal par with 
NASCAR (the National Assn. for Stock Car Racing)," whose leading money winner 
tops $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, smiling, "I plan on being a multimillionaire." 
</P>
<P>
For now, there are about 160 association members worldwide and, Kinnee 
estimates, about five times that number experimenting with dry land luge, some 
of them head-first skaters. Kinnee thinks those people are crazy: "I can't 
imagine having my head be the first thing that's going to hit. You'd wind up 
looking like one of those dogs with the flat faces." 
</P>
<P>
On this morning, up in the Santa Monica Mountains, one of the lugers' favorite 
spots (the others are in Saugus and Glendora), Lisa Guardino, a 5-foot-1 
novice, is on her second run. Rob Munsey has made several runs and now, from 
the chase car, he watches her and says, "This makes me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car laughs and says, "If my girlfriend did this, I don't know 
what I'd do to take her out for thrills." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, there is trouble ahead. Guardino loses control and swerves onto the 
shoulder. She has "high-sided," let her board tip on edge. A nasty cut on her 
thumb requires an emergency room trip and a few stitches. 
</P>
<P>
What does a luger see, zooming down the highway parallel to the pavement? "The 
top of your feet, your stomach -- and the whole road ahead," Munsey says. 
</P>
<P>
With no motor, no brakes and no steering wheel, who or what is in control? 
Pereyra says the pilot is totally "in command." He points out that a skater 
going 80 m.p.h. can come to a complete stop in the length of a telephone pole 
-- better by far than a car can do -- and that, unlike a downhill biker, he 
faces no danger of a brake cable breaking. 
</P>
<P>
With his bent left arm temporarily immobilized by metal plates, Kinnee is, for 
the moment, a "one-hander," which precludes his competing in races. Racing 
rules stipulate holding on with both hands. The association, which hopes to 
stage its first sanctioned competition in the Los Angeles area this fall, also 
specifies that racers must be age 18 or over and must wear protective gear (the 
leathers cost about $285 and the helmets about $350). Dry land luge is a unisex 
sport, with women and men competing side by side. 
</P>
<P>
Each team has developed its own hand signals to indicate, for example, that the 
lead car should speed up or that there is danger ahead. And each pilot has 
developed a feel for the road. They know, for example, that riding on the white 
road stripe increases their speed. 
</P>
<P>
Speed is their high. "I love going fast. I can't lie about that," Pereyra says. 
"It is dangerous, and I accept that." But, he says, "Jumping out of airplanes, 
all those things, are a lot more crazy than this." 
</P>
<P>
The dry land lugers have what they describe as an uneasy relationship with 
traditional skateboarders. Some lugers' jargon is borrowed from them, some of 
it from car and motorcycle racers. "Dicing" is changing positions. A "slingshot 
move" is a pull out-and-pass maneuver. An air pocket is a "draft." And they 
will say, "Let's go skate." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the thrills, they have collected speeding tickets. None of these 
luge enthusiasts claims that the sport is without peril. Jeff Levy says, "I 
always say a prayer before I go down the hill. I want to know someone is there 
overlooking me . . . once you get through those first few turns, everything's 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Pereyra admits, "I've been doing this for six years and I still can't watch 
anybody do it." This day, he will clip a reflector in the center of the road 
with his elbow, raising a nasty bump beneath his leathers. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest dangers are that a vehicle will veer into their lane or that the 
skater will lose control and cross lanes. Lugers hit the road in early morning. 
Levy explains, "The traffic coming home from the beach is all against us. The 
two don't mix." 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd wanted to play tag with cars," Pereyra says, "we'd have been dead 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
As their visitor drives away, Pereyra and Kinnee caution, "Be careful out 
there!"

GETTING ZAPPED!; 
</P>
<P>
SUDDEN POWER SURGES MAY RUIN COMPUTERS AND OTHER COSTLY EQUIPMENT, BUT AN 
INEXPENSIVE DEVICE CAN PREVENT DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumers beware: That jolt of electricity that makes your lights momentarily 
brighter can wreck some of your expensive electronic equipment, especially home 
computers. Equally damaging can be a sudden drop in power. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what happened recently to one Westwood resident: He returned from work 
one night to find that a power surge in his apartment building had wiped out 
his $350 portable CD player and a $70 clock and seriously damaged his VCR, 
aquarium light, plant light and microwave. The CD player and clock were beyond 
repair; the rest would cost $280 to fix. Total damage: $700. 
</P>
<P>
Power surges have various causes -- a downed line, faulty transformer, 
lightning, a Mylar balloon hitting a power line. Often the utility company does 
not know there has been a surge until customers complain about damage. 
</P>
<P>
While surges always have occurred, they now cause more grief than before 
because so many consumers now own highly sophisticated, sensitive electronic 
equipment, said Robert McMillen of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who added: "Twenty years ago, you would see the lights flicker and that 
would be the only effect. But (then) we didn't have VCRs and microwave ovens 
that have digital clocks that start blinking when there's a voltage problem. 
The new equipment . . . like computers, VCRs, microwave ovens, even some of the 
burglar alarms, now are very sensitive" to surges or interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, electrical problems occur more frequently in hot weather when the 
systems can become overloaded due to extra consumer use, but winter months 
often have storms that can cause power outages. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more lightning that people here think we do," said Gary Davis of 
Southern California Edison, which supplies electricity to customers throughout 
50,000 square miles in Southern California. "In wintertime we usually have a 
couple storms come through the metropolitan area, and this year we had 
lightning in May and July. I've lived here all my life and we've been getting 
more lightning in the last few years and more humidity." 
</P>
<P>
Utility companies are required by the state Public Utility Commission to 
maintain residential electrical voltage between 114 and 120 volts, unless a 
240-volt line is used for special needs, such as an electrically heated hot 
tub. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a blackout, in which a total loss of power occurs, a surge -- or what 
experts call a transient condition or voltage spike -- can cause a sudden, 
large jolt of electricity to enter a house; it also can result in a brief 
period of lower than normal voltage. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible for a surge to damage electronic equipment, even though it lasts 
milliseconds, or, in some cases, nanoseconds (one billionth of a second). 
Frequent power fluctuations, experts warn, can cause early burnout of appliance 
motors. 
</P>
<P>
There are devices called surge or spike suppressors to protect home computers 
and expensive entertainment systems. The bar-like devices, priced from $10 to 
$80, have outlets for plugging in equipment; they, in turn, connect to standard 
wall outlets. The suppressors use variable resistors and arresters to short out 
excess voltage and absorb that current before it reaches equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Some electronic manufacturers, in writing, recommend that consumers use surge 
suppressors with their products. And "every computer store tells you to get 
one," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumer Action 
Network (UCAN), a nonprofit utility watchdog group with 56,743 members in the 
San Diego area. "Not having one for a computer is like having unsafe sex. You 
shouldn't take a chance. Really, you should have a surge suppressor for 
anything valuable." 
</P>
<P>
If buying a suppressor, be sure to read the package to check its listed 
"clamping level." That is the maximum voltage the device is supposed to let 
through. The levels can differ. Some list a 200-volt clamping level; others up 
to 400. The lower the clamping level, the better the protection. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have a suppressor and your lights start flickering, Shames said, 
unplug your equipment. "When the lights go back on, it's even more dangerous," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not home when a surge occurs, document the damage and call your 
utility company. Depending on its policy, the utility may pay for repairs or 
replacements. (The Westwood resident with the damaged items is waiting to 
settle his $700 claim with DWP.) 
</P>
<P>
When submitting a claim to any utility, specify the date, time and place of the 
power problem. Include copies -- never send originals -- of receipts from 
repair bills. Some utilities have claim forms to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's an act of God -- a wind storm, lightning, a pole down -- or something 
we have no control over, we wouldn't settle the claim," said a representative 
of Pasadena Water and Power. "If it is a mistake by a maintenance crew, 
something we did, we're responsible for that." 
</P>
<P>
DWP gets "in excess of 500 claims a year," but they are not categorized "by 
type of occurence," said Harvey Lutske, the utility's chief claims agent. We 
encourage people to call us and then we send field people out to investigate." 
</P>
<P>
DWP will either pay claims, deny them or offer partial payment. "We negotiate 
an agreement," Lutske said. "There's a little horse trading on both sides. If 
you have a 4-year-old TV that was ruined, then we owe you a 4-year-old set, not 
a new one." 
</P>
<P>
Residents in apartments should check with their building manager to see if the 
building's insurance covers surge damage. 
</P>
<P>
For repeated problems with a utility, UCAN's Shames advises homeowners to "put 
on a voltage meter to check it. If they can establish a voltage fluctuation, 
the utility is responsible for it. If the utility won't pay, we just send the 
consumers to small claims court, and they never lose."

CAMPBELL PAYS $300,000 IN SKYYWALKER SETTLEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: THE 2 LIVE CREW LEADER AGREES NOT TO USE VARIATION ON THE NAME 
TRADEMARKED BY 'STAR WARS' FILMMAKER GEORGE LUCAS.

<P>
2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell paid filmmaker George Lucas more than 
$300,000 and agreed to quit using the name Luke Skyywalker in an out-of-court 
settlement revealed late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which actually transpired two weeks ago, puts to rest a 
$300-million federal trademark infringement lawsuit filed by the Marin 
County-based Lucasfilm Ltd., on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claimed that Campbell, by using the name Luke Skyywalker, had engaged 
in unfair competition and infringement on a licensed Lucas trademark. Luke 
Skywalker is the fictional hero of Lucas' blockbuster "Star Wars" trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
Lucasfilm attorney Charles Shephard refused to comment on the specific 
financial arrangements of the agreement, but said the settlement put into force 
a permanent injunction on Sept. 12 prohibiting Campbell and his company from 
using any variation of the Skywalker trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely pleased with the settlement," Shephard said. "Mr. Campbell can 
no longer appear on stage calling himself Skywalker. Nor can he ever again sell 
a record or wear clothing that bears the name." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also frees Campbell from having to appear in court to face 
contempt charges filed by Lucasfilm on July 5. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, in rehearsal for 2 Live Crew's upcoming national tour, could not be 
reached for comment, but David Chackler, Luke Records' chief operating officer, 
said although the company agreed to the settlement, Campbell admitted no 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was more expedient to settle the issue now," Chackler said, "Rather 
than just let it drag on forever in the courts." 
</P>
<P>
The contempt application developed out of allegations by Lucasfilm that 
Campbell had violated U.S. District Court Judge James Ideman's May 9 
preliminary injunction barring Campbell from using any variation of the name 
"Luke Skywalker." 
</P>
<P>
Ideman ruled that 2 Live Crew's use of sexually explicit lyrics could "dilute 
the distinctive quality" of the Lucas trademark and demanded that Campbell stop 
using the Skywalker name pending the outcome of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he stopped using the name in June and changed the title of his 
record company from Skyywalker Records to Luke Records.

COUNCIL REJECTS GROVE FESTIVAL BAILOUT; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: FOLLOWING THE CITY COUNCIL'S DENIAL OF EMERGENCY FUNDS, THE GARDEN 
GROVE TROUPE HAS CANCELED ITS FINAL PERFORMANCE OF SEASON.

<P>
The cash-starved Grove Shakespeare Festival, which has canceled the final 
production of its current season, is apparently a traitor to American culture 
because it produces the work of foreign authors. 
</P>
<P>
At least that was the message Grove artistic director Thomas F. Bradac says he 
took away from the City Council debate Monday night, when a 3-2 majority denied 
the Grove emergency funds that would have enabled the troupe to close out the 
season in December with Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were all surprised to hear that Councilman (Raymond T.) Littrell 
believes Shakespeare and the classics are un-American," Bradac said in a 
midnight interview Monday, after the Grove board of directors canceled "A 
Child's Christmas" but reiterated its decision to open Oscar Wilde's "The 
Importance of Being Earnest" Oct. 4 as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"What he basically said was that we should only be doing American culture," 
Bradac claimed, "that we shouldn't be doing Italian culture or the German 
culture, and we don't need Shakespeare. The issue really comes back again to a 
majority of the council believing that Shakespeare and the classics are not 
something they want in their community." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Littrell said that Shakespeare is not American culture, and 
that "we left England to get away from that." Tuesday, though, he maintained 
that he had not labeled Shakespeare and the classics un-American, nor had he 
asserted that the Grove should promote only American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say that. I said we have a great American culture and we really 
aren't taking care of it. We are doing everybody else's culture," Littrell said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
This season the Grove has produced three Shakespearean plays -- "Much Ado About 
Nothing," "As You Like It" and "Othello" -- and "The Miser" by Voltaire. 
Shakespeare was English, Voltaire was French, Wilde was Irish, and Thomas was 
Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
Littrell said Tuesday that the issues are money and whether the city should 
fund the theater at all, and not an "artsy thing" concerning various cultures. 
"There's nothing un-American about making a business deal," he said. "When they 
can't keep it together, don't blame (the council). They (the theater) don't 
have a business plan in place to recover from their financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
Bradac pointed out, however, that a detailed business plan had been presented 
to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old, nonprofit Grove troupe operates the outdoor Festival 
Amphitheatre and the indoor Gem Theatre, both owned by the city, under a city 
contract.

BINDINGS: COLLECTOR SNAPPED UP THE BEST OF THE BINDERS' ART FOR 12 YEARS. NOW 
HE PLANS TO SELL 150 OF THE JEWELED AND LEATHER WORKS AT AN AUCTION.

<P>
Paul Chevalier loved to collect jeweled leather book bindings as long as he 
could buy the very best. For 12 years he did exactly that until he assembled 
America's finest private collection of British, American and European bindings 
from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
He snapped up rare examples of impeccable craftsmanship from London's top 
binderies: Sangorski and Sutcliffe, Riviere and Zaehnsdorf. Unique bindings of 
John Keats' "Some Poems," Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient 
Mariner" and two volumes of William Shakespeare's "The Tragedy of Romeo and 
Juliet" -- all produced around 1915 as illuminated manuscripts -- found their 
way to the library of Chevalier's English Tudor-style house in the Los Feliz 
area. So did one of 25 copies of a Bible printed in 1953 for the coronation of 
Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
But Chevalier, a senior vice president at Carter Hawley Hale, was so successful 
at collecting that he eventually ran out of things to buy. "The fun was the 
chase and learning about the field, but about a year ago the market ran out. 
Now it's time for other people to have an opportunity to collect this 
material," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential collectors' first big opportunity will be Nov. 9, when Christie's New 
York plans to auction about 150 rare and precious bindings from Chevalier's 
collection. The sale is expected to bring a total of $755,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Keats binding -- with floral patterns and the author's monogram executed in 
tiny stones and inlays of colored leather -- is expected to bring the sale's 
top price of $125,000 to $175,000. The astonishingly complex work, which is 
considered the masterpiece of Sangorski and Sutcliffe, contains about 4,400 
pieces of leather and more than 1,000 jewels. 
</P>
<P>
The Coleridge volume -- depicting a red-sailed galleon on the high seas with an 
albatross soaring in the sky -- is estimated at $60,000 to $90,000. Henry 
Wadsworth Longfellow's "Selections," an illuminated manuscript with a jeweled 
leather binding, also is expected to sell for $60,000 to $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two jeweled Shakespeare bindings, to be sold together, are valued at a 
total of $45,000 to $75,000. Two other top-priced items, each estimated at 
$30,000 to $40,000, are set with miniature portraits on ivory. W.H. 
Worthington's "Portraits of the Sovereigns of England" has 39 portrait 
miniatures, while a two-volume binding of Julia Frankau's "William Ward A.R.A., 
James Ward A.R.A." is set with 25 ivories. 
</P>
<P>
The art market, which has sent auction prices to astronomical heights during 
the last few years, appears to have calmed, but Chevalier is not concerned 
about selling at a disadvantageous time. His collection contains items that 
come on the market so rarely that he believes collectors will jump at the 
opportunity to buy. 
</P>
<P>
The market for fine bindings has risen steadily in recent years, with top 
pieces bringing six figures, "but it has to be a very unusual binding to do 
that," said Stephen Massey, head of Christie's books and manuscripts 
department. 
</P>
<P>
The record for an English binding is $418,000, paid for a Bible that was 
produced in 1680 at the Queens' Binder B in Oxford. The Bible was sold in 1988 
at Christie's $37.8-million series of auctions from the Edward Laurence Doheny 
Memorial Library of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, Calif. Most of the prime 
pieces in the Chevalier collection were once in the Phoebe A.D. Boyle library, 
which was sold in 1923 at a legendary auction in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier said he became interested in collecting while frequenting an 
antiquarian bookshop on business trips to New York. He subsequently visited the 
great binderies in Britain and became a scholar in the field. Jewels were set 
in metal bindings for bibles in the Middle Ages, but Sangorski and Sutcliffe (a 
company formed in 1901 by Frances Sangorski and George Sutcliffe) was the first 
firm to make jeweled leather bindings, he said. The stones -- including 
garnets, pearls, turquoise and amethysts -- are set in gold within designs of 
inlaid colored leather that are often detailed with gilt. 
</P>
<P>
Sothgran's, a prestigious London bookseller, took an interest in Sangorski and 
Sutcliffe's innovative work around 1907 and began to commission bindings. 
Business boomed during the Arts and Crafts period; by 1910 there were more than 
10,000 binderies in England, Chevalier said. Jeweled bindings are rare, 
however, because of the time and expense required to produce them. Sangorski 
and Sutcliffe did its best work between 1912 and 1914, but World War I nearly 
put an end to the craft, he said. Since then, many examples have been destroyed 
or damaged.

The door to Mike Wallace's glass-walled office is closed for a few moments, but 
people keep coming in anyway. Producers half the age of the 72-year-old Wallace 
want to discuss long-term investigative pieces they're doing with "60 Minutes' 
" bulldog inquisitor. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace thrives on the bustle. 
</P>
<P>
"Had it not been for '60 Minutes,' I'm sure they would've jettisoned me, thrown 
me over the side some place, because people want new faces, new reporters, new 
blood," he says later. Instead, "60 Minutes" began its 23rd season Sept. 16 as 
the No. 1 show in the weekly Nielsens. And Wallace (who works for a 67-year-old 
executive producer in "60 Minutes" creator Don Hewitt) is not exactly ready for 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a contract until I'm 75, and then I'll re-negotiate!" he says, 
laughing. "I'll retire when my toes turn up -- in other words, when I die. As 
long as I get the job done, what's the point in leaving? Seriously, I'm a very 
bad solitary person; I need to rub up against people and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
A retrospective of that friction can be seen in a CBS News special, "Mike 
Wallace, Then and Now," that airs at 10 tonight (Channels 2 and 8). The program 
-- which marks Wallace's 40 years in broadcasting -- includes black-and-white 
kinescopes from his live 1950s talk show, some of "60 Minutes' " "ambush 
interviews" of miscreants, and profiles ranging from Golda Meir to Vladimir 
Horowitz and Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a stroll through 40 years of stories that I've done and people I've 
talked to," says Wallace. "It's a snapshot of this country, in a strange way." 
</P>
<P>
For a man who has made a career of probing the lives of his subjects, Wallace, 
like many journalists, has been remarkably private about his private life. But, 
during the interview, he said that he had been treated for depression in 1985 
during what was probably the low point in his career, a $120-million libel suit 
against CBS by Gen. William Westmoreland. 
</P>
<P>
(Westmoreland sued CBS and Wallace over a 1982 "CBS Reports" documentary for 
which Wallace was a correspondent. The documentary alleged that in the late 
1960s, Westmoreland and other U.S. military officials in Vietnam conspired to 
mislead the President and the public about enemy strength in order to maintain 
popular support for the war. The general ultimately withdrew his suit in 
exchange for a statement about his patriotism by CBS. While CBS stood by the 
facts of the broadcast, the network's own internal investigation acknowledged 
that the producer of the documentary had broken some of CBS News' guidelines.) 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the trial, Wallace collapsed from exhaustion and was admitted 
to a New York hospital for several days. 
</P>
<P>
"It triggered a clinical depression in me," says Wallace. "I didn't know that's 
what it was. All I knew was that I was exhausted, emotionally exhausted. Only 
when the psychiatrist at the hospital came and saw me and talked to me and 
diagnosed it did I understand what it was. There were a lot of things going on. 
My marriage was busting up, I was moving out of the house that I'd lived in for 
22 years, and I was on trial. When a reporter goes on trial for libel, you're 
going to his gut. You're going to his soul because you are calling him a cheat. 
If there's anything that a reporter does not want to be called, it's a cheat." 
</P>
<P>
He felt better as soon as the trial was over and persuaded his doctor to take 
him off the anti-depressant he'd been taking. Several months later, after 
returning from a trip on a story in Nicaragua, Wallace fell and broke his wrist 
playing tennis, triggering a second bout with depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I was deeper in the second time than the first, and that went on for about six 
more months. I didn't want to tell anybody here; nobody knew. They knew that I 
was acting very strangely, but they didn't know what it was. That went on for 
some months. I knew what it was the second time around, and was back on that 
same thing and talking to the same guy." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wallace says, "That's now five years ago, and I feel wonderful. Part of 
the happiness, the energy that you understand in me is the self-knowledge that 
comes through having been through that kind of situation." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace has been married for four years to the former Mary Yates, the widow of 
producer Ted Yates, who encouraged Wallace to change the then-landscape of 
polite TV-talk as the creator of Wallace's 1950s New York talk show, "Night 
Beat." 
</P>
<P>
This marriage, his third, seems to have softened some of Wallace's edges. "I'm 
a very contented fellow," Wallace says quietly. "Why not? I have a good job, 
I've got good health, and I have a companion to whom I'm utterly devoted."

BROOKS GIVES DODGERS THAT SOMETHING EXTRA; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HIS TWO-RUN HOME RUN IN THE 10TH LEADS TO A 3-1 VICTORY OVER THE 
ASTROS AND CUTS THE REDS' LEAD TO 3 1/2 GAMES.

It was nearly 11 p.m. here when Hubie Brooks hit a line drive over the 
left-field fence, but the Dodgers believe Tuesday's game was won eight hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
That was when Brooks, despite the aches in his knees and wrist, took early 
batting practice in an empty Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more important for me to win (a division title) than anything I've ever 
done, because it's the only thing I've never done," said Brooks, whose 
10th-inning, two-run homer gave the Dodgers a 3-1 victory over the Houston 
Astros before 7,093. 
</P>
<P>
With one long swing at a 1-and-0 sinker from Juan Agosto, Brooks helped move 
the Dodgers to within 3 1/2 games of the National League West-leading 
Cincinnati Reds, who lost to Atlanta, 10-0. The Dodgers have seven games 
remaining, and the Reds have eight left, all at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Dodgers' second consecutive extra-inning victory at the home of a 
team that is tied for second in the league in home victories with 45. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget the '64 Phillies, don't forget the '64 Phillies," shouted catcher 
Mike Scioscia in the clubhouse, referring baseball's fabled losers who blew a 6 
1/2-game lead to the St. Louis Cardinals with 12 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reds are limping home," Scioscia said. "Right now, we are the best team in 
our division." 
</P>
<P>
They are among the most motivated, beginning with Brooks, who had not hit a 
home run since Sept. 9, and entered the day with only four hits in his last 16 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
This is why he showed up early to get in a few extra swings even though his 
knees are so sore he wrapped them in ice after Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"It all goes back to the philosophy of Tommy (Lasorda)," said coach Mark 
Cresse, who pitched to Brooks. "We aren't smarter than anybody else, we just 
work harder." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brooks: "I've been struggling lately, I just wanted to come out and get 
myself together. If I think I need the extra hitting, I'll be there for it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got the extra hitting they needed from Brooks in the 10th inning, 
after they had come back from a 1-0 deficit in the eighth with a sacrifice fly 
by Eddie Murray that scored Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
They had already blown a chance to win it in the ninth when Gibson was picked 
off first base. They had already used four pitchers, including starter Ramon 
Martinez and top setup reliever Tim Crews and Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
When Murray drew a one-out walk in the 10th, "I didn't need to hit into any 
double-play grounder," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't, knocking a pitch from Agosto so hard that just beyond home plate, 
Brooks turned toward the left-field fence to watch it while sidestepping toward 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
It was his 20th homer, tying a career high and giving the Dodgers three players 
with 20 homers for the first time in five years, since Greg Brock Pedro 
Guerrero, Mike Marshall and Greg Brock did it in 1985. Kal Daniels leads the 
Dodgers with 26 homers and Murray has 25. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave Brooks 89 runs batted in. His next RBI will give the Dodgers three 
90-plus RBI men for the first time in 16 years, since Steve Garvey, Jim Wynn 
and Ron Cey in 1974. Murray has 91 RBIs and Daniels has 90. 
</P>
<P>
But Brooks said those milestones mean nothing compared to a more personal one. 
In his previous nine major league seasons, with the New York Mets and Montreal 
Expos, he has never made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about that every year," Brooks said. "I want to experience that. I 
want to have a chance at it. It really would be something. 
</P>
<P>
"Anymore, that is the only thing that matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell threw two scoreless innings, retiring the side in the 10th, to even 
his record at 5-5. By that time, Martinez, attempting to become the youngest 
Dodger to win 20 games since Ralph Branca won 21 games at age 21 in 1947, was 
in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez allowed one run and two hits in six innings, with both hits coming in 
the same inning. He allowed only five other baserunners, on an error, a hit 
batter and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
But after getting 5.1 runs per game in his first 30 starts, this time the 
Dodgers did not score for him. And he had the misfortune of making a bad first 
pitch to former teammate Franklin Stubbs to start the second. Stubbs hit it 
over the left-field fence for his 21st homer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin was a late scratch from the Dodgers' lineup. He was replaced by 
Mike Sharperson, making his third start at shortstop this season. 
</P>
<P>
Arthroscopic surgery on Jay Howell's knee will probably be Oct. 4, the day 
after the end of the season. Although Howell would not admit it, his injury 
appeared to affect him Monday when he pitched in the seventh and eighth 
innings. Of six batters he faced, he gave up two singles with a walk and a hit 
batter. The Astrodome mound is sloped more than most, and Howell was forced to 
land harder on his injured knee, causing him to lose his rhythm. "What does it 
matter? I just stunk," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears Mickey Hatcher could return to the Dodgers if he accepts a lesser 
contract. The Dodgers realize there are few veterans who can fill Hatcher's 
role on the field and in the clubhouse. "I have no indication of what is 
happening," said Hatcher, whose one-year contract expires this winter. He will 
be 36 by opening day next season. "The Dodgers have always been great to me, so 
in that sense I feel good about things, but I wonder if they will offer me a 
contract even with my lack of playing time, or go with younger guys," said 
Hatcher, who leads Dodger pinch-hitters with .302 average in 43 at-bats.

The University of Florida decided against filing a formal appeal of NCAA 
sanctions announced last week, but proposed that it be assessed scholarship 
reductions in football rather than a ban on a bowl appearance this season. 
</P>
<P>
University President John V. Lombardi informed the NCAA in a two-paragraph 
letter that Florida will not contest the findings or penalties returned after a 
15-month investigation of the football and basketball programs.

Doug Moe Jr., formerly a Denver Nuggets' assistant coach under his father, sued 
the first black owners of a major sports franchise, claiming he was fired 
because he is white. 
</P>
<P>
The civil complaint against the Denver Nuggets Limited Partnership alleges the 
"acts in terminating were without cause and were motivated, in part, by 
consideration of race." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed in Denver District Court alleges that the firing constituted 
breach of contract because the younger Moe received oral assurances he would be 
signed to a new one-year contract worth $80,000 for this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets have since hired Paul Westhead as coach and Jim Boyle as an 
assistant. Both are white.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE ALMOST GOT TIRED OUT NEAR THE FINISH

Odds-on favorite T K's Skipper won Saturday night's race in the American Pacing 
Classic Series at Los Alamitos. Shortly after the finish, a loud pop sounded 
throughout the track. 
</P>
<P>
Videotape of the stretch drive showed that the right wheel of the winner's 
sulky was vibrating, providing the bettor who had $20,000 to show on TK's 
Skipper a rare opportunity: Cheering for a tire. 
</P>
<P>
'Dog and Tiger show: Monday's editions noted that history repeated itself when 
Chicago's Kevin Butler kicked the game-winning field goal in the final four 
seconds to defeat Minnesota. Six years ago Saturday, Butler kicked the 
game-winner with 11 seconds remaining for Georgia to beat Clemson. The common 
element was Donald Igwebuike, the Vikings' kicker Sunday and Clemson's kicker 
six years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson alumnus Mark Crammer suggested that Denver Bronco kicker David 
Treadwell also be saluted, if only as a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Treadwell kicked a field goal in overtime to beat Seattle. Four years 
ago Saturday, he kicked a field goal with no time left to give Clemson a 31-28 
victory over Georgia. Three years ago Saturday, he kicked a field goal in the 
last two seconds to beat Georgia, 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only Division I-A conference in which two pairs of teams 
have the same nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
By the numbers: Bill Dobson, Occidental's offensive coordinator, walked onto 
the field with his players to get ready for the Tigers' football game against 
Azusa Pacific Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Near midfield, he saw three students in street clothes rehearsing a series of 
football moves with Oxy sports information director Jim Kerman. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dobson: "He was training his statistics crew. He had a football, and he 
was walking them through every possible play -- straight handoff, lateral, pass 
behind the line of scrimmage, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Hey, maybe I should go into this much detail with my guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
He got the first name right: During Monday night's telecast of the Buffalo 
Bills-New York Jets, the announcer on ABC's promotional spot for Saturday's 
USC-Ohio State game pronounced the name of the Trojans' quarterback, "Todd 
Mara-NO-vich." 
</P>
<P>
Unseating news: The Physician and Sportsmedicine magazine, noting in its 
September issue that Prince Charles of England has suffered two leg fractures 
in a fall from his polo pony, added: 
</P>
<P>
"According to David E. Nelson, M.D., an epidemiologist at the Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta, the rate of serious injuries per riding hour is 
estimated to be higher for horseback riders than for motorcyclists or 
automobile racers." 
</P>
<P>
Swinging at a ghost: Philadelphia Phillie outfielder Lenny Dykstra recently 
told a reporter how it feels to be competing against Willie McGee for the 
National League batting championship, now that McGee has been traded to the 
Oakland Athletics, leaving behind a .335 average and enough at-bats to qualify 
for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dykstra: "It's weird, dude. It's like (McGee) is hitting .335 every day 
until the end of the year. That's hard to do in September. . . . It's a tough 
league, dude."

"I said I wasn't about to move my kids around like checkers on a board, and I'm

L.A. GROUP ANNOUNCES FESTIVAL SITES

The opening ceremony for the 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival will be held at Dodger 
Stadium, the organizing committee announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, however, will be played at USC's Dedeaux Field. The Coliseum, site of 
the opening ceremony and track and field events for the 1932 and 1984 Olympic 
Games, will not be used during the July 12-21 festival, said Eli 
Primrose-Smith, president and executive director of the Los Angeles organizing 
committee. Track and field will be at UCLA's Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose-Smith said all but four venues -- canoe-kayak, rowing, water polo and 
ice hockey -- have been secured. Most of the events will be held at UCLA (eight 
sports), USC (nine) and Loyola Marymount (six). The 4,200 coaches and athletes 
competing in the Olympic-style games will be housed at the three universities. 
</P>
<P>
Gymnastics and basketball are the other major events scheduled for UCLA, both 
at Pauley Pavilion. Swimming and diving will be held at USC. Volleyball and 
boxing are scheduled for Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Other venues include the Forum, for figure skating and some boxing, Alamitos 
Bay Yacht Club in Long Beach, Balboa Park in Van Nuys (archery), El Camino 
College (soccer) and the South Bay Bowling Center in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to keep transportation to a minimum," said Jan Palchikoff, vice 
president of operations for the festival. "Athletes competing at UCLA, USC and 
Loyola Marymount will be housed right there. Other athletes should be no more 
than 10-12 miles from their venues." 
</P>
<P>
Cycling will be held at the Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
shooting will be held at Prado Dam. However, the Sports Arena, site of the '84 
boxing competition, will not be used. Unlike the '84 Olympics, during which 
several events were held in Orange County, all events for the Sports Festival 
will be held in Los Angeles County, Palchikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose-Smith said ticket information will not be available until early 
spring. JIM COLONNA

Coach Art Shell said the secret of his team's success is that players have been 
giving up personal goals for the sake of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a part of something, you have to leave your egos at the 
door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys have done that." 
</P>
<P>
He cited the tailbacks in particular. Marcus Allen and Greg Bell, both stars, 
have shared the position, meaning each gets fewer carries and fewer yards. 
"That's the greatest example right there," Shell said. "With those guys, there 
are no complaints. It's just going out and playing football and working, 
practicing. They get in games and they root each other on. There are no 
problems with them." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, coming off consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons with the Rams, has 
gained 88 yards in 23 carries this season. By contrast, he gained 417 yards in 
76 carries with the Rams through three games in 1989. Allen, the Raiders' 
all-time leading rusher with 7,404 yards, has 129 yards in 29 carries in 1990.

<P>
Although some serious saltwater fishing is going on south of the border, where 
yellowfin tuna are being caught in record numbers by the San Diego Sportfishing 
fleet, Curtis Wegener thought it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"The yellowfin are all five to eight pounds, and I caught them all summer 
long," Wegener said. "I'm tired of fishing for them. So I thought I'd get 
something new going." 
</P>
<P>
And so, Wegener, owner-operator of the Aztec out of Long Beach Sportfishing, 
traveled 90 miles due south to Cortez Bank, where his passengers hooked into 
some real tuna. 
</P>
<P>
His 21 customers fished the area alone for two days and caught 103 bluefin tuna 
before returning Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all 36 to 60 pounds," Wegener said of the bluefin. "We moved only 
once (each) day, just because we had to go catch more bait." 
</P>
<P>
Wegener, 28, said that the bluefin bite generally doesn't begin at Cortez until 
mid-October, and it lasts through early November. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it lasts into November remains to be seen. Commercial fishermen are 
already aware of the bluefin tuna -- which brings a high price here and abroad 
-- and have reportedly been netting their share at the Tanner and 60-mile 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
A legislative package that would generate an estimated $10 million for the 
financially troubled Department of Fish and Game has yet to be signed by Gov. 
Deukmejian as the Sunday deadline looms. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Bill 3158, authored by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), would set up 
a fee structure for the performance of environmental reviews by the DFG under 
the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
According to Vern Goehring, a legislative coordinator for the DFG in 
Sacramento, the bill is being attacked by developers who would have to pay for 
the services. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not gone away and not let up, apparently," Goehring said. 
</P>
<P>
The other bill, AB 2126, would increase commercial fishing fees for 1991 only 
and would also allow the DFG to increase one-day fishing license fees and other 
fine and user fees. 
</P>
<P>
The two bills are linked, so both must be approved by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"If he vetoes one bill he might as well veto both," Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
Add legislation -- Also awaiting Deukmejian's signature is a bill that would 
change the DFG's name "to more accurately reflect current missions and goals," 
according to Costa, its author. 
</P>
<P>
If AB 3159 is signed, the state agency will become the Department of Fish and 
Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Costa said the name change would have no fiscal impact because the bill 
prohibits the department from changing any insignia except as new material is 
needed, unless such replacements are provided for from funds other than the 
Fish and Game Preservation fund. 
</P>
<P>
That new material might be needed sooner than previously thought, however. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG, perhaps anticipating the bill's passage, recently introduced a retail 
catalogue offering DFG logo products and wildlife-related gift items, including 
DFG caps, mugs, wildlife cassettes and books, stamps and limited-edition 
wildlife prints. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
ALBACORE -- Fishing boats from Berkeley Marina are beginning to catch 
impressive numbers of albacore off the Northern California coast and there are 
reports of the popular tuna being caught as far south as Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
John Warbeef's Ranger 85 has had the best results so far. On one trip, fishing 
75 miles off Point Arena, his nine passengers caught 65 albacore to 40 pounds, 
with most running 25-30. He then took out another 14 passengers, who caught 93 
albacore. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the port manager at Avila Bay in Avila Beach verified 15 albacore 
totaling 290 pounds were taken Sunday by commercial fishermen 50 miles off 
Morro Bay. Ed Bolling at Paradise Sportfishing in Avila Beach said the landing 
will send a boat out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO LONG-RANGE -- Bluefin tuna of more than 100 pounds are being taken at 
Guadalupe Island off the Baja California coast, and yellowfin tuna and 
yellowtail are providing most of the action farther south at the Alijos Rocks 
and Thetis Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven passengers on the Point Loma out of San Diego caught 17 bluefin -- 10 
weighing more than 100 pounds and the largest a 229-pounder -- while on a 4 
1/2-day trip to Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
WORLD RECORDS -- California catches recently approved by the International Game 
Fish Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A nine-pound 13-ounce kelp bass (also called calico bass), caught by Peter 
Wight May 12 off the Palos Verdes Peninsula, all-tackle category. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 55-pound striped bass (landlocked), by Fred Brand Jr. Feb. 19 at O'Neill 
Forebay in Santa Nella, Calif., 12-pound line class. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 31-pound 12-ounce California halibut, by Steve Mares off Oceanside May 5 
eight-pound line class. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One-pound one-ounce brown bullheads, by James Cahoon Lindsay Jr. May 21 and 
24, 1990 (Lindsay caught two fish at the same weight), two-pound tippet class 
in fly-rod category.

SARDINES MAKE COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE FISH ARE HELPING TO PROVIDE A BIG SEASON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuna are being caught by the thousands just south of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowtail are being taken consistently in the waters off the southern Channel 
Islands, and along the coast as far north as Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Southland fishing is going strong. 
</P>
<P>
Favorable oceanic conditions have been a factor, but so has been the steady 
supply of bait. Notable among the bait fish is the long, almost-lost sardine. 
</P>
<P>
Bait tanks these days are loaded with them. 
</P>
<P>
Take a trip on one of San Diego's overnight boats. Grab a four- to six-inch 
sardine and watch it perform like an anchovy on steroids. 
</P>
<P>
It will run from the boat, almost immediately attracting hungry predators in 
the area. It will remain fresh and healthy until swallowed, although it is 
considered wise to change baits if there are no takers within a minute or so. 
</P>
<P>
An anchovy is more likely to swim in circles near the boat and be torn from the 
hook by an attacking fish or the strength of the current. Or it may falter and 
die after several seconds' swimming with a hook through its nose or gills. 
</P>
<P>
Anchovies are vital to Southland sportfishing fleets. They're ideal for such 
smaller fish as bonito, bass and barracuda, which keep the half-day operations 
in business. And they're the perfect chum, since they scale easily and remain 
close enough to the boat to keep the fish in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But for bigger game, the sardine is the better bait. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had pin-head bait (small anchovies) this time of year we'd be 
struggling," said Joe Chait, who owns and operates the Conquest, which runs out 
of San Diego's Fisherman's Landing. "We have these nice sardines, the fish love 
'em and they're accessible for us." 
</P>
<P>
The entire San Diego fleet is supplied by the Everingham Bros. Bait Co., which 
this season has kept the fleet in constant supply. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ask for something, they try and produce it," Chait says. 
</P>
<P>
And the company, with its fleet of seiners, bait carriers and airplanes, has 
been producing sardines -- especially since this has been an extremely poor 
year for anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that whenever the conditions appeal to the sardines, it doesn't 
appeal to the anchovies so much, and anchovies kind of melt away and then the 
sardines become more abundant," Roy Everingham said. "One thing about this 
year, that I haven't seen in all my (40) years in this business, is the 
abundance of these little sardines, these four- to six-inchers." 
</P>
<P>
Nor have fishermen up and down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
They're seeing these "racehorse sardines" in the surf and beyond. Many believe 
they are attracting larger fish closer to shore. 
</P>
<P>
A possible example is the 36-pound white seabass caught in the surf last month 
off Zuma Beach by North Hollywood's Jim Russo, who was fishing with a 
light-tackle rod, using a sand crab for bait. 
</P>
<P>
"People are jigging (sardines) on the pier," said Phil Campanella, owner of the 
tackle store at the end of Malibu Pier. "It's rare that we even see sardines." 
</P>
<P>
Campanella has been involved in the fishing industry for 20 years and says 
sardines this year have been unusually abundant in Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always rare to get a load of sardines to fish with," he said. "This is 
the first year we've had that." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Davis of Huntington Beach recalls the late 1930s and '40s, when 
sportfishing landings had trouble catching anchovies because sardines were 
crowding them out. 
</P>
<P>
"When the harbor had all the effluent from the canneries, and sewage that came 
into San Pedro and Long Beach harbors, the sardines came into feed on it and 
they were so thick that you couldn't get anchovies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cannery business was thriving at the time. There were 20-25 canneries in 
the San Pedro area alone and the fishery stretched from Ensenada to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Sardines were in heavy demand on all fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial catches exceeded three-quarters of a million tons annually in the 
late 1930s. Catching, canning and selling sardines couldn't have been easier. 
</P>
<P>
But things changed in the 1940s. Overfishing was believed the major cause of 
the collapse of the fishery in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Canneries struggled unsuccessfully to stay open. Most were vacated or converted 
to waterfront restaurants in the years after the collapse. The market remained, 
however, and the Pacific stock was fished into near oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Norway and Spain became the main suppliers of canned sardines. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game finally imposed a moratorium in 
1972, which was to remain in place until it was determined that there were at 
least 20,000 metric tons in the Pacific stock. 
</P>
<P>
"I've given the opinion that the whole (Pacific) stock was less than 2,000 tons 
in 1975, but you gotta remember, we don't have any good way to measure such a 
small stock," said Paul Smith of the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on sardines led to a slow recovery, in part because the Mexican 
government would not -- and still doesn't -- impose restrictions on the take of 
sardines or anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the determination was made in 1986 that there were 20,000 metric tons in 
the stock and California's commercial fleet -- operating primarily out of San 
Pedro -- was permitted 1,000 tons a year, starting January 1. 
</P>
<P>
It reached the 1,000-ton quota in July of 1986 and in April of 1987. This year, 
the fleet caught its 1,000-ton limit in the first three days of January, 
prompting commercial fishermen to pressure the state for an increased fishery. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the fall of (the fishery in the 1940s), and from what these boats 
are telling us, there's more sardines now than there ever was before," said 
Frank Iacono, 69, vice president of United Food Processors in Terminal Island 
and a consultant for the Fisherman's Co-Op, a group of purse seine fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see (the fishery) opened. There's a good market for (sardines). 
We've had a lot of inquiries from overseas. They want to know if they can buy 
sardines and we don't have any." 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1,000-ton quota has already been met, commercial fishermen are 
allowed an incidental take of up to 35% sardines, most of which is hauled in 
with mackerel catches. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had several boats that have been cited with over 50% (sardines)," Iacono 
said. "The fishermen have to make split decisions. When you bring alongside 
1,000 tons of fish or so, you better damn know real fast what the mixture is." 
</P>
<P>
Patty Wolf, a biologist with the DFG who specializes in sardine research, said 
she hasn't heard of or seen many loads of fish carrying more than 20% sardines, 
and that although the sardine stock appears on the road to recovery, the DFG 
wants to make sure it doesn't take a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
"From 1975 to 1990, they've been increasing," she said. "We think it's over 
20,000 (tons)." 
</P>
<P>
But she also said the DFG lacks the money to adequately sample the stock, and 
reopening the fishery now might be detrimental to the sardine's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to go farther north, south and offshore. . . . We need more ship 
time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Iacono acknowledged the state's money problems, but criticized the state's 
refusal to increase the quota. 
</P>
<P>
"The DFG cannot agree with us because they're not going to stick their necks 
out," he said. "But they know damned well what's out there. And I think if they 
gave us a 10,000- to 15,000-ton quota it wouldn't hurt the resource 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf's reply: "That's his opinion. It's difficult to get enough information . . 
. that allows us to know that we have the right number (of sardines in the 
stock). Our major responsibility is to rehabilitate that resource."

SEC presidents voted earlier Tuesday during a conference call to ask the school 
to join the conference, which on Aug. 1 added Arkansas. Since then, the SEC had 
been searching for a 12th member to give it an even number of schools. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina and Miami of Florida were the front-runners to become the 12th 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is a great day for South Carolina," Arthur K. Smith, the school's 
interim president, said at a news conference at Williams-Brice Stadium. "This 
afternoon, on behalf of the 10-member universities, Commissioner Roy Kramer of 
the Southeastern Conference extended an invitation of membership to the 
University of South Carolina. On behalf of the University of South Carolina . . 
. I enthusiastically accepted that invitation." 
</P>
<P>
Many supporters sported stickers saying, "Proud To Be in The SEC." The 
stadium's scoreboard posted "SEC" in big letters. 
</P>
<P>
"We now join the finest all-sports collegiate conference in the country, one 
with a proud history that began nearly 100 years ago when member teams began 
competing with one another," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina had been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference from that 
league's inception in 1953 until it withdrew June 30, 1971, becoming the only 
school to leave the ACC. South Carolina then joined the Metro Conference April 
14, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro does not include football. South Carolina wanted to become a member 
of a league that included football. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC hopes to integrate all South Carolina sports except football into the 
league by the 1991-92 season. Participation in football probably will be 
postponed a year because of scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina was founded in 1801 and is the oldest state institution in the 
United States to be continuously supported by public funds. The school has nine 
campuses across the state, with 25,613 students attending the Columbia campus.

DESIRE TO PRESENT THE UNDER-REPRESENTED POINT OF VIEW.

<TEXT>
<P>
Even when you think you've got the San Diego Repertory Theatre pegged, artistic 
director Douglas Jacobs and producing director Sam Woodhouse still have 
something up their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
"A Lovely Sunday at Creve Coeur" opens tonight on the Lyceum Stage, and you may 
think this quiet Tennessee Williams play is their attempt at playing it safe 
after last year's disastrous premier-laden season. But, actually, this quiet, 
rarely done, late work of Williams fits into a larger plan to present 
under-represented points of view at the Rep. It calls for an all-female cast 
for a story about a woman waiting for that elusive someone or something she 
believes will change her life. 
</P>
<P>
The company is presenting a wide array of voices this season: women, Latinos, 
African-Americans and gays, among others. While "A Lovely Sunday" uses all 
women, two other plays in the season use all Latino casts -- "Latins Anonymous" 
and the upcoming bilingual production of "Man of the Flesh" are part of the 
Teatro Sin Fronteras project. 
</P>
<P>
Winding up the season will be the company's African-American musical, the world 
premiere of "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," based on the story of a 
real-life black gangster who bankrolled the Harlem Renaissance. Earlier this 
year, the company presented "Burn This," a play that gave a gay character a 
major role. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days, all we were trying to do is put a play on stage and see if 
anyone would come and see it," said Woodhouse, who started the company with 
Jacobs 15 years ago. "Now there's a great deal more professional theater, and 
the environment in which we provide theater has changed. Our commitment to and 
our interest in multicultural programming has evolved over time. And I think we 
have become more interested in investigating the mysteries of existence rather 
than in expressing the hard-core realities of existence." 
</P>
<P>
For Jacobs, part of that exploration comes in the form of plays such as "A 
Lovely Sunday" and the play he will direct back to back at the Rep, 
Shakespeare's fairy-tale-like "Cymbeline," another late work that is rarely 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been intrigued by the late plays of playwrights," Jacobs said. 
"They move into these interesting new realms that anticipate where later 
playwrighting went. At the time when 'A Lovely Sunday' came out, people said 
Williams was getting old, that he didn't know what he was doing. People thought 
he was losing his powers. But it makes sense 10 to 15 years later. It was just 
a strange kind of awkwardness that comes when the playwright goes back to being 
a child, trying to make sense of the world and how the mind works. And then 
people say that this was the real interesting stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs has no apologies for the reception of last season, which he compares to 
the initial reception of "A Lovely Sunday" when it was first produced in 1979. 
He sees some of the work from last year as "some of the best work we've ever 
done." 
</P>
<P>
And he believes that time will be kinder to the season than the critics were. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider fallow periods as a time when some of the most creative work is 
happening. Some get excited, some get puzzled. I was happy with the work we did 
on 'Albanian Softshoe,' " he said, referring to Mac Wellman's abstract science 
fiction 
</P>
<P>
comedy, which turned out to be one of the more controversial offerings. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some losses in subscriptions. But there was also some 
ground-breaking work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Rep is paying the price for taking those chances. The subscription 
base, which dropped from 6,500 to 3,500 at the beginning of this year, must 
rise to 6,000 for the company to be able to pay operating costs, managing 
director Adrian Stewart said. As of this week, the subscription base had inched 
up to 3,800 and single-ticket sales are at an all time high, which suggests 
that one-time subscribers may still be patronizing the theater, but are 
sampling the season cautiously, one show at a time. The Rep is trying to reach 
out to those people who were not ready to subscribe at the beginning of the 
season, by marketing what it calls "a winter season package" for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, by the end of the fiscal year the company must raise $726,000 of 
its $2.1 million budget, which was reduced $300,000 from last year. Ninety days 
ago, Stewart said that if the company hadn't reached that goal by this time, 
the theater would be in crisis. On Monday he said the success of the Rep's 
first three shows "bought us a little time," although he wouldn't say how much. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's still of grave concern," he said. "It's a fragile situation and I'm 
very concerned about revenues. We've still got a good way to go." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, such crises are hardly news to the Rep. Even a cursory look back 
reveals periodic ones since the company was jump-started by the 25-year-old 
Woodhouse and 26-year-old Jacobs, who were former classmates fresh out of UC 
Santa Barbara and the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Jacobs and Woodhouse started the company, a writer questioned 
the Rep's high rent (which at that time was $600 a month for the Sixth Avenue 
Playhouse) and wondered if the city could support another theater when it 
already had the Old Globe, the Mission Playhouse (now defunct) and various 
college and university theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after that, in 1983, season subscriptions took a whopping 33% nose 
dive, which some blamed on an eclectic season of little-known modern plays. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it becomes clear that a new era of competition was beginning in 
local theater. In the early 1980s, the Old Globe closed after an arsonist 
destroyed the theater, then reopened as a fully professional operation; the La 
Jolla Playhouse was revived, and the Bowery Theatre, the Gaslamp Quarter 
Theatre Company and the North Coast Repertory Theatre all opened. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, the San Diego Rep had pulled itself together again and moved from the 
Sixth Avenue Playhouse to the newly built Lyceum Stage and Space in Horton 
Plaza. But just a year later, there were reports that behind the scenes of the 
company's critically acclaimed "Hard Times," things were living up to the name. 
Rapid expansion and round-the-clock activity were taking their toll. 
</P>
<P>
But 1988 brought the Rep a financial boon in the long-running "Six Women With 
Brain Death, or Expiring Minds Want to Know." Coupled with a benefit by one of 
the theater's celebrated alums, Whoopi Goldberg, and some unexpectedly generous 
contributions, the theater found itself back on track. At least until it 
launched into the ill-fated 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, you won't hear regrets from either Jacobs or Woodhouse. 
</P>
<P>
If Woodhouse made a mistake with his commission and direction of the 
disastrously received "Animal Nation" last year, he says the problem was that 
the work was rushed on stage too soon. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Animal Nation' was definitely an example of a piece of art that needed more 
time before it was exposed to the demands of a subscription audience and San 
Diego critics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company is continuing to develop new work, which it will integrate in the 
1991 and '92 seasons, Woodhouse said. The only difference is that the company 
will give the work more time to mature in development programs such as 
WordWorks, a 2-year-old staged reading program. A workshop series may also be 
in the works somewhere down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and Woodhouse are hard to predict, idealistic and feisty. Clearly, even 
in the face of financial pressures, they will not stop trying to be different. 
And even after 15 years it appears they intend to ride out the challenges -- 
both the ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are parts of theater that are repetitive. There is a lot of drudgery," 
Jacobs said. "You open a show and close a show and you always wish you had more 
time for rehearsal. But when you can get into a rehearsal hall with a great 
play and a talented group of actors, you never know what's going to happen. And 
that's why you do the rest of it."

OUTDOOR CONCERT PROMOTER HOPES 3RD TIME IS A CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past three years, there have been two unsuccessful attempts at staging a 
major outdoor concert series in North County. Promoter Rick Tupper is hoping 
the third time will be the charm. He has announced tentative plans for a 
10-show series next summer at Palomar College in San Marcos, in a natural 
amphitheater behind the school, with room for 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 14 Palomar Music Festival is something of a trial run. Tupper is 
producing it with campus radio station KKSM-FM (98.9, cable only) and the 
Associated Student Government. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, to start at noon and end shortly before sundown, will feature 
performances by Jimmy Cliff, the Untouchables, Psychefunkapus, local reggae 
band the Cardiff Reefers, and two other acts to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on how well the show does," Tupper said, "the idea is to do an 
entire series next summer, with as many as 10 shows." 
</P>
<P>
Good luck. Two previous attempts at producing an outdoor concert series in 
North County, both at the Sammis Pavilion in Carlsbad, were dismal failures. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, promoter Bill Silva had big plans for the 7,000-capacity amphitheater: 
a dozen concerts, if not more, by summer's end. As it turned out, only two 
shows, by Bob Dylan and Basia, were actually held before Carlsbad city 
officials yanked his conditional-use permit due to insurmountable traffic and 
security problems. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, the owner of the Batiquitos Lagoon Educational Park, in which 
the pavilion is located, decided to give it another shot on his own, only to 
give up a few weeks before the series was scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
Tupper, however, is confident he will succeed where others have failed. The 
Palomar amphitheater is on a college campus, with much easier access, and a lot 
more parking than Sammis Pavilion, which is smack-dab in the middle of a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, San Marcos is one of the fastest-growing areas in the county," Tupper 
said. "And there's a real need for somewhere to go, something to do, for 
entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Tupper is no stranger to the Palomar College facility. In the early 1980s, he 
produced several concerts there until the welcome mat was withdrawn in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, a different set of trustees came in, and they had a whole 
changeover of school officials, who didn't want to have concerts," Tupper said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, largely due to the efforts of the campus radio station and the 
student government, they have decided they want to put the area in back of the 
school to good use, once again." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s and most of the '80s, singer-songwriter Rob Lamothe fronted a 
succession of San Diego hard-rock bands that played school dances and parties 
and occasionally ventured into the studio to cut some demos. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing ever became of those demos, however, and in 1986 Lamothe, like so many 
other frustrated San Diego musicians before him, decided to try his luck in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it took awhile, but Lamothe has finally arrived, as they say. He's the 
lead singer of the Riverdogs, a hot new L.A. rock band that also features 
Vivian Campbell, formerly with heavy-metal giants Dio and Whitesnake, on lead 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverdogs' debut album was released by Epic Records last June. Sales have 
been quite good for a first album, and the reviews have been great. With good 
reason: The band's bluesy rock 'n' roll packs a real punch, the musicianship is 
top-notch, and the 10 songs, all either written or co-written by Lamothe, have 
a lot more passion, substance and lyrical integrity than the typical hard-rock 
ear-splitter. 
</P>
<P>
One interesting aside: In a recent interview with national metal-mag Screamer, 
Lamothe talks about his local rock 'n' roll roots. "In 1979, I went to high 
school with Warren DeMartini and Robbin Crosby (currently with Ratt), and 
played with them in different bands." 
</P>
<P>
The poor lad's memory must be failing, or else he's trying to hide his real 
age. In the fall of 1972, Lamothe and I both began our freshman year at 
University of San Diego High School in Linda Vista (we were enrolled in the 
same honors math class). I graduated in 1976, and I would assume he did, too. 
</P>
<P>

SOVIET MILITARY SPENDING DROPS FOR 1ST TIME UNDER GORBACHEV

<P>
Soviet military spending fell last year for the first time since President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, reflecting the impact of a domestic 
economic crisis and "new thinking" in the Kremlin, the Pentagon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department also said in its annual assessment of Soviet military 
strength that Moscow slowed the pace of arms production last year, particularly 
of tanks, artillery pieces and other equipment for its ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the ninth in a series started by then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. 
Weinberger, departed from previous editions by striking an encouraging tone in 
describing the security threat to the West posed by the Soviet military. 
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of a conflict stemming from U.S.-Soviet confrontation is lower 
than it has ever been in the postwar era," the report said, noting the historic 
changes of the last year, including the breakup of the Soviet empire in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Soviet defense spending last year fell by 4% to 5% from the 
1988 level. Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, said that in the period from 
1985, when Gorbachev assumed power as general secretary of the Soviet Communist 
Party, to 1988, Soviet military spending rose by an annual average of 3%. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense spending since 1985 has declined by an annual average of about 2% 
and is headed for a bigger drop as a resulf of current negotiations between the 
White House and Congress over the 1991 budget year, which starts next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon report said the most pronounced reductions in Soviet arms 
production in 1989 came in ground forces materiel. The Soviet Union built about 
1,700 tanks last year, half the previous year's total. Production of artillery 
pieces fell by nearly 20% and multiple-rocket launchers dropped to 300 from 
480. 
</P>
<P>
In his introduction to the report, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney stressed that 
while Gorbachev was reducing arms production in most areas, he was maintaining 
Soviet strength in strategic, or long-range, nuclear forces.

FOLGER LIBRARY GIVES TEACHERS A CUE ON HOW TO GET HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN ON 
THE ACT.

<P>
If their kids could see them now: a score of high school teachers of English 
slashing at each other with long dowel sticks on the lawn of the usually sedate 
Folger Shakespeare Library. 
</P>
<P>
"When do we get to die?" calls out one awkward battler in retreat. A teacher, 
looking forlorn, carries her broken stick to the fencing instructor, Michael 
Tolaydo, the artistic director of the Maryland Shakespeare Festival. "Teacher," 
she says in mock lament, "I broke my sword." He smiles and hands her a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Tolaydo then shows the teachers how to rain blows on each other with their 
fists, how to simulate pain and might. "With kids," he goes on, "you give them 
a whole bunch of match sticks. When they get hit, yurrrrup." He fakes spitting 
out match sticks like broken teeth. "They love it." 
</P>
<P>
The recent shenanigans at the Folger -- the world's most extensive and hallowed 
depository of books by and about William Shakespeare -- were far from a lark. 
The teachers were slashing and smashing at each other as part of a Folger 
program offering new techniques in teaching Shakespeare. These antics reflect 
the power of two American phenomena: the persistent fascination with 
Shakespeare throughout American history and the recent revolution in the way 
many American teachers now teach his plays. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare, in fact, is probably more popular in the United States than in his 
native England. "In America, almost every high school student has read one or 
two plays by Shakespeare," said Tony Hill, director of education for Britain's 
famed Royal Shakespeare Company. "That is not true in Britain." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the works of Shakespeare are too often treated in American schools as 
a forbidding text that can only be deciphered with eye-squinting footnotes, as 
a dreaded store of formidable and boring exercises to memorize. 
</P>
<P>
To free Shakespeare, the Folger Library's staff and many educators have been 
campaigning to move him from the textbook to a makeshift stage in every 
classroom, to encourage children to understand Shakespeare by acting him out. 
For seven years, the library has invited small groups of high school teachers 
for summer courses in new techniques of presenting plays to pupils. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best way to learn Shakespeare is for kids to get up and do it," 
Peggy O'Brien, the director of the Folger's education department, told the 
teachers. "So we get goofy things like seventh-grade kids dressed in bedsheets 
and Nikes acting as Romans. But it's great. It's his words in their mouths." 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare has long been popular in America. He was first venerated by the 
Establishment as the preeminent poet in the English language. Thomas Jefferson, 
outlining the proper education for young lawyers in the 18th Century, urged 
them to study Shakespeare night and day. He and John Adams visited 
Shakespeare's birthplace in 1786 and chipped a piece off one of his chairs for 
a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
Under the influence of Shakespeare admirer Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Clay 
Folger, president and chairman of Standard Oil, assembled the world's largest 
collection of rare editions of Shakespeare's works and then built the Folger 
Library for them, a marble building that fits easily into the assembly of 
houses of government on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In its educational program this year, mostly funded by a $200,000 grant from 
the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Folger Library combined its 
resources with those of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company for the first time. 
As a result, 15 British high school teachers joined 25 American high school 
teachers in the month of studies at Stratford-on-Avon in England and at the 
Folger Library in Washington. The teachers studied acting techniques, 
curriculum development and text analysis and watched performances by the Royal 
Shakespeare Company. 
</P>
<P>
But the teachers probably gained the greatest insight into teaching Shakespeare 
by acting out the plays. Susan Carol Ledford of Flathead High School in 
Kalispell, Mont., who had taken the part of Lord Capulet in a makeshift 
performance of "Romeo and Juliet," said: "When I see a play of Shakespeare now, 
I see it in a whole new way." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who started out as a high school teacher of English two decades ago 
and joined the Folger staff in 1981, believes Ledford's pupils will see it in a 
whole new way as well. "There's an affinity between Shakespeare and kids," she 
said, because children can relate to his language when spoken aloud. "Kids can 
memorize rap in 10 minutes," she said. "The key for the kids to make the 
connection with Shakespeare is to put his words in their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers have been acting out Shakespeare for years," O'Brien added. "I didn't 
invent the idea. Shakespeare did."

D.C. MAYOR HOPEFUL WINS VOTES BY PUSHING REFORMS

In a race increasingly centered on this city's crime problem, Democratic 
mayoral candidate Sharon Pratt Dixon is holding fast to the "clean house" 
philosophy that led to her surprise primary victory earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is using the same message she used to defeat three members of the City 
Council and the District of Columbia delegate to Congress in the Democratic 
primary campaign: charging that her Republican opponent -- the district's 
former police chief -- is "part of the problems" the city faces. During the 
primary, the 46-year-old district native urged voters to kick out the present 
city Democratic Administration. 
</P>
<P>
SOFT ON CRIME?: Days after her upset win, Dixon's opponent, Republican Maurice 
T. Turner, charged her with being "soft on crime," and the issue has driven the 
campaign since. Dixon's response has been to continue capitalizing on the 
negative emotions lingering after a tumultuous summer highlighted by Mayor 
Marion Barry's trial on cocaine possession charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Her theme has struck a responsive chord; she's an outsider and people like 
that," said Russell Owens, director of national policy at the Joint Center for 
Political and Economic Studies, a black-oriented think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is not a newcomer to the city's rough-and-tumble political scene, though. 
"She's not a political novice, she's just not been involved in the Barry 
Administration or the City Council," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Democratic primary generally wins the mayor's race in this 
city, where significantly more than two-thirds of the voters are Democrats. But 
Turner, who became a Republican just a few months ago, is well-respected and 
could prove to be a viable opponent, said the joint center's research director, 
Milton Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's experience in private business drew voters to her camp, as did the fact 
that "she was the first and only one who came out and demanded that Barry step 
down and get out of the election" after his January arrest at the Vista Hotel, 
city public affairs specialist Michael Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Washington milieu "goes way beyond an anti-Marion Barry sentiment," 
said Stephen Raiche, chairman of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for Ward 
3E, a mixed-race area that Dixon captured. "She tapped a very strong anti-D.C. 
government sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also offers voters a varied and diverse background. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very aggressive and very determined," said Dixon's aunt, Aimee Pratt, 
who helped raise Dixon and her sister after their mother died when Dixon was 4. 
"Instead of jumping rope when she was young, she'd play '20 Questions.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dixon graduated with honors from Howard University's law school and went to 
work at the practice of her father, now-retired Superior Court Judge Carlisle 
E. Pratt. Later she became the first black woman to be named a vice president 
at Potomac Electrical Power Co., where she worked for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL BACKGROUND: Her political education blossomed with former husband 
Arrington Dixon, a past district council chairman. She was vice chairwoman of 
the D.C. Law Revision Commission, which transferred the local criminal code 
from Congress to the city, and served on the Democratic National Committee for 
a dozen years, part of that time as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's daughter, Aimee, 21, accompanies her on campaign appearances and her 
son, Drew, 19, helps in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
If she is elected, Dixon says, she will cut the city payroll by 2,000 jobs to 
help reduce the city's runaway budget deficit. She also has proposed a capital 
growth fund to help minority businesses get established.

POPE SETS STANDARDS FOR CATHOLIC COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
VATICAN: ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND AUTONOMY ARE GUARANTEED. FIDELITY TO CHURCH 
TEACHING IS DEMANDED.

<P>
Yielding to American pressure, Pope John Paul II on Tuesday proclaimed new 
international standards for Roman Catholic colleges and universities, standards 
that demand fidelity to church teaching but guarantee academic freedom and 
institutional autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
The apostolic constitution for the world's 935 Catholic institutions of higher 
learning, published Tuesday after more than a decade of internal debate, 
acknowledges the concerns of American Catholic educators chary of tight Vatican 
rein. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no surprises," Sister Alice Gallin, executive director of the Assn. 
of Catholic Colleges and Universities, said by phone from New York. "We were 
not anxiously looking for any document, but if there had to be one, this is as 
good as we could get." 
</P>
<P>
She said that observance of the new norms will call for little change in the 
present operation of Catholic universities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-word constitution affirms that a Catholic university owes 
"institutional fidelity" to the church, including "recognition of and adherence 
to the teaching authority of the church in matters of faith and morals." 
</P>
<P>
Reasserting longstanding insistence that Catholic theologians adhere to church 
teachings, the document tells local bishops to "watch over the preservation and 
strengthening of the Catholic character" of the universities. Where local 
conditions allow, at least half the faculty of Catholic universities should be 
Catholics, it says. 
</P>
<P>
"All Catholic teachers are to be faithful to, and all other teachers are to 
respect, Catholic doctrine and morals in their research and teaching," it says, 
but it adds that this should not limit academic freedom or the essential role 
of the university as a place of dialogue between faith and reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Freedom in research and teaching is recognized according to the principles and 
methods of each individual discipline, so long as the rights of the individual 
and of the community are preserved within the confines of the truth and the 
common good," it says. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing the sensitivity of scientific research, the constitution says that 
scientific advances should be aimed at "the authentic good of individuals and 
of human society as a whole." The Vatican forbids research into techniques of 
artificial procreation, including in- vitro fertilization, in Catholic 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The church has operated universities for nine centuries, but Tuesday's document 
is the first constitution for Catholic higher education around the world -- a 
"magna carta," John Paul called it. It becomes law at all Catholic institutions 
of higher learning with the start of the 1991 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
"The constitution insists on the Catholic identity of the universities but 
emphasizes that the adjective Catholic does not diminish the 
academic-scientific character and the specific aims of the university," said 
Archbishop Pio Laghi, sub-prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education, 
in presenting the document to reporters here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Early drafts of the constitution alarmed Catholic educators in the United 
States, where there are 235 Catholic colleges and universities with more than 
half a million students. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Sister Gallin said, the presidents of 110 American Catholic colleges 
warned that Vatican proposals for tighter control, including juridical 
direction by local bishops, would decimate the world's largest network of 
Catholic institutions of higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Catholic educators from around the world expressed their 
reservations about early drafts and suggested changes that broadened the norms. 
The liberalizing proposals were largely incorporated into the constitution that 
was published Tuesday, Gallin said.

JAPAN'S KAIFU TO VISIT MIDEAST FOR TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: THE NATION IS STILL DEBATING A RESPONSE TO DEMANDS THAT IT SEND FORCES 
TO THE GULF.

<P>
In an apparent effort to salvage Japan's tarnished image as a global power 
after its much-delayed response to the Persian Gulf crisis, Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu will visit the Middle East early next month for talks with 
leaders of the front-line gulf states, the Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Kaifu will be resurrecting an itinerary that was canceled -- in 
keeping with Japan's traditional low-posture foreign policy -- after Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
After attending the United Nations-sponsored world summit conference on 
children in New York, Kaifu will leave Oct. 1 for a seven-day tour of Egypt, 
Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Japanese bureaucrats and political leaders were locked 
in a protracted, mostly closed-door debate over how Japan should answer 
international demands that it take part in the peacekeeping effort with 
manpower as well as money. 
</P>
<P>
It was not made clear whether an agreement would be reached on a plan of action 
before Kaifu leaves Friday for New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Kaifu administration procrastinated for weeks before pledging $4 billion 
for the international response to Iraq's aggression -- $2 billion as aid to 
gulf states hurt by the economic sanctions against Iraq and $2 billion to help 
support the U.S.-led military deployment in the region. 
</P>
<P>
But the government has ruled out sending uniformed military personnel, saying 
that the Japanese constitution forbids it to send the so-called Self-Defense 
Forces overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion now centers on a proposal to create a "U.N. Peace Cooperation Team" 
by drafting a new law that would allow sending a corps of 1,000 or more people 
to join U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping efforts in foreign trouble spots. The team 
would apparently include some Self-Defense Forces personnel, but it would be 
unarmed and non-military in function, according to the consensus in official 
thinking, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if agreement is reached soon, a special session of Parliament would have 
to be called to act on it, and support from opposition parties will have to be 
solicited because Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority in the 
upper house. 
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party, announced only 
recently that it would accept the existence of the Self-Defense Forces within 
Japan, but emphasized its opposition to sending them abroad in any capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The centrist Komeito, or Clean Government Party, is the likely swing vote in 
the upper house, but it is Buddhist-backed and pacifist. 
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Watanabe acknowledged that, at the earliest, it would be "a 
matter of months" before a new law could go into effect and a Japanese 
government peacekeeping team could be mobilized, raising serious doubts as to 
whether it would play even a symbolic role in the current Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has never faced this kind of choice before," Watanabe said, "and for the 
Japanese government to reach a decision to create an organization that can cope 
with this kind of situation, a matter of months is a very short time. You need 
to put yourselves in the shoes of the Japanese people to appreciate how quickly 
we are moving along." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a previously announced plan to send 100 non-government medical 
volunteers to the gulf is getting off to a slow start. An advance team of 17 
has been sent and will report back before further steps are taken.

AIR EMBARGO SEEN AS LARGELY SYMBOLIC; 
</P>
<P>
BOYCOTT: VERY FEW GOODS HAVE ENTERED IRAQ BY PLANE, AND THE NATION HAS NO 
ABILITY TO RESUPPLY ITSELF THIS WAY.

The United Nations' declaration of an air embargo against Iraq is a major 
symbolic move to tighten the international economic boycott of Saddam Hussein's 
government, but it is unlikely to significantly tighten the noose drawn by the 
land and sea embargo, U.S. experts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Very few goods have been entering Iraq by air and, even in the absence of an 
embargo, Iraq had no ability to resupply itself by airplane, according to U.S. 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic may have been helpful to Iraq on "specialized items" over the last 
several weeks but "won't replace food" that normally would have entered the 
country by either ship or truck, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was able to keep West Berlin alive through an airlift in 
1961, analysts noted, but Iraq's population of 17.5 million is far larger than 
Berlin's was at the time, and Iraq does not possess the sort of vast fleet of 
airplanes that the United States used in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, officials say, even with the embargo, a pilot who is 
determined to fly cargo into Baghdad will be able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"There are complications in an air embargo that you don't have in a sea 
blockade," said one senior Administration official. "You shoot the rudder or 
propeller off a ship, and it doesn't sink. You can't disable an aircraft that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have absolutely no intention of shooting down 
commercial aircraft, the official said, adding: "You have to have voluntary 
compliance." 
</P>
<P>
The main step in voluntary compliance will be for nations that border Iraq to 
close their airspace to Baghdad-bound flights and for ground controllers in 
world airports to refuse to allow airplanes to take off if they are trying to 
carry goods to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Those measures will suffice to cut off the vast bulk of commercial air traffic, 
because pilots and owners of air fleets will not be willing to take the risk of 
flying without air and ground control. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, one senior Arab diplomat said, "if there are 10 
airplanes going in, we can definitely stop eight" because their pilots will 
choose not to take off in violation of the embargo. "The two pilots who will be 
instructed to fly anyway" will get through, he added, but "a ratio of two to 
eight, I think, is acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Any nations that choose to violate the embargo would risk world disapproval and 
potentially could find themselves the targets of a secondary embargo that is 
already under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's resolution does allow some airplanes to enter Iraq legally. Under the 
terms of the resolution, pilots flying to Iraq will be required to land 
somewhere else first and allow their airplanes to be searched. The searches 
will be designed to ensure that planes are not carrying any cargo other than 
food or medicine that has been approved by the special U.N. committee that 
considers "humanitarian" emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Airplanes carrying passengers in or out of Baghdad will also be allowed to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the embargo will not have a major practical impact, U.S. officials 
welcomed the step as another way of solidifying the international coalition 
against Iraq, believing that each time the Security Council votes another 
resolution against Iraq, the world community is shown to be more determined to 
force the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait. The declaration of the air embargo is 
the eighth resolution condemning Iraq that the Security Council has passed 
since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the Bush Administration already is laying the groundwork for 
what is likely to be the next resolution in the sequence -- a measure to 
threaten a "secondary embargo" against countries that have violated the Iraq 
trade ban in the past.

STATE DEPARTMENT FAILED AMERICANS, HOUSE MEMBERS CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
Key members of Congress strongly criticized the State Department on Tuesday for 
failing to take adequate precautionary measures to protect American citizens 
now trapped in Kuwait or held hostage in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
At a joint hearing before two House panels, Elizabeth Tamposi, assistant 
secretary of state for consular affairs, was pressed to explain why the State 
Department did not advise Americans to leave Kuwait in the days immediately 
before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't issue any warnings to Americans to get out. We didn't help them to 
get out. We did zero," said Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a pattern of misjudging one event after another over a whole 
decade with regard to Iraq," added California Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), 
who asked Tamposi why Americans were not urged to leave Kuwait when Iraqi 
troops were massing on the border and American intelligence was warning of a 
possible invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Visibly shaken by the barrage of criticism from members of the House Foreign 
Affairs subcommittees on international operations and Europe and the Middle 
East, Tamposi defended the department's response by noting that the "prevailing 
consensus" at the time was that Iraq would not invade. 
</P>
<P>
"I know our response has not been perfect. . . . But no problem was a result of 
our not trying," she told lawmakers attending the joint hearing. "My sense is 
we are miles ahead of where we were when we started to take steps to improve 
our crisis management system." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis management system, designed to help Americans caught in threatening 
situations abroad, was overhauled and greatly expanded in the wake of 
widespread criticism of the State Department's failure to warn Americans of the 
terrorist threat that existed before the bombing of Pan American Airways Flight 
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rep. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me.), joining the criticism led by Democrats 
Lantos, Smith and another Californian, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), said 
testimony by several Americans who escaped from Iraq suggested that the "system 
is still not working well." 
</P>
<P>
One of those escapees, Illinois businessman Michael P. Saba, told the 
subcommittees that he and other Americans trapped in Iraq during the early 
stages of the crisis were frustrated by the U.S. Embassy's inability "to act on 
its feet . . . in this crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
Saba said he and other Americans stranded in Iraq sought the embassy's help in 
leaving by land after Iraq closed its airport to departing foreigners in the 
wake of the invasion. But despite requests for information, the embassy was not 
able to ascertain whether Iraq's land borders with Turkey and Jordan were still 
open, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the Embassy unable or unwilling to offer more assistance, Saba said, he 
and several other Americans hired a taxi and drove to the Jordanian border Aug. 
8. Once across the border, the group found itself stranded because the U.S. 
Embassy in Amman, which was supposed to have sent a car to meet them, was never 
informed of their departure. 
</P>
<P>
Saba said he and the others eventually hitched a ride to Amman. There, U.S. 
officials said they could not assist him in arranging his return to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Saba also said the State Department task force set up to keep family members 
informed of their captive relatives' whereabouts told his wife that he was 
still in Baghdad even after she had called the State Department to tell them 
that he had reached Amman.

NASA AIMS FOR OCT. 6 LAUNCH OF SUN PROBE

NASA officials announced Tuesday that they will attempt to launch the space 
shuttle Discovery, carrying a sun-probing satellite, on Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 4:35 a.m. PDT with five astronauts who 
will send the European satellite on a five-year journey to study the sun's 
polar regions. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first spacecraft to orbit the solar poles. 
</P>
<P>
"This date is a little success-oriented and is dependent on not encountering 
any unusual problems," shuttle director Robert Crippen said. "But I think the 
shuttle team has a good chance of making the 6th." 
</P>
<P>
NASA's last shuttle flight was in April, when Discovery carried the flawed 
Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Soon afterward, the rest of the fleet, 
Columbia and Atlantis, were crippled by hydrogen leaks. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials repeatedly have said 
they are confident that Discovery's fuel lines are leak-free because of the 
shuttle's flight performance in April and the minimal amount of work performed 
in its engine compartment since then. 
</P>
<P>
NASA faces an Oct. 23 launch deadline for Discovery and the plutonium-powered 
sun probe, named for the legendary Greek adventurer Ulysses. If Discovery does 
not lift off by then, the mission will have to wait until the planets are 
properly aligned again in late 1991.

addiction and have a particularly hard time quitting smoking, according to new 
research that suggests that many people use smoking as a form of 
"self-medication" against anxiety and pain. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are considered important because of the dire health consequences 
of smoking and the difficulties of stopping. They suggest that, for some 
people, it may be unrealistic to expect to quit without first being treated for 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the best evidence yet that certain people are more 
susceptible to drug addiction than others," said Dr. Alexander H. Glassman of 
Columbia University, an author of one of two studies published today in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. "It certainly raises the question: Is 
this going to be true for other drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
The reasons behind what Glassman called this "chronic and pernicious 
interrelationship" are not yet clear. 
</P>
<P>
Because nicotine is a stimulant, researchers suspect that some smokers use it 
to fend off the anxiety and discontent that characterize depression. Over time, 
those feelings may come to trigger cravings for nicotine because it has 
alleviated them in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the anxiety that accompanies nicotine withdrawal may be more severe 
among depressed ex-smokers and more likely to drive them back to cigarettes. 
Researchers say some depression-prone people have been driven back into 
depression by an attempt to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible explanation is that some factors, such as low self-esteem, may 
predispose people to both depression and smoking. Or, there may be a genetic 
factor that can lead to both depression and smoking, some researchers suggest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a lot of people who stop (smoking) easily and look down on 
the person who can't, as though they are a weaker kind of human being," 
Glassman said. " . . . I think (this finding) says it's something biological, 
not a moral issue." 
</P>
<P>
Glassman and others pointed out that, as social pressure to stop smoking mounts 
and those who are capable of quitting do so, the pool of persistent smokers 
will increasingly consist of people with a history of depression or vulnerable 
to depression. 
</P>
<P>
Because women, among other groups, are especially prone to depression in the 
United States, nicotine may become an increasingly female addiction, Glassman 
said. He said the balance is already shifting, and women have been less 
successful than men in quitting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two new studies, by researchers at the federal Centers for Disease 
Control, is based on data collected in a general health and nutrition survey of 
randomly selected people. The researchers explored smoking habits and 
self-reported symptoms of depression. 
</P>
<P>
They found that people whose symptoms amounted to a clinical diagnosis of 
depression were significantly more likely than others to be current smokers. 
Similarly, they were significantly less likely to have successfully quit. 
</P>
<P>
The other study is based on a mental health survey of randomly selected people. 
The researchers found that people who had experienced major depressive 
disorder, or severe depression, were twice as likely as others to be, or to 
have been, regular smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said it would be premature to prescribe anti-depressants for people 
who have difficulty quitting smoking. But Glassman said he is currently 
studying the possibility and "it really looks like it's going to work."

the project. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commissioner for Expo 92 Frederick Bush and Ambassador to Spain Joseph 
Zappala took part in a ground-breaking ceremony for the $44 million pavilion, 
which will adopt Expo's theme "The Age of Discovery."

WOODLAND HILLS' JOHN TOLOS CAN LOOK TO A LARGE COLLECTION OF SCARS TO DOCUMENT 
HIS LONG, ROWDY CAREER AS A PRO WRESTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real men have scars. And the scars of real men come complete with stories 
brimming with machismo. The stories, however, are not always true. 
</P>
<P>
A scar on a knee, for example, often will be introduced as "an old football 
injury." Truth serum, however, would reveal that it was the result of 
arthroscopic surgery after the man wrenched his leg during an awkward tumble 
from a bar stool while watching a Raider game -- which is, technically, still a 
football-related injury, but, well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A jagged scar on a hand might be explained in hushed tones as "the train 
accident." And it might be, sort of. The truth is that it was the result of the 
man's wife accidentally slamming the car door on the hand in an Amtrak parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
John Tolos, 60, has many scars. Some beauties cross the top of his forehead. 
And Tolos, a big and burly man's man if ever there was one, has one of those 
dazzling explanations as to how he received those scars. 
</P>
<P>
Seems Freddie Blassie, the great pro wrestler, used to regularly mistake Tolos' 
head for a snack. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to bite me all the time. That was his thing," Tolos said. "And man, 
does your head bleed when someone bites it." 
</P>
<P>
The difference, however, between Tolos' explanation and those of most guys' is 
that Tolos had witnesses to his scar-producing moments. Hundreds of witnesses. 
Thousands of witnesses. Once, nearly 25,000 happened to be sitting in the 
Coliseum when Blassie, right in front of everybody, began gnawing on Tolos' 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Tolos, you see, was also a pro wrestler. At 250 pounds, the heavily muscled 
Tolos was known as The Golden Greek until he retired in 1982 after a 32-year 
career in the wacky world of head butts and eye gouges. 
</P>
<P>
But lest you think Tolos spent 32 years just accumulating scar tissue, he wants 
it known right up front that for every scar he received, he put dozens on his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I never learned how to take it," Tolos said. "But I did learn to dish it out." 
</P>
<P>
His main course was a flying knee-drop from the top rope. 
</P>
<P>
"Right on their stomach. Or throat," Tolos said. "Man, some of those guys 
didn't do a lot of eating for a few days after I caught them with the 
knee-drop." 
</P>
<P>
Now, let's analyze this for a moment, from a medical standpoint. You, or 
perhaps someone you dislike, are lying on your back on a wrestling mat, 
apparently defenseless. Or really stupid. A 250-pound man climbs to the top of 
the five-foot-high turnbuckle. He then leaps off the rope, his body rising 
another several feet above the rope, and crashes down onto your throat with his 
knee, the equivalent of a 250-pound anvil being dropped from nearly the height 
of a basketball rim onto your windpipe. 
</P>
<P>
OK. That would be a minor irritant. Actually, it would kill you. Your head 
likely would roll across the ring like a bowling ball with ears. Yet pro 
wrestlers never seem to die from these attacks. So maybe, just perhaps -- and 
this is just a wild, unfounded accusation -- pro wrestling might be phon . . . 
well, let's come back to that later. 
</P>
<P>
Tolos, who has lived in Woodland Hills for more than a decade, rolled out of 
the wilds of Canada at the age of 21, having engaged mostly in hard work around 
the steel mills of Hamilton, Ontario, and hard play inside the taverns of 
Hamilton. It was during one of these many after-work encounters with fellow 
steelworkers that the idea of becoming a pro wrestler somehow occurred to him. 
</P>
<P>
He headed south, to El Paso, Tex., where his brother Chris had settled and 
begun his own pro wrestling career a few years earlier. The Tolos brothers 
became a team, the Canadian Wrecking Crew, and toured the United States and 
Canada. For months they took turns jumping on opponent's stomachs and throats, 
occasionally even doing it in unison, mostly during those rare moments when the 
referee was distracted. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers split about a year later, and, in 1952, John landed in Los 
Angeles, one of the nation's pro wrestling hotbeds. From his home base he 
traveled extensively, from San Francisco to San Diego for quick bouts, and off 
to Chicago and even New York as part of multi-bout tours. The money? Oh, it was 
awful. At first. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd fight for $25 a night sometimes," Tolos said. 
</P>
<P>
But quickly, as he began attracting fans with his menacing style and killer 
physique, the purses rose. Often, however, other purses were being clutched in 
the hands of women at ringside, who would strike Tolos with a thud on his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always more afraid of the fans than my opponents," he said. "Crazy 
people in most places. I really worried about some of them. They'd hit me with 
everything, including chairs." 
</P>
<P>
Tolos said that at the peak of his career he was earning as much as $75,000 a 
year by battering other giants into alleged submission. He was famous among 
wrestling fans, many of whom stared in wonder and amazement at The Golden 
Greek. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, a few pro wrestling fans would also stare in wonder and amazement 
at a brick. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Tolos was a legitimate star in this world of blood and sweat. The 
March, 1971, edition of Wrestling Revue, which was the world's largest 
wrestling magazine (we know this because on the cover it said The World's 
Largest Wrestling Magazine) featured Tolos and Blassie engaged in 
tooth-to-skull combat, with Freddie having put a vicious molar-lock on Tolos' 
forehead and Tolos responding by trying to drown Freddie in blood. 
</P>
<P>
A program from the Olympic Auditorium, one of the real L. A. meccas for the 
sport in the '70s, featured a picture of Tolos bellowing and the caption, 
"Maniac Tolos Screams 'I'll Get Even.' " It did not explain what Tolos wanted 
to get even about, but likely it had something to do with Freddie Blassie and 
some missing forehead skin. 
</P>
<P>
Another match at the Olympic, in 1972, pitted Tolos against Puerto Rican star 
Victor Rivera with legendary ex-boxing champion Joe Louis serving as the 
referee. 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK. But why, you might be wondering, did Freddie Blassie keep biting him? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it might have something to do with one of their early matches, when Tolos 
angered Blassie a bit by lobbing a 15-foot-long, very-alive python onto his 
head. That, as you know, is no way to make friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He went nuts," Tolos said. "Screaming and trying to get this snake off his 
neck. Just went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Now, about these charges you occasionally hear about pro wrestling being, well, 
something that even Pete Rose wouldn't bet on. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard it for three decades," Tolos said. "I've heard the word phony a 
million times. Let me tell you something: If wrestling was phony when I was 
wrestling, if people decided before a match who was going to win, well, no one 
ever told me about it." 
</P>
<P>
As further proof, Tolos points to the scars. They are, he points out, very 
real. As is the chronic back pain, as are the creaky knees and the aching 
shoulders and elbows. Not to mention the dozens of concussions he said he 
sustained and the 20 teeth in his mouth that are made of hard plastic, teeth he 
was forced to purchase as replacements for the ones he left scattered about 
dirty wrestling arenas from Los Angeles to El Paso to New York. 
</P>
<P>
And if you would like to discuss this any further with the handsome Tolos, who 
recently turned 60 but still possesses a rock-hard body and massive arms with 
rippling muscles, he'd be glad to have a little chat with you. 
</P>
<P>
Just lie down and give him a few seconds to get onto the top rope.

SHIELDS OUTLASTS BAYNES TO WIN COMEBACK FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a boxer has not fought in nearly eight years and insists upon making a 
comeback, he looks for an opponent that closely resembles a punching bag. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Shields, once one of the premier welterweights in the world, thought he 
had found such a man in Stewart Baynes of Los Angeles. Baynes had all the 
credentials, most notably a 9-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
But Shields, whose last previous fight was in 1983, had forgotten what such a 
long retirement does to a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night at the Country Club in Reseda in his first comeback bout, 
Shields, of North Hollywood, won a unanimous 10-round decision over Baynes. But 
he was stretched to the limit in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly knocking Baynes out in the second round with blistering, jarring 
combinations, Shields took a beating in the fourth round of the junior 
middleweight bout as Baynes hammered him for three minutes. Shields sagged 
against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
But Shields, who fought the best welterweights in the world on fairly even 
terms during the 1970s and early 1980s, showed his toughness by regaining 
control of the bout in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
The judges had Shields winning by scores of 97-93, 98-92 and 99-90. 
</P>
<P>
Shields is 42-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the co-main event, former North American Boxing Federation heavyweight 
champion Orlin Norris was knocked down in the fifth round by journeyman Greg 
Gorrell before he stopped Gorrell in the eighth round of the scheduled 10-round 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
Gorrell, who has fought mostly as a light heavyweight and a cruiserweight, 
weighed a flabby 197 pounds. Norris, ranked 13th by the World Boxing Council, 
weighed 221. 
</P>
<P>
After being pounded for four rounds, Gorrell shocked Norris with a heavy right 
hand late in the fifth round and Norris crumpled to the mat. He was up quickly, 
however, and in the eighth he battered Gorrell from the opening bell. Referee 
Lou Fillipo stopped the fight just 36 seconds into the round. 
</P>
<P>
Norris, of Campo, Calif., is 24-2 with 11 knockouts. Gorrell, of Wichita, Kan., 
is 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier bout, Joey DeGrandis, a two-time Golden Gloves champion from 
Boston who fights out of the Ten Goose Gym in Van Nuys, pounded out an easy, 
unanimous decision over Fred Thomas of Los Angeles in a four-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
DeGrandis, 166, unleashed a relentless body attack to pile up points and hurt 
Thomas, 165, inthe third and fourth rounds. DeGrandis is 3-1. Thomas fell to 
3-3.

HOW JOHNSON STARTED THE BALL ROLLING; 
</P>
<P>
BOWLING: PANORAMA CITY WOMAN RECEIVED EARLY BOOST IN HER DEVELOPMENT INTO TOP 
PROFESSIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITTORIO TAFUR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of putting a bowling ball in a 2-year-old's hands to keep her out of 
trouble does not appear to be strikingly brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Johnson, manager of a bowling center in Hayward, used to bring his 
2-year-old daughter Letitia to work every once in a while. For someone with 
Letitia's youthful energy, a bowling center must have seemed like a cavernous 
romper room, and Roy needed a plan to keep his toddler busy. A big, heavy plan 
that would be difficult to carry, if not carry out. 
</P>
<P>
"He put a bowling ball in my hands," Tish Johnson, now 27 and a resident of 
Panorama City, recalled. "He figured I would be all right if I had something to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The first couple of times down the lane, the five-pound ball did the bowling. 
When her toes weren't being banged up, Johnson was sent reeling toward the 
pins. Tiddlywinks, this was not. 
</P>
<P>
And thank goodness for that, because one usually does not make $90,000 a year 
playing tiddlywinks. 
</P>
<P>
In her 10th year on the Ladies Professional Bowlers Tour, Johnson has hit pay 
dirt. Last season, she made $90,000, good enough for third place on the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
This year she has won $47,420 and last week claimed the AMF Cobra Tournament 
title at Chesapeake, Va., rolling strikes in 10 of 12 frames in the 
championship match against Aleta Sill. She banked $20,000 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The first five years I was out on the tour, the money wasn't that good," said 
Johnson, who took in $128,130 in her first eight years. "It's still not as good 
as the men make, but it is getting there." 
</P>
<P>
Even though her first experience with bowling was not without pain, Johnson 
loved it and found a hobby for life. Or so she thought. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson turned down three bowling scholarships to play basketball at the 
College of the Redwoods in Eureka. For most people, bowling means recreational 
leagues, an occasional family outing or get-togethers with friends. Johnson 
figured it would be that way too, despite the efforts of the University of 
Wyoming, Wichita State and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always loved bowling," said Johnson, voted Southern California woman 
bowler of the year in 1985 and 1986 and co-bowler of the year in 1989 by 
Southland sportswriters. "When basketball was my life in college, I still 
bowled after basketball practice. I have been doing it since I was 2 and I 
don't think I will ever stop." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson started making a living in bowling after a serious knee injury ended 
her basketball career in 1980 at Redwoods. She suffered torn cartilage and 
ligaments in her right knee, and doctors were not sure if she would ever walk 
properly again, let alone play basketball. After five operations and 
rehabilitation, it became clear that bowling would be her best option. 
</P>
<P>
"Bowling never gets boring," said Johnson, who averaged 228 last year. "I learn 
something every time I pick up the ball. If I didn't learn something, there is 
no point doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in her career, Johnson said she planned to bowl until she was 50 or 60 
years old. Now she hopes to bowl professionally until she is at least 40. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see there being a point where I want to do anything else," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Which is what Roy Johnson had in mind 25 years ago.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MATSUSHITA'S VISION GOES BEYOND HORIZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan, one of the world's largest 
consumer electronics firms, interested in acquiring MCA Inc., the giant U.S. 
entertainment company? 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the answer is easy. Matsushita, with $44 billion in annual 
sales, wants films and TV shows it can sell along with televisions and VCRs in 
all parts of the globe and songs to go with its stereo and compact disc 
players. 
</P>
<P>
And if it pays up to $7.5 billion for MCA, Matsushita will get films and songs 
in abundance. MCA, with $3.5 billion in sales, owns Universal Studios ("Back to 
the Future," "Field of Dreams," "Jaws," "E.T." and many more), plus an enormous 
library of television programs that includes "Murder She Wrote" and "Miami 
Vice," plus one of the largest record companies in the world, plus the 
Universal Studios Tour theme parks. In a single purchase, Matsushita would buy 
a worldwide distribution system for films and records, an incomparable value. 
</P>
<P>
But Matsushita's reasons go beyond the short term. It is looking at the 
development of home entertainment technology -- at high-definition television 
and, later, more complex, computer-like instruments. There's vision in 
Matsushita's moves. 
</P>
<P>
The deal isn't signed yet, and merger talks involving MCA have fallen through 
in the past. Still, something is afoot. So we should understand what the deeper 
implications are. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days you may hear a lot of noise about Japan buying up U.S. 
movie studios. But chances are the noise will miss the underlying issue, which 
is vision in Japanese business and lack of vision in American business. 
</P>
<P>
So why does Matsushita want to own MCA's films and shows? That's essentially 
the same question that was asked a year ago when Sony bought Columbia Pictures. 
And the answer is that humble products change and develop -- the phonograph 
becomes the stereo and then becomes the compact disc player. The mundane TV set 
is becoming high-definition television and nowhere more prominently than at 
Matsushita, which employs HDTV's inventor, Takashi Fujio. 
</P>
<P>
Owning the programing is important because it gives you something to show on 
the advanced TV set and also persuades producers to film for your new 
technology. "If you get the technology going, producers will begin shooting 
HDTV because they think of the rerun market, of the future value of their 
product," says a senior television executive. 
</P>
<P>
The vision used to be American. When Radio Corp. of America originated radio, 
it also created the National Broadcasting Co. to have something to broadcast; 
when the same RCA developed color television, it pushed programmers to film in 
color. But, sadly, RCA lost its vision, declined and ultimately sold out to 
General Electric, which unloaded its TV-making business. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita's vision looks beyond tomorrow's marketplace to what its annual 
report calls "emerging new products in audio-visual technology, including 
liquid crystal and digital TV. "Our long-range plans encompass 
computer-controlled audio visual and home automation systems. We will 
revitalize the home electronics market." 
</P>
<P>
What do reruns of "Jaws" have to do with computers? Plenty, says Paul Saffo, 
research fellow of the Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park, Calif., research 
firm. "Entertainment programing is better at getting computer-like machines 
into the home than more technical software," says Saffo. "Just look at Nintendo 
and its game systems." 
</P>
<P>
With MCA, of course, Matsushita would buy great libraries of entertainment 
software. But the MCA deal would be only one part of the mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Matsushita made another, much smaller deal. It agreed to 
invest in Owl International, a Bellevue, Wash., software company that makes a 
"hypermedia engine." That's an electronic equivalent of a library card 
catalogue, allowing you to pick programing through your TV set-computer. So you 
might come home some future night, flick on a screen in your wall and choose to 
view the Battle of Hastings or the life of a Chinese empress. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it's a long leap from Matsushita's negotiation with MCA to the coming 
of walk-in television. But nobody doubts that information technology will 
develop massively in this decade, that computers and communications will come 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Matsushita understands that. In an interview in Osaka two years ago, 
Masayuki Nakajima, director of engineering at Matsushita's Central Research 
Laboratory, summed up the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest inventions of the 20th Century are the semiconductor and the 
laser," he said. "The semiconductor has brought progress in the field of 
computers and the laser has contributed directly to communications. We are 
devoted to progress in both." 
</P>
<P>
Now, lots of U.S. companies think like Matsushita; the U.S. electronics and 
computer industry sees the trend of technology. But are U.S. companies acting 
on their vision as Matsushita is? If the TV set and the TV show make a good 
combination in consumer electronics, why does NBC no longer have the TV sets? 
Why is MCA for sale and not Matsushita?

ON THIS DEAL, THE FEE MAY BE ONLY THE ICING FOR OVITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Japanese come calling on Hollywood, talent agent Michael Ovitz, 
chairman of Creative Artists Agency, often serves as their advance man. 
</P>
<P>
He smoothed the way for Sony Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment last year, and he is playing a similar role in talks between the 
giant Matsushita Electric and MCA. The difference this time, however, is that 
Ovitz may walk away with more than a consulting fee. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation is rife that Ovitz will be tapped to run MCA if the sale goes 
through. People close to the discussions say Ovitz may eventually replace aging 
MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman under the deal, thereby satisfying a long-held 
desire to head an entertainment conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the problem with Mike. . . . Big hat, no cattle," said one top Los 
Angeles investor, referring to Ovitz's big ambitions but relative lack of 
funding to play the takeover game. In Matsushita, a $38-billion-a-year giant, 
he may have found cash to play at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say Ovitz probably wouldn't move into a management spot at MCA 
for a year or even more. With the prospect of running MCA, however, Ovitz could 
face the most daunting management task of his career: Leaving behind a viable 
agency that revolutionized the way deals are made in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz, who would presumably be required to sell his CAA holdings under federal 
antitrust guidelines, is widely held to be the most powerful and innovative 
agent to work in Hollywood since Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
CAA built a huge "packaging" business in TV by cutting its fees, and in movies 
by organizing ensembles of big-name stars and directors. Along the way it also 
amassed a stable of clients including Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman, Robert 
Redford, Jane Fonda and director Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
CAA spokesman Stephen Rivers branded as "rumor" suggestions that Ovitz's 
relationship to the Japanese electronics giant extends further than "software 
consulting." "His role and our company's role in this situation are as agents, 
not principals," Rivers said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Ovitz leave, sources close to CAA say his departure could take a heavy 
toll. "The good news is that Ovitz is a strong, willful, dynamic manager," said 
one source close to CAA. "The bad news is that despite the best-laid plans, his 
departure will leave a gaping hole. The whole fabric of the agency would 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry say the whole fabric of the agency business would change, 
too. Ovitz personally represents about a dozen of the biggest stars and 
filmmakers in the business -- names such as Barry Levinson, Spielberg, Sydney 
Pollack, Dustin Hoffman, Redford and Bill Murray -- who might be courted by 
other agents if he departed. 
</P>
<P>
Just as importantly, CAA's talent agents could be wooed away by competitors. 
Unlike some other big competitors, CAA does not bind its agents with contracts, 
and ownership of the company is closely held by Ovitz (55%) and his co-founders 
Ron Meyer and Bill Haber (who split the remainder) rather than spread out among 
senior agents. 
</P>
<P>
Although Meyer and Haber were founding partners, it has been Ovitz who shaped 
the culture of CAA. Said one source close to CAA: "Mike is such a 
godfather-type figure there. This would be a huge, huge change. It would be 
like Disney losing Mickey Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz built CAA on a steadfast resistance to hierarchy. In recent years, for 
example, co-owners Meyer and Haber served as Ovitz's lieutenants but Ovitz -- 
as president -- was the only one to carry a title in the company. 
</P>
<P>
That has begun to change. Early this year, Meyer was made president and Ovitz 
became chairman -- a move that many insiders took as a signal that Ovitz had 
one foot out the door. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other signs of Ovitz' restlessness. In February, 1989, Sony 
hired him as a consultant when it was shopping for a Hollywood studio. When the 
Japanese electronics giant settled on Columbia Pictures six months later, Ovitz 
was offered the top job. 
</P>
<P>
Under one scenario discussed by Ovitz and Sony, Coca-Cola or its Columbia unit 
would have bought CAA and then spun the agency back to its senior agents in a 
leveraged buyout, according to sources close to the negotiations. But Ovitz and 
Sony could not agree on terms and the top posts went to producers Peter Guber 
and Jon Peters instead. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, sources close to the agency say, Ovitz appeared to be distancing 
himself from the agency, more frequently keeping his doors closed to all but 
the most senior agents. About three months ago, Ovitz took the more dramatic 
step of turning over the Wednesday morning motion picture staff meetings to 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
In Ovitz's stead, it is expected that Meyer would become the top manager. A 
popular figure inside the agency, Meyer often plays good cop to Ovitz' bad cop, 
but insiders say he is less interested in the administrative side and not 
enough of a hardball player to gain the stature that Ovitz enjoys.

MATSUSHITA TAKES A SURPRISINGLY BOLD STAB AT HOLLYWOOD 
</P>

<P>
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., whose late founder once compared business 
competition to traditional Japanese sword fighting, is carving out a new 
reputation for itself by pursuing acquisition talks with MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Long considered more conservative than better-known rival Sony Corp., 
Matsushita may now be seeking to shed that low-key image and step into the 
Hollywood limelight in a major -- and potentially risky -- way, experts said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Matsushita has great strength in manufacturing but they are not a particularly 
innovative company," said Richard Ozaroff, assistant research director for 
Value Line Investors Service, a New York securities research firm. "They have a 
lot of money but they have been very reluctant to use it for a conventional 
type of takeover. . . . Maybe that's changed; maybe they are willing to take 
more risks." 
</P>
<P>
Osaka-based Matsushita (pronounced maht-SOOSH-tah), a far larger consumer 
electronics company than Sony, has prospered by honing its manufacturing skills 
under the trade names Panasonic, Quasar, Technics and National. Matsushita, 
which also owns a 51% stake in Victor Co. of Japan (JVC), produces a variety of 
consumer staples from personal computers and microwave ovens to irons and 
electric pencil sharpeners. 
</P>
<P>
Those products have helped the company roll up profits of $1.6 billion on sales 
of $44 billion for the year ended March 31, 1990. And with about $25 billion in 
cash and marketable securities on hand, Matsushita spokesman Akira Nagano said 
Tuesday that the firm would have no trouble paying for MCA. But he said the 
talks with MCA are preliminary and among several deals under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese and U.S. analysts point out that Matsushita has had acquisition talks 
with a number of parties in recent months. And there are considerable questions 
whether an American entertainment company could mesh with Matsushita's 
conservative style. 
</P>
<P>
Nagano, however, rejected the idea that Matsushita doesn't have experience in 
the entertainment business -- the television program and movie "software" that 
would complement its audio and video equipment "hardware." 
</P>
<P>
"JVC has been in the software side for some time so we have management 
experience even though it isn't direct," Nagano said. JVC recently formed a 
motion picture joint venture with Hollywood producer Lawrence Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
He said Matsushita has recognized for some time the importance of software, 
particularly given the increasing competition in hardware. "Strengthening 
software is a key part of our strategy. Software and hardware are two wheels on 
the same shaft," Nagano said. Without both wheels, he said, the company cannot 
advance as effectively. 
</P>
<P>
He said having access to a video library like MCA's would help sell laser disc 
players and videotape recorders. 
</P>
<P>
MCA would not be the first acquisition of a well-known U.S. name by Matsushita. 
In 1974, the company purchased Motorola's Quasar color television division. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Sony -- which entered the U.S. entertainment business in 1988 when 
it purchased CBS Records for $2 billion, and which pioneered products such as 
the portable Walkman cassette player and compact disc -- Matsushita has had a 
history of letting others take the risk in developing new markets. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the best-known example, Matsushita sat back and let Sony develop the 
market for videocassette recorders, and then threw its full weight behind 
advancing the technology. And when Matsushita went after the VCR market, it did 
so with one goal in mind: to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is like sword fighting in the traditional Japanese way," the late 
Matsushita founder Konosuke Matsushita wrote in "Quest for Prosperity," his 
1988 autobiography. "It's all or nothing. In business as well, if you are to be 
successful you must always win." 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita became a thorn in Sony's side. Not only did it sacrifice short-term 
profits for a larger long-term share of the VCR market, but it did so with an 
incompatible VHS format that some analysts called technically inferior to 
Sony's Beta format. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita followed this pattern with other products -- often leaving the 
innovating to others, but just as often attaining the high-volume sales that 
made it one of the world's biggest sellers of consumer electronics. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the slogan of Matsushita's Panasonic unit -- "Just slightly ahead of 
our time" -- is viewed by some analysts as being a jab at Sony, which 
Matsushita considers too far ahead of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, however, Matsushita began to re-examine its laissez faire 
attitude toward innovation and new product development. 
</P>
<P>
It became restless with its heavy reliance on consumer electronics, which in 
1985 accounted for 60% of its sales. The company poured more money into 
research and development, with less of it going to consumer electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Helm reported from Tokyo and Shiver reported from Los Angeles. Times staff 
writer Donna K. H. Walters also contributed to this story.

The figures below illustrate the windfall that MCA executives would realize as 
a result of their stock ownership and stock option plans, based on the 
company's 1990 proxy report. All amounts estimated below are based on number of 
shares benefically owned by an individual if all scheduled stock options were 
to be exercised at $85 per share. In some cases, stock options depend on 
continued employment at the company.

North American-Made Vehicle Sales Drop: Sales of cars and trucks dropped 5.6% 
in mid-September, compared to last year, when high inventories pressed auto 
makers to offer big incentives, the companies said. A 42.3% increase in the 
sales of cars made in North America by Japanese companies was offset by a 7.5% 
decline in cars made by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. 
The Big Three held 84.4% of the car market in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 major companies making cars and trucks in the U.S. said they sold 
vehicles at an average daily rate of 35,810 during the Sept. 11-20 period this 
year, compared to a rate of 37,948 a year earlier year. Car sales were down 
2.6%, and truck sales were off 10.5%.

Argentinian Model for Training Aircraft: LTV Corp. of Dallas has chosen a 
foreign military aircraft on which to base its entry in a huge U.S. military 
procurement program. LTV is one of several competitors preparing to bid on the 
Joint Primary Aircraft Training System, the all-purpose trainer for the Air 
Force and Navy. The initial contract calls for more than 500 Air Force and 300 
Navy aircraft, with the possibility of as many as 1,000 planes in the long run. 
Instead of building its own trainer from scratch, LTV found a plane by Fabrica 
Militar de Aviones in Argentina that fits most of the specifications and can be 
altered to fit the U.S. military's needs. The military's decision will not be 
made until the beginning of 1994. Dallas Morning News

Good and Bad Crop News: Cool, wet spring weather across the United States 
delayed planting and slowed early plant growth of peas, corn and green beans, 
and resulted in smaller crops than expected. To make matters worse, the sudden 
warm weather in recent weeks has caused many crops to mature all at once rather 
than at the staggered pace planned by farmers. However, this may be good news 
for processors, because a little bit of crop shortfall raises prices and profit 
margins, and the odd weather did not cause major crop shortages. Milwaukee

Maine Takes Aim Against Waste: Maine is so serious about recycling that it has 
committed itself to recycling half its solid waste by 1994. To that end, it has 
outlawed the single-serving juice boxes that fit so neatly into lunch boxes. 
The ban on these boxes, as well as mandatory deposits on all beverage 
containers except those for dairy products, took effect at the beginning of 
this month. State officials say the boxes, which are made of plastic on paper 
on aluminum, are not recyclable at present. Boston Globe

Jet Engine Cracks Probed: Cracks inside the shafts of 12 Pratt &amp; Whitney 
PW4000 jet engines have prompted a Federal Aviation Administration 
investigation, with findings expected to be released next week. The defective 
shafts cleared inspections at Pratt in Hartford, Conn., and at Le Fiell Co., 
the San Francisco-based subcontractor that forged the shafts for Pratt, the 
Hartford Courant reported. One engine had been in service before it was 
grounded, three had been shipped for installation on jumbo passenger jets and 
the others were in various stages of assembly.

California's median home price declined for the fifth straight month in August, 
but the pace of sales rose for the first time in five months, a realty trade 
group reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Realtors said that based on the August sales rate for 
existing, single-family homes, 426,805 units would be sold in a year. 
</P>
<P>
That was 14.9% higher than the pace in August, 1989, and up 1.6% from the rate 
in July, the real estate brokers group said. 
</P>
<P>
The August median price of an existing single-family home was $193,292, down 
0.4% from $194,099 in July and off 3.1% from $199,385 a year earlier.

A shift toward smaller homes contributed to the decline in the median home 
price, the price at which half the sales were for more, half less, the trade 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Antt Jr., the president of the group, said inventories had dropped and 
sellers were pricing homes lower, contributing to the upturn in sales. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the National Assn. of Realtors reported that nationwide 
sales of existing homes rose 2.1% in August from the previous month, reflecting 
buyer strength in some regions of the country. But sales remained below 
year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
The NAR said August's annual sales rate for single-family homes was 3.4 million 
units, up from a revised 3.33 million units in July. The NAR previously 
reported a July pace of 3.4 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
The August rate, however, was 1.2% lower than in August, 1989, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Home sales in the West fell to a rate of 510,000 annually from July's 530,000 
units, while median home prices in the area rose $1,900 to $141,600 from a 
month ago, the NAR said. 
</P>
<P>
The national median price for single-family homes was $97,000 in August, down 
slightly from $98,300 in July, but up $1,200 from August 1989. 
</P>

AUGUST REGIONAL HOME SALES ACTIVITY* 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Realtors' median price and sales data for detached 
homes are based on reports from 80 boards of Realtors around the state. Median 
condominium price and sales data are based on a survey of 32 boards. Regional 
sales data is not seasonally adjusted.

*Based on closed escrow sales of single-family, detached homes only (no 
condos). Reported month-to-month changes in sales activity may overstate actual 
changes because of the small size of individual regional samples. Movements in 
sales prices should not be interpreted as measuring changes in the cost of a 
standard home. Prices are influenced by changes in cost and changes in the 
characteristics and size of homes actually sold.

NORTHROP SOLE SUPPLIER OF SENSOR, PANEL TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
HEARINGS: A MARINE COLONEL SAYS THE NAVY HAD NO CHOICE ON A $300,000 SPARE 
PARTS ORDER, EVEN THOUGH THE FIRM ADMITTED FAKING TESTS ON THEM.

The Navy has decided to partially waive a contract suspension against Northrop 
Corp. so that it can obtain critically needed electronic sensors for its AV-8B 
Harrier, which has been dogged by higher than expected failures of the part, it 
was disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by shortages of the sensor, the Pentagon has been forced to turn back 
to Northrop for an estimated $300,000 spare parts order, even though the 
company pleaded guilty last February to falsifying tests on the same sensor 
system, a Marine Corps official told the House Government Operations Committee 
Tuesday. The Marine Corps official said the Northrop part has become the most 
trouble-prone part of the aircraft and could force the grounding of as many as 
18 Harriers over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure that the Pentagon is buying the same parts from the same company 
by which it was earlier defrauded evoked harsh criticism at the congressional 
hearing, which was called to look into Northrop's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"A procurement system in which the Navy is forced to obtain parts from a 
corporate criminal is intolerable," said committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. 
(D-Mich.). "But it looks like business as usual for Northrop." 
</P>
<P>
Marine Col. James G. Hart, the Harrier program manager, said the military 
service has no choice but to go back to Northrop for the equipment because it 
is the sole supplier of the part, known as a "rate sensor assembly," which 
helps stabilize the AV-8B in flight. At present, the Marines have parked four 
of the $22-million aircraft because the sensors are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Northrop has cheated all of us, not the least of which may be that young 
Marine who needs that airplane," Hart said. "But I cannot compound that 
mistake. We have to get those jets up." 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have deployed to the Persian Gulf an estimated 60 of the two-engine 
Harriers, which can take off vertically and are used to provide close air 
support for ground troops. It is not known whether the problems with the 
Northrop sensors have caused any operational problems for Marines in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Hart testified that the Northrop sensors are failing after an average of 999 
hours, while they were supposed to operate under contractual specifications 
1,525 hours before failure. Hart described the component as a critical safety 
item on the Harrier but said the failure of a sensor is not likely to cause a 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, at least one fatality in a Harrier accident has been related to 
the troubled Northrop sensor, Hart said, but he declined to discuss details 
about the case because of military confidentiality about accidents. Northrop 
spokesman Les Daly said later in an interview that the firm has no information 
about any accidents related to a sensor failure. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hart said that if a sensor failed during combat, it would seriously 
degrade the ability of the Harrier and its pilot to defend against an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"The improprieties are a clear and present danger to our troops in the Persian 
Gulf," Conyers said in an interview after the hearing. "In a potential military 
situation, a failure could spell disaster for the ground troops that depend on 
the Harrier for coverage." 
</P>
<P>
The committee also heard testimony from two other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
One was Howard H. Hyde, former chief engineer at Northrop's Western services 
department in Pomona who was convicted in the criminal case and is now serving 
a prison sentence. Hyde, who was escorted to the hearing by federal marshals, 
testified how he and Western services General Manager Charles Gonsolves 
conspired to falsify tests on the sensors because they lacked the proper 
equipment to test the devices. 
</P>
<P>
And Ronald Deady, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, testified that he has 
long suspected that the U.S. air-launched cruise missile, which uses another 
Northrop sensor that was improperly tested, is defective and unable to meet 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Deady, now living in Lancaster and who formerly was a high-level official in 
the cruise missile program, said he became alienated from the Pentagon 
procurement system after he saw that the military itself conspired with 
contractors to allow defective weapons to pass through the system. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen enough of this process that I was disgusted," Deady said. "I 
personally could not put up any longer with seeing the taxpayer ripped off."

Paramount Pictures confirmed Tuesday that David Kirkpatrick will become the 
next co-president of its motion picture group, replacing Sidney Ganis. 
</P>
<P>
The change, which ends weeks of speculation about the future of the two 
executives, is effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis will become an independent producer with a long-term agreement at 
Paramount. In a prepared statement, Ganis -- who spent most of his career 
marketing movies -- called production "a longtime commitment of mine" and said 
Paramount is the "best home base for the kinds of films I look forward to 
making." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick, who joined Paramount from Disney in July, will report directly to 
studio Chairman Frank Mancuso. Barry London, the co-president responsible for 
marketing and distribution, will remain in his position, studio officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ganis had been president of the motion picture group, overseeing feature film 
production, since November, 1988. NINA J. EASTON

JUDGE STRIKES DOWN PROP. 73 FUNDING LIMITS 
</P>

<P>
Dramatically changing California campaign fund-raising rules six weeks before 
the Nov. 6 election, a federal judge Tuesday sided with Democrats and struck 
down the voter-approved campaign contribution limits of Proposition 73 as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
In concluding that the initiative's restrictions on campaign financing violate 
the 1st Amendment right to free expression, U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. 
Karlton also rejected a key provision banning the transfer of campaign funds 
from a candidate to another. 
</P>
<P>
Barring further court action, candidates for governor and other statewide posts 
are now free to raise unlimited amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came as a shock to candidates of both parties, who must adapt 
their campaigns to cope with the sudden change in the rules. But the ruling was 
hailed by Democratic Party Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., who helped bring the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision strikes down one of the most pernicious campaign laws ever 
enacted," the former governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Two authors of the initiative and the state Fair Political Practices Commission 
said they would go to court immediately to challenge the ruling and seek a stay 
of the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing of this decision is most unfortunate," said Assembly Republican 
Leader Ross Johnson, the primary author of Proposition 73. "There will be 
enormous confusion now as hundreds of candidates at all levels of government 
try to figure out what the new rules are." 
</P>
<P>
Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson called on his Democratic rival, 
Dianne Feinstein, to continue complying with the $1,000 campaign contribution 
limit. But Feinstein, who trails far behind Wilson in fund raising, did not 
accept the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating the fund-raising picture, the Fair Political Practices 
Commission declared that Karlton's ruling now means the fund-raising 
restrictions of a rival initiative, Proposition 68, will take effect for 
legislative races -- not statewide offices. Proposition 68 was approved by 
voters in 1988 but did not take effect because it received fewer votes than 
Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 has been under legal challenge ever since its passage. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, it prohibited candidates for state and local offices from 
accepting contributions of more than $1,000 from individuals and more than 
$5,000 from political committees during the fiscal year from July 1 to June 30. 
The limits applied only to candidates, not ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
In a direct attack on the power of Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
other legislative leaders, the measure also outlawed the longstanding 
legislative practice of transferring campaign funds among candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 was sponsored by Johnson, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) 
and former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who is serving a 6 1/2-year 
prison sentence on federal corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, the measure was drafted in an attempt to defeat Proposition 68, 
a broader measure that called for public financing of campaigns and even more 
sharply restricted campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
With Karlton's ruling, the only major provisions of Proposition 73 that remain 
intact are the ban on public financing of elections and certain restrictions on 
mass mailings sent out by elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit challenging Proposition 73 was brought by Speaker Brown of San 
Francisco, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the 
Democratic Party, the Service Employees International Union and the California 
Teachers Assn., among others. 
</P>
<P>
Karlton agreed with the argument of the Democrats and labor unions that 
limiting contributions by fiscal year is unconstitutional because it gives an 
inordinate advantage to incumbents running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"I conclude that Proposition 73, in measuring the limitation on campaign 
contributions by fiscal year rather than election, unconstitutionally restricts 
free speech and favors incumbents against challengers," Karlton said in a 
65-page opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Enacting contribution limits that correspond with the election year cycle -- 
such as the limits imposed by Proposition 68 -- would not give the same 
advantage to incumbents and would therefore not be unconstitutional, the judge 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation for challengers is entirely different than for incumbents," 
Karlton said. "Few non-incumbents will decide to run for a particular office 
years in advance of the election. Even if they do, they will have significant 
trouble in raising money early in the election." 
</P>
<P>
The ban on transfers by candidates is also unconstitutional, Karlton ruled, 
because it violates their right to freedom of expression. But the judge 
specifically noted that he was offering no opinion on the similar transfer ban 
contained in Proposition 68. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown, who has long used the ability to transfer funds to help maintain 
his power, greeted the victory with an uncharacteristically subdued response. 
</P>
<P>
"The court made the proper decision," Brown said. At the same time, the Speaker 
was warning legislators to be "circumspect" in their fund-raising efforts until 
legal questions surrounding the decision are resolved, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Sen. Wilson criticized the judge's decision, saying: "I disagree with 
the court's ruling and believe it subverts the will of Californians who voted 
overwhelmingly for campaign reforms under Proposition 73." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Dee Meyers, a spokeswoman for the Feinstein campaign, said it is only 
natural for Wilson to object, since he fares better with the contribution 
limits in place. But the Republican senator will still be able to raise more 
money regardless of what campaign rules the candidates follow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no surprise that Wilson is in favor of a measure that locks in his 
fund-raising advantage," she said. "No matter what the rules are, they are 
going to out-raise us and outspend us." 
</P>
<P>
John Larson, chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission, warned 
legislative candidates not to engage in a "fund-raising frenzy" because the 
campaign contribution limits of Proposition 68 still apply. 
</P>
<P>
But Joseph Remcho, the attorney who represented the Democrats and unions in the 
case, contended that Proposition 68 does not take effect at all since it was 
superseded by Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, Proposition 68 does not click in at all," Remcho said. "Now that 
Proposition 73 is not constitutional, Proposition 68 does not rise Phoenix-like 
from the ashes."

COUNTY OFFERS PLAN TO EASE OBSTETRICAL SYSTEM CHAOS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDI-CAL: PRIVATE HOSPITALS WOULD BE PAID DIRECTLY FOR SERVICES AS PART OF 
PROPOSAL TO EASE OVERCROWDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a novel program, Los Angeles County health officials have joined forces with 
the private sector in a plan to divert thousands of pregnant women to private 
hospitals to ease the tremendous overcrowding of the county's obstetrical 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the county has offered to cut Medi-Cal red tape for private 
hospitals and doctors by paying them directly for their services, then claiming 
reimbursement from the state under Medi-Cal guidelines. The plan also offers 
the incentives of filling empty obstetrical beds at some of the private 
hospitals, and of bringing some order to the current chaos in obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 21 private hospitals -- which collectively can provide about 300 
additional obstetrical spaces per month -- have agreed to participate. If all 
goes well, officials say the plan could be implemented within two months. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every hospital, public and private, is struggling with the problem of 
women showing up in labor in their emergency rooms without a doctor or any 
record of prenatal care. Overcrowding in the county health-care system -- from 
neighborhood health centers to the county's five hospitals with obstetrical 
services -- is largely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Things were so bad one Saturday last month at the county's Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center in Torrance that an exhausted staff obstetrician simply stopped 
admitting patients, even as they arrived at the hospital in labor. Instead, he 
handed them road maps, saying they would be better off delivering their babies 
elsewhere. Private hospitals in the area were marked on the maps. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed hospital administrators quickly declared the doctor's actions to be 
contrary to policy, and said no such diversion of patients would be attempted 
again, no matter how busy things were in the obstetrical unit. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Charles Brinkman, Harbor-UCLA's chief of obstetrics, will not guarantee 
that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a judgment about whether the conditions are safe," he said. "We are 
running at 130% above our designed capacity. We are staffed for 17 deliveries a 
day and are routinely hitting 25 to 35 a day. . . . The staff here are heroes 
in my eyes, and I am really upset that the community hasn't helped us out." 
</P>
<P>
The plan being formulated is just such a community effort, which is what makes 
it unique, local officials and the American Hospital Assn. say. Besides the 
county Department of Public Health, the major players are the Los Angeles 
County Medical Assn. and the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the crisis coming. We can see very clearly that the county is over 
capacity," said David Langness, the council's vice president for community 
relations. "What we are attempting to do is apportion out the overflow births 
from the county system to the private hospitals that are willing and able to 
deliver." 
</P>
<P>
The plan has two goals: to provide for the orderly use of existing hospital 
facilities for deliveries and to get women into care early in their pregnancies 
so they and their babies have the best chance. 
</P>
<P>
For the program to work, planners say, staff doctors at these hospitals must 
also be willing to participate. The medical association has given the health 
department the names of nearly 5,000 private obstetricians, pediatricians, 
anesthesiologists and family practitioners, all specialists involved at some 
point in the care of pregnant women and the safe delivery of their babies. 
</P>
<P>
The county mailed contracts to the doctors on the association's list earlier 
this month, accompanied by a letter of endorsement from medical association 
President David Chernof. It is still too early to predict how many will sign 
up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county health officials are negotiating with Medi-Cal authorities 
for approval of the plan's financial aspects. Both sides say agreement is near. 
</P>
<P>
Early prenatal care has not been an option for many poor women in Los Angeles 
County, particularly as the public health care system has seen its funding 
reduced while the number of people depending upon it for care has increased. 
The burden in obstetrics is especially acute because few private obstetricians 
are willing to accept Medi-Cal insured patients. This is a major factor in the 
current imbalance, with five county hospitals handling a crushing load of the 
county's 190,000 annual births while obstetrical units in some private 
hospitals have empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
Too much paperwork, slow reimbursement and outright refusal of claims are the 
reasons most cited by doctors and hospitals for washing their hands of Medi-Cal 
-- and the poor patients it serves. Last June, Medi-Cal stopped paying its 
bills altogether because of legislative delay on a supplemental appropriation. 
The program resumed payments in July, but the incident was yet another black 
mark on a record that already made the program a tough sell to health-care 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hitch, though. Medi-Cal requires hospitals receiving its money to 
offer a full range of care to publicly insured patients, not only single 
services such as obstetrics. Of the 130 hospitals in Los Angeles County, 70 
have Medi-Cal contracts, not enough to make the obstetrical program work. Few 
outside the system want to join, but a good number of these are willing to help 
out in a limited fashion in the obstetrics area, according to Langness. 
</P>
<P>
Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia is one. Its president, 
Frederick C. Meyer, said the pressure to join the obstetrical safety net came 
from doctors on the staff who knew of the "terrible overcrowding" at nearby 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
When the Hospital Council of Southern California pitched the cooperative plan, 
he readily signed up. His hospital also stands to make some money, since it's 
obstetrics unit is under-used. 
</P>
<P>
The county medical association's Chernof, who has brought single-minded 
enthusiasm to the project, confesses to some dismay at how long it has taken to 
put the plan together. His involvement began last September. He worries that 
the incident at Harbor-UCLA, however unsanctioned, may scare hospitals and 
doctors who might otherwise participate in the program, undermining trust in 
the county's ability to refer overflow patients in an orderly manner. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Williams, Los Angeles County's administrator for hospitals, worries about 
the imminent possibility of another overload at Harbor-UCLA or Olive View 
Medical Center in Sylmar or Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in 
South-Central Los Angeles. Of the five county hospitals with obstetrical 
services, these are the busiest. 
</P>
<P>
"The triage system (a means of referring less-urgent cases) is what we need to 
do right away," he said. "But we recognize that that is not the best solution 
long term. The other part of this is the better way to avoid these situations 
building up in the county hospitals in the first place."

MILKEN ACCUSED OF BRIBERY, MORE INSIDER TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken's defense lawyers revealed Tuesday that the former junk bond 
wizard has been accused by prosecutors of committing many crimes beyond the six 
he pleaded guilty to, including previously undisclosed acts of bribing 
officials of mutual funds, obstruction of justice and insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
The government allegations evidently were contained in a 200-page 
pre-sentencing memorandum supplied to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood in New 
York. An edited version of that document had been scheduled to be made public 
Tuesday but was withheld at least until today because the judge was still 
reviewing it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Milken's lawyers released edited versions of their own pre-sentencing 
memorandum, as well as a detailed rebuttal of the still-confidential government 
document. These defense documents contain the first official details of the 
alleged additional crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 44, former head of the Beverly Hills-based junk bond department of 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, is due to be sentenced Monday on the charges of 
conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud he pleaded guilty to in April. He 
faces a maximum of 28 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plea agreement, Milken cannot be prosecuted for any of the additional 
crimes the government now says he committed. Prosecutors, however, presented 
the judge with the new allegations in the hope that she will take them into 
account in deciding Milken's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution document evidently includes new allegations that Milken and his 
associates obstructed justice by deliberately destroying documents and planning 
a cover-up in 1986, immediately after they became aware that former stock 
speculator Ivan F. Boesky had agreed to plead guilty to an insider 
trading-related offense and was cooperating with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur L. Liman, Milken's lead defense lawyer, asserted in the defense 
documents that these charges are false. 
</P>
<P>
Liman also denied government allegations that Milken in effect bribed managers 
of mutual funds to buy securities of dubious value from Drexel for their funds, 
by allowing the managers to invest personally in highly lucrative deals. The 
government apparently asserted that such investment opportunities included 
participation in the acquisition of Storer Communications in December, 1985, by 
the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The new allegations that seemed to draw the greatest indignation from the 
Milken camp, however, were the insider trading allegations, including at least 
one instance in which Milken allegedly profited personally. 
</P>
<P>
Milken resigned from Drexel in June, 1989, and the once powerful investment 
bank collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings in February, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Liman asked in his court papers that the judge ignore the new allegations. He 
said it is not the court's role "to resolve scores of contested claims" that 
were dropped when Milken agreed to plead guilty to six counts. Although the 
indictment included some insider trading charges, it did not include 
allegations of obstruction of justice or bribing mutual fund officials. Liman 
provided a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal of the new government allegations. 
</P>
<P>
And he asserted that the government document seemed intended to appeal unfairly 
to the public and pressure the court. "The document's factual presentations are 
grossly distorted," Liman stated. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan has said it will not comment at least 
until its memorandum is released. 
</P>
<P>
The defense memo says Milken's crimes were aberrations in an otherwise 
exemplary life. Liman wrote: "Although inexcusable, Michael's offenses . . . 
were neither venal nor motivated by greed. He did not personally profit by 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers asked that he be sentenced only to probation and a community 
service project that would be supervised by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
Milken already has agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Wood, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, has recommended 
that because of Milken's unusual talents society would best be served if he was 
allowed to run a program to benefit inner-city children. 
</P>
<P>
However, the defense said the government has asked the judge to impose a 
substantial prison sentence, possibly a provisional sentence that could be 
reduced later if Milken cooperates fully with the government. Milken has agreed 
to do so after his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
On the prosecution allegations of insider trading, the defense documents reveal 
that prosecutors have asserted that Milken personally profited in 1983 from 
advance knowledge that Caesar's World Inc. was about to carry out a major 
recapitalization. The government evidently has maintained that Milken's 
profit-sharing retirement account acquired $3 million of Caesar's World bonds 
based on knowledge that their value was about to soar. 
</P>
<P>
Milken has long contended that his transgressions never included anything as 
serious as insider trading. And his lawyers took pains last spring to point out 
that the charges Milken pleaded guilty to do not include insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other insider trading allegations in the government's memo were 
previously disclosed in the indictment of Milken that was withdrawn when he 
agreed to plead guilty. These include trading in the securities of 
entertainment companies Viacom Inc. and Lorimar. Others apparently had not been 
disclosed previously, including trades in securities of Republic Airlines and 
in dealings with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
In page after page of their own documents, the defense lawyers rebut the 
charges, providing detailed explanations of why the trading was not based on 
inside knowledge. They say the government's own witnesses have testified before 
a grand jury that the trading was entirely normal and proper. 
</P>
<P>
And Liman charged that the government's documents "omitted almost all evidence 
exculpatory or favorable to Mr. Milken, including objective facts and even 
specific testimony by the government's own cooperators . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It is by no means clear yet whether the judge will take any of the new 
government allegations into account when she imposes sentence. Prosecutors have 
asked the judge to hold hearings on the additional allegations to determine if 
there is sufficient evidence to back them up. If the judge decides to do that, 
it could delay sentencing for months. Milken's lawyers oppose such a move, 
however. The judge is expected to rule on the issue before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar case, involving Robert M. Freeman, a former stock speculator at 
the investment banking firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. who pleaded guilty to a 
single insider trading-related count, a judge refused to hold such hearings and 
said he ignored prosecutors' allegations of additional crimes.

ABORTION A FACTOR IN BERGESON VS. MCCARTHY

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson is the prim and proper product of a newly rich 
Newport Beach neighborhood. Her manner, typically, is modest and polite. She 
tends to deflect tough questions with a disarming smile and a short, fleeting 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, she seems like one to shrink from confrontation. But listen to 
what she has been saying about her opponent in the race for lieutenant 
governor, incumbent Leo T. McCarthy: 
</P>
<P>
He's a flip-flopper, a job-hopper, a coddler of the common crook. His anti-drug 
ballot measure is a sham and a gimmick meant to save his political skin. Now 
he's hiding from her. He won't come out and fight fair and square. 
</P>
<P>
And all McCarthy wanted was one more term in what is perhaps the least powerful 
job in state government. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy has the name, the resources, the experience and the endorsements. He 
was Speaker of the state Assembly. He has run for statewide office four times 
in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The smart money also said Bergeson would lose the Republican primary to Sen. 
John Seymour of Anaheim. Seymour is back tending his state Senate district, 
wondering why his connections to U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, his network of 
volunteers and his popular position on abortion failed to stop the Bergeson 
bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said during the primary that the Republicans needed a tough fighter 
with the stomach to take on McCarthy. They got her. Bergeson, Wilson's running 
mate, is the Republicans' best hope of electing a woman to statewide office for 
1990, which the experts have dubbed the year of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for lieutenant governor is often an afterthought for voters whose 
attention is split by the high-profile governor's race and dozens of other 
political campaigns. California's second-in-command is elected separately from 
the governor and has few duties under the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
This year's battle may have broader implications, particularly for the 
politically charged issue of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy supports the status quo: Adult women have the right to an abortion at 
any time during pregnancy, and the poor can have their abortions paid for by 
taxpayers through the Medi-Cal health insurance program. Bergeson opposes 
abortion except in cases of rape or incest and when considered necessary to 
save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two candidates could be crucial if the membership 
changes in the state Senate, where as presiding officer the lieutenant governor 
has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote. Currently, a majority of the 
40-member upper house favors abortion rights and state funding for the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, sensing that California voters side with abortion rights proponents, 
has labeled abortion the "most clearly defining issue" that divides the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's position on abortion also differs from Wilson, who generally 
supports a woman's right to abortion. That split could prove problematic for 
Wilson because of the strong abortion rights stand taken by his Democratic 
rival, Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wilson has welcomed Bergeson as his running mate. They have made 
numerous joint appearances, and Wilson has mentioned topics, such as education, 
on which he would employ Bergeson's expertise. Although Feinstein and McCarthy 
are both from San Francisco, they are more distant. McCarthy said recently that 
he had not discussed his potential role in a Feinstein Administration with the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy is a statewide political figure in his own right. After six terms in 
the Assembly, including three as Speaker, he was elected lieutenant governor in 
1982. Reelected in 1986, McCarthy ran against Wilson for the U.S. Senate in 
1988 and lost. He has not ruled out another try for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
Serving two terms under Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, McCarthy has had to 
struggle to stay in the limelight. He got some rare publicity as the state's 
acting chief executive just after last year's Bay Area earthquake, when 
Deukmejian was out of the country. Mostly, he has had to make his own way. 
</P>
<P>
As lieutenant governor, McCarthy sponsored a legislative package that cracked 
down on negligent and abusive nursing home operators, and he pushed for 
stricter standards for the state's air and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Controller Gray Davis, McCarthy used his position on the state Lands 
Commission to stop new oil drilling and exploration in state waters. After the 
Alaska oil spill, he and Davis co-sponsored legislation that led to the passage 
last month of a program to tax oil companies to pay for oil spill prevention 
and clean up. He has won the endorsement of the Sierra Club and League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have taken a sleepy office and transformed it into something it never was 
before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's latest endeavor is Proposition 133, an initiative on the Nov. 6 
ballot that would increase the sales tax by a half-cent on the dollar to pay 
for anti-drug education, treatment and law enforcement. If approved by voters, 
the sales tax increase would be in effect for four years and raise $7.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has been endorsed by Feinstein, state schools Supt. Bill Honig, and 
virtually every law enforcement group in the state. Even Wilson said he may 
vote for it. But Bergeson opposes Proposition 133, calling it a "gimmick" to 
cover up McCarthy's record on crime as a member of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sham," she said. "I find it ironic that Leo has come to the initiative 
process to fight crime. If he hadn't fought every tough crime bill which came 
before him as Assembly Speaker, I firmly believe our streets would be safer 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson noted that McCarthy voted to decriminalize marijuana in 1975, he once 
voted to reduce sentences for first-time rapists, and he helped block passage 
of a bill to require life in prison for habitual sex offenders. McCarthy was 
Speaker when the Assembly Criminal Justice Committee, whose members he 
appointed, gained its reputation among conservatives as a "graveyard" for 
public safety bills. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy brushed off Bergeson's criticism of his voting record, and his 
campaign provided a list of more than 100 bills he voted for that he considers 
tough on crime. He also noted that he has been endorsed by most of the state's 
police officials and rank-and-file law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There is real irony in suggesting that smoking one marijuana cigarette is 
something we should be centering on in this election, with a couple (of) 
hundred thousand coke addicts in California, with Colombian drug networks 
setting up in Los Angeles," McCarthy said. "There is a stupidity to being so 
out of focus on the drug epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, however, said the effort to decriminalize marijuana was not a trivial 
act. It sent a message that it was all right to use drugs, she said, and that 
attitude helped fuel the drug epidemic of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson has also attacked McCarthy for changing his position on two of the 
most emotional issues in politics: abortion and the death penalty. She said he 
did so only to enhance his chances for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson has always opposed abortion because, she said, she believes life 
begins at conception. McCarthy said he came to support abortion rights more 
than 15 years ago, although while Assembly Speaker he opposed public funding of 
abortions for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates support the death penalty, although McCarthy came to his 
position in 1985, long after the issue was settled by California voters. 
McCarthy, who twice co-authored legislation to abolish the death penalty, said 
he became convinced over the years that it did not make sense to enact tougher 
penalties for most violent crimes while allowing some murderers to be released 
in as little as 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I changed my mind on it," McCarthy said. "I'm as comfortable as one can be 
when trying to decide when to take a life." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, 60, and Bergeson, 65, served together in the Assembly a decade ago 
when McCarthy was the powerful Speaker and Bergeson was a quiet first-term 
member. Both came to state politics after years in local government -- McCarthy 
as a San Francisco County supervisor and Bergeson as a Newport Beach school 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson has spent much of her legislative career -- six years in the Assembly 
and six in the Senate -- on matters of interest to schools and local 
government. On various issues, she has been at odds with the powerful 
California Teachers Assn. and the state's trial lawyer lobby, experiences that 
helped turn her into a battle-toughened lawmaker. She once had a public 
shouting match with Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) on the Assembly 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"She hates to lose," said Karen Coker, a lobbyist for the County Supervisors 
Assn. of California. "She throws a punch in a way that sometimes you don't know 
you've been hit until you've been knocked out for good." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson used that tenacity two years ago to help win enactment of legislation 
expanding state-paid prenatal care to 25,000 additional poor pregnant women -- 
the kind of expensive program traditionally favored by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Lazarus, vice president for policy of Los Angeles-based Children Now, 
credits Bergeson with having performed "damage control" to blunt the moves of 
the more conservative Deukmejian Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really been a persistent advocate for health and nutrition programs for 
working women and their children," Lazarus said. "She's had the influence of a 
leader, brought some other people along on this." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson is no liberal. In addition to her opposition to abortion, she has 
supported prayer in the schools and opposed efforts to prohibit discrimination 
against homosexuals. She was one of the few lawmakers who spoke out against 
divesting the state's pension funds of stock in companies that do business in 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
As chair of the Senate Local Government Committee, Bergeson has spoken of the 
need to form a state policy on growth management. Her critics say she failed to 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"She talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk," said Paula Carrell, Sacramento 
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were especially frustrated when Bergeson helped kill a bill 
that would have stopped cities and counties from approving new development 
until they could ensure that financing existed for public works such as 
schools, roads, water and sewers. The measure was passed by the Assembly but 
died in Bergeson's Senate committee, where she voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one simple, straightforward bill presented to her, she went with the 
development industry -- in spades," Carrell said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Bergeson called the bill a "no-growth" measure. She said it 
would have left cities and counties open to court challenges whenever they 
approved a housing development over community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
This campaign has been mainly a war of press releases and separate appearances. 
Bergeson has proposed a series of debates, but only one is scheduled, on a 
public television station in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think McCarthy realizes that if he is put on the spot, he will lose," said 
Ron Smith, Bergeson's campaign consultant. "His whole strategy is to hide. I 
don't think that's an acceptable way to run for public office." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy denied that he is avoiding Bergeson and said he would agree to a 
second debate with her in San Francisco.

VENUS BARES ITS SOUL IN NEW RADAR IMAGES; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: LATEST PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW CRATERS LARGE ENOUGH TO SWALLOW LOS ANGELES. JPL 
SCIENTISTS SEARCH FOR CLUES TELLING WHY PLANET TURNED OUT TO BE SO DIFFERENT 
THAN EARTH.

<P>
Venus, a planet that started out like the Earth but took a dramatic turn 
somewhere along the way, is turning out to be a geological candy store as it 
lays bare its soul for the Magellan spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs released Tuesday by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory show a planet 
that is pockmarked with giant impact craters large enough to swallow Los 
Angeles and a twisted, tormented landscape that has been molded by forces that 
are still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely jazzy images," said Gordon H. Pettengill of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, principal investigator for Magellan's 
radar science team. The images were captured by an electronic "camera" that 
uses radar beams to pierce through the dense atmosphere that normally hides the 
surface of the hot, barren planet. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that Magellan will help them understand why Venus -- the planet 
that is most like the Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun -- turned 
out to be so different: devoid of life, with surface temperatures hot enough to 
melt lead and a heavy atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
After a troubled beginning, Magellan seems to be doing its best to help unravel 
the mysteries, but some of the images produce more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has mapped the surface for more than 80 orbits as it flies in a 
polar trajectory around Venus. The problems that caused the craft to sever its 
communications with Earth twice are not fully understood, said chief engineer 
John P. Slonski Jr., so Magellan is not completely safe yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems may happen again," Slonski told a press conference at the 
Pasadena lab. He said that even if the "root cause" of the blackouts has not 
been determined, engineers have at least narrowed the range of probabilities 
and taken steps to protect Magellan as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said Tuesday that the images captured by Magellan have demonstrated 
that Venus is an extraordinary laboratory in which to test geological theories 
because the photographs are clear and reveal a geological record spanning 
hundreds of millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth, the evidence of earthquakes and volcanoes disappears over time 
because of vegetation and erosion. On Venus, where there is no vegetation and 
very little erosion, the geological record stands out in brilliant clarity. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new images shows an extraordinary pattern of what appears to be a 
crosshatching of faults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely regular pattern," said James W. Head II of Brown University, 
co-investigator on the radar science team. "The regularity is so remarkable," 
he said, that "we have no idea how these (patterns) would form." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that there are similar areas on Earth, he said, but they must be 
hidden by vegetation or erosion. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, "erosion does not appear to be a fundamental process" on the 
surface of Venus, Head said. That is because there is no water to wash away the 
soil and produce sediments that could be transported by the wind, and the wind 
amounts to little more than a slight breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so used to water eroding the surface of Earth," Head said. "It's 
astonishing to see all this detail. When you create (a geological feature on 
Venus) it stays there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
If Magellan can capture a photo of an active volcano on Venus, it would answer 
whether the planet is alive in a volcanic sense, but nothing in the images 
transmitted to Earth shows that. 
</P>
<P>
Head pointed out that Magellan has covered only 1 1/2% of the surface of Venus 
so far. If you looked at that much of the Earth's surface, you probably would 
not see any active volcanoes either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Head indicated that he believes he already knows the answer. "It's very much 
alive," he said of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The images from Magellan reveal a surface that could be changing even as the 
spacecraft zips overhead. In addition to faulting and cratering, the newly 
released images show a "river" of lava hundreds of miles long. The images also 
show giant volcanoes similar to those in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular image is a mosaic covering an area about half the size of 
California. It was displayed at JPL as a 10-foot-by-12-foot mural, and it shows 
giant craters up to 30 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
One image shows an impact crater that is nearly two miles deep. All of the 
impact craters are at least five miles in diameter. Scientists said that is 
because only the largest objects survive the long journey through space to 
Venus' surface. Smaller meteoroids apparently break up as they crash through 
the dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is expected to spend nearly a year mapping Venus, and scientists said 
Tuesday that they expect far more images and a lot of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't touch that dial," Head said. "We think we've got a blockbuster fall 
season coming up."

NAME GAME: The new name on the Big A outside Anaheim Stadium -- Great Western 
Bank -- will cost GW at least $125,000 a year. But that's nothing like the 
estimated $1 million a year GW pays to have Inglewood's sports arena called the 
Great Western Forum. . . . Could there be a "Great Western Anaheim Stadium" in 
store? Both sides say it's tempting, "but the name Anaheim Stadium is the only 
identity the city has for its investment here," a stadium spokesman says. "If 
the teams were named after Anaheim, it would be different." Marcida Dodson and

SUSPECT WAS WAY OUT OF LINE IN EFFORT TO BLEND IN AT MCDONALD'S

At the age of 10, Douglas Eric Girard was arrested for stealing a coop full of 
pigeons from the roof of a fish market. Like the birds he filched, his criminal 
career never quite took off. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's true, crime does not pay," he recently told a probation officer, 
noting that he has "made enough money to get by but not to get rich." 
</P>
<P>
Even his turn in the spotlight Monday, as the central figure in a six-hour 
hostage incident, apparently was a result of a botched attempt to elude La 
Verne police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An officer responding to the robbery of a children's clothing store saw Girard 
and a companion, Frank M. Teresi, get into line at a nearby McDonald's, 
investigators said. If the two suspects were trying to blend in, they failed. 
Both are heavily tattooed, and wads of money bulged visibly in their socks. 
Girard, witnesses said, carried a gun in his back waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the employees were huddling in the basement, customers had hit the 
floor and Girard had 20 captives, whether he wanted them or not. He paced, 
smoked cigarettes, changed his shirt and shrugged helplessly from time to time 
until sheriff's deputies stormed the McDonald's shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
No one was harmed. "He never pulled the gun out," said Ramiro Gironas, the 
assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a thief, but not a violent one," said Girard's younger brother, Vincent. 
"Me and my other brothers are the violent ones. We're more likely to knock 
someone out." 
</P>
<P>
Girard -- known to his intimates as "Dougie" -- has spent most of his life in 
and out of youth camps and jails. Police and court records say Girard, 32, and 
Teresi, 39, are heroin addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Teresi, described by police as the alleged "driver of the getaway car and 
possible lookout," has a similar history of convictions. He was captured by 
Brea police in 1983 after accidentally shooting himself in the leg with a 
.57-caliber deringer at the end of a string of armed robberies in Orange 
County. Teresi was then living at his brother's house in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
He has other Orange County roots: His estranged wife, with whom he has an 
11-year-old child, was a Garden Grove resident when she filed for divorce in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Girard is short, with slicked-back, red-brown hair, the fourth of six children. 
He was born to a mechanic and a housewife in Waco, Tex. The family moved when 
he was a youngster to South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Girard recalls his brother's first brush with the law as an arrest, 
along with two brothers and some neighbor children, for stealing pigeons from a 
cage on the roof of a Wilmington fish market. The charges were later dropped, 
the younger Girard said. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas kept stealing bikes and breaking into cars, his brother said. "All 
we knew was crime," Vincent Girard said. "Your surroundings make you what you 
are. And once you put a kid in jail, that's it. He just gets harder and 
harder."

PROGRAM OFFERS TROUBLED KIDS FUN AND, FOR SOME, A WAVE OF CALM

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diana is 12 and grew up in Southern California. But until Tuesday, she had 
never seen the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Her brown eyes wide with excitement, she ran back to the shore after taking her 
first plunge into the surf on Tuesday morning. "The waves!" she squealed in 
excitement. "I like the waves. And the water tastes like salt!" 
</P>
<P>
For Diana and nine of her friends, Tuesday was a very special day at Huntington 
State Beach. The 10 girls, ages 9 through 14, live together in one of the 
cottages at Orangewood Children's Home in Orange. They are all wards of the 
court. All were placed in the county-operated home because they had been abused 
or neglected or abandoned by their parents or guardians. 
</P>
<P>
But a new program at Orangewood now gives the children a chance for an all-day 
field trip to the ocean. It's a welcome break from a life that can be all too 
bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids normally wouldn't get a chance to go to the beach," said Dennis 
Gilmour, 33, an Orangewood teacher who accompanied the group Tuesday. "That's 
what's so nice about this. We bring the kids here in small groups, and the 
lifeguards work with them, giving them experiences the kids normally wouldn't 
get. . . . It's the kind of personal experience that maybe you and I grew up 
with in our families, but it's being given to these kids through the 
lifeguards." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reisenhofer, 32, a lifeguard at Huntington State Beach, enjoys the 
opportunity to work with the children. 
</P>
<P>
"I see changes that happen from the time they arrive in the morning to the time 
they leave in the early afternoon," Reisenhofer said. "In the morning, a lot of 
them are kind of in a shell. But by the end of a day, they come out from that 
shell a little bit -- sometimes a lot -- and so you feel like you've 
accomplished something." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour said the idea for the program came two or three years ago from Bud 
Brown, a lifeguard formerly at San Clemente State Beach. At first, the trips 
were infrequent. This summer, Orangewood and the state lifeguards arranged for 
regular weekly trips to the beach. Now every child gets a chance to visit the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The groups vary by age and sex according to the cottage they live in. Sometimes 
the visitors are all boys; sometimes, as on Tuesday, they're all girls. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters arrived Tuesday in a van driven by one of their counselors, Mary 
Lasley, and accompanied by Gilmour. Lifeguard Reisenhofer, in his blue uniform, 
met the group as it drove up to the lifeguard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi," he said. "My name is Rick, and I'm a lifeguard here." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children looked at him suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure you're not a cop?" one girl asked. 
</P>
<P>
Reisenhofer smiled. "Yes, I'm also a peace officer," he said. "But most of the 
time I'm a lifeguard. I work here to make it safe for people, to make sure 
everyone has a safe, fun time." 
</P>
<P>
The girls followed the lifeguard inside the headquarters. Reisenhofer drew on a 
blackboard, illustrating safety at the beach. The girls smiled as he sketched a 
bear wearing sunglasses and carrying suntan oil. They laughed as he involved 
them in one-on-one safety instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you have trouble in the water, don't just yell, 'Help!' " Reisenhofer 
said. "Yell: 'Help! Lifeguard! Help!' Can you repeat that?" 
</P>
<P>
The girls did. Loudly. And they laughed. 
</P>
<P>
After a trip to the top of the lifeguard tower, the girls walked to the water's 
edge and put their towels on the beach. Then, with squeals of joy and fear, 
they ran into the water. Two lifeguards joined them in the water, as did their 
counselor, Lasley. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour stood on the shore, watching the lifeguards offer the girls pointers on 
water safety. 
</P>
<P>
The children, he said, sometimes are afraid of adults. And it's no wonder: 24% 
of the children entering Orangewood have been physically or emotionally abused; 
23% have been sexually molested; 35% have been neglected; 15% are from 
destitute or homeless families; 2% have been abandoned by their parents, and 1% 
have a variety of other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"These children have had many problems, and some of them just haven't had the 
chance to be kids," Gilmour said. "That's why this beach program is such a good 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the No. 1 gain from this program is the positive adult role models 
these children see. Through these lifeguards, these kids are learning to trust 
adults. They're at an age now when they're starting to understand the world, 
and for some of them, this is the time that they start understanding what 
happened to them. When they were little children, it wasn't clear to them what 
happened. So it's a tough time for them, and it's good to have positive adult 
role models." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour said another positive aspect of the beach program is the rare bit of 
solitude -- and the short departure from routine at Orangewood -- it offers the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch it, and you'll see," he said. "They'll start to relax, and they'll find 
a place for themselves on the beach, and they'll just be themselves for a day. 
It's a good learning experience. You and I know that people often come to the 
beach when they're feeling down or whatever, and now these kids are learning 
that they can find a real soothing experience just being here by the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
As Gilmour predicted, some of the girls from time to time broke away from the 
group and sat alone on the sand, looking at the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the waves," said Maria, 10, as she gazed at the sea. In the distance, 
three pelicans slowly hovered over the water, then dove in search of a fish. 
The September sun warmed the sand. A soft breeze from the ocean carried a salty 
tang. 
</P>
<P>
Reisenhofer looked at the group of laughing, grinning girls, and smiled 
himself. "I just like the whole idea of this," he said.

the sand. Above, a little girl shows her delight. ; Photo, Orangewood

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MITTERMEIER NAMED AIRPORT MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After discussing the matter in closed session for less than five minutes, the 
County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted Tuesday to accept the resignation 
of their airport manager and replace him with Jan Mittermeier, the airport's 
second in command. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all still thrilled over your activity and the leadership you have 
provided," Supervisor Don R. Roth, chairman of the board, told Mittermeier 
during Tuesday's session. "We want to say congratulations to you." 
</P>
<P>
Along with its congratulations, the board gave Mittermeier a healthy raise, 
from $87,838 to $91,000 a year. That makes Mittermeier one of the county's 10 
highest-paid appointed employees. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier -- a well-liked, 16-year veteran of county government who was 
transferred to the airport in 1987 from the auditor-controller's office -- is 
the first woman to run John Wayne Airport. She had been widely expected to win 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the pay raise reflects the board's confidence in Mittermeier, 
50,and stands in stark contrast to the way the supervisors dealt with George 
Rebella, Mittermeier's embattled predecessor in the airport manager's post. 
Rebella was passed up for a raise this year, the only top county administrator 
to be so slighted. 
</P>
<P>
Rebella submitted his resignation to the board last week, citing stress and 
illness. His resignation was effective Tuesday, ending Rebella's five-year 
stint as airport manager, a tenure marred by construction delays and cost 
overruns at the $310-million airport expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
The board accepted Rebella's resignation without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, a vacancy in a top county management post would be filled on an 
interim basis, with a permanent replacement being named after a search. But 
supervisors said Tuesday that they were convinced of Mittermeier's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little off the normal procedure, but it was crying to happen," said 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who made the motion to appoint Mittermeier. "She's 
the right person for the job." 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier, who started in her new post as soon as the decision was announced, 
said she planned to begin work by reviewing the organizational structure of the 
airport staff and seeing how to consolidate it. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's new terminal opened 10 days ago; with it completed, many staff 
members will see their responsibilities shift from construction to other areas, 
Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been geared up for managing a very large project," she said. "Now what 
we need to do is look at the organization and try to do some consolidating."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SUPERVISORS URGED TO PASS AIDS STATUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Orange County Visibility League accused county supervisors of 
political cowardice Tuesday and asked the board to pass an ordinance 
prohibiting discrimination against people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an awful lot of prejudice and discrimination and hate in Orange County 
for people who have AIDS," said Visibility League member Rod Jackson. He was 
one of several league members who attended Tuesday's session, one day after 
activists and relatives of people with AIDS marked the death of more than 1,000 
Orange County residents from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to say that it's not OK to discriminate against a person with a 
life-threatening disease," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has AIDS, struggled to the podium to make his remarks Tuesday and 
delivered them to a silent, pensive audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to be here," he said after the meeting. "We marked last night the 
1,000 people in this county who have died of AIDS, and I'm probably not going 
to be here to mark the 2,000th." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors rejected an anti-discrimination ordinance last year, making Orange 
County the only urban area in California without an ordinance protecting people 
with AIDS from discrimination. As a result, activists said, county residents 
with AIDS face the risks of being fired, kicked out of their homes and 
otherwise victimized because of their disease. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, they added, the board's rejection of the anti-discrimination 
measure last year sent a signal that county officials are unwilling to stand up 
for the rights of people with AIDS. The board turned down the measure on a vote 
of 3 to 2, with Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder supporting 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Two supervisors were courageous and did the right thing," Jeff LeTourneau, 
co-chairman of the Visibility League, said during his testimony before the 
board. "Three, in my opinion, did not." 
</P>
<P>
LeTourneau and other league members who attended Tuesday's session said they 
intended to press board members for another vote on the issue, but the 
supervisors made no response to the group's request. 
</P>
<P>
LeTourneau said later that league members will continue to press for the 
measure. The league is hoping that one of the supervisors will agree to 
reintroduce the ordinance sometime after the Nov. 6 election, he added. JIM

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CRASH VICTIM WINS SUIT AGAINST GM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court jury awarded $1.65 million to a Huntington Beach woman Tuesday 
after agreeing that defects in her 1982 Chevrolet Camaro contributed to serious 
injuries she suffered in a collision six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated about 2 1/2 days before deciding in favor of Terri F. 
Soule and against General Motors Corp., ending an eight-week trial in Fullerton 
and closing the book on more than 4,000 pages of witness testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Soule's attorney, Frank P. Barbaro, called the verdict a landmark decision and 
said the trial revealed welding weaknesses in a bracket that attaches the 
left-front wheel assembly to the car's frame. He said testimony also showed 
that the car did not "crush" properly on impact, and he urged General Motors to 
take notice of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors attorney Barry Schirm said he was "shocked and dismayed" by the 
verdict and was discussing the corporation's options, including the possibility 
of an appeal, with GM executives. 
</P>
<P>
"This (appeal) is not something we can decide in 15 or 20 minutes on the 
telephone," Schirm said of his post-trial conversations with the car company. 
"We can't say what the full ramifications of the verdict will be." 
</P>
<P>
In Barbaro's office, decorated with colorful paper streamers, Soule, 49, was 
lifting a glass of Scotch in tribute to her legal team. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't settled in with me yet," she said, tears welling in her eyes. "The 
main thing I felt today is grateful for this verdict, my attorneys, a great 
jury and an excellent judge. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it will ever be behind me, but it makes it less painful. It's 
been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Soule briefly recalled the accident in January, 1984, that crushed her left 
ankle, requiring nine operations to fuse it back together. She said the 
accident caused her to leave a full-time job and has left her with no ankle 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'I'm going to die,' " she said, describing her thoughts that day 
when she saw another car cross the center-divider of Bolsa Chica Road in 
Westminster and move toward her. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorneys claimed that when the vehicles collided, welding weaknesses in 
the Camaro bracket allowed the left-front tire to push up the floorboard, 
causing her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"For the rest of her life she will have pain every time she takes a step," 
Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, Barbaro said, Soule has accumulated medical bills totaling 
$80,000 and has lost $114,000 in earnings, and faces the loss of another 
$320,000 in future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Schirm said a major point in the GM defense was the fact that Soule was not 
wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision. He also said the corporation 
disputed the claim of weakness in the bracket welds and denied that the bracket 
caused Soule's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to make of their decision," Schirm said. "I think there were 
technical issues that they missed. It was certainly not what I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Barbaro said he spent more than $90,000, not including attorneys' fees, to try 
the case. For the entire eight-week trial he said he stayed in a Fullerton 
hotel room to be near the courtroom and save commuting time to his Laguna Beach 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"We cut up two Camaros in pieces to put this case on," he said. "You can never 
be sure when you're up against the world's largest corporation." KEN JOHNSON

C. RUSSELL COOK PARK EXPANDED BY 4 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City-owned C. Russell Cook Park was expanded by nearly 4 acres recently when a 
previously fenced-off area was opened for use as soccer fields. 
</P>
<P>
The park, which consists of three parcels along Calle Arroyo adjoining San Juan 
Creek, now covers 19 acres. It was named for a civic activist who founded the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Sievers, director of public lands, said the park size will increase. "As 
money from local development becomes available, we'll use it to prepare more of 
the parkland in the area."

MOLA SUES OFFICIALS, CITY FOR $11 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mola Development Corp. has filed an $11-million lawsuit against the city of 
Seal Beach and three City Council members, claiming that the city illegally 
discriminated against the company by rescinding approval for its proposed 
$200-million Hellman Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 4 1/2 years, Mola has waged a battle to build a $200-million 
housing development on a 149-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The city approved the plan and then, after the seating of two new council 
members, rescinded the approval. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's actions are arbitrary and capricious, intended to single out Mola 
for discriminatory treatment and to frustrate Mola's development plan, and are 
without factual or legal support," Mola's complaint states. 
</P>
<P>
The amount Mola is seeking -- $11 million to cover land rights and 
pre-development costs -- would wipe out two thirds of the city's 1990-91 budget 
of $16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The city's original approval of the 335-unit Hellman Ranch project last October 
was thrown out by an Orange County Superior Court commissioner in March because 
the city's state-required local housing plan was obsolete when the council's 
vote was taken. Three months after the commissioner's action, a newly installed 
City Council voted to reject the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
City officials were not available to comment on the lawsuit Tuesday, but City 
Clerk Joanne Yeo said it had not yet arrived at City Hall. The lawsuit named as 
defendants the city and council members Frank Laszlo, Gwen Forsythe and Marilyn 
Bruce Hastings -- the three who voted to rescind approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials have not yet given up plans for the development and are still 
hoping the state's 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana will reinstate the 
original approval given the project last October.SHANNON SANDS

CITY REBUTS REPORT CRITICAL OF POLICE 
</P>

<P>
The city has made another response to the Orange County Grand Jury's report 
that sharply criticized the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
After city officials released a written response to the grand jury report two 
weeks ago, several residents objected to the lack of specific replies to 
allegations of nepotism, an unusually high number of stress-related disability 
retirements and citizen complaints about officers' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to finally set the record straight and get the facts out," Police 
Chief William Stearns said of the packet of documents now available to the 
public. Stearns criticized the grand jury's investigatory methods in a memo 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was appalled because I thought it would be a professional, unbiased, 
in-depth investigation," Stearns said in a telephone interview. Specifically, 
Stearns said the grand jury failed to use skilled investigators in putting 
together its report and ignored personnel and other records. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns also said he was never interviewed in connection with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Duensing, chair of the grand jury committee that conducted the probe, 
confirmed Stearns was not interviewed but stood by the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation was very thorough," she said. "The committee did an 
excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
The confidential nature of the grand jury investigation prevents her from 
talking about who was interviewed or what records were considered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The memos released Tuesday -- from the police chief, a police captain and the 
city attorney's office -- dispute charges of nepotism stemming from the 
reclassification of Stearns' wife, Michele, from animal control officer to 
court liaison. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grand jury report indicated that her hiring had violated city 
rules, city officials said proper procedures were followed in making the job 
change. And, contrary to the grand jury's report, Michele Stearns did not 
receive a pay increase with the new position, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the decision to reclassify Stearns was approved by the city manager, 
civil service board and City Council at the time, the memos indicate. The city 
has already referred the charge of nepotism to the city's Civil Service board 
for review and recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The memo also states that the police chief's actions over the last two years 
have reduced the number of medical retirements and that only citizen complaints 
to the City Council involved incidents that occurred more than two years ago.

2 PROSECUTORS ANNOUNCE ENDORSEMENT OF ENRIGHT

Two prosecutors who lost in the June primary in the district attorney's race 
formally announced their support for Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright 
Tuesday against appointed incumbent Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman and Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef 
also used the news conference to lash out at Capizzi for using employees to 
walk precincts on weekends in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Enright assailed Capizzi several weeks ago for using office help in his 
campaign. But Tuesday, he and the other two prosecutors said they were upset 
about a letter from Capizzi's wife, Sandy. It was sent to those deputies who 
had indicated to the Capizzi campaign staff that they would walk precincts for 
him, but had failed to show up for the preceding kickoff breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry you were unable to attend our kickoff meeting . . . we will need lots of 
people to cover the county, and if you can persuade friends to walk they will 
be appreciated," the letter stated in part. 
</P>
<P>
"The main question is, are these really volunteers," Enright said. "It hasn't 
been done in the 30 years that I've been in the district attorney's office. I 
think it borders on intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Enright said he also believed that legally, it was a close question. However, 
Enright's campaign staff had already received legal advice that Capizzi's use 
of deputies did not violate any state election statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, who was appointed by the county supervisors in January when then-Dist. 
Atty. Cecil Hicks became a judge, had refused to let deputies in the office 
participate in his June primary campaign. But Capizzi said he relented in the 
November election because so many deputies had wanted to help. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Capizzi called the Enright-Avdeef-Freeman news conference "sour 
grapes." 
</P>
<P>
It was "double-talk", Capizzi said, because Enright is using Freeman in his 
campaign and he is technically Freeman's boss. He added that he believes the 
three of them are still upset because he got 86% of the deputy support within 
the office when deputies were polled by their professional association for an 
endorsement for the June election. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the June election, I thought I was up against Edgar Bergen and two 
Charlie McCarthys," Capizzi said Tuesday. "I'm still waiting to see which of 
them is Edgar Bergen." 
</P>
<P>
But Freeman called Capizzi's use of deputies questionable. 
</P>
<P>
"This is of grave, grave professional concern of people involved and committed 
to the real job to man the public's business," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman and Avdeef indicated on election night in June they would support 
Enright. Freeman has long been Enright's best friend within the office and had 
run as an anti-Capizzi candidate only because it appeared then that Enright was 
not going to join the race. Capizzi had been Hicks' chief assistant and had 
gained a foothold as the No. 2 prosecutor in the office ahead of Enright. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef, who was Capizzi's strongest critic in the primary, said Tuesday he was 
giving Enright his formal endorsement because "we agree on what has to be done 
to make this community a safer place to reside." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi was easily the front-runner in June, gathering more than 40,000 votes 
ahead of Enright, who ran second. But Capizzi fell far short of the 50% plus 
one vote he needed to prevent a runoff. He finished with 41%, but Enright, an 
eleventh-hour candidate, ran a surprisingly strong race, finishing at 29%. 
Avdeef and Freeman had about 29% between them. 
</P>
<P>
Enright supporters believe that the Freeman and Avdeef votes were anti-Capizzi 
votes that can make the difference on the November ballot. The Capizzi camp, 
however, points out that Capizzi still easily outdistanced Enright and that it 
was logical that the other candidates would split up the vote.

HARD-FOUGHT BOARD RACES CAP AN ACRIMONIOUS YEAR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a year that has seen a worsening budget crisis, the controversial 
departure of the superintendent and an exodus of other administrators and 
teachers, the Huntington Beach City School District is set for what promises to 
be a vigorously contested school board race. 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates -- three incumbents and four challengers -- are vying for 
three seats in the Nov. 6 election. The victors will be faced with the task of 
restoring harmony to a board that has been torn by frequent infighting among 
members, a lengthy teachers' labor dispute and the dismissal of Supt. Diana 
Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Sherry Barlow and Trustee Patricia Cohen, both nine-year 
members of the board, are each making third reelection bids largely on the 
promise to continue the district's goals and direction of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
In the other corner is Trustee Robert Mann, an independent voice of dissent on 
the board since his election in 1987. Mann argues that the status quo is 
misdirected and is calling for greater communication both within the district 
and with parents, while favoring more power for teachers and the channeling of 
more money into educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers, representing a divergent range of viewpoints, are also 
clamoring for changes in the district, particularly stressing the need to 
enhance communication and bridge the divisions on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Carey, a health consultant and active community volunteer, and Brian 
Garland, a former board member and current principal at Edison High School, 
both support many of the viewpoints Mann has advocated. Both, for example, 
favor giving teachers a greater voice in district decisions and spending more 
money on programs and, if possible, teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, Carey, Garland and Mann are endorsed by the Huntington 
Beach Elementary Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, challengers Michael Cassidy, a lawyer and former police officer, and 
Brian Rechsteiner, an oil company executive, take a more conservative approach 
to proposing change. Both, for example, say they support teachers' issues but 
question whether the union leadership accurately represents those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the problems facing the board, many observers -- including the 
candidates on the Nov. 6 ballot other than Barlow and Cohen -- view the 
district as being in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees were compelled this year to withdraw $200,000 from district reserves 
to balance the budget. Last year's teachers' contract negotiations were bitter 
and prolonged, marked by teachers who picketed, denounced trustees, threatened 
to strike and boycotted many school activities. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that perhaps most threatens to further divide the district is the 
board's decision in July to buy out Peters' contract three years before it was 
scheduled to expire. 
</P>
<P>
The board paid Peters more than $140,000 in exchange for her resignation. 
However, under a gag order included in the buyout agreement, neither the board 
nor Peters has elaborated on the "philosophical differences" they say led to 
her departure. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates say they hope to put the issue behind them, but Peters' 
dismissal will inevitably be a focal point of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, for example, recently issued a news release attempting to dispel rumors 
that she is endorsed by Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Both Barlow and Cohen have to wrestle with the legally binding gag order, while 
trying to explain why they joined the board majority in giving Peters a pay 
raise and contract extension through 1993 -- less than a year before paying her 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mann, who opposed Peters' raise and contract extension, and the 
challengers also must field questions about Peters' administration and her 
departure. Since the new board will be appointing her successor, its views on 
Peters' managerial style, which will weigh heavily into that decision, must be 
addressed during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Among the challengers, Cassidy has perhaps stated the most defined viewpoint on 
the Peters issue. "I think she did a heckuva job," he said of the former 
superintendent. "I don't know why (trustees) did what they did." 
</P>
<P>
Rechsteiner said he believes that the district's educational programs reflect 
well on Peters, but he considers the teachers union's two votes of no 
confidence in Peters a significant strike against her administration.

"Howdy and welcome, folks. It's time again for another fun-filled edition of 
'Full Ride,' the game show for parents who seek that all-important status 
symbol: the college scholarship! 
</P>
<P>
"OK, let's get started. 
</P>
<P>
"Parent No. 1, tell us what you've done to groom your son for a full ride." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, when our Johnny was born, we filled the nursery with all the important 
stimuli. You know, playbooks, goal posts, rolls of Astroturf. We even got his 
diapers autographed by Lou Holtz." 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooh, very nice. Very nice." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, then when he was 4, we took him to his first session with his sports 
psychologist. I mean, Johnny wasn't a wimp or anything, but, well, you know, 
any time his mother and I would sit him down to discuss pass plays he'd cry for 
his Winnie-the-Pooh videos." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes. That can be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, last year at Johnny's eighth birthday party, his exercise physiologist 
noticed he wasted far too much oxygen when he blew out his candles. From that 
moment on we've had him hold his breath on the way to practice." 
</P>
<P>
"To increase lung capacity?" 
</P>
<P>
"You got it. We figured if football didn't pan out we could always get him into 
underwater alligator wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
"Right. I heard that was a scholarship sport now in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, not yet, but we're working on it. Got lobbyists down there right now, as 
a matter of fact." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that expensive?" 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, what isn't? We've had Johnny work with sports nutritionists, 
astrologers, aerodynamic hairstyle specialists. Those footwork sessions with 
Paula Abdul weren't cheap, you know. Anyway, it'll all be worth it once he gets 
that full ride. I mean, I get tears in my eyes every time I envision him 
signing that letter of intent." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, sure. We all understand that feeling, don't we? OK, on to the next 
contestant. Go ahead, Parent No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, I think maybe I'm on the wrong stage." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean? This is 'Full Ride,' the show everyone wants to be on. Now 
go ahead, don't be shy. Tell us what you've done to get your kid a 
scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I just, uh, have him go to school and let him play sports, basically." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, stop kidding. What's your game plan? Who's your publicist?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, really. My son told me when he gets to high school, he'd like to try out 
for the gymnastics team, if they have one." 
</P>
<P>
"Gymnastics? Gymnastics! Come on, Parent No. 2, didn't anyone tell you that 
gymnastics is one of the fastest-fading college sports around? It's the dead 
end of scholarship street. For heaven's sake, haven't you attended even one 
scholarship-seeking seminar?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, see my son really enjoys gymnastics. He likes doing somersaults, just for 
fun, you see." 
</P>
<P>
"Fun? What does fun have to do with it? We're talking scholarships, here. You 
understand the significance of that? Get your kid a scholarship, mister, and 
your status skyrockets. We're talking a big piece of prestige pie. I mean, 
c'mon, it's the Orange County way." 
</P>
<P>
But is it the right way? No way. 
</P>
<P>
High school coaches in Orange County typically say the pressure on athletes 
has, in some cases, risen to ridiculous proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Earning a college scholarship is, in many areas, becoming more important than 
playing the sport. Sure, college is expensive and a scholarship can certainly 
help a family in need. There's nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
But when parents go to unreasonable lengths to increase their child's chances 
for a scholarship, the resulting pressure can interfere with the child's 
ability to perform and the enjoyment of the sport the child plays. 
</P>
<P>
And many times, you have to question the parents' motives. 
</P>
<P>
At Corona del Mar High, a parent of a wide receiver once called the coach's 
office requesting that her son be thrown more passes than usual in the upcoming 
game. Why? Because a Pac-10 recruiter said he would be in the stands that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
At Laguna Beach, parents of a volleyball player asked the coach if he could 
make sure their daughter was given more opportunities to spike than normal 
because they told a college coach they would videotape their daughter's next 
match so he could judge her ability. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hired a new girls' soccer coach," Corona del Mar athletic director 
Jerry Jelnick said. "One parent came out and his first question was, 'Does he 
know college coaches?' He didn't ask whether the guy knew soccer." 
</P>
<P>
The Times gets several calls each week from parents who are upset because their 
child hasn't gotten "enough press." Their complaint often comes down to this: 
</P>
<P>
"How's my son going to get a scholarship if no one knows about him?" 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are in the business of news, not public relations. Publicists now 
are making themselves available to high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But as with all the other ways a parent can "buy" a better chance for an 
athletic scholarship -- personal trainers, nutritionists, sports psychologists 
-- doesn't it make more sense to sock that money away in a college cookie jar 
in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
It might not be as prestigious as a scholarship, but the education will be paid 
for just the same. 
</P>

HIGH SCHOOL: COMPANIES ARE DISCOVERING THERE'S A BOOMING BUSINESS IN MARKETING

<P>
As a 6-foot-4, 250-pound lineman with a 3.7 grade-point average at Trabuco 
Hills High School, Jim Farbaniec appeared to be a likely candidate for a 
football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Farbaniec wanted to play Division I football. During his junior year, to help 
spread the word, he hired a service to blanket the country with resumes touting 
his athletic and academic achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Letters poured into the Farbaniec household, enough to fill two dresser 
drawers. USC, UCLA, Georgia Tech, Utah State and Cal State Long Beach seemed to 
be wooing Farbaniec. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when the process was over, Farbaniec, a Times' second-team all-Orange 
County selection last season, had only vague scholarship offers from Utah State 
and Cal State Long Beach. Last spring he decided to attend and play football at 
UC Davis, a Division II school that doesn't offer football scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to break into the lucrative Orange County market, College Prospects of 
America provided its service free to the Farbaniecs. Farbaniec's teammate, 
quarterback/defensive back Tim Manning, on the other hand, paid about $300 for 
the same service. Manning is attending California on a football scholarship; 
Cal, however, had contacted Manning before he went to College Prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's and Farbaniec's experiences are evidence that when it comes to the 
quest for an athletic scholarship, there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
The services make no promises, but sell the idea of exposure through mass 
mailing. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't hit on as many people as we do and not find someone who is 
interested," said Keith Fox, president of College Prospects of America, which 
is based in Logan, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The Farbaniecs and Mannings say they are satisfied with the service they 
received from College Prospects. "It got his name out to a lot of schools that 
I couldn't get it out to," said Farbaniec's father, Ron. 
</P>
<P>
Said Doyle Manning, Tim's father: "I really looked at it like, 'Yeah, it's a 
couple hundred bucks for all the exposure in the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, it hasn't worked this way. Most scouting services generated 
revenues by charging colleges a fee for the names, heights, weights and other 
details about the top high school athletes. These so-called "blue-chip lists" 
were usually made up of players destined for major college football and 
basketball programs that could afford the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as College Prospects and the Scouting Report market their 
services primarily to parents of athletes not on the blue-chip lists who might 
have the talent to continue in some level of athletics. The main targets are 
the coaches who don't have large recruiting budgets -- often coaches of 
football and basketball teams below the Division I level, and of teams in 
non-revenue sports such as softball, baseball, golf, tennis and track and 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a summary of some of the services available in the area: 
</P>
<P>
College Prospects of America has been in business since 1986 but recently began 
offering its service in Orange County. College Prospects charges $489 ($389 
outside of California). The company's representatives prepare the athlete's 
resume after talking to the athlete, the athlete's parents, coaches and 
opposing coaches. The resume is sent to the national headquarters, where it 
will be determined which schools should receive copies of the resume. 
</P>
<P>
National Sports Marketing Group is a Newport Beach company founded in 1989 by 
Kenneth Parady, a former college football and basketball official. Parady was 
one of College Prospects' first representatives in California and his company 
offers a similar service for $395. But before it will sign anyone, National 
Sports Marketing Group requires a $125 personality test, which ranks the 
athlete's aggressiveness, drive and leadership, etc., on a national level. It 
markets its athletes as students who will graduate from the colleges that 
accept them and includes a book and videotape on "sports psyching" and a manual 
that suggests answers to questions recruiters commonly ask. 
</P>
<P>
Scouting Report, a service founded in Birmingham, Ala., in 1981, was initially 
only a football scouting service in the South. Its headquarters are now in 
Atlanta, and for $395, it will send resumes to virtually all of the colleges 
and universities in the nation that have teams in a specific sport. Scouting 
Report also provides information about loans and financial aid and study guides 
for standardized tests that are required for entrance into most schools. For an 
additional $200, Scouting Report will produce a videotape of the athlete in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
None of the services compiles statistics on the percentages of clients who 
receive scholarships, so it's difficult to determine how effective they are. 
The services say they maintain credibility by being selective in their choice 
of clients. 
</P>
<P>
However, many high school coaches are skeptical when families are solicited for 
money by these services. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe you should have to pay out money to get a scholarship," Los 
Alamitos football Coach John Barnes said. "All good scouting services are free. 
They make their money from the colleges. The minute I get any call saying, 'I 
can help your kid for $100,' I say, 'I can help him more.' 
</P>
<P>
"The borderline player might need a service, but he's still at the mercy of the 
college guy who is recruiting him. That guy is still the one who will come and 
take a look, then say yes or no." 
</P>
<P>
But Barry Stevens, who owns the College Prospects of America franchise in north 
Orange County, said coaches don't have enough time to do the job his service 
can. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world that your coaches -- I don't care who they are -- 
can do what we do," Stevens said. "They don't have time to take these kids 
individually and market them to colleges." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen coaches contacted nationwide had variety of feelings about the 
services. In general, the perception is that coaches for teams without big 
recruiting budgets are more apt to make use of the services. 
</P>
<P>
At Division I football programs "there are very few kids that get missed," said 
Mike Maynard, football coach at Division III Redlands. "If a kid's going to get 
a scholarship, he doesn't need to market himself. Very few get missed. But for 
the Division II or Division III kids, this is a very helpful service. 
</P>
<P>
"When a student pays money to advertise his achievements and skills, we feel he 
is a serious prospect. He really wants to play football." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA soccer Coach Sigi Schmid said he uses the services to gather information 
about athletes from areas to which he doesn't have direct access because of a 
limited budget. Once initial contact is made, he relies on his own contacts to 
determine an athlete's worth. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me, 'How many players have you gotten from the services?' " Schmid 
said, "I'd say probably none, but this year there is one kid who popped up 
through the service that we are taking a serious look at. He's probably the 
first one." 
</P>
<P>
In sports with quantitative standards, such as track and field or swimming, 
coaches seem more wary because success in those sports is defined by how fast 
an athlete's times are. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wood, cross-country and track and field coach at Division II Ferris State 
in Big Rapids, Mich., said most of the profiles he gets from such services are 
for marginal athletes. Wood said he answers every letter from athletes 
inquiring about his track program, but throws away most letters from the resume 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, parents who believe the services have helped their children get 
scholarships maintain they got their money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle Manning, whose son, Tim, received a football scholarship to Cal, kept 
track of how many inquiries were generated by College Prospects of America. Of 
64 initial contacts the family considered seriously, 46 could be traced to 
College Prospects. When Tim narrowed his choice to nine schools, three of them 
were traceable to College Prospects. Cal contacted Manning before he signed 
with the service. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kirner, whose son Lee signed with National Sports Marketing and received a 
partial tennis scholarship to Oregon, believes the service helped Lee get 
exposed to schools that wouldn't otherwise have known about him. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirner warns that hiring a service doesn't guarantee anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people who think this is some type of guarantee or warranty are 
completely wrong," Jim Kirner said. "You still have to sell yourself and you 
still have to have the goods. You have to have intrinsic worth and if you don't 
you probably won't get too far."

INJURIES TURNING RAMS' SUPER BOWL VISION INTO HARD-LUCK STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does this 1-2 start have you digging through the magazine stack in search of 
those preseason predictions putting the Rams in Super Bowl XXV? 
</P>
<P>
 Just what was it that was supposed to be so good about this team, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Rams did fall just one defeat -- albeit one very convincing 
defeat -- shy of making it to the Super Bowl last season. And they've got a 
quarterback and two wideouts who make scoring touchdowns look easy. 
</P>
<P>
You don't make it to the Super Bowl without a semblance of a defense, however. 
So a lot of people -- Coach John Robinson included -- must have figured the 
Rams' defensive youth movement would have a key role in their ascension to the 
"Team of the '90s" title. 
</P>
<P>
Eight first-year players, seven of whom play defense, made contributions last 
season. Four were projected starters for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, they were pleasant rookie surprises adjusting to life in the NFL. 
This year, however, they were supposed to settle in and make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, most of them learned that life in the NFL hurts. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of 1989's rookies -- linebackers Frank Stams and George Bethune -- 
have not been sidelined, or at least seriously hampered, by injuries in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a closer look at the Mostly Sad Case of the Sophomore Class (in the 
order they were drafted): 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hawkins: Hoping to beef up their inside pass rush, the Rams picked the 
6-foot-6-inch tackle from Miami with their first of two first-round picks in 
'89. He was steadily improving until he injured his left knee Dec. 11 against 
the San Francisco 49ers in his first pro start. He underwent arthroscopic 
surgery three days later and is still somewhat hobbled. 
</P>
<P>
Used mostly on passing situations this year, Hawkins has made just one tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing with a leg and a half," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Gary: The Rams took the running back from Miami five picks after 
Hawkins. Gary played in only eight games last season but was impressive enough 
to become a clear favorite for the starting tailback spot coming into the 1990 
season. But a slow-healing lower back injury kept him out of action the entire 
exhibition season and the regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
And Gary says he still is not 100%. He had 42 yards in eight carries late in 
the game against Tampa Bay, but managed only five yards in four carries Sunday 
against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's ready to handle all the responsibility, I think he'll certainly see 
a lot of action," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Stams: He was an outside linebacker at Notre Dame, but the Rams' first of 
three second-round selections in '89 made the transition to an inside spot as a 
rookie. Injuries to Fred Strickland and Larry Kelm meant Stams got a lot of 
on-the-job training last year. 
</P>
<P>
He played in all 16 regular-season games, starting twice, and finished the 
regular season with 27 tackles, three passes defensed and one interception, 
which he returned 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Stams led the team in exhibition tackles with 22 (18 of which were unassisted) 
and he's tied with Strickland for the regular-season lead with 16. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Smith: Three picks after Stams, the Rams took the outside linebacker from 
Auburn with the intention of turning him into a quarterback-chasing tackle. He 
spent the first 10 weeks of his rookie season on injured reserve with a wrist 
injury and played in his first pro game on the same night Hawkins was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-6 Smith gained 20 pounds during the off-season and is now starting ahead 
of Hawkins. Smith injured his knee Aug. 15 and missed two exhibition games. 
He's now suffering with sore ribs, but has started all three regular-season 
games. He has eight tackles and a sack. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making some progress," Robinson said. "He's getting a little bit better, 
but that's a real concern for us. We have to get that position playing better." 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Henley: The third of the Rams' '89 second-rounders, Henley, from UCLA, 
returned punts and played on special teams and nickel defense situations as a 
rookie. He made 21 tackles (18 solo), had one interception and four passes 
defensed. His performance was good enough to spur the Rams' decision to move 
All-Pro corner Jerry Gray to safety. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was scrapped when a hip injury kept Henley out of action from Aug. 
1-29. Henley returned to practice long enough to re-injure the hip. He's been 
on injured reserve since Sept. 1 and figures to miss at least half the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Piel: A defensive tackle from El Toro High School and the University of 
Illinois, Piel was drafted in the third round in 1988. He didn't play in '88, 
however, because of a neck injury suffered in training camp. But last season, 
Piel played in 13 regular-season games and started six times. He led the Ram 
defensive linemen in sacks with four. 
</P>
<P>
Then he dislocated his left elbow Dec. 3 at Dallas. He returned to start in all 
three postseason games before reinjuring the elbow in the NFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Piel, who has one sack this year, is still favoring the arm and has played 
sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Jackson: He was a wide receiver at San Diego State, but the Rams took 
Jackson in the fifth round in '89 with the intention of converting him to 
cornerback. He played in seven games last year, mostly on special teams, but 
saw action in the defensive backfield on some passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
He came on strong in the postseason with four unassisted tackles and one pass 
defensed in playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was injured in the collision with Gray during the exhibition finale, 
but returned in time to dislocate a finger in the regular-season opener. He's 
playing in the nickel defense and has two tackles this year. 
</P>
<P>
George Bethune: The outside linebacker from Alabama was the Rams' seventh-round 
selection in '89. He plays in Kevin Greene's designated pass-rusher spot, which 
says plenty about his athleticism. Bethune played in all 16 regular-season 
games last year and was an asset on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Bethune saw considerable playing time in the 1990 season opener at Green Bay -- 
Greene had just returned from a six-week holdout -- and recorded two solo 
tackles and an eight-yard sack. He has only one tackle in the last two games, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this is not the litany Robinson envisioned for his young warriors' 
second season, but he still sees hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"They will (make an impact) again," Robinson said. "Those guys have a lot of 
time ahead of them."

COMMERCEBANCORP TO BUY BACK STOCKS WITH $1-MILLION FUND

Directors of CommerceBancorp, the holding company for CommerceBank in Newport 
Beach, think their company's stock is undervalued. So they approved a plan to 
spend up to $1 million to buy back the firm's common stock at $10.25 a share 
and, thus, bolster the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
If the company spends the whole amount, it would buy and retire 4.6% of the 
company's common stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, the company's book value -- a major indication of the 
company's worth -- was $11.82 a share, and that amount is likely to go up once 
profits are announced for the third quarter, ending Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
But the stock was trading at only $10.25 a share Sept. 14 on the National 
Market System of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation 
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
CommerceBank is the county's largest independent bank, with $322 million in 
assets at the end of June.

GRADCO MAY SPIN OFF ITS PRINTER PRODUCTS WING; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: THE COMPANY WOULD SEEK TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY SEPARATING 
IRVINE-BASED GRADCO PRINTER SYSTEMS INC. AND COPIER-RELATED GRADCO JAPAN.

Gradco Systems Inc., a struggling copier and printer products company that is 
in a proxy fight with its biggest shareholder, said Tuesday that it will 
explore a plan to spin off its printer products unit to existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the company would seek to maximize shareholder value by 
separating Irvine-based Gradco Printer Systems Inc. and Gradco Japan, which is 
engaged in copier-related business, into separately traded entities. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, Gradco said it will pay down all of the existing Gradco 
Systems debt, write off certain business assets and function as a holding 
company owning shares of Gradco Japan, which makes the company's staple sorter 
products for office copiers. 
</P>
<P>
Keith B. Stewart, chairman and chief executive of Gradco Systems, said the 
disparity between the businesses and fundamentally different markets has 
produced "confusion" among company shareholders. In the spinoff plan, the 
profitable copier products plant will provide initial working capital to the 
money-losing printer business. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the printer systems unit has high-growth opportunities and will 
seek a strategic partner in the future. He said Gradco is reviewing the 
feasibility of the plan, but no definitive action will be taken before the 
company's annual meeting on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco stock closed Tuesday at $6.50, up 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement is Stewart's first counterpunch to Martin E. Tash, who as 
Gradco's biggest outside shareholder started a proxy battle to take control of 
the company's board of directors in August. Tash also filed a shareholder 
lawsuit against Stewart and top Gradco management, alleging that they tried to 
misappropriate the assets of Gradco Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Tash, chairman of Plenum Publishing Corp. in New York, and his company control 
9.4% of company stock. Tash is seeking to replace Gradco's board with his own 
slate of candidates at the annual meeting. Tash could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said it is willing to settle the suit, which the company said 
jeopardized efforts to take its copier unit public in Japan. But Gradco said 
Tash has not responded to its overtures. Tash said Friday that he would not 
negotiate a private settlement that does not affect all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported operating losses of $2.3 million on revenue of $20.3 
million in its first quarter ended June 30, largely because of the loss of its 
biggest customer, Xerox Corp. In its fiscal year ended March 31, Gradco lost 
$28.1 million on revenue of $89.5 million.

FDA APPROVES HUMAN TESTS FOR TRIMEDYNE ARTERY LASER

<P>
Trimedyne Inc. said Tuesday that it has received approval from the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration to conduct human tests on its holmium cold-laser system 
to clear clogged heart arteries as an alternative to bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin-based biotechnology company said it successfully tested the laser 
system last week at the Northern Sheffield Hospital in England. It expects to 
expand its studies to more than 10 medical centers worldwide, including 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the FDA approval gave the company's stock a boost Tuesday. The 
stock closed up 37.5 cents Tuesday, closing at $2.25 in over-the-counter 
trading. Still, Trimedyne stock is off 67% from its yearly high of $6.75 
achieved in January.

arteries, in 1987 was the first company to win FDA approval to use lasers in 
leg surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Its technology then was a "hot-tip" laser that used heat to vaporize plaque or 
fatty deposits in arteries. That hot laser, however, could damage the artery. 
</P>
<P>
Cold lasers have since been used to cut through the plaque with short bursts of 
ultraviolet light, which do not produce the heat of hot lasers. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's cold laser uses holmium, a rare metal element used to control the 
wavelengths of highly focused laser light. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said it normally takes more than two years for a 
company to test a medical device and get final approval. Trimedyne is just one 
of several companies that received FDA approval to test the cold laser for 
coronary application, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies include Irvine's Advanced International Systems Inc., 
Spectronetics Corp. of Colorado Springs and Eclipse Surgical Technologies Inc. 
of Mountain View in Santa Clara County. GV Medical Inc. of Minneapolis said it 
expects approval for similar tests later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The company hopes to use this new device to re-establish itself as a leader in 
laser angioplasty," said Chriss W. Street, managing director of Reorganized 
Securities Corp. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He added that if approved by the FDA, the device could move Trimedyne to the 
forefront of this increasingly popular method of correcting coronary artery 
problems, short of heart surgery.

GAY TRAFFIC SCHOOL FINDS NICHE IN BIG-TICKET MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: CALIFORNIA DRIVERS USE THE SESSIONS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO EXPENSIVE 
CITATIONS AND INCREASED INSURANCE RATES. AS LONG AS SCHOOLS FOLLOW THE DMV 
CURRICULUM, THEY CAN EMPHASIZE COMEDY OR LIFESTYLE TO GET THE POINTS ACROSS.

<P>
Traffic school was in session, and A.J., a former California Highway Patrol 
officer who was instructor this day, had covered several basic concepts of 
safety on the highways: driving defensively, anticipating dangerous situations, 
recognizing potential distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Next it was time to test the class members' observational powers and knowledge 
about the branches of law enforcement they are likely to encounter every day. 
</P>
<P>
"What do Highway Patrol officers' uniforms look like?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh -- hot sometimes," Peter Munneke responded quickly. "Tight and tailored. 
Those sandstone brown belts are a real turn-on." 
</P>
<P>
The other 25 students erupted with laughter on a recent Saturday morning, as 
they sat on the patio of a popular gay bar where the course is offered twice a 
month. But it was the laughter of comfortable familiarity, not the giggles of 
nervousness or derision. 
</P>
<P>
This is a typical day in gay traffic school, a new twist on an institution that 
for more than three decades has been popular with California drivers as an 
alternative to that $95 speeding ticket and the increased insurance rates that 
always accompany such vehicular transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, many privately run schools -- which most California courts 
will allow traffic violators to attend instead of paying fines -- turned to 
comedy to make this form of detention a little less painful (Lettuce Amuse You 
Comedy Schools Inc., Whee-l Make U Laff Great Comedians, Laffs R Us, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 In conducting these refresher courses in the finer points of the state Vehicle 
Code and general traffic safety, other schools tailor classes to drivers who 
are not proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, the owners of Costa Mesa-based Academy Traffic School came up with 
another target audience: gay and lesbian drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are Japanese, Spanish, French and Hebrew traffic schools," said Helene 
Lorenz, who owns and operates the school with her daughter, Beth Singer. "Last 
year Beth asked me, 'What would you think of gay traffic school?' and I thought 
it was great." 
</P>
<P>
The school, approved by the state Department of Motor Vehicles, now offers 
sessions in 10 locations, from San Diego to San Francisco. The company grosses 
about $200,000 annually and plans to open three more locations this year, 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After phasing out the driving school side of the business, Lorenz and Singer 
changed the name to Finally A Gay Traffic School. Since receiving DMV 
certification earlier this year, it is on a list of hundreds of approved 
traffic schools. 
</P>
<P>
But, Finally a Gay Traffic School is an option for county offenders only if 
they get their tickets in South County or beyond the county line. Because 
Orange County is one of three in California that has an exclusive contract with 
a single traffic school, a contract that covers most court jurisdictions, 
Central and North County courts assign eligible drivers only to that one 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Participants pay the court a fee to enroll in traffic school -- usually about 
$25 -- then pay the school itself another fee that ranges from about $20 to 
$35, depending on the school. For most, that still costs less than the fine. 
Depending on the court, though, violators may be assigned to an eight-hour 
class (the DMV's stipulated minimum) or for 12 hours of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
DMV spokesman William Gengler said that while traffic schools have been 
operating since the late 1950s in California and are used by traffic-court 
judges as a way "to lighten their court burden," it has been only since 1985 
that schools were required to be licensed by the DMV and held to a standard 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
School instructors are also individually tested and licensed by the DMV, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It does not matter how the material is presented, Gengler said, "as long as 
they are presenting the curriculum as outlined." 
</P>
<P>
At Finally A Gay Traffic School employees answer the phone innocuously enough 
("Traffic school") but, Lorenz said, callers are always told that the classes 
are aimed at gays. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be gay to attend. In fact, the Long Beach course led by A.J. 
-- like all the school's instructors, she is gay -- included a few straights 
who had selected it primarily because it was close to home. 
</P>
<P>
Men outnumbered women about 2 to 1, but Lorenz said that was less a reflection 
of its appeal to the gay community than to men generally being ticketed more 
often than women. 
</P>
<P>
Most, however, were gays and lesbians who learned about Finally A Gay Traffic 
School through its ads in the gay press, flyers distributed at gay bars, other 
businesses and at gay pride festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa, who lives just four blocks from the downtown bar where Long Beach 
sessions are held, said: "I just wanted to go somewhere close. I'm glad I got 
this one. She (A.J.) is really nice. I hear some traffic school instructors can 
be like drill sergeants." 
</P>
<P>
A drill sergeant A.J. isn't, although with her muscular build and Highway 
Patrol training, she probably could give one a run for his money. (She left the 
CHP after a traffic accident rendered her left leg unfit for duty, and has 
since been teaching traffic school.) 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she kept the atmosphere informal and, over the course of the required 
400-minute session, invited each student to give his or her name, then recite 
the offense, which led to varied stories that one would expect in traditional 
traffic school -- except that the jokes, examples and anecdotes that surfaced 
through the day were mostly oriented to the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
"I got mine for speeding. I was doing 70 on the freeway because I was talking 
to a friend about a girl I liked, and he snagged me," Sally said. 
</P>
<P>
Jokes about the arresting officers became a common source of humor throughout 
the day. "I didn't stop going around a curve, and she gave me a ticket," 
confessed a Long Beach woman who asked to be identified as Vicki. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very cute" she added, her smile turning to a frown, "but I think she 
was straight." 
</P>
<P>
Later, when A.J. introduced a third video on traffic safety, and announced, 
"This is a Marine training film," several of the men chimed in "All right!" 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the many one-liners that helped lighten the deluge of facts and 
figures, most participants said the primary appeal of the school was an 
atmosphere in which they could feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Some said previous experiences with comedy-oriented schools proved less than a 
laugh riot, so they were looking for something different this time. (California 
law allows offenders to attend traffic school, resulting in the ticket being 
purged from their driving record, just once every 18 months.) A few, however, 
said they also thought it might present an opportunity to meet new people. 
</P>
<P>
While all traffic schools must adhere to the standard DMV curriculum, the 
context in which it is presented raises issues of special interest to gay 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In a segment of sharing stories, during which the instructor stressed the 
importance of regular automobile maintenance, Peter Munneke, 59, said he had 
taken his car to a particular mechanic because "he had advertised his 
'gay-owned, gay-operated shop.' He ripped me off big." 
</P>
<P>
When asked by others in the class to identify the mechanic, Munneke demurred, 
saying, "That wouldn't be cool." 
</P>
<P>
But the others didn't let up: "If it was a straight guy, you'd tell us in a New 
York minute!" one argued. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Munneke relented and, without revealing the name, gave his 
classmates enough information so they might figure out which business it was if 
they wanted to avoid the problems he had encountered. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, many comments and reactions were exactly what you would 
expect of any audience. When Michael of San Diego announced that he had been 
cited for driving solo in a car-pool lane, he elicited the heartiest round of 
boos heard all day. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Calcetas, an insurance claims adjuster from Long Beach, said about the 
school: "I wanted to see what (the class) was like. I wanted to see how 
legitimate it was. You see a lot of gay this and gay that, but sometimes it 
just turns out that it's no good." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Lee Taylor, also of Long Beach, came to the session after learning of 
the school from Calcetas at a South Coast Chorale rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to me was the more comfortable atmosphere," Taylor 
said. "You don't have to pretend or play the straight role. It's more relaxed, 
and therefore you are more receptive to hearing what's being said."

FRAMERS' WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people, when they come face-to-face with someone famous, will be flustered 
and slightly awe-struck. What they usually carry away from that meeting, 
besides a good story to tell their friends, is an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
While autographs of famous people -- actors, actresses, athletes, politicians 
-- have particular value to the person who received it, they have become 
increasingly valuable from an investment perspective as well. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hodulik, 35, should know. He is the owner of Framers' Workshop in El Toro, 
a store where people can bring in their old autographs to be paired with a 
photograph and framed. Already paired and framed autographs are also for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Hodulik parlayed his hobby of autograph collecting into a business four years 
ago, and has seen the value of autographs escalate tremendously over the last 
few years as people realize the investment potential. 
</P>
<P>
While there are two or three other places in Orange County where autographs are 
bought and sold, Framers' Workshop is the only place Hodulik knows of that 
pairs them with photographs and frames them for display. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive piece he remembers selling consists of autographs of three 
of the Marx brothers -- Harpo, Groucho and Chico -- on which Harpo had also 
drawn a self-portrait. It fetched $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive? He said a framed James Cagney autograph with photo is 
currently being offered at $475. 
</P>
<P>
The bane of Hodulik's business is fake autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are guides for autographs available to those in the trade, and I know 
several experts I can call to find out if an autograph is authentic," he said. 
"There are obvious ways to tell, too, of course, like if you have one of 
Humphrey Bogart's on a 1980 issue of Time magazine." 
</P>
<P>
"Fakes are all over, even from the old-timers," Hodulik added. "Babe Ruth used 
to have his wife sign. Only an expert would be able to tell which is what." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates he has about 1,000 autographs in his collection, 100 of those 
framed and ready for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Each is like an individual work of art, and is treated as such," he said.

CHORALE OPENS 35TH SEASON ON AN ITALIAN NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Master Chorale of Orange County opened its 35th season Saturday night with 
two Italian-theme parties and, in between, a production of Verdi's Requiem at 
the Performing Arts Center. After the curtain dropped, about 250 chorale fans 
packed a gala at Gianni's Ristorante in the Crystal Court at South Coast Plaza 
for wine, hors d'oeuvres and dessert. Before the concert began, 73 of the 
group's most dedicated supporters met at Alfredo's Ristorante in the Westin 
South Coast Plaza hotel for cocktails and a gourmet sit-down dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Words 
</P>
<P>
Director William Hall -- whose sonorous voice is a concert in itself -- mingled 
with the dinner crowd at Alfredo's, then stepped up a few stairs from the 
sunken dining area to greet the group en masse. He praised his singers, saying, 
"I've learned that all I have to do is do the downbeat, let them come in, then 
follow them." He briefly described the accomplishments of the four "superstar" 
soloists performing with the chorale that night -- Elizabeth Biggs of the New 
Zealand Opera, Leslie Richards of the San Francisco Opera, Jonathan Welch of 
the Metropolitan Opera and Louis Lebherz of Covent Garden. Hall, beating a 
hasty retreat, exited as the risotto and tomato basil appetizers were being 
served (these were followed by a choice of entrees: grilled salmon with Italian 
salsa or spinach rotolo stuffed with seasoned chicken). "You guys enjoy the 
good food," Hall said, laughing. "I'm going to go back to my hotel room for a 
cheese sandwich and a little more preparation before the concert." 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Among the dinner guests was Donna Bunce, a frequent flier on the society 
circuit and member of the Master Chorale. "I eat, I sing, I do it all!" Bunce 
joked. Also doing it all were chorale members Gary Busby, John Rynerson, Maxine 
Trotter and Diane and Bob Guyett. Jim Hissey, a fan from Canoga Park, made the 
hour-plus drive to attend the party. Arriving from less distant points were 
county residents Jane and Philip Winsor, Linda and Joe Gatlin, Georgina and 
Stan Califf, Lois and Richard Gettys, Carol Adams, Susan Beechner, and Marcello 
Doffo. Nancy Sorosky -- a longtime resident of the Westin South Coast Plaza, 
where the dinner was held -- chaired the event. 
</P>
<P>
Quote 
</P>
<P>
When this is over, I think I'm going to run upstairs and put on a nice, 
comfortable knit dress for the concert," said Sorosky, who chose a nice, 
not-so-comfortable black crepe strapless to dine in. PAMELA MARIN

FEENEYS SAW 'SISTER MARY' AS CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS FUNDING: COSTA MESA COUPLE, PERHAPS THE PLAY'S MOST VOCIFEROUS FOES, SAY 
THEY'RE ONLY DEFENDING THEIR BELIEFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We're not activists at all," says Ernie Feeney. "We're just concerned 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that humble claim, the Feeneys -- Ernie and husband John -- have 
single-handedly pushed Costa Mesa into the national debate over censorship and 
public funding of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys have lived in Costa Mesa for 25 years, and say they have been 
active in city matters for about seven years. It is the arts issue, however, 
that suddenly has boosted them to prominence. The Feeneys, who are Catholic, 
say they are acting in defense of their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole thing with the arts has not been the obscenity issue. It has been 
the religious issue," Ernie Feeney said. "I will defend my faith." 
</P>
<P>
That pledge is what provoked the Feeneys in June to protest a flyer distributed 
by South Coast Repertory urging support of the besieged National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a copy of the flyer and they give a full-fledged, unconditional 
endorsement to the NEA," John Feeney said at the time. "In doing so, they gave 
an endorsement to things like submerging an image of Jesus Christ in vats of 
urine," a reference to the now-famous Andres Serrano photograph "Piss Christ," 
which helped set off the NEA controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The events the Feeneys set in motion culminated in the adoption of an addendum 
to the city's cultural arts grants agreements, requiring recipients to pledge 
not to use city money for "obscene matters" or "religious or political 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
John and Ernie Feeney are nothing if not organized, a fact demonstrated by 
Ernie's campaign against the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse production of 
Christopher Durang's satire, "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." 
The Feeneys have branded the play as "anti-religious bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
They are tenacious city watchdogs who -- for people who represent no 
certifiable constituency -- have developed an uncanny knack for pushing buttons 
and getting their view across at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys knew all about Durang's satire of parochial education well before 
they first got wind of the Costa Mesa production in a Sept. 6 newspaper 
listing, one day ahead of the play's opening. "Sister Mary," which debuted in 
1979, has outraged a number of Catholic activists, which resulted in a 
well-publicized 1982 controversy in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Feeney wasted little time before swinging into action. 
</P>
<P>
She got tickets for the play's opening night and invited along Jo Ellen Allen, 
a Corona del Mar resident and, more important, president of the California 
chapter of Eagle Forum, conservative columnist Phyllis Schlafly's "pro-family" 
organization. Feeney is a member of the group, which has been active in arguing 
against reauthorization of the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Feeney obtained from the city a copy of the playhouse's cultural arts grant 
application, along with a copy of the charter agreement between the city and 
playhouse and a copy of the company's 1990 season announcement -- which listed 
the comedy "Born Yesterday" as the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
By the following Monday, she had aired her views on the play in the press and 
had contacted two members of the City Council, Sandra L. Genis and Mayor Peter 
F. Buffa, who were sympathetic when the Feeneys had earlier pushed for new 
restrictions on city arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
As TV cameras rolled at Tuesday's council study session, Feeney addressed the 
council and the city arts commission, piggybacking on a scheduled report that, 
ironically, called for increased city arts spending. Feeney, flanked by Allen 
and husband John, was armed with information packets for the press and even 
brought a visual aid, a doll of "Sesame Street" character Ernie that she said 
was used to represent the Christ child in "Sister Mary." 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys, who first became active in city matters when they joined in 
complaints over noise from the Pacific Amphitheatre, attend all of the council 
meetings or watch them on cable TV. Ernie Feeney also attends each study 
session. (John Feeney is a salesman, Ernie does not work outside their home). 
</P>
<P>
Their objection to the production of "Sister Mary" stems from the fact that the 
playhouse receives city tax dollars, and they reject the argument that no city 
funds were spent directly on this production. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they need to remember that our tax money is still subsidizing them," 
Ernie Feeney said. "In essence what they're doing is making us buy a ticket to 
their production." 
</P>
<P>
The bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange added his voice to the 
Feeneys, in response to a Times editorial critical of the city's stance, by 
lambasting the play as an "unremitting travesty of Catholic ritual, tradition 
and values, with its particularly cruel caricature of Catholic sisters." Bishop 
Norman F. McFarland continued, " . . . a serious injustice is added to the 
insult when such religious bigotry is supported with tax dollars." 
</P>
<P>
While "Sister Mary" co-producer David Sharp has said that the play's 
controversial nature was not discussed during its selection, Ernie Feeney said 
she believes the play was chosen expressly to challenge the city's new arts 
grant restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I rather take it as a slap in the face. I take their whole intent as a 
challenge," she said. "They're making their statement, and they left us no 
choice but to respond to their statement."

LAGUNA MUSEUM COMPLETES FISCAL YEAR WITH SURPLUS 
</P>

<P>
For the first time since it completed a major renovation in 1986, the Laguna 
Art Museum has ended its fiscal year in the black, according to preliminary 
figures released Tuesday by museum director Charles Desmarais. 
</P>
<P>
"We're $91,453 on the plus side" for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, Desmarais 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the organization ended the year with a $72,000 deficit. The 
museum's 1990 budget is $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais said the museum held 1990 spending at roughly the same level as last 
year and attributed the financial turnaround to increased charitable 
contributions and grant support. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a result of increased excitement about the museum and where it's

one of work by media artist Ilene Segalove, another showcasing California 
Impressionism -- and to three scholarly catalogues the museum published.

"We're not entirely where I'd like us to be (financially) for the long term,"

'SISTER MARY' NO VIOLATION OF GRANT, CITY ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>

The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse did not violate a new arts-grant restriction 
barring city-funded groups from engaging in religious activity with its 
production of "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," City Atty. Thomas 
A. Kathe has determined. 
</P>
<P>
Kathe, who sent the legal opinion in a report to City Council members early 
this week, found that the city apparently has no grounds to demand repayment of 
city money from the theater company. The playhouse has received $20,000 in arts 
grants so far this year and has a $9,400 grant pending. The City Council is 
expected to address the city attorney's report at its regular meeting on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle said the council usually agrees with the city 
attorney's opinion. "In my reading of the play and reading of the Constitution, 
I think (Kathe) is probably right. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see us (overruling Kathe and) filing suit," Hornbuckle said. "That 
would certainly not be a productive use of our funds." 
</P>
<P>
The 1979 Christopher Durang play, a caustic satire about a nun who lectures 
about Catholic dogma, was denounced as "anti-Christian bigotry" by some local 
residents. Among them were John and Ernie Feeney, a couple who asked the city 
to investigate whether the production violated its new restriction against 
using city arts grants for "religious or political activity." 
</P>
<P>
"Although the choice . . . by the Playhouse is of questionable taste," Kathe 
wrote, "the use of public grant monies on a theatrical production which 
questions the value of parochial school education does not violate the 
restrictions on the use of public funds set forth in the California 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Citing legal precedence, Kathe backed his opinion by concluding that the aim of 
"Sister Mary Ignatius" is secular. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose of the production is to use satire to question the methods 
of education used in the parochial school system," Kathe wrote. "Although the 
play contains scenes that recite Catholic dogma, the theatrical purpose of 
satire would appear to negate any message of endorsement of the religious 
content by the dialogue in the play. Thus, the primary purpose of the play 
appears to be secular and not sectarian." 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the Feeneys nor the play's co-producer, Civic Playhouse board member 
David Sharp, could be reached for comment. The play, slated to run through 
Sunday, is sold out for all remaining performances, according to a box office 
official.

The last time the New York City Ballet performed at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, four years ago, Margaret Tracey and Ben Huys were among 
the newest company members. Both had made a strong impression at the School of 
American Ballet's annual workshop the previous spring and had joined NYCB 
immediately afterward. But in October, 1986, they were dancing in the furthest 
reaches of the corps, and Orange County audiences were hardly likely to single 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Tracey and Huys, both 23, arrive as soloists who have accumulated a 
considerable repertory of important roles. While a one-week engagement can give 
only a small sampling of those roles, each has some plum assignments. Tracey 
danced George Balanchine's "Tarantella" on opening night and will perform the 
featured role that Peter Martins created for her in his most recent ballet, 
"Fearful Symmetries," on Friday and Saturday nights. Huys was in the First 
Theme of Balanchine's "The Four Temperaments" on opening night and will be seen 
as the Man in Green in Jerome Robbins' "Dances at a Gathering" on Thursday and 
at the Saturday matinee. 
</P>
<P>
New York audiences have been witnessing the flowering of these two young 
talents in recent seasons as each took on demanding assignments with aplomb. 
The petite, confident Tracey has tackled bravura lead roles in Balanchine's 
"Square Dance" and "Donizetti Variations"; appeared as both the Sugar Plum 
Fairy and Dewdrop in "Nutcracker"; exerted an air of quiet mystery in Robbins' 
"Afternoon of a Faun" and Balanchine's "Ivesiana" and originated roles in 
several Martins ballets as well as Robbins' "Ives, Songs." 
</P>
<P>
Huys has demonstrated an air of quiet authority and innate elegance partnering 
leading ballerinas in "Swan Lake," "Cortege Hongrois" and "Nutcracker" and made 
an impressive debut in the lead role of the Divertimento from "Le Baiser de la 
Fee," one of Balanchine's most intricate male roles. 
</P>
<P>
Given the sizable and diverse repertory available at City Ballet, both dancers 
would seem to have an impressive array of challenges awaiting them, and both 
are likely to be prominent when the company stages its first "Sleeping Beauty" 
next spring. 
</P>
<P>
During breaks between recent rehearsals at the New York State Theater, Tracey 
and Huys each took time to look back on the route that led them to NYCB and 
their careers thus far. Both had to travel a considerable distance (in opposite 
directions) to get to New York and to overcome initial discomfort at finding 
themselves alone in the city at a very young age. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey, one of four children of a family in Pueblo, Colo. (her young sister, 
Kathleen, also is in the company), came to the NYCB-affiliated School of 
American Ballet at 15 after auditioning in Colorado. She studied there for four 
years, although she had not particularly set her sights on New York City Ballet 
before her arrival at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Huys, a native of Ghent, Belgium, who received his ballet training in Antwerp, 
had longed to join the company but been frustrated that NYCB does not hold 
auditions. His success at the Prix de Lausanne competition won him a 
scholarship to the School of American Ballet in 1985. After a year of studying 
there, he achieved his long-held goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dying to get out of Pueblo. I know that if I wanted to be a 
professional, Colorado had nothing to offer me," recalled Tracey, who received 
most of her early training from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
At the School of American Ballet, she found an especially inspiring teacher in 
Stanley Williams, the Dane whom Balanchine invited to come teach in 1964: "We 
had wonderful Friday night pointe classes with him. He has an amazing 
understanding of pointe work. And my fondest memories of the school are of 
working with him on ballets for the workshop. I like his manner. He's very 
gentle and encouraging. He gave me strength and precision and inspired a lot of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
After four years at the school, Tracey found that she took naturally to the 
Balanchine repertory upon joining the company. "You automatically feel 
comfortable when you step into his pieces," she said. "They're amazing. They 
just seem to work, musically and physically." 
</P>
<P>
Huys' first months at the school were frustrating ones. His Soviet-based early 
training was at odds with the speed and attack emphasized there, and his early 
memories of Williams are of being repeatedly told, "That's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Huys was ready to head back to Europe but was persuaded to stick it out and 
soon found things going more smoothly. "They started rehearsing for the 
workshop, and I was cast in 'Cortege Hongrois,' (Bournonville's) 
'Konservatoriet' and a new pas de deux by Peter Martins," he said. "All of a 
sudden, I got inspired. I had a great foundation from my studies in Antwerp, 
but I had to adjust and learn. I'm still learning. It was very difficult: The 
musicality is different; you use different muscles; I got injured. Now I've 
found my own way of working, so I haven't had so many injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Quiet and reflective in conversation, Huys demonstrated assertiveness when he 
took matters into his own hands in gaining his first prominent role. After two 
years in the company, "nothing was happening," he said. "I started to rehearse 
the 'Nutcracker' pas de deux on my own, and I asked Peter (Martins) to come 
look at it. He watched and said, 'Great,' and put me on. I don't know if they 
ever would have put me out there that year. Sometimes you have to do it 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Both dancers have known the challenge of learning and performing a role within 
a matter of days, as well as the luxury of having lengthy preparation. Tracey 
learned "Square Dance" in four days. "At first I didn't think I could actually 
do it, but I was extremely busy that season, so I didn't have time to think 
about it, which was a blessing. If I'd had had two or three weeks to brood over 
it, I could have psyched myself out of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Robbins, known for the meticulousness of his rehearsals, worked 
daily with Tracey and Jeffrey Edwards for two weeks before their debuts in 
"Faun." 
</P>
<P>
Huys had a similarly intensive process with Robbins when "Dances at a 
Gathering" was revived last spring. "He started two months before we did it. . 
. . He talked about the quality of dancing together, something he said the 
ballet had lost over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Tracey received some coaching from the source on "Tarantella" when she asked 
Patricia McBride, the longtime NYCB ballerina on whom Balanchine had 
choreographed the 1964 ballet, to make suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rehearsing it for Patty's special retirement performance, and I saw her 
walk by. I asked her if there were things she'd like to change. I really wanted 
her to be happy with the way I did it. She fixed little things, and the way she 
fixed it at that rehearsal is the way I've left it, and I won't touch it 
because I feel that's my small way of honoring Patty. I also learned a lot from 
watching tapes of her dancing the role. She just had so much fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
Tracey and Huys are part of the new generation, who never knew Balanchine in 
any personal way and are now entrusted with his ballets. Both dancers seem to 
recognize the significance and uniqueness of this legacy and of the extensive 
challenges the NYCB repertory holds for them. 
</P>
<P>
Each also is out to break some molds, as well. Huys said he is concerned that 
he not be "stereotyped as a danseur noble. I would like to do as many different 
kinds of roles as I can. Otherwise, you don't develop into a complete dancer." 
</P>
<P>
He has his eye on several of Balanchine's knottier Stravinsky ballets, such as 
"Agon" and "Duo Concertante." 
</P>
<P>
Tracey mentioned "Stravinsky Violin Concerto" as a ballet others might not 
picture her in but that she hopes to try. She also hopes to find her way into 
repertory traditionally considered the property of "tall girls" -- something 
she already has done with her roles in "Square Dance" and "Donizetti," which 
mostly have been the domain of such tall ballerinas as Merrill Ashley and Kyra 
Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
Without ever working with Balanchine, Tracey has acquired one of the primary 
traits associated with his dancers -- a boldness and energy on stage, a 
willingness to take chances and give a little extra. "I don't know how to hold 
back on stage," she said. "If I did, I'd feel I was cheating not only myself 
but also the audience, and I wouldn't have as much fun." 
</P>

STATWATCH: CRUSADERS FORCED TO GO EXTRA YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Village Christian High tied a school record for first downs in a 21-13 loss to 
Murphy, but the circumstances could have been better for the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
They were forced to gamble when the team's only long snapper, Billy Rust, 
suffered an ankle injury early in the third quarter. Coach Mike Plaisance, not 
wanting to risk special-teams turnovers, forsook the punt six times on 
fourth-down situations in the second half. Village Christian got the first down 
five times and made 19 overall to tie the record set at Santa Fe Christian in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Special teams: Kennedy kicker Keith West booted a school-record 50-yard field 
goal in Kennedy's 36-0 defeat of Franklin last week. West, an All-City Section 
soccer player, easily bettered the old mark of 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been good from 57 yards, easy," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said. 
"It landed halfway across the track and cleared the uprights." 
</P>
<P>
Beginnings: Royal, which has matched its school record (set in 1969 and first 
equaled in '75) with its 3-0 start, has outscored its opponents, 94-13. . . . 
Grant is 2-0 behind a strong defense. The Lancers have picked off four passes, 
including two by Hillsdale Hufanga. Grant has allowed an average of 32 yards 
rushing. . . . If nothing else, Verdugo Hills (0-2) is showing consistency. The 
Dons gained four yards total offense in each of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Kennedy linebacker Damon Tice has 18 solo tackles and has caused two 
fumbles in two games. . . . San Fernando defensive back Amon Flanagan, a 
sophomore, has 5 1/2 sacks in two games. . . . Cornell Hill, a senior defensive 
back at Taft, made eight solo tackles and recorded two sacks in a 28-0 defeat 
of Hamilton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Streaks: Birmingham, which will play Reseda on Thursday in a battle for Victory 
Boulevard bragging rights, has not defeated the Regents since 1979. Reseda is 
12-0-1 against Birmingham over that span. 
</P>
<P>
Passing: Westlake's Todd Preston attempted 51 passes this season before he 
threw an interception Thursday against Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley attempted just one pass in its 17-16 win over Redlands. The 
ground-oriented Antelopes have thrown the ball just 18 times in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Ends: Rio Mesa's Jamie Liddell (seven receptions for 214 yards) is averaging 
more than 30 yards a catch. . . . Westlake's Erik Holcomb (nine receptions for 
220 yards) is averaging more than 23 yards a catch.

Virginia was en route to a 59-0 victory Saturday when the name of its opponent 
disappeared from the scoreboard. Instead, "????" appeared in place of "Duke." 
</P>
<P>
Bottom Ten voters were left in a quandary. Was it a malfunction? A prank? Or 
had some team other than Duke really been on the field? The Indianapolis Dolts, 
for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, we've signaled to the instant replay booth for a decision, which should 
be forthcoming any moment. In the meantime, "????" has been ranked No. 1. For 
now, we'll call the mystery team the Who Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Alabumble, meanwhile, fell to 0-3 for the first time since 1956, when it was 
coached by J.B. (Ears) Whitworth, who is in the Great Nicknames Hall of Fame. 
Whatever happened to those bumper stickers that said, "It's hard to be humble 
when you're from 'Bama"?

QUOTEBOOK: Kathleen Bober-Sorcinelli of New Haven, Conn., on last year's 
Yale-Connecticut pregame bash, which led to this year's ban on tailgating 
parties: "By mid-morning, it was absolute bedlam. There were intoxicated fans 
urinating into neighboring yards, tossing beer cans into yards -- literally 
dropping their drawers in front of neighborhood children." 
</P>
<P>
HE KNOWS WE HAVE WAYS OF MAKING HIM TALK: Michigan State Coach George Perles, 
asked if he felt bad about the last-minute Notre Dame victory: "If I did, no 
one's going to know it. You can have me tied up against the wall and have whips 
and slingshots and all that, but never, never, never, is anybody going to get 
anything negative." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
Many Aints fans, responding to a plea by radio station WMXZ, had vowed to 
abstain from sex until New Orleans scored a touchdown. The team finally got one 
Sunday, late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
So, the stands were mostly empty for the rest of the game as the Aints dropped 
from the ranks of the winless. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Pitt is the only NFL team whose offense has yet to make it into the end 
zone. Come on Steeler fans! It's your turn to take a vow of chastity -- at 
least until Coach Chuck Noll abandons the team's new, complicated offense. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Philadelphia receivers out-leaped Ram defenders all day in a 27-21 
victory. It's now clear why the Eagles' Buddy Ryan said the Rams had a "junior 
high school defense." He only meant that their defensive backs, who average 
under 6-0 in height, are junior high school-size.

A vandal who flipped a switch on a train track apparently caused two 
locomotives and two boxcars carrying thousands of rounds of artillery shells to 
derail Tuesday night in Westminster, railroad officials said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Pacific train, called the Huntington Beach Switcher, was at the 
crossing at Hoover Street about two miles from Seal Beach Naval Weapons 
Station, heading toward Anaheim, when the locomotives and cars slipped off the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"All the cars were upright, although some were leaning. None of the ammunition 
was damaged in any way," said Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland. "There 
were no detonators aboard, so there was no real risk of explosion. No railroad 
carries live stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster officials were close to evacuating about 1,000 people in the area, 
including a nearby hospital and several retirement homes, after the 6:35 p.m. 
accident. But they decided against the precaution when naval ordnance experts 
determined the cargo was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the two derailed cars were 2-foot long, 5-inch diameter, 38-caliber 
shells, which are shot from guns aboard battleships. 
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the two stranded but undamaged boxcars were towed back to 
the Seal Beach station, where the ammunition was to be stored until it can be 
shipped out again. 
</P>
<P>
By dawn today, about 15 green-helmeted Southern Pacific workers were repairing 
300 feet of twisted rails and torn railway ties at Westminster Boulevard and 
Hoover Street. Using a crane-like device, they hoisted the damaged rail and 
pulled broken ties from underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific road master Larry Magathan, who was supervising the repairs, 
said new rails and ties were on the way. He predicted that the rails would be 
repaired by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we think it is vandalism," said Bill Currier, a superintendent with 
Southern Pacific. "We think they tampered with a switch."

<P>
An 87-year-old West Los Angeles woman was killed and five other motorists 
injured when a car plowed into a line of cars stopped on a rural road in the 
Antelope Valley for a film shooting, the California Highway Patrol reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Poston was fatally injured about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday on the Pearblossom 
Highway at 180th Street East in Llano, CHP Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said CHP officers had stopped traffic on the two-lane road in an 
undeveloped area while a film crew photographed the region. There were "Men 
Working" signs alongside the roadway, a CHP car was stopped at the scene with 
its emergency lights on and officers were out of the car directing traffic to 
stop, Siordia said. The film crew had a Caltrans permit to film in the area, 
the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 westbound cars were stopped in a line on the road when a car going 
about 50 m.p.h. and driven by Penny Stone, 27, of Apple Valley, smashed into 
the rear of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Stone and her passenger, Courtney Stone, suffered moderate injuries. Her car 
hit a car driven by Robert Preston, 67, of Sedona, Ariz., and carrying his 
wife, Shirley, and Poston, who was in the back seat. The Prestons suffered 
moderate injuries and Poston was fatally injured. 
</P>
<P>
Preston's car was pushed into the car in front of it. The driver of that car, 
Warren Tonuy, 35, of Palmdale, suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The injured were treated by paramedics and at local hospitals. Siordia said 
Penny Stone will be charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter.

3 JETS LAND; IRAQ EXTENDS RATIONING

Three Iraqi passenger planes touched down today in Jordan, raising questions 
about Jordan's support for the new U.N. embargo on Iraqi air traffic. But 
Jordan later said it would halt all flights to and from Iraq to comply with the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq bitterly attacked its former ally the Soviet Union today and said Arabs 
would not be friendly toward a country in "the alliance of American hostility." 
</P>
<P>
And in a sign that the sanctions are hurting Iraqis, Baghdad also announced 
that it would extend rationing to rice, flour and cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers aboard the three regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways planes 
landing in Amman included nine expelled French diplomats and 11 Britons 
stranded during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. It was not known what 
their cargo holds contained. The planes all returned to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jordanian officials said the passenger aircraft were not included 
in the embargo resolution passed Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Kasim said today that Jordan will 
comply fully with the embargo and halt passenger flights to and from Iraq, 
including freedom flights for Westerners stranded in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan has continued to allow a minimum number of flights by the Iraqi 
Airways, due to humanitarian considerations, facilitating the movement of 
foreign nationals from Iraq and Kuwait," he said in a statement at U.N. 
headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"However, those flights will now be terminated in accordance with (the air 
embargo)," said Kasim, who is also the deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution does not mention passenger planes but says all planes 
traveling to and from Iraq should be checked to make sure they are not carrying 
cargo prohibited by the U.N. trade sanctions. The resolution prohibits the use 
of force to stop planes, but allows for the detention of aircraft. 
</P>

The tirade against the Soviet Union by the official Iraqi News Agency was in 
response to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's speech Tuesday to 
the United Nations condemning the invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The news said the tone of the speech by Shevardnadze "clearly shows the bribe 
given by America and its allies the oil sheiks."

Iraqi officials announced that the new food rationing will begin this weekend. 
Trade and Finance Minister Mohammed Mahdi Saleh said sugar and tea will also be 
affected by the new restrictions. The government already closed fast-food 
restaurants and many pastry shops because they use large amounts of sugar.

SOVIETS PASS LAW BANNING RELIGIOUS REPRESSION

<P>
The Soviet legislature formally ended decades of religious repression today, 
passing a law on freedom of religion at a time when Soviets are flocking to 
churches in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people suffered to get this law," said Mikhail Kulakov, a leader of the 
Soviet Union's Seventh-day Adventists, who have been persecuted for evangelical 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The law forbids the government from interfering with religious activities, 
improves the legal status of religious organizations and gives Soviet citizens 
the right to study religion in homes and in private schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet constitution has long guaranteed freedom of worship, but in the past 
the Communist Party's ideological opposition to religion as the "opiate of the 
masses" made that guarantee hollow. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the government discouraged religious services, closed churches and 
synagogues, imprisoned religious leaders and preached atheism. 
</P>
<P>
But official tolerance for religion has increased since President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev came to power in 1985. Gorbachev's mother is a practicing member of 
the Russian Orthodox Church, and last year he acknowledged that he was baptized 
as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Gorbachev held talks with the head of the Russian Orthodox 
Church, the first such meeting in more than 40 years. In December, he met Pope 
John Paul II at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which passed 341 to 1 with one abstention, says the government 
will not "restrict the study, financing or propagandizing" of religion. It was 
not a roll call vote and the identity of the person who abstained was not 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Atheism remains the doctrine of the Communist Party, but the law prohibits the 
government from funding either religious activities or atheist propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
It allows religious groups to set up societies and send people abroad for 
spiritual study. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, religious organizations had no clear legal standing and were 
unable to make contracts or represent themselves in court. Under the new law, 
they have the same status as individual citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But a clause allowing public schools to be used for religious classes after 
regular hours set off a fierce debate and was defeated by one chamber of the 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Western experts estimate that a quarter of the 285 million Soviet people 
practice religion.

BUSH MAY DEAL ON CAPITAL GAINS CUTS, LAWMAKERS SAY

<P>
President Bush may be willing to compromise on his call for a capital gains tax 
cut, the main sticking point in talks to slash the federal deficit, Republican 
members of Congress who met with the President said today. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reducing the rate on capital gains taxes, Bush might accept other 
incentives to economic growth, the lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
"He might be willing to look at alternatives in the growth area," said Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), as he and other GOP lawmakers left the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush and GOP lawmakers warned that without Democratic concessions at 
ongoing budget talks, no deal would be reached in time to avoid $85 billion in 
federal spending cuts that the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will impose 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, at a political fund-raiser today in Akron, Ohio, criticized congressional 
Democrats, saying, "It's their fault for holding up getting a budget 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to press hard for incentives for capital investment," Bush 
said. However, he did not further discuss his longstanding insistence on a 
capital gains tax reduction as part of any budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the No. 2 House Republican, said the incentives 
Bush might be willing to accept include tax breaks for businesses to encourage 
research and investment, and a proposal to establish so-called enterprise 
zones. The zones would provide tax breaks for businesses in poor urban and 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"While he's going to be very flexible and he's willing to look at a Democratic 
offer, he wants part of this final agreement to be a growth package," Gingrich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's willing to negotiate every item that's been advanced," said Sen. Thad 
Cochran (R-Miss.) when asked if Bush was now ready to bargain on the question 
of capital gains.

AMERICANS' MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME INCHES UP 1.3% IN '89

<P>
Americans' median household income rose 1.3% in 1989, after adjusting for the 
rise in consumer prices, the Census Bureau reported today. The increase 
followed two years in which income had been unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
In a report based on a survey of 58,000 U.S. households in March, the bureau 
also reported that the nation's poverty rate last year was 12.8%, about the 
same as in 1988. That means 31.5 million Americans were living in poverty in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate has declined since 1983 but remains higher than it was in 
1978, the recent low point, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The median income for all households was $28,910. 
</P>
<P>
Black household income was up 5% to $18,080, but Latino and white median 
incomes were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The median earnings of all women working full time increased 1.8% to $18,780, 
while the earnings of men decreased by the same percentage to $27,430.

DURABLE GOODS FALL; INCOMES UP SLIGHTLY

Orders to U.S. factories for "big-ticket" durable goods dropped 0.8% in August, 
continuing the flat performance that has gone on for 18 months, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said personal incomes advanced 
just 0.3% in August, the slowest pace in four months, while consumer spending 
rose 0.5%, the lowest in three months. 
</P>
<P>
The department reported that orders for durable goods -- items expected to last 
more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $127 billion following a 
revised 2.7% gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
But excluding defense and transportation, overall orders would have fallen 
more. Without either category, orders would have dropped 1.6%, the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers pretty much show that the economy has few vital signs left," 
said Jean Sundrla, an analyst at Evans Economics in Washington. "The new orders 
in defense did really save the day for the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Sustained weakness in durable goods usually precedes a recession and right now 
the economy is very vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Robert Dieli, an economist at Northern Trust, called the report "a 
trifle weak" but not enough to "make you say 'It's time to head to the storm 
cellar.' " 
</P>
<P>
Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, often a barometer of 
business plans to expand and modernize, plunged 11.2% to $35.4 billion after 
gaining 10.1% in July. Excluding aircraft orders, the drop would have been only 
4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The often-volatile defense category jumped 12.4% to $8.4 billion, following a 
5.6% decline in July. 
</P>
<P>
Dieli said he "wouldn't tie a great deal of" the military spending to the 
Persian Gulf crisis, but added that there's "no doubt" some of it was reflected 
in the latest data. He also said he expects more crisis-related military 
spending "down the road." 
</P>
<P>
A market letter by Fuji Securities in Chicago noted: "Durable goods orders have 
chopped back and forth over a year and a half without achieving any significant 
net growth." 
</P>
<P>
In its other report, the government said personal incomes totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $4.68 trillion, a $13-billion increase over July. It 
was the smallest increase since a 0.2% gain last April. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the department said spending totaled $3.69 trillion, up $16.7 
billion from a month earlier. It was the smallest advance since last May, when 
spending was unchanged from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, consumer spending in August topped the 0.2% gain at an annual 
rate posted in the second quarter gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health since it 
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.

An assistant restaurant manager fed up with hordes of teen-agers at her Pizza 
Hut locked the doors and collected $1 each from youths unaccompanied by adults, 
but the national chain ended the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Gamlin, manager of the Pizza Hut in Baden, about 15 miles northwest of 
Pittsburgh, said her assistant instituted the cover charge because unruly teens 
were disrupting the eatery after football games and high school dances. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think a dollar was too much to ask from kids who destroy our dining 
room every Friday night," Gamlin said. "The kids dump the salt and pepper 
shakers, only order bread sticks and water, try to bring in food from 
McDonald's, don't wait to be seated and then complain about not having a 
waitress." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rydell, a spokesman at the chain's Wichita, Kan., headquarters, said it 
was wrong to collect the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no cover charges at Pizza Hut," he said.

The largest internally flawless diamond to be auctioned will be put on sale in 
Geneva on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
David Bennett, director of Sotheby's jewelry department, told a news conference 
today that the 101.84-carat stone could fetch about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
The pear-shaped stone is 1.43 inches long and was certified by the Gemological 
Institute of America as D color. In a white diamond, this is the highest 
possible classification, denoting a total absence of color. "It is an extremely 
rare feature in a diamond of this size," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
It also has a purity grading known as "internally flawless," which is important 
because the presence of inclusions or other natural features within a stone can 
impair its brilliance.

Prosecutors seeking a stiff prison term for Michael Milken released their

on the convicted financier's "sweeping and serious crimes."

The 200-page memorandum to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood exhorted her to 
pay scant attention to Milken's good deeds and consider evidence that he was a 
systematic crook.

"The court's sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess great wealth 
and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or their money will insulate 
them from certain and serious punishment," said the document.

Milken, the most celebrated defendant in the securities fraud scandals that

WEST SAYS MAGIC TOOK PAY CUT SO LAKERS COULD ACQUIRE TEAGLE

<P>
Magic Johnson voluntarily surrendered part of his salary so the Lakers could 
acquire Terry Teagle from the Golden State Warriors, General Manager Jerry West 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing we needed another first-rate player, Magic came to me several weeks 
ago and offered to give up part of his salary if we needed room under the 
salary cap to get a player we wanted," West said in a statement released today. 
</P>
<P>
West said the Lakers couldn't have made the trade without Johnson's help. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have enough money under the cap to pick up Terry's contract without 
Magic giving up a substantial amount of his own salary," West said. 
</P>
<P>
"You read so much these days about renegotiations and holdouts, it is important 
that fans know of Magic's unselfishness. In my mind, it is further proof that 
he is the ultimate team player." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money Johnson relinquished was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who won his third NBA Most Valuable Player award last season, said he 
was willing to give up a substantial sum of his salary because winning is more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about winning," Johnson said. "Of course money is great, but I play to 
win and that's why I did it."

Police officers lacked a firm identification of an alleged bank robber when 
they drew their guns on Boston Celtics rookie Dee Brown last week, according to 
transcripts of police tapes released today. 
</P>
<P>
In releasing the tapes police admitted they took their action based on a shaky 
description given by a bank manager who said she saw Brown. They also said 
South Shore Bank Manager Sharlene Harris had never seen the actual bank robbery 
suspect, despite earlier police statements to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Donald Whalen, in charge of investigating the incident, said Brown was 
first spotted by a clerk at the bank who had seen the actual robbery suspect. 
The clerk then pointed out Brown to Harris, who phoned police, Whalen said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris offered a tentative identification of the suspect when she called police 
after spotting Brown in his car last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But when Police Sgt. Robert Meaney relayed the message to officers heading to 
the scene, he told them the bank manager and another employee "have pretty much 
confirmed" Brown as the man who robbed the bank Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is black, was with his girlfriend, Jill Edmondson, when five police 
officers drew their guns, ordered him from his car and forced him to lie on the 
pavement until his identity was established. 
</P>
<P>
Harris told a police dispatcher in a taped phone conversation between the two: 
"We just spotted a black man across the street coming out of the post office 
and it looks strangely like the man that was in our office." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks very much like him. We're not positive. . . . We're across the 
street," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the incident, at least 500 Wellesley residents signed a 
letter apologizing to Brown. The letter also said the signers "will do 
everything we can to assure that such harassment will never happen again in our 
town." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's Board of Selectmen's hearing, black residents complained of police 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Selectmen took the matter under advisement, and the board's executive 
secretary, Thomas Lee, said there may be further discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"The comments (Monday) were not limited to the Brown issue, so we have to sift 
out and see if we have some type of problem here," Lee said.

"Like General MacArthur, I shall return," New York Yankees broadcaster Phil 
Rizzuto said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear after Tuesday's game between the Yankees and the Baltimore 
Orioles whether Rizzuto, who often shouts "Holy Cow" at crucial moments of 
games, would be back at the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto, who celebrated his 73rd birthday Tuesday, has been in the broadcast 
booth for 34 years, but that may end after this season if WPIX-TV is unable to 
purchase the rights to broadcast any of the Yankees' 1991 games from the 
Madison Square Garden cable network. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a terrible feeling right now," said Rizzuto, known as "Scooter," in a 
story in today's editions of the New York Post. "I'm not an emotional guy, but 
today, thinking about all of this, I had tears in my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years have gone by and I can't believe there's a chance I won't be 
coming here any more," said Rizzuto, who joined the Yankees as a shortstop in 
1941. "It's kind of frightening."

Blacks are more likely than whites to be barred from playing high school 
football in Florida because of failure to meet academic standards, a University 
of Florida study has found. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven percent of the state's high school students who failed to get high 
enough grades to play football were black, even though they represent only 
about 37% of all varsity football players, said Michael Ryan, a sports and 
fitness instructor at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 858 of 11,479 varsity athletes failed to get the minimum 1.5 
grade-point average required to play football. Of those who didn't meet the 
standards, 489 were black, 289 were white, 76 were Latino and four were other 
ethnic groups, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's research is based on a survey of 76%, or 254 of the state's 334 high 
school varsity football coaches.

AFTER '89, WARY BEARS HOPE THEIR WINNING RECIPE WON'T SPOIL

Mixing pride with advancing age is the sporting world's recipe for a Molotov 
cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
The return of the Bears' punishing defense to the top of the NFL heap may be 
one of the young season's most welcome surprises, but it also could be one of 
the most short lived. So enjoy it while it lasts. This thing could blow up as 
early as Sunday, when the Bears play another 3-0 team with a strong defense, 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," said Mike Singletary, the intense but soft-spoken defensive 
captain and middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"But we won our first four games last year," he added, "and about the time 
everybody started talking about the Super Bowl, we got hammered by Tampa Bay 
and Houston back to back." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, with irascible Buddy Ryan commanding the troops, the Bears' defense 
revolutionized football. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, while almost 
every other club spent its highest picks on draft day gambling on offensive 
weapons, the Bears kept accumulating defensive gems. 
</P>
<P>
It began in 1979 with the selection of Dan Hampton and Al Harris and stretched 
through the selection of William (Refrigerator) Perry in 1985. The Bears 
stocked the team with enough back-breakers over that stretch -- Otis Wilson, 
Singletary, Todd Bell, Dave Duerson, Richard Dent, Wilber Marshall and Shaun 
Gayle -- to win the Super Bowl in January, 1986, and terrorize opponents long 
after the rest of their game would not have scared some college teams. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, so strong was the core left behind when Ryan took his scorched-earth 
philosophy to Philadelphia, that the steamroller kept going with the same 
brutal efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago started 1989 by going 4-0 -- and then Hampton, an 11-year-veteran, went 
down for his ninth and 10th knee operations. With him went the pass rush and 
just about everything and anything that could have salvaged the season. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was long gone, via the free-agent express to Washington, and Wilson 
was derailed for good because of a bad knee. Harris and Bell had already joined 
Ryan in Philly. Perry could not push himself away from the table or past most 
blockers, and line mate Dent, playing with a string of nagging injuries, was 
chasing him up the scale. 
</P>
<P>
Although Singletary and Steve McMichael performed credibly last season, there 
was little they could do to fill all the gaping holes on the field -- and even 
less to offset the psychological damage Coach Mike Ditka inflicted on the 
handful of promising youngsters with his tirade of the week. Chicago slid to 
6-10, and the team's defensive ranking dropped from No. 2 in 1988 to No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the problems hurt team morale, Singletary smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew," he said. "But I'll say this -- if you've never been there with 
Mike, haven't seen the way he does things for a little while, how in the world 
would you know what to expect or what to make of it?" 
</P>
<P>
It is safe to say that no one expected Ditka to be this mellow by this juncture 
of the season -- nor the Bears to be this good. 
</P>
<P>
In three games, the team has one shutout, has surrendered just two touchdowns, 
one the result of an interception, collected 11 sacks, forced the same number 
of fumbles and intercepted seven passes. In the bargain, the Bears' defense has 
proved that the precipitous drop in performance last year was in large part the 
result of injuries and inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to be reminded that the numbers have come against three teams with 
just two wins between them and that the players who provide much of the heart 
and most of the soul on the unit -- Singletary (almost 32), Hampton (33) and 
McMichael (three weeks shy of 33) -- already are playing on borrowed time. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to see our record and figure the defense is behind it. But 
the real reason," Singletary said, "is that the offense is keeping us off the 
field."

COMISKEY PARK HEADS INTO FINAL INNING; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER SUNDAY'S GAME, THE NEXT BALL IN THE OLDEST STADIUM IN THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES WILL BE THE WRECKING BALL.

<P>
At 80 years, Comiskey Park is the oldest major-league ballpark and the only one 
remaining where Cy Young pitched. It is where Babe Ruth homered to win the 
first All-Star game and Bob Feller pitched the only opening day no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Cherish such memories, though, because after Sunday's game between the Seattle 
Mariners and the Chicago White Sox, the next ball seen in Comiskey Park will be 
a wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
The "Baseball Palace of the World," as it was touted when built at the corner 
of Shields Avenue and 35th Street in 1910, will be razed next month. 
</P>
<P>
A new Comiskey Park -- across 35th Street -- will be completed for next season. 
The original will be a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first black to play with the White Sox in 1951," Minnie Minoso said. 
"I hit a homer on the first pitch off the Yankees' Vic Raschi. From the first 
day, the fans were great. Friendship is like a glass. You have to polish and 
protect it or it will be shattered. I'll always think of Comiskey that way, 
even after it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Comiskey Park is one of the great cathedrals of baseball, one of a class that 
has dwindled to a precious few. Fenway Park in Boston, Tiger Stadium in Detroit 
and Wrigley Field in Chicago's North Side are the only remaining major-league 
parks built before World War I. 
</P>
<P>
With Comiskey Park's demise, there will be one fewer link -- like Ebbets Field, 
the Polo Grounds, Sportsman's Park, Connie Mack Stadium and Forbes Field -- to 
baseball's generations, one less place where history resonates. 
</P>
<P>
Comiskey Park is not revered like Fenway Park with its Green Monster, and it's 
not charming like Wrigley Field with its ivy-covered outfield wall. 
</P>
<P>
Comiskey Park is a lunch-pail place, in the South Side. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one iron girders obstruct the views of fans. The park's electrical, 
television, radio, water and life-support systems are an exposed web of 
grime-layered membranes hanging from the ceilings. Paint is peeling. Water 
seeps through cracks in the five levels of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
These furrows reveal Comiskey's age. 
</P>
<P>
Look beyond these lines to appreciate its uniqueness: The shower and barber 
chair: Both are in the center-field bleachers. Pull the chain and get cooling 
relief on a scorching day. Or sit and get a shave and haircut while watching 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
The center-field scoreboard: Fireworks and smoke spew from the scoreboard and 
nine pinwheels whirl after each White Sox homer. In answer to the fireworks in 
the early 1960s, New York Yankees' Manager Casey Stengel often would light and 
wave sparklers in the dugout after a Yankees' homer. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard, built in 1960 under the direction of colorful owner Bill Veeck, 
probably will be donated to, or purchased by, a university or college. One of 
the reported candidates is Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The clubhouse: "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, Ted Lyons, Luis Aparicio and Billy 
Pierce dressed in the closet-like White Sox side. And in the even-smaller 
visiting clubhouse, Ruth, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Reggie Jackson and Walter 
Johnson laced up their spikes. 
</P>
<P>
The spacious dimensions: Originally, the fence was 363 feet down the lines and 
420 to center. Today it is 347 down each line -- the longest in the American 
League -- and 409 to center. 
</P>
<P>
Minoso looked from the White Sox dugout and said, "You'll always have memories, 
but it's time. It's time for a new park." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers say Comiskey is ready to totter. No major park renovations can be 
done because it is not structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
Home plate, the bases and other prized objects will be placed in the White Sox 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"Each player is supposed to get a few seats," infielder Steve Lyons says. "I'll 
never give them up. I'll pass them on to my children." 
</P>
<P>
The new Comiskey, which rises above its predescessor, will be a baseball-only 
grass-field park that will seat 43,000. It will have a new scoreboard in center 
field. And yes, it will be an exploding one.

Nichelle Nichols says she wasn't particularly interested when her friend Gene 
Roddenberry insisted that she audition for a part in his new science fiction 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Nichols considers "Star Trek" to be "just an interruption in my 
singing career, a nice interlude." 
</P>
<P>
Still, though Nichols is best known for her role as Lt. Uhura, she has never 
abandoned her musical career. Her one-woman show, "Reflections," pays tribute 
to musical legends. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, born in Chicago in 1936, was discovered by Duke Ellington, toured with 
Lionel Hampton and danced with Sammy Davis Jr. Eventually, she was playing 
successful engagements in European nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
Next thing she knew, she was decoding subspace communiques from Starfleet 
Command. 
</P>
<P>
But Trekkies need not fear. She and the old Enterprise crew "are still family," 
she says, and she is looking forward to "Star Trek VI."

'IDOMENEO' ACCORDING TO SENDAK AND CORSARO

<P>
Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
The wonders of a great opera are compromised by the gimmickry of a meddlesome 
director and designer. The problem becomes especially irksome when the music is 
sensitively conducted, exquisitely sung and elegantly played. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for sad example, Mozart's "Idomeneo" as staged by Frank Corsaro, 
illustrated by Maurice Sendak and conducted by Roderick Brydon for the Music 
Center Opera on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If our records are accurate, Los Angeles had never before seen a major staging 
of the lofty opera seria. Los Angeles still hasn't seen a faithful 
representation of this stylized exploration of jealousy, devotion, heroism and 
renunciation on the island of Crete in the wake of the Trojan War. 
</P>
<P>
Corsaro decided that the idiom needed to be juiced up. Forget classic nobility. 
Let's have a psychosexual charade. 
</P>
<P>
Idomeneo, the king of Crete, was really Leopold Mozart, the composer's 
overbearing father. That was Corsaro's irrelevant concept. Idamante, the 
troubled prince, was really Mozart himself. The opera, we were told, really 
concerns the complex love-hate relationship between the paternal despot and the 
youthful pretender to his aesthetic throne. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone loves Maurice Sendak. He is a master of dark-edged humor, and his 
magical images cast their spell far beyond children's books. With "Idomeneo," 
however, he seems to have strayed into the wrong scenic milieu. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, this "Idomeneo" is best appreciated with eyes closed. Roderick 
Brydon, who has replaced the originally scheduled Christof Perick, conducts 
with tender, lyrical, reasonably stylish care. The cast functioned as an 
ensemble of virtuosos. Siegfried Jerusalem, the most celebrated Wagnerian tenor 
of the day, brought manly dignity, ample agility, dynamic finesse and burnished 
tone -- some passing pitch problems notwithstanding -- to the title role. Susan 
Quittmeyer complemented him -- and Corsaro's directorial conceit, too -- as an 
Idamante of tremendous suavity and sensitivity. She has become a trouser-role 
specialist with few peers. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Coburn looked a bit robust for the sweet-ingenue platitudes of Ilia, but 
she sang with limpid, angelic tone. Although her soprano isn't as dark or as 
heavy as cliche might have it in this evil role, Christine Weidinger swept all 
before her with an Elettra of galvanizing passion and stunning vocal bravura.

A defense attorney described Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photos in 
detail to gauge the reactions of prospective jurors at the nation's first 
obscenity trial of an art gallery and its director. 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie are charged with 
obscenity and displaying nude photos of children at a Mapplethorpe exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers today rejected a prospective juror as jury selection moved into 
the third day. Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, used a peremptory challenge 
to remove a retiree, who he said was not adequately familiar with the 
community's contemporary social standards. 
</P>
<P>
Eight jurors and two alternates are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, prosecutors used one of their peremptory challenges to dismiss a 
prospective juror who viewed the Mapplethorpe photo exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 175 photos from the exhibit are the basis for the criminal 
charges. One photo shows a man urinating into another man's mouth. Others show 
anal penetration with objects and other homosexual or sadomasochistic images. 
</P>
<P>
After describing the seven photographs in detail, lawyer H. Louis Sirkin asked 
several prospective jurors, "Are you willing to see those photographs before 
making a decision as to whether any of them is obscene?" 
</P>
<P>
All answered that they were willing. 
</P>
<P>
Sirkin said later that he didn't describe the photographs for shock value, 
although he was interested in seeing the potential jurors' reaction. 
</P>
<P>
He did not say what he believed the reactions were. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury is entitled to know what the photographs show," Sirkin said. "If 
they're going to see them, they have a right to know what's in them."
