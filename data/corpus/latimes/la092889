NEWSMAKERS: SHOPPING CHILD'S PLAY TO YELTSIN

Contrary to published reports, Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist Party maverick 
who recently visited the United States on a speaking tour, did not shop till he 
dropped, an aide said. The total of Yeltsin's bourgeois purchases, in fact, was 
a toy pistol and two calculators for his grandchildren for the sum of $24, the 
aide, P. Voshchanov, said. Earlier this month, in what quickly became known as 
"the Yeltsin affair," the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Yeltsin 
acted like the United States was "a bar 3,000 miles long, downing two bottles 
of vodka, four bottles of whiskey and countless cocktails in five days," and 
spending his speaking fees on movie videocassettes and other luxury goods. The 
La Repubblica article was then reprinted in Pravda, prompting outraged denials 
from Yeltsin. In fact, Voshchanov said in an article recently published in the 
youth newspaper Komsomovskaya Pravda, Yeltsin did not even want to be paid for 
his speeches and handed over his speaking fees to aides. "While Yeltsin was 
delivering his last lecture, which was to end three hours before our departure, 
me and (aide) Lev Sukhanov rushed to satisfy his 'insatiable consumer 
appetites,' " Voshchanov said. "We chose a child's pistol for his grandson, 
worth $6, and two toy calculators for his two granddaughters, worth $18." In a 
rare move, Pravda apologized for the article, apparently in a rebuff to 
conservatives.

 -- Author Tom Wolfe's research into a new novel has taken him into the 
courtroom, where the "Bonfire of the Vanities" writer is observing a trial 
involving two real estate developers. "Real estate development is one of the 
themes I want to elaborate (on) in the novel I'm working on now," he said. 
"Along with investment banking, it is one of the two industries that set the 
tone of the period. Here are two developers in a lawsuit -- lots of things in 
the business will come forth. One of the great things about lawsuits is they 
tend to pull the covers off of things." During the trial in Boston, Wolfe also 
appeared at a convention of the International Council of Shopping Centers, 
inviting the crowd to tell him anecdotes about the real estate game.

 -- Veteran U.S. space researcher James A. Van Allen has received the 
prestigious Crafoord Prize from Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf for his pioneering 
exploration of space. Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences, which also awards the 
Nobel science prizes, in particular cited Van Allen's discovery in 1958 of the 
Earth's high-energy radiation belts that were named after him. Van Allen, 74, 
of the University of Iowa, developed new rockets and space instruments used in 
launching the first U.S. satellites. ANN CONNORS

D. HOOPES, 93; CANDIDATE OF SOCIALIST PARTY 
</P>

<P>
Darlington Hoopes, the Socialist candidate for President in 1952 and 1956 and a 
former Pennsylvania state legislator, died Monday at a nursing home near 
Reading. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Quakers, Hoopes studied agriculture at the University of Wisconsin 
but then turned to law, receiving his legal education largely through 
correspondence courses. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced law in Reading, a base for Socialist political sentiment in the 
1930s and 1940s. He served as national chairman of the Socialist Party for 20 
years and was elected to three terms in the Pennsylvania Legislature in the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Hoopes introduced and helped pass the state's child labor law. 
</P>
<P>
Hoopes was the Socialists' vice presidential candidate in 1944 with perennial 
Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas. When Thomas declined to run a 
seventh time, Hoopes ran for President on the ticket in 1952 when Republican 
Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson. Unlike those of the 
major candidates, Hoopes' campaign cost him only $150. 
</P>
<P>
He campaigned for the nationalization of banks, railroads, coal mines and the 
steel industry, and for strengthening the United Nations, effecting world 
disarmament and reuniting East Germany and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The wealthy have long used the power of government to enrich themselves. In a 
democracy, government is a tool that should be used to advance the common 
welfare," he said in a radio address shortly before the 1952 election. 
</P>
<P>
He received about 21,000 votes to Eisenhower's 33 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hoopes also ran in 1956, when Eisenhower again defeated Stevenson. Hoopes' name 
appeared on the ballots in only about 10 states.

JOHN BRIGHT, 81; SCREENWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John M. Bright, a one-time Chicago newspaper reporter who helped through such 
films as "The Public Enemy" in 1931 establish the gangster film as a powerful 
motion picture theme, has died in a Panorama City hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was 81 and lived in West Hollywood. He had suffered a stroke and died Sept. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
With Kubec Glasmon, another former journalist, Bright wrote a series of stories 
that became films, beginning with "The Public Enemy" with James Cagney and Mae 
Clarke. The film made a star of Cagney, and the scene in which he smashes a 
grapefruit into Miss Clarke's face has become one of the more fabled moments in 
American cinema. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 10 founders of the Screen Writers Guild in 1933, Bright had screen 
credits for "The Brave Bulls," "The Kid From Cleveland," "I Walk Alone," 
"Close-Up" and several more when he became entangled in the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities' investigation of communist influence in the film 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than subject himself to the scrutiny, he moved to Mexico, returning 
several years later to write magazine articles and plays. His leaving the 
country resulted in his blacklisting. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Mildred, and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial has been scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Writers Guild, 8955 
Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles.

HELICOPTER LIMITS OKD IN ATTEMPT TO QUIET SKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A North County planning group won a battle to make neighborhood skies a little 
friendlier and a lot quieter Wednesday when county supervisors voted to toughen 
the laws governing takeoffs and landings of private helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"We got what we came here for," said Albert Frowiss, chairman of a San Dieguito 
planning group, who spoke before the five-member county panel. The unanimous 
vote was the final hurdle for a proposed law he and other residents have 
battled for months to see passed. 
</P>
<P>
Their determination was simple to explain: The age of George Jetson is here, 
Frowiss says -- a time of people zipping around the neighborhood like uncaged 
birds in their private aircraft. And it was time to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
You remember Jetson, the futuristic cartoon character who careened about the 
starry skies in his streamline bubble-top spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
Frowiss and his Rancho Santa Fe neighbors had seen too many private helicopters 
whizzing about their wealthy North County enclave in recent years. At the 
controls were irresponsible neighbors, they said, whose airborne vehicles 
filled the air with a staccato racket. 
</P>
<P>
Frowiss had glimpsed the future. And he didn't like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jetsons live here already," he said. "All you have to do some days is look 
up in the sky, or just listen, you'll find them." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Fe residents say that, along with small planes and hot air 
balloons, the aircraft are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Rancho Santa Fe Assn. board of directors voted to ban all 
helicopters, except for those used for emergencies and special events, from 
landing in the exclusive 6,000-acre development. 
</P>
<P>
Another community planning group recently expressed fears to the county that a 
planned hotel-resort near Mt. Helix might one day darken the skies with 
personal whirlybirds, whisking big city company executives to and from vacation 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopter advocates say the aircraft alleviate traffic hassles for corporate 
executives who must regularly fly to Los Angeles and elsewhere. And, besides, 
they say, they're a lot of fun to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Atlas Hotels Inc., which holds the only major-use permit application on file 
with the county for a helicopter landing area, failed to return phone calls 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to impede anyone from flying their toys around illegally and set up 
some stricter guidelines for any future ones," Frowiss said. "And these cases 
come up all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that many now. But just one is aggravating. A guy moves into a 
neighborhood, and he doesn't know the rules, and, all of a sudden, you've got 
another helicopter headache to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Though helicopter owners must now obtain a major land-use permit to land on 
private property, the new law makes it tougher by requiring at least 5 acres 
for a landing spot. 
</P>
<P>
The takeoff areas will also have to sit back 200 feet from a property line in 
residential and agricultural areas, rather than the current 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Also, night flights are prohibited unless specified in the use permit. And 
landing areas that service more than one helicopter must be within 1 1/2 miles 
of a major roadway to blend the aircraft's noise with that of freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"The new law puts people on notice that, if they want to build a helicopter 
landing area on their property, it's not just like they're going to be able to 
pay their money for the permit and have the thing approved," said Marvin Jones, 
an associate planner with the county. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of considerations involved the average person might not think 
of." 
</P>
<P>
Although the new law applies countywide, its effects will most likely be felt 
in wealthy neighborhoods, where residents can afford to plunk down $100,000 to 
$1 million for a personal helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Frowiss also asked the board to amend the public hearing process for acquiring 
the necessary major-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
"The present law requires that anyone within 300 feet of a proposed project be 
contacted for their input before the permit is granted," Frowiss said. "The 
difference is we're dealing with a flying object here that people are going to 
hear a lot further away than 300 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Frowiss proposed that people within 500 feet on each side of a helicopter 
owner's proposed landing corridor -- until the craft reaches an altitude of 
1,000 feet -- be alerted to the potential permit.

No wonder the Los Angeles City Council decided Wednesday to postpone a vote on 
a bill to restrict the movement of horses here. 
</P>
<P>
The background information supplied to the council by the city attorney's 
office said the ordinance would prohibit horses "on the medians of any road in 
the city of Los Angeles, except in areas where bridal paths currently exist." 
</P>
<P>
Does the city attorney really want to make it illegal for a horse to walk down 
the aisle of a church? 
</P>
<P>
Actor Kevin Dobson, who was Telly Savalas' sidekick in the detective series, 
"Kojak," still can't get over his initial reaction at being accosted outside 
the downtown Midnight Mission while making a donation of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, who was unhurt, told Mission director Clancy Imislund that he had 
appeared in so many cinematic violence scenes "that when the guy came at me 
with the knife, I felt like saying, 'Wouldn't it be more believable if you took 
it out from under your coat?' " 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda's decision to designate the Jan. 9 birthday of ex-President Richard 
M. Nixon, the Orange County city's most famous native, as a civic holiday 
raised the question of what famous people -- if any -- were born in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Mouse, born in Walt Disney's brain in a Hollywood studio in 1928, was 
nominated as L.A.'s most famous product recently in this space. 
</P>
<P>
But there are a few others, as it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ohlin of Twentynine Palms points out that movie choreographer Busby 
Berkeley and actor-pioneer descendant Leo Carrillo were native Angelenos, as 
was Norma Jean Baker, better known as Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. also gave the world a chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court -- the late 
Earl Warren -- as well as an unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate in 
Adlai Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
There's still a chance that the city could produce another presidential 
contender. Jack Kemp, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was born 
here and played football at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
No telling when a native Angeleno will be elected mayor of L.A., though. 
</P>
<P>
If the Hollywood Freeway seemed noisier than usual near Cahuenga Pass on 
Wednesday morning, it might have been the additional din at nearby Universal 
Studios created by dozens of amateur yodelers who were trying out for parts in 
the amusement park's Oktoberfest Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the perils of celebrity-hood. County Supervisor Ed Edelman was recently 
invited by NBC's Today Show to discuss his part in persuading one winery to 
temporarily stop distributing its cheap, fortified brands to Skid Row liquor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a catch: He would have to rise at 3:30 a.m. to make it to the NBC 
studio in Burbank in time to be interviewed by the New York-based show. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman checked into a hotel in Universal City the night before and rose 
promptly at the appointed time, only to learn that he had been preempted by 
Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor was asked to come back another day, but sent a county health 
official rather than go through the pre-show ordeal again. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked around like a zombie for two days," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when local boosters attributed astonishing curative powers to 
the climate of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The purity of the air in Los Angeles is remarkable," author Charles Nordhoff 
wrote in a typical endorsement a century ago. He guaranteed that just a few 
inhalations would give "the individual a stimulus and vital force which only an 
atmosphere so pure can ever communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Now, marketing ploys are taking a reverse approach, offering cures from the 
effects of Southern California's fumes. 
</P>
<P>
In a new series of local radio ads, one vitamin company actually claims that 
its products can aid in the battle of "defending your lungs against air 
pollution."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER SPRAYED BY INSECTICIDE; 2 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two part-time state agriculture employees have been arrested for squirting a 
motorist in the face with a toxic insecticide used to kill the Oriental fruit 
fly, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a 41-year-old Burbank woman whose name was not released, complained 
of blurred vision, a burning skin sensation and a numbing around her mouth, 
Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told police she was sprayed with the insecticide -- identified as the 
highly toxic chemical Dibrom 14 -- by a passenger in a state Food and 
Agriculture truck. 
</P>
<P>
The truck had first followed dangerously close behind her as she entered a 
Burbank intersection, and then pulled into opposing lanes of traffic alongside 
her car and sprayed her, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck sped away, but based on the description the woman gave, the two men 
were arrested nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Mario Jarquin, 18, of North Hollywood, the driver, and Walter 
Rowland, 30, of Van Nuys, believed to be the passenger who wielded the nozzle 
to squirt the insecticide.

JUDGE WITHDRAWS MAIL-FRAUD RULING AGAINST SOUTHWEST MARINE ON NAVY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has withdrawn a judgment in which he ruled that San Diego-based 
Southwest Marine Inc., one of the largest shipyard companies on the West Coast, 
committed mail fraud and acted with fraudulent intent against the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In settling a lawsuit between competing shipyards, U. S. District Judge Stanley 
A. Weigel on Tuesday withdrew an earlier summary judgment against Southwest 
Marine, according to a court clerk and shipyard attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 8 judgment found that the company acted "with intent to deceive, 
manipulate and defraud" the Small Business Administration and the Navy in the 
fall of 1983 to win a contract worth up to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment was a precursor to a trial to decide a lawsuit brought by three 
competing shipyards against Southwest Marine. The lawsuit alleged that 
Southwest Marine used unfair means to win a contract to fix four Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Finding 
</P>
<P>
Despite Weigel's latest action, a spokeswoman for the Navy's Sea Systems 
Command, which oversees the repair of naval vessels, said Wednesday that Navy 
officials were still considering sanctions against Southwest Marine in light of 
the judge's earlier finding. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine maintained in a statement, however, that the rescinding of the 
judge's order eliminates the possibility that the company would be barred from 
bidding on future government jobs. Repairs on Navy ships provide about 80% of 
the workload for Southwest Marine's 2,500 employees, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Southwest Marine said the judge's latest decision gives the 
company a "clean bill of health" in its dealings with the government. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, it's (back to) business as usual," said Lloyd 
Schwartz, vice president and legal counsel for the ship repairer. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine is one of the largest remaining ship repair businesses 
remaining in the West, with facilities in San Diego, San Pedro, San Francisco, 
Portland and American Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Ruling in August 
</P>
<P>
Weigel, through his clerk, declined to comment on the decision to rescind his 
earlier ruling.

ELDERLY MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ATTEMPTING TO MURDER HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 79-year-old Ramona man who tried to smother his wheelchair-bound wife pleaded 
guilty Wednesday to attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Watson entered his plea before San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew 
Wagner, who set sentencing for Dec. 1. The incident occurred July 15 in the 
couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Watson, also 79, testified at a July 31 preliminary hearing that her 
husband forcibly put a plastic bag over her head. During the struggle, she also 
broke some fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's son heard his mother screaming and removed the bag from her head, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. George Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
Beall said Watson faces a maximum 9-year state prison term and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
However, because of his age, the prosecutor acknowledged that getting a prison 
sentence for Watson would be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a battle getting him to prison at all. A prison sentence 
would probably be a death sentence," Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Watson suffers from Parkinson's disease, according to court testimony. Her 
husband reportedly has been frustrated in dealing with his handicapped wife, 
said Herb Bowman, a prosecutor who previously worked on the case. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Watson reportedly put a bag over his own head in the 
basement, where he was found unconscious, Beall said. He also apparently tried 
to drink carburetor fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Watson posted $10,000 bail in August, and he remains free on the condition that 
he have no contact with his wife.

ANOTHER MARSHALL PLAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago the United States committed itself to a $12-billion program to 
finance the reconstruction and integration of Western Europe's war-devastated 
economies. That effort, first publicly proposed by Secretary of State George C. 
Marshall, achieved spectacular successes. 
</P>
<P>
Now the prosperous Western Europeans, joined by Japan, the United States and 
other major industrial nations, are lining up to help as Poland and Hungary 
embark on an unprecedented political transformation. The recognized need to 
prevent threatened economic instability from eroding these reform efforts gives 
a special urgency to the outside aid program. 
</P>
<P>
The Marshall Plan succeeded in no small part because Western Europe already 
possessed the political and economic culture -- including a large pool of 
talented technicians and officials -- to make it work. Poland and Hungary lack 
many of those advantages. Four decades of state-controlled Marxist economies 
have in the main produced only wide-scale inefficiencies, distortions, 
shortages and massive international debt. Many of the basic institutions that 
are needed to support the shift to free-market economies are weak or 
nonexistent. Poland, for example, lacks even a single commercial bank to make 
loans to newly hatched small businesses or to finance private home 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The donor nations are proposing $648 million in new commitments to Poland and 
Hungary next year, on top of the $271 million in food aid already announced. 
Proposed help runs the spectrum from pesticides, medicines, farm machinery and 
environmental cleanup to improved market access for Polish and Hungarian goods 
and training in capitalist management. The initial U.S. contribution, announced 
earlier by President Bush, is for $219 million in economic and food aid. 
Democrats have been critical, saying more should be done. In an address 
yesterday to the International Monetary Fund, which can be expected to play an 
important role in the economic restructuring in Eastern Europe, Bush agreed "we 
must do more." He has yet, however, to commit his Administration in any more 
practical terms. 
</P>
<P>
The direction of international help that is required now and in the years ahead 
nonetheless has been set, and the readiness to show generosity seems clear. The 
new political leaders in Poland and the emerging and changing leaders in 
Hungary have said in so many words that their countries are abandoning 
communism and intend to move swiftly toward free-market economies and more 
democratic institutions. All this represents a truly historic turning point in 
the history of Europe and the postwar world. The need for outside help to speed 
this process along is compelling. The encouraging news is that there is a clear 
willingness to provide that help.

COMPARING BUSH TO EISENHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I too notice similarities, but it does not give me the contented feeling that 
Broder gets. Both men are caretaker Presidents bent on preserving the status 
quo. Today, I don't believe we can afford a president who is not a problem 
solver. We have the problems of budget and trade deficits, drugs, the failed 
policy of trying to police the world by spending billions to maintain 
servicemen overseas, the excessive debt by government, business and consumers, 
the policy of paying millions to a fascist government in El Salvador to support 
its death squads and paying the Contras to murder citizens of Nicaragua, to 
name a few.

'GOOD WORK IN SACRAMENTO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Common Cause wishes to extend its sincere thanks and appreciation to 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) who, together with six of his colleagues, 
played a leadership role in the drafting of a comprehensive package of reform 
proposals designed to restore public confidence in state government. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the bipartisan Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, Katz had to 
make some unpopular decisions concerning the activities of other legislators. 
Through an extraordinarily open and deliberative process, the committee 
recommended to the full Assembly an exhaustive, thoughtful list of reforms: 
Eliminate honorariums, strictly limit gifts, prohibit the personal use of 
campaign funds -- and much more. As far as substance, Common Cause gave them a 
grade "B." The committee's effort, however, deserves nothing less than 
"A-plus." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the recommendations were not fully implemented in either house. 
This should not lessen our praise for each committee member who, faced with 
tough decisions, made tough choices. They have provided for some restoration of 
confidence in the institution they serve, and have opened the door to a more 
responsive and effective Legislature.

COORDINATING COASTLINE ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Considering Gov. George Deukmejian's consistent and persistent hostility to the 
California Coastal Commission, it was not surprising that he vetoed a bill that 
would have empowered the commission to halt illegal bulldozing of roads and 
grading of development sites, and to fine those who ignored such stop-work 
orders. Regrettable, but not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
The governor still has an opportunity, however, to approve legislation that 
might provide marginal improvement in administering state laws affecting the 
coastline and offshore regions, although it does not grant any new authority to 
any state agency. The measure is AB 2000 sponsored by Assemblyman Sam Farr 
(D-Carmel). Farr's proposed California Ocean Resources Management Act of 1990 
would establish an Ocean Resources Task Force representing the more than 20 
state agencies that regulate, oversee, study, protect and lease the ocean 
resources -- activities that also affect the coastal area upland of the 
high-tide line. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to make sure that each of the state departments knows what the 
others are doing and that they provide consistent state policy in management of 
the ocean resources. The taskforce also would try to work with the federal 
government to make certain federal agencies follow state laws where applicable. 
The task force would report to the governor and Legislature on Jan. 1, 1993, on 
ways to improve such management and coordination. The task force would serve as 
a clearinghouse for all the information and research being compiled by the 
state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
While it may seem a simple matter, one arm of state government does not always 
know just what another branch is doing, even though both might deal with 
essentially the same subjects. The task force would provide the necessary 
coordination. The bill deserves the governor's signature. 
</P>
<P>
As for the pirate bulldozers, the Legislature should try again to construct a 
bill that is acceptable to the governor. Illegal grading and road construction 
has been a particular problem in the Santa Monica Mountains and along the 
Malibu coast. When the Coastal Commission learns of a violation, it must ask 
the state attorney general to persuade a judge to issue a temporary restraining 
order. This process often takes a week and, by then, the damage is done. The 
vetoed bill was sponsored by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia).

ONCE THE BOSSES LOVED THE PRESS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIETS OUTGROWING PRECOOKED NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITALY A. KOROTICH, Vitaly A. Korotich is editor of the Soviet magazine 
Ogonyok. A photo of the magazine's cover appears in the collage above. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today we are moving away from the trance into which Soviet society once lapsed 
-- either on orders or from sheer fright -- to a concrete assessment of all 
that has happened to us. 
</P>
<P>
We are reading our press with unprecedented attention, we are peering intently 
into the TV screens. We are rethinking ourselves and our place in life. 
</P>
<P>
Transforming society and telling the truth are daunting propositions in this 
country, where we still have laws -- never formally renounced -- that could 
land half, if not all, of the most fervent glasnost supporters in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion reigns in the house under reconstruction. Apart from looking for new 
paths to the future, we are also thinking over the plans for today's salvation. 
And we want to understand our past -- although this is no easy task, because 
many crucial documents are still out of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet press symbolizes the biggest achievement of perestroika. For the 
first time, the press represents a threat to those who would like to arrest the 
positive changes in the Soviet Union. That is why it lives amid constant 
attempts to slow it down, to apply the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between events and the reporting of events is traditionally 
complicated. In the absence of even a hint of a law on the mass media (although 
the Soviet legislature is working on one), too much depends on the boss and his 
whim. 
</P>
<P>
There were times when the bosses loved us! This love reached its peak 10 or 15 
years ago, when the press was swimming in a torrent of sunny news. The Soviet 
people read the papers meditatively while standing in endless lines, and at 
best their attitude toward the press was that of compassion. But the bosses 
loved us! 
</P>
<P>
It was then that one of the most ridiculously showcased publications, Ogonyok, 
received the country's highest decoration, the Lenin Order. The magazine was 
horrible, but eminently tame, which was the reason it received the order. 
Ogonyok's tales of prosperity flowed merrily on; to express doubts of the 
actual existence of prosperity was not only unpatriotic but also subject to 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Repression is not the only weapon against the media. They can also be pampered 
and domesticated. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Soviet society has a stable, unchanging allotment of optimism. 
Sometimes the bulk of optimism is in the upper levels of power, and sometimes 
it flows downward, to the people, leaving the leaders in a state of deep worry. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the population has never rejoiced as a whole. In the years of 
terror, Josef Stalin and his team beamed from countless posters and official 
photographs. Today, as we move tortuously toward democracy and renovation, the 
bureaucracy demonstrates profound pessimism or even outrage. The picture of a 
beaming leader today is a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
The bureaucrats had been building the country for themselves. Now they are 
doomed to fight to the death. They have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
But this is also true of the rest of the country. Having started to think and 
analyze, the people cannot stop, no matter who tells them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
With this new habit of thinking, we are making discoveries that add little to 
our feeling of comfort. For instance, we have discovered that there are a great 
many dishonest people among our leaders. The main criterion for selection to 
the top jobs in this country was always the ability to obey, rather than brains 
or original ideas. Unquestioned loyalty to ideological dogmas was always worth 
more than professionalism. Because loyalty is much easier to simulate than 
competence and knowledge, the share of cynical and dishonest functionaries 
steadily grew in our leadership. 
</P>
<P>
That was true everywhere. When I entered the editorial office of Ogonyok for 
the first time, I discovered a long list of names under the glass on the desk. 
This proved to be the complete list of birthdays of all the Politburo members 
and the Central Committee secretaries. Next to each name, careful notes were 
made: whose portrait was to be published in color and whose in mere black and 
white on the required day. 
</P>
<P>
I asked if a special Central Committee decree had been adopted on the subject, 
or perhaps it was simply the initiative of my overzealous predecessor. "There 
was no special decision," was the answer, "but no one has ever objected." 
</P>
<P>
Is it necessary to mention that my predecessor, who successfully killed the old 
Ogonyok, was pensioned off with the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor? 
</P>
<P>
Even in this time of change, the official "fighting unit" functions as before. 
I refer to the Communist Party's daily Pravda, as well as subservient 
television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
People in this country had long been accustomed to a precooked dish of news, 
instead of separate components with which everyone makes his own meal. The 
country lived on a diet of commentary rather than reporting. But a new 
generation of readers is emerging along with a new generation of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The bureaucrats open their mailboxes with trepidation every morning. This not 
so much because some unexpected article or a block-busting interview might 
appear. The problem is that social control is slipping from their grip. 
</P>
<P>
A process of serious, dignified thinking is going on in the country, and this 
is reflected in the mass media. The censors remove one, two or more articles, 
but this no longer changes the overall situation. With the absence of a press 
law, the relationships between the editor and the censor are full of mystery 
and half-legal actions, relying for the most part on the temperaments of both. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom of expression is a complicated phenomenon in a country unable to feed 
its population and apprehensive of awakening thought. We are trying to steer 
the middle course between China and Poland. The Communist Party does not intend 
to lose its monopoly on power as in Poland, but neither does it plan to support 
its authority with tanks as it did in China. This makes the press the crucially 
important instrument. 
</P>
<P>
We are building the country. We are trying to create a new society, where 
time-honored traditions and institutions will be given new places and 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
I am editing a magazine that fights for this goal, for the new society and for 
the new place in it for ourselves. "Please, don't be afraid," the readers are 
encouraging us. "Write the truth!" This is a completely new situation in the 
Soviet press: We now depend on people who are craving the truth. Let it be 
forever!

MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS ACTRESS MOTHER CHANGES PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old man accused of clubbing his actress mother to death with a 
barbell in their Encino home withdrew a plea of not guilty by reason of 
insanity Wednesday and entered a plea of not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Three months after a mistrial was declared in a first attempt to try Timothy 
Scott Roman, his two new lawyers waived his right to a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Roman is accused of the Dec. 10, 1986, murder of Susan Cabot, 59, a B-movie 
actress in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The practical effect of the plea change is that during his new trial, scheduled 
to continue today, Roman's attorneys can present medical and psychiatric 
evidence alleging that he was incapable of forming the intent to kill required 
for a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lesser Charge 
</P>
<P>
If they present such evidence and Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. 
Schempp rules in their favor, Roman might end up convicted of a lesser charge, 
such as voluntary manslaughter, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone, who 
is prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
If the insanity plea had remained in effect and Roman had been convicted, a 
separate hearing would have been required to determine if he was insane at the 
time of the killing. If deemed insane, he could have been incarcerated for the 
rest of his life unless later found to be sane, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Stone and Richard P. Lasting, one of Roman's attorneys, waived their right to 
make opening statements to Schempp, who is trying Roman. 
</P>
<P>
The trial got under way with Los Angeles County paramedic Robert Gocke 
testifying that Roman claimed on the night of the slaying to have found his 
mother dead in bed. Roman said he had been knocked unconscious by a Latin 
intruder in a Ninja mask but had only a superficial cut on his forearm, Gocke 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of murder, Roman could be sentenced to life in prison since 
prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. But if convicted of voluntary 
manslaughter, for instance, he would receive a maximum of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declared Mistrial 
</P>
<P>
About a month into the first trial, Schempp in May declared a mistrial after 
Roman's attorney, Chester Leo Smith, 67, was admitted to a hospital with what 
were said to be stress-related heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's defense tactics had stunned prosecutors. During the first trial, he 
revealed to jurors during direct examination of a police officer that Roman had 
confessed to slaying his mother after the two had argued. 
</P>
<P>
Had Smith not brought it up, the confession would have been inadmissible in 
court since it was made after Roman had asked to speak with an attorney, a 
constitutional right, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had earlier unsuccessfully sought to have the murder charges dropped by 
arguing that his client was the victim of a failed medical experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Born a dwarf, Roman grew to 5 feet, 4 inches with thrice-weekly injections of a 
hormone derived from the pituitary glands of cadavers. Smith maintained this 
caused aberrant behavior in the former Pierce College art student.

ROCKWELL SETTLES, PAYS $75,000 TO EX-WORKER WITH LEUKEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TImes Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International has agreed to pay a $75,000 workers compensation 
settlement to a former employee who has leukemia, according to papers filed 
with the state Workers Compensation Appeals Board in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
In settling the case, Rockwell did not admit liability for the illness of Gary 
Shoop, 52, of Thousand Oaks, who worked nearly 20 years as a laboratory 
technician at Rockwell's De Soto Avenue plant in Canoga Park, and later the 
Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In his compensation claim, Shoop alleged that he was routinely exposed to a 
variety of radioactive substances and toxic chemicals at Rockwell, where he 
worked from 1961-69 and again from 1979-88. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved Last Month 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement agreement approved last month, attorneys for Rockwell and 
Shoop said "a bona fide and good faith issue" remains as to whether there is 
any link between the workplace exposures and Shoop's leukemia, a cancer of the 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop worked at the De Soto plant from 1961-69 for Atomics International, a 
Rockwell branch which has since been absorbed by the firm's Canoga Park-based 
Rocketdyne Division. Shoop said his duties included testing the nuclear fuel 
that Atomics manufactured at the De Soto plant in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, he was also assigned work with radioactive materials at 
the Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth, where most of Rockwell's 
nuclear work has been done. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Rockwell for a sales job, Shoop returned in 1979, working at the 
science center until the end of last year, when he was placed on medical leave 
because of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop said he also worked for less than two years in the late 1950s for a 
nuclear fuel fabrication company in western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Shoop said he "definitely had an exposure to" toxic 
and radioactive materials during his years at Rockwell. But he praised the 
company for what he called its "caring attitude," saying "safety . . . is the 
mind-set" at Rockwell. "Those people tried very hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long Process' 
</P>
<P>
The company does not believe Shoop's illness is work-related, but it would be 
"a long, unproductive process to try to prove that," said Jim Wettleson, 
director of human resources and communication at the science center, which has 
about 400 employees, more than one-third of them with doctorates. 
</P>
<P>
The $75,000 settlement is a substantial amount for a workers compensation case. 
Rockwell previously settled five other claims of radiation-induced cancer 
involving former workers in Canoga Park or Santa Susana, company officials have 
said. Those settlements ranged from a low of $2,500 to a high of $90,000, 
according to a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Shoop settlement provided for payment of $63,750 to Shoop and $11,250 to 
his lawyer. Shoop also is to receive lifetime medical care and is to be 
continued on medical leave status until eligible for his retirement pension at 
the age of 55. Shoop also waived his family's right to seek death benefits.

PANEL DELAYS ACTION ON AVIATION MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORS CRITICIZE RECOMMENDATION INVOLVING VAN NUYS AIRPORT SITE 
</P>

A decision on building an aviation museum as part of the redevelopment of about 
90 acres of the Van Nuys Airport was delayed Wednesday when the Los Angeles 
Board of Airport Commissioners sent a recommendation on the issue back to its 
consultant for additional study. 
</P>
<P>
The board's consultant had recommended a plan devoting five acres to the museum 
and a park. 
</P>
<P>
But the airport's neighbors oppose the plan because they said it includes too 
much space for aviation-related uses and not enough for public use, such as the 
museum. An association of the airport's commercial tenants also opposes the 
plan, saying the 16 acres it set aside for aviation is insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"The aviation community is mad because we kept it at only 16 acres, and the 
general community is mad because of the 16 acres," Commissioner Robert A. Chick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission set a ceiling on aviation-related uses on the 
redevelopment site, two-thirds of which is being vacated by the Air National 
Guard, in response to residents' concerns about increasing aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard is scheduled to complete the move from its 62-acre facility 
to Point Mugu by early next year, and the airport commission wants to increase 
airport revenue by redeveloping that site, plus 30 neighboring acres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Handout to Community' 
</P>
<P>
The limit on aviation-related uses was "a handout to the community, to say we 
believe the growth of the airport should be limited," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Schultz, president of Ban Airport Noise, said the recommended redevelopment 
plan ignores the wishes of the community. He said the plan that was the 
"community's overwhelming choice" -- designating 33.5 acres for the museum and 
park -- is being ignored by the airport board. 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Voorhis, president of the Van Nuys Airport Assn., said aviation uses 
of the redevelopment area should not be limited to 16 acres. 
</P>
<P>
He said non-aviation leases in the redevelopment area, combined with fee hikes, 
would dramatically increase airport revenue at the expense of community 
aviation. The federal government donated the airport to Los Angeles after World 
War II to serve national aviation interests, not to generate money for the 
city, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;D Technologies, the project's consultants, presented to the board 
Wednesday four redevelopment alternatives that include a mix of industrial, 
research, commercial and public space. Each includes establishment of an 
aviation museum and public park on the airport property, ranging in size from 
two acres to 33.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The plan recommended by P&amp;D sets 
</P>
<P>
aside about 62 acres for offices, light industry and stores -- the most acreage 
of any of the four plans devoted to those uses -- and would generate about $6 
million annually in revenue. That alternative would also place the greatest 
demand on the city's water supply and create the the largest amount of solid 
waste and nearly the most traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But the board asked P&amp;D to restudy its recommendation and to consider the 
impact of relocating the Flyaway bus terminal, a city Fire Department 
helicopter repair facility or a city police station onto airport property. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth plan -- a hybrid of the others that also proposes relocating the 
25-acre Flyaway terminal onto the redevelopment site -- was endorsed by the 
airport's Citizens Advisory Council. That alternative sets aside 17.5 acres for 
a park and museum. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyaway, which runs 51 bus trips a day between the terminal and Los Angeles 
International Airport, now operates at a nearby site on Woodley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department has expressed interest in building an 
additional police station in the area in the next five to seven years, and the 
Fire Department is considering moving its helicopter base onto the site. 
</P>
<P>
The board also asked the Irvine-based planning and engineering consultant to 
re-examine its recommendation for the amount of acreage to be set aside for the 
museum and park. P&amp;D is to come back with another report in November. 
</P>
<P>
After the airport board endorses one of P&amp;D's recommendations, the planning 
firm will prepare detailed traffic studies and environmental impact reports. 
The plan finally approved by the airport board will have to be voted on by the 
Los Angeles City Council.

THE CRITTERS IN REDONDO WON'T MEET SIMILAR FATE 
</P>

When Redondo Beach empties two park ponds as part of a reconstruction project, 
John Oliver will make sure that a large population of marine life doesn't go 
down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, Redondo Beach's city clerk, and about 40 other users of Hopkins 
Wilderness Park plan to save the ponds' critters by placing them in a large 
wading pool until workers have finished putting in new cement bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of pulling the plug on them and killing them, we're going to save 
them," said Oliver, who is a member of the Friends of the Wilderness Park 
organization. "Our No. 1 concern is to save the animals. You hate to see 
anything like that die." 
</P>
<P>
Crayfish, mosquito fish, frogs, turtles, salamanders and even fresh-water 
shrimp are believed to inhabit the two ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said they hope a company will donate a large wading pool or sell one for 
about $300. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be rigged up where we can keep people from terrorizing them," 
Oliver said about the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-acre park at Knob Hill Avenue and Camino Real is valued by Redondo Beach 
officials for its camping and nature study facilities among trees, meadows, 
streams and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, which had used the site for the Nike missile 
radar-tracking system, gave Redondo Beach title to the area in 1971. The site 
originally was part of the El Segundo sand hills, which extend about 12 miles 
from Playa del Rey to the Palos Verdes Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the city planted about 1,000 trees, including eucalyptus, sycamore, 
gumwood, pine, ash, elm and California redwood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clogged by Mud 
</P>
<P>
Pumps were installed to feed water into two streams that flow into the ponds, 
which were built with a sand and porous clay bottom. Since then, mud has 
collected on the bottom and has blocked inlets. When the water is drained, the 
mud will be scraped out and workers will build concrete bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said construction, which was to have begun about two years ago, was 
delayed by budget problems. The animals were to have been transferred to 
another body of water. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans were scrapped when it was found that many of the animals could be 
carrying spores from duckweed, a lime-green plant that spreads across the water 
surface. But officials feared that the duckweed would be spread throughout 
another body of water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a Catch-22," Oliver said. "If you want to kill the weed, you have 
to kill the animal." 
</P>
<P>
So the organization has proposed putting the animals in the wading pool. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weeds Cover Water 
</P>
<P>
On the park's largest pond, called Green Swamp, the duckweed has spread so much 
that signs were put up to warn visitors, especially children, not to try to 
walk on the water, said Bob Atkinson, the city's director of parks and 
recreation. But he said that the weed is more of a nuisance than a harm to 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
At Manhattan Beach's Polliwog Park, much of the marine life was lost when the 
city started construction on a pond about three weeks ago to improve its water 
quality. But Oliver stressed that the Polliwog pond is much bigger. Users of 
Hopkins Park, he said, also had time to mobilize an effort to save the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real active community here," Oliver said. "It's too bad that they 
couldn't get something going on it."

STATE EXPERTS SAY THEY DID NOT URGE KILLING OF POLLIWOG PARK ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Department of Fish and Game biologists recommended that 83 ducks and 
geese at Manhattan Beach's Polliwog Park be quarantined but did not suggest 
that they be killed, an agency official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The waterfowl were killed Sept. 7, according to Los Angeles County Animal 
Control officers, after Manhattan Beach officials, preparing to make 
improvements to a pond in the park, sought advice from state biologists on what 
to do with the wildlife there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Voiced Over Killing 
</P>
<P>
Since then several residents and some City Council members have voiced concerns 
over the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Giusti, an associate biologist for the Department of Fish and Game in 
Long Beach, said he advised Manhattan Beach officials that the birds might 
carry several diseases, including botulism, and advised that they not be moved 
to another open pond. 
</P>
<P>
"We said that transferring them might create the potential for disease 
transmission," Giusti said. "We told them, 'Hold them at the site if possible 
or give them to individuals,' " Giusti said he had not visited the park. 
</P>
<P>
City staff, after hearing of the possibility of disease, ordered the birds 
killed. It is uncertain whether any birds actually were diagnosed as carriers. 
Lt. Marvin Stitts of County Animal Control said, however, "To my knowledge, 
they were not diseased." 
</P>
<P>
Walton Wright, a naturalist for the city of Torrance, said he has heard of no 
recent outbreaks of diseases among such bird populations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Kelly, director of the Manhattan Beach Department of Public Works, which is 
in charge of the project, refused to take calls on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach started the $426,000 project about three weeks ago to improve 
the pond's water quality. Workers drained the pond to install a new liner and 
retaining wall and will construct a redesigned bypass channel to divert 
polluted runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Animal Control officers from Carson removed the birds and 
put them to sleep by injection. 
</P>
<P>
Officials later discovered that several ducks had escaped capture. Four were 
taken last week to the city yard at 3621 Bell Ave. They are being held in a 
fenced-off area that includes sand and a small wading pool. 
</P>
<P>
Before the waterfowl were killed, the city tried to find homes for them through 
an Adopt-a-Duck program. Many had been pets before they had been abandoned at 
the park. Only one person agreed to accept one of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti said Fish and Game officials had no objections to the adoption program 
because, in most cases, the ducks and geese would have been placed in areas 
where they would be isolated from other large bird populations and could not 
transmit disease. 
</P>
<P>
More ducks and geese will be placed in the park when construction is complete 
on the pond, expected to be by the end of the year, said Ralph Luciani, 
Manhattan Beach director of administration and community services. He did not 
know how many would be replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents were irate last week when they heard that the birds had been 
killed. Mayor Pat Collins said she has received about half a dozen calls. The 
Department of Public Works has received more than 20 calls, Luciani said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said that, if the birds were healthy, "I think if one did enough 
telephoning around you could find a pond to put them in." 
</P>
<P>
"Every place that there has been any discussion of getting rid of animals, 
there's always been a public outcry," he said. "You have to look at the options 
you have, but you can't ignore the public sensitivity to it." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Collins said the City Council did not know of the situation until after 
the fact. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any action we can take at all," she said. "The deed has 
already been done. It was an unfortunate incident."

POLICE SEEKING MAN WHO TRIED TO LURE 4 CHILDREN INTO TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In separate but related incidents over the last two weeks, four schoolchildren 
in Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach have been approached by a man who has 
tried to lure them into his pickup truck, police say. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the children -- two 8-year-old boys and two 12-year-old girls -- 
have reported being approached by a man in a blue pickup with a white camper 
shell. The suspect has been described as in his 30s, white or Latino, with a 
dark complexion, dark hair and a dark mustache, although police report that 
some children have said he is overweight and others say he is slender. 
</P>
<P>
All of the children have run away from the man, who has neither gotten out of 
his vehicle nor attempted to forcibly abduct them, according to police in both 
cities, who say they have stepped up plainclothes patrols around schools in the 
wake of the incidents, the first of which happened Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"He has not been successful so far," Manhattan Beach Detective Jane Hoag said 
of the suspect, "but he also hasn't stopped. What is of concern to us is that 
sooner or later, he may be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four attempts occurred in Manhattan Beach, but the most recent 
took place Monday on Prospect Avenue in Redondo Beach, not far from Hillcrest 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach police said a group of girls spotted the man in a pickup "acting 
kind of strange, singing to himself (and) waving at them" at Emerald Street and 
Prospect Avenue at about 3:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:45 p.m., when one of the girls was walking home alone, the same man 
approached her in the 600 block of Prospect Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Come Over Here' 
</P>
<P>
According to Redondo Beach Sgt. Mike Minard, the man said, "Hey, come over 
here," but the girl ran in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent of schools in Redondo Beach said neither he nor the 
principal at Hillcrest School had been informed of the attempted abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Nick Parras said he and the principal knew only that a group of girls had 
seen "some guy driving around singing" but were not aware that one of their 
students was directly approached by the man. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, school officials have dubbed the man the "would-be 
blue-pickup-truck kidnaper." They have sent home two flyers reminding parents 
to take precautions and students not to walk alone to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Supt. Douglas Keeler said police composites of the suspect have 
been distributed to bus drivers, school gardeners and other city employees who 
drive during the course of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been all kinds of precautions," he said. "The best precaution has been 
the behavior that our kids have demonstrated during the course of this 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hoag, the Manhattan Beach detective, the first two attempts both 
took place near Pacific Elementary School and involved 8-year-old boys who are 
students there. 
</P>
<P>
The first occurred Sept. 13 at 2:30 p.m. at 18th Street and Flournoy Road, and 
the second occurred two days later, at 8 a.m. in the 1400 block of Poinsettia 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Hoag said, the same man approached a 12-year-old girl at 7:20 a.m. 
as she was walking to Manhattan Beach Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the South Bay, in a similar but apparently unrelated incident, a 
10-year-old student at Point Fermin Elementary School was briefly abducted 
Sept. 19 by a man driving a panel van. 
</P>
<P>
According to school officials and Los Angeles Harbor Division police, the boy 
was not feeling well and was waiting for relatives to pick him up at 11:45 
a.m., when the man drove up and forced the child into the van. The man drove 
with the boy for about five blocks and then forced him out of the vehicle, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
School Principal Charles Hall said the boy had been waiting on the sidewalk 
against the instructions of school officials, who had told him to stay inside 
the schoolyard.

'MALCONTENTS' SEEK TERM LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report in the Sept. 8 South Bay edition stated that Inglewood Citizens for 
Reasonable Reform under the leadership of Curren D. Price Jr. and the United 
Democratic Club are in favor of a City Charter amendment limiting the terms of 
elected officials in the city of Inglewood. At first glance this might look 
like a straight enough proposal. However, to get an honest picture, it has to 
be shown who the real people are behind this scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the United Democratic Club's members are have-beens, want-to-bes and/or 
perennial candidates for every elected office which has been and will be 
available in the city of Inglewood. These same people are now with Inglewood 
Citizens for Reasonable Reform. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, as an active Inglewood voter, I have been involved as campaign 
worker and volunteer in several political campaigns for challengers and for 
incumbents alike. This was always done the democratic way: hard long work, 
door-to-door campaigning and enthusiasm for a candidate who had something to 
offer, who had the trust and confidence of the people and whose election would 
make a difference. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win, but if an 
officeholder does not live up to his promises or if he has lost touch with the 
voters, sooner or later he will be replaced by this process. (Look at Mayor 
Koch of New York City). 
</P>
<P>
These perennial candidates, however, never are able to get elected on their 
programs or their accomplishments and therefore have to look for a gimmick to 
fulfill their ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years Inglewood has been on a bullish upswing which will bring 
us into a bright new future and will be beneficial to all of us. God help us if 
these malcontents ever get the run of the city.

CHOPPING A BOTHERSOME, BEAUTIFUL TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing this letter to the sound of a chain saw hacking away at a 
beautiful 35-foot palm tree that only moments ago was chopped and then fell to 
the ground with a deadening bang. 
</P>
<P>
You see, the lady next door was "bothered" by this 40-something-year-old beauty 
in her front yard. It had, in fact, bothered her for a long time, and so she 
finally ordered it to be chopped down, hacked up and removed. She had this 
done, by the way, at 9 on Sunday morning -- a day when most neighbors enjoy 
sleeping in, a day free from work, free from the noise of traffic and 
construction. . . . But today, many of us were awakened in horror and watched 
in amazement as this tree was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder why it's so easy for a person to "take a contract out" on a tree, 
simply because it bothered them? This tree represented no danger to any person, 
home or telephone line. Does my neighbor not realize that trees allow us to 
breathe purer air, a point of concern of any Los Angeles residents? 
</P>
<P>
When a person orders a tree to be cut down, isn't there an organization that 
should intervene and determine if there is indeed a sound reason for that 
removal, and if not, prevent this from happening? We expect large corporations 
to replant the trees they take for industry. Should this not be enforced on a 
individual scale as well? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the tree was on her property, but it seems to me that this planet is all 
of our "property" and we should be held responsible for its health, yes, even 
in the case of one tree on Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
I am a reasonably concerned environmentalist, not a fanatic. But this morning 
as I witnessed a defenseless, majestic tree lying in the middle of the road 
while its trunk and limbs were being severed, I felt pained and hurt. Thanks to 
my neighbor, I am becoming a fanatic.

ARLETA HOUSE FIRE LEAVES 8 HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire caused $50,000 damage to an Arleta house Wednesday and left eight people 
homeless, the Los Angeles City Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who tried to fight the flames before firefighters arrived was treated 
outside the house for a minor burn, Battalion Chief Tom Stires said. The fire 
started about 4:30 p.m. in the 8800 block of Sparton Avenue and was contained 
about 15 minutes later, said Jim Wells, Fire Department spokesman. The cause 
was unknown, Stires said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials asked the American Red Cross to provide the house's occupants 
with emergency food and shelter, Stires said.

Our board of directors has decided to oppose the paving of Reseda Boulevard and 
possibly Mulholland as well, as a way to improve traffic circulation in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
While there might be some short-term improvements in traffic circulation, they 
would soon be negated by continued growth and development. Valley residents 
should oppose the cut-through and paving since they will lead to more density 
in the Santa Monica mountains. 
</P>
<P>
We support fire roads in the area. However, these roads should remain unpaved 
and blocked to all vehicular access. We do not want fire roads to become 
informal paths for off-road vehicles, motorcycles, etc. The Fire Department is 
the appropriate agency to determine the number and placement of these roads. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major causes of congestion on the Ventura Freeway is the absence of 
cross-mountain roads. Roads such as the Laurel Canyon freeway, Reseda to the 
sea and Hayvenhurst to Sepulveda would have relieved traffic on the Ventura 
Freeway had they been built. Without them there is pressure to double-deck the 
Ventura Freeway and build light rail, much to the detriment of those living 
near the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
If cross-mountain roads are to be built, then they should include the 
Hayvenhurst cut-through, Reseda to the sea and more freeways through the 
mountains. But we do not advocate this course of action, since it would have a 
severe negative impact, changing the character of our communities. It would 
spur additional growth in the little remaining open space left. This leads us 
to the conclusion that we must live within our transportation means. 
</P>
<P>
We need tough controls on development and must make improvements in the present 
transportation system.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORUM TONIGHT ON HYPERION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A community forum will be held tonight at Recreation Park in El Segundo to 
discuss a proposal by the Hyperion Treatment Plant to construct at least a 
dozen large processing tanks that will obstruct the ocean views of some 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials Saturday raised 50 large weather balloons about 100 feet 
into the air to demonstrate how views could be blocked by the tanks, which are 
being built as part of a project to increase the capacity of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The homes are on the bluffs directly above the sprawling plant, which is 
operated by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration prompted a group of El Segundo residents to organize a 
grass-roots effort to block the construction of the tanks, which would be 105 
feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, at 7 p.m. in the George Gordon Clubhouse, was called by El Segundo 
City Councilman Scot Dannen. The park is at 300 E. Pine St.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBILE-HOME RULING UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson City Clerk Helen Kawagoe's decision to invalidate an initiative petition 
against the city's mobile-home rent control law has been upheld by a state 
appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
In the decision, handed down Monday, the judges ruled that Kawagoe was correct 
in throwing out more than 200 signatures. Kawagoe's disqualifications left the 
petition short of the 10% of registered voters needed to qualify a measure for 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have retained existing rent control for mobile-home tenants 
meeting federal poverty guidelines while phasing them out for others over a 
two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners, who supported the petition drive, argued that the city's rent 
control ordinance prevents them from making a fair profit. Mobile-home owners 
say they would not be able to pay steep increases in rent for their spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Kawagoe, who lives in a Carson mobile-home park, said she felt vindicated by 
the decision.

MORNING BRIEFING: THEY'RE ALL GUNNING FOR THESE COWBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How are the Dallas media reacting to the 0-3 Bar 4J (Jerry Jones-Jimmy Johnson) 
Cowboys? Jack Mann of the Baltimore Evening Sun provides a glimpse: 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the film at 11 in Dallas on Sunday night was Sunday Silence airing by 
six lengths in the Super Derby. 'Sunday Silence is the horse named after the 
Cowboys' offense,' the anchorman said. 
</P>
<P>
" ' . . . Who's gonna make the play?' Johnson had shouted at his troops daily 
during preseason training. Columnists in both Dallas newspapers Monday asked 
the question and answered it: 'Nobody.' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the columnists was a shade caddish in likening owner Jerry Jones' 
having Elizabeth Taylor flip the coin to 'turning the Dallas Cowboys into the 
Arkansas State Fair.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Cowboys: Johnson, reminded that Tom Landry went 0-11-1 in his first season 
as coach in Dallas: "That's not much solace." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing playful about it: David Aldridge of the Washington Post quotes former 
Ram Eric Dickerson on being the target of Anaheim Stadium fans throwing play 
money after his Indianapolis Colts had lost Sept. 17: "That's really a joke. 
This is a game and you get paid for it. You can take all those fans in the 
stands and you can line them up. If they think it's fun, let them come out and 
try and play the game of football. If they don't want to get paid . . . This is 
not a game where you're just thankful to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Sept. 28, 1938, who hit the "homer in the gloamin" in the ninth 
inning to give the Chicago Cubs their ninth straight victory, 6-5, at Wrigley 
Field en route to the National League pennant? 
</P>
<P>
Score one for Kiner: New York Mets broadcaster Ralph Kiner usually receives 
attention only for his malapropisms. But Jayson Stark of the Philadelphia 
Inquirer gave Kiner his due after this exchange with Tim McCarver, prompted by 
a TV shot of Met Barry Lyons sitting with a towel wrapped around his head: 
</P>
<P>
McCarver: "There's Barry Lyons, sporting sort of a Pharaoh look -- and the Mets 
are trying to pyramid their runs, leading, 4-1." 
</P>
<P>
Pause; shot of Lyons remains on screen. 
</P>
<P>
Kiner: "It sphinx for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Add broadcasters: He might not commit as many malapropisms as Kiner, but 
Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray has become the leader in misidentifications. 
Marty Noble of Newsday reports that earlier this month Caray identified St. 
Louis Cardinals third baseman Terry Pendleton as Teddy Pendergrass. 
</P>
<P>
The sour science?From Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press: "Any newspaper that 
sends a reporter to cover a boxing match between George Foreman and Gerry 
Cooney should be charged with aiding and abetting a fraud. And has there been a 
greater con man in the 20th Century than Cooney? The Great White Hype, who is 
33, has fought four times in seven years. Boxing stinks." 
</P>
<P>
A mere punk: Hall of Famer Bob Feller, quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer on 
all-time strikeout king Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers: "There was only one 
pitcher faster than I was. That was Walter Johnson. My curve was much better 
than Ryan's. His is only average." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Gabby Hartnett.

WITH RULES FAVORING OFFENSES, TEAMS ARE PILING UP THE POINTS

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life in the National Football League used to begin at 40. You could count on 
winning with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
Today, not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a big scoring year so far in the NFL, unusually big. To the sports 
fans who think a scoreless tie is a fate worse than a soccer game, the football 
season is off to a beautiful start. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a reason? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there is, but it's not a very glamorous reason," Sam Wyche, coach of the 
Cincinnati Bengals, said this week. "The offensive coaches have been getting 
the breaks in the rules for the last several years. This year, we're simply 
putting (it all) together." 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the rules changes of recent years: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most holding is legal now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The passer can't be touched if the tackler has to take even one step before 
hitting him after the ball is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, among other things, the downfield bump-and-run has been outlawed, 
encouraging the NFL's offensive coaches to find more quick little receivers and 
300-pound offensive linemen to wall off the passer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally taking advantage of all this, NFL teams are instructing their 
quarterbacks to fire more rapidly this season -- dropping back only three to 
five steps, instead of seven. 
</P>
<P>
And more than ever, coaches are putting four receivers on the field at the same 
time, doubling the number of passing targets. And taking defensive backs as 
well as linebackers out of the pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the rush is being neutralized. The offensive wall is just that now, human 
but massive, and sacks are down dramatically. There will be fewer than 1,000 
sacks this season for the first time since they started counting. 
</P>
<P>
"(Offensive coaches) are combining our many blessings this year, our many 
advantages," Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of UCLA's prominent recent stars have had trouble getting out of the 
starting gate in pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
Halfback Gaston Green, the Rams' top choice in the renowned Eric Dickerson 
trade, has proved that he's no Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman, the Dallas Cowboys' $11-million quarterback, is a remarkable short 
passer who doesn't throw it long enough to worry NFL defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Who's left? Well, there's Cincinnati's rookie fullback, Eric Ball -- a Bruin 
product who is a pro. Or so he looked Monday night when he replaced the injured 
dancer, Ickey Woods, and was the game's leading rusher with 78 yards in 18 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game, I told Eric: 'This is the night you burst onto the NFL 
scene,' " his new coach, Wyche, said enthusiastically. "And sure enough, he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"For the average good rookie back, you'd eliminate the no-huddle offense until 
he'd been around a while. But we didn't change anything, we didn't condense 
anything for Eric, and he didn't miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
"(Quarterback) Boomer (Esiason) called every play at the line of scrimmage, and 
we had an extensive audible system. It wasn't just, 'Check with me, left or 
right.' It was basically our whole offense, and Eric got every signal dead 
right. For a rookie, that was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
And so the difference between the Bengals and most passing teams remains. They 
can run the ball -- with Woods and James Brooks last season, with Ball and 
Brooks now. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody runs better (than Cincinnati)," said Cleveland's new coach, Bud Carson. 
"I would rather play Cincinnati less than anyone, for that reason." 
</P>
<P>
How much will the Bengals miss Woods? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll miss the heck out of him," said Wyche. "But the fact is, Eric had a 
better preseason than Ickey." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning his coaching career impressively at the age of 57, Carson came to 
Cincinnati undefeated this week, bringing his old 4-3 Pittsburgh defense with 
him -- the one that made middle linebacker Jack Lambert famous when an All-Pro 
defensive tackle, Mean Joe Greene, stripped out most of the other team's inside 
blockers. 
</P>
<P>
Carson coaches to take the middle away from the offense. His defensive tackles 
crouch closely together, making a run between them virtually out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on Cincinnati's ground play of the night, Ball accelerated so rapidly -- 
after accurately interpreting Esiason's audible signal -- that he zipped 
between Cleveland's tackles for 11 yards, pulling the Bengals out of a hole 
near their end zone in the first quarter, and positioning them for a big second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hefty enough at 211 pounds, Ball, who stands 6 feet 2, went on to gain 78 
yards. After the statisticians subtracted the end-around yardage compiled by 
wide receivers on both sides, Ball outgained the Cleveland team in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Ball said: "Our trap blocking up the middle was fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
On the night of his NFL debut, what was Ball thinking? 
</P>
<P>
"As many times as I found myself going one on one against a (defensive back)," 
Ball said, " I was thinking, 'Maybe I should have done this or this to get a 
bigger play.' " 
</P>
<P>
If there's a Dickerson ego there, it's under control. 
</P>
<P>
In their last two games, the San Francisco 49ers have won without running the 
ball effectively. 
</P>
<P>
That's the biggest difference in the 49ers in the post-Bill Walsh era. 
</P>
<P>
With the same defensive coach, George Seifert, who has replaced Walsh as head 
coach, the 49ers have the same defense. 
</P>
<P>
And with Joe Montana, they have the same pass offense. After 11 years in San 
Francisco, Montana knows the pass offense so well that he's like a Bill Walsh 
computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't win three Super Bowls with a one-dimensional coach, and Walsh was 
never that. Indeed, he was probably the greatest all-around coach of his time 
-- an underrated motivator, a skillful drafter, the most creative thinker, and 
the surest road-game winner since George Allen. 
</P>
<P>
And he based the whole operation on a strong running game. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with Coach John Robinson in his prime, the Rams are running with 
more success than the 49ers -- even though no one would ever trade Roger Craig 
even up for Greg Bell. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, in his better moments, Jim Everett has passed the ball with an 
artistry reminiscent of Montana, employing Henry Ellard as productively as 
Montana uses Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, also, these undefeated old rivals seem about even -- but as running 
teams, there's no comparison. 
</P>
<P>
If the past is prologue, the Rams will win in San Francisco Sunday because the 
49ers have forgotten how to run. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Eagles, at the moment, aren't getting the most out of their 
gifted young quarterback, Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
With a chance to open a sizable lead against the 49ers Sunday, and make a 
Montana-led comeback impossible -- well, more unlikely -- they chained 
Cunningham in the pocket, and tried to win on conventional running plays with 
their substandard runners. 
</P>
<P>
As a roll-out quarterback, Cunningham leads the league today as both passer and 
ballcarrier. He also leads in the science of running quarterback draws from the 
pocket. But in the 49er game, the Eagles called for none of that -- even on the 
goal line, where, three times, they were well positioned for the touchdowns 
that would have blown the 49ers out. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Cunningham criticized Coach Buddy Ryan for conservative 
signal-calling, and this week he stopped just this side of doing it again. With 
a touch of sarcasm, he said of the Philadelphia roll-out play: "It's still in 
the play book." Long pause. "But I don't want to get controversial." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has been exemplary in the task of bringing along a brilliant young 
quarterback. He championed him publicly from the start. Early on, he 
imaginatively threw Cunningham in as a third-down quarterback -- for the 
experience. And, this summer, he let him call the plays, giving him a feel for 
strategy that a quarterback can gain no other way. 
</P>
<P>
But in Sunday's game, the truth is, Cunningham wasn't playing in a modern NFL 
offense. Montana didn't outplay Cunningham. He outplayed Ryan.

THE BOTTOM TEN: GOPHERS DIG THEMSELVES TO THE TOP

THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
It's been a year to forget for the state of Minnesota. The Twin Cities have 
been betrayed by Gophers (clobbered by Nebraska), Vikings (clobbered by a 
semi-pro team out of Pittsburgh), and the Twins (fading from sight), with more 
disappointments to come from the NBA expansionist Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a new federal study indicates that Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport ranks No. 1 in the Bottom Ten of Airports as the noisiest 
flight facility in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers are typical members of the hapless Big Ten (10-13 overall). No. 10 
Ohio State fell to USC, 3-42, despite the absence of the Trojans' strongest 
runner -- Traveler IV, out with an ankle injury. Traveler V, who had planned to 
red-blanket this season, was pressed into action instead. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ohio State, Illinois was burned, though in a different manner. Following 
the Illini's 41-2 win over Utah State, someone set fire to 40 yards of 
artificial turf in the team's stadium. One thing about artificial turf, though. 
It grows back fast.

THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
While rookie Dallas owner Jerry Jones pressed his campaign to have Liz Taylor 
named as the new NFL commissioner, the Cowboys ran their on-field record to 
0-3. Obviously the replacement of Tom Landry by Jimmy Johnson has made a big 
difference. At least Dallas won three games last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the Meadowlands, a crowd of 74,742 -- or 74,743, if you count Jimmy Hoffa -- 
was present as the Giant pass rushers literally (well, not literally) buried 
Phoenix quarterback Gary Hogeboom. He was sacked five times and had four passes 
intercepted in a 35-7 Cardinalsloss. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's millionaire receiver Mark Clayton gave new meaning to term costly 
mistakes, ending his holdout in time to drop four passes, including two in the 
final 20 seconds of a 33-40 loss to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
And Detroit (0-3) announced that rookie Rodney Peete will probably start at 
quarterback for the Edsels in place of Bob Gagliano, who married a magazine 
model Monday and may not be ready to play by Sunday.

JARRYD UPSETS ZIVOJINOVIC TO REACH QUARTERFINALS

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Continuing to show signs of the form that put him in the top 10 five years ago, 
Anders Jarryd of Sweden upset eighth-seeded Slobodan Zivojinovic of Yugoslavia, 
6-3, 3-6, 6-3, Wednesday in the second round of a $425,000 tennis tournament in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Also reaching the quarterfinals were fifth-seeded Kevin Curren, who defeated 
Todd Witsken, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, and fourth-seeded Tim Mayotte, who beat Jim Pugh, 
6-2, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Against the power-serving Zivojinovic, Jarryd dominated with his serve. He lost 
only four points while serving in the first set and never had to face a break 
point in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
Jarryd, who was ranked No. 6 in 1984 and gradually fell to No. 32 last year, 
broke Zivojinovic in the sixth game at love and then served to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
Jarryd, 28, has emerged as a favorite in the top of the draw with the absence 
of John McEnroe, who withdrew Tuesday because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's place was taken by Brian Garrow, who lost in a first- round match to 
Andrew Sznajder of Canada, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to the quarterfinals Wednesday was Kelly Evernden of New 
Zealand, who defeated Leif Shiras, 7-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Philippe Fleurian of France shocked third-seeded Horst Skoff of Austria, 
6-3, 6-4, in a $225,000 tournament at Bordeaux, France. 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian, ranked No. 111 in the world, advanced to the quarterfinals by beating 
the No. 22 player. 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian will next play fifth-seeded Goran Prpic of Yugoslavia. Prpic defeated 
Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Sanchez of Spain, seeded second, advanced with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 victory 
over Marko Ostoja of Yugoslavia. Another Spaniard, Thomas Carbonell, beat Jens 
Peter of West Germany, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Claudio Pistolesi, Guillermo Perez Roldan and Sergio Brughera reached the 
quarterfinals with second-round victories in a $123,400 tournament at Palermo, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Brughera of Spain, seeded fifth, defeated Diego Perez of Uruguay, 6-3, 7-6 
(7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Perez Roldan of Argentina, seeded seventh, beat Claudio Mezzadri of 
Switzerland, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Pistolesi defeated fellow Italian Stefano

FORMER OWNER SAYS SHE STILL HAS EMOTIONAL TIES TO SECRETARIAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Penny Chenery saw Secretariat at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., last 
spring, the woman who raced him to the Triple Crown title in 1973 came away 
with the impression that he was carrying too much weight. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, Secretariat was diagnosed as having laminitis, a serious 
hoof inflammation that causes circulatory problems. 
</P>
<P>
Chenery doesn't have a breeding interest in Secretariat anymore, but she was 
associated with the horse for 17 of his 19 years. So, naturally she was happy 
to learn that he has recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything like that could be life-threatening, but he's stable now," said 
Walter Kaufman, the veterinarian who is treating Secretariat. "He's still on 
medication, but he now has about 95% of his normal gait back." 
</P>
<P>
Secretariat was syndicated for breeding after he won the Triple Crown, and 
Chenery, after years of getting ordinary horses from mares she sent to the 
stallion, sold her lifetime share a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the part about breeding to him every year," she said. "It was a 
financial move. The business has gotten so expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Long before Secretariat's recent problem, Chenery felt that she made one 
mistake in sending him to stud. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was anything I would like to do over, it would have been to insist 
that he be exercised regularly with a rider on his back," Chenery said. "But 
when we syndicated him, I was new in that phase of the business, and so was 
Seth Hancock (who has managed Claiborne since his father, Bull, died). 
</P>
<P>
"Seth just told me that Claiborne never exercised any of it stallions because 
his daddy didn't believe in doing it. I found out later that when Seattle Slew 
was syndicated, it was a condition of the contract that he be ridden on a 
regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman doesn't believe that exercising Secretariat would have prevented him 
from developing laminitis. Kaufman said that Seattle Slew has been exercised 
since his early stud days because in the beginning he had difficulty getting 
mares in foal. 
</P>
<P>
"When Sir Gaylord (who was out of Somethingroyal, the same dam as 
Secretariat's), first went to stud, he got fat and infertile," Chenery said. 
"He was sent to Alec Head, who gave him lots of exercise, and he became one of 
the best sires in England." 
</P>
<P>
The last connection for Chenery with Secretariat is Sacred Dance, a 3-year-old 
daughter of the 1973 horse of the year who is at a Pennsylvania farm. Sacred 
Dance, who is out of Dance With Squall, a minor stake winner, suffered from a 
salmonella infection and has never raced. 
</P>
<P>
"She's gray, but she has Secretariat's head," Chenery said. "She may not race 
until she's a 5-year-old, but I'll never give her up. For sentimental reasons, 
I'm going to keep her the rest of her life." 
</P>
<P>
Present Value was assigned high weight of 123 pounds, one more than Speedratic 
and three more than He's a Saros, for the Pomona Handicap. He's a Saros, beaten 
earlier at the meet by Conquering Hero, another nominee for Sunday's stake, has 
won the handicap two consecutive years. Conquering Hero, assigned 118 pounds 
for Sunday, was second in last year's handicap. 
</P>
<P>
First Magical Mile, who could have been California's fastest 2-year-old, was 
sent to the sidelines. Then Red Ransom, an undefeated New York 2-year-old, 
suffered a leg injury that ended his season. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, winner of the Hopeful at Saratoga, is still in training, but 
plans to run him Sunday in the Arlington-Washington Futurity have been scuttled 
because of a bruised foot. 
</P>
<P>
After the Arlington race, Summer Squall was scheduled to run in the Champagne 
at Belmont Park and then the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream Park. But 
instead of the Champagne he may run in the Breeders' Futurity Oct. 13 at 
Keeneland, where he's currently stabled. The Keeneland race is 1 1/16 miles 
around two turns, which might better prepare Summer Squall for the Nov. 4 
Breeders' Cup race at the same distance. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Chris Antley is in limbo in New York because of recurrent 
substance-abuse problems, and owner Dan Lasater has been reinstated by 
Louisiana racing officials after a prison stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Antley, one of New York's leading riders, surrendered his license to 
authorities, admitting that he has drug problems again. Antley, sidelined a 
month because of a knee injury, was scheduled to return last weekend, but 
didn't ride and was also abandoned by his agent. Antley says he will continue 
drug rehabilitation and his program will be monitored by state racing 
authorities before they consider giving him another license. 
</P>
<P>
Lasater, whose stable won 494 races in 1974, which is still a record, won three 
Eclipse Awards as the country's top owner before he was arrested on charges of 
distributing cocaine. He spent 11 months in prison. The commission voted to 
reinstate him, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
More surprising than Bayakoa's victory over Open Mind in last Sunday's Ruffian 
Handicap was that Belmont Park fans made the winner the favorite, even though 
Open Mind went into the stake with a 10-race winning streak. There was also no 
advantage for Bayakoa in the weights. Despite a last-place finish at Del Mar in 
her last start, Bayakoa carried five more pounds than Open Mind, who got a 
break in the weights because she is a younger horse. In 14 starts before the 
Ruffian, Open Mind was favored in all except the first three races of her 
career. Open Mind wound up third in the Ruffian, the first time she has been 
worse than second. 
</P>
<P>
According to the linemaker at the Sands in Las Vegas, Bayakoa is the 2-1 
favorite and Open Mind is 3-1 for the Breeders' Cup Distaff. After his victory 
in the Super Derby, Sunday Silence went to 8-5, behind Easy Goer at 6-5, in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic. Other Breeders' Cup favorites are Summer Squall, 3-1 in 
the Juvenile; Stella Madrid and Rue de Palm, both 3-1 in the Juvenile Fillies; 
On the Line, 2-1 in the Sprint; Polish Precedent, 2-1 in the Mile; and 
Cacoethes, 2-1 in the Turf. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant, the horse that handed Nashwan his first loss by winning a 
stake at Longchamps, is owned by Kings' owner Bruce McNall.

DESPITE UNCERTAINTY IN MARKET, FIRM PLANS 2ND OFFICE HIGH-RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite some uncertainty in the San Diego office market and within its own 
corporate structure, Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes is proceeding with plans to 
build a second downtown high-rise office tower bounded by A, B and India 
streets and Kettner Boulevard, which is catercorner from the CC&amp;F building 
nearing completion at B, C, India and Columbia streets. 
</P>
<P>
The new building will be roughly the same volume as the first building's 
343,000 square feet but only 17 or 18 stories high, contrasted with the first 
building's 20 stories. CC&amp;F owns about two-thirds of the designated block 
but will depend on the city's condemnation powers to acquire the rest of it, 
Senior Vice President Gary Toeller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Toeller said the building will cost about $80 million and may end up being 
financed with help from the same Japanese limited-partner investors -- C. Itoh, 
Daiwa Real Estate and Konoike Construction -- that invested with CC&amp;F in 
the first building. Discussions with the Japanese are under way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy rates in "class A" office buildings downtown are now about 14.5%, 
Toeller said, which is less than the glut that exceeded a 20% vacancy rate 
earlier in the decade but still relatively soft. Buildings totaling 1.2 million 
square feet, or roughly 20% of existing inventory, are now under construction 
and scheduled to come on line downtown over the next year or so, Toeller said. 
</P>
<P>
Toeller is not worried, given the fact that nearly 43% of the new space under 
construction has been leased, meaning that not that much vacant space will hit 
the market. His building, which is scheduled to open for tenants in December, 
is 70% leased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
CC&amp;F majority owner Marshall Field V is restructuring the real estate 
company and is reportedly considering selling all of CC&amp;F's Western real 
estate properties, including the San Diego office building. CC&amp;F nationwide 
owns 12 million square feet of office and industrial buildings. CHRIS KRAUL

APARTMENTS FIND FAVOR AS INVESTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
S.D. COUNTY PRICES ATTRACT BUYERS FROM OVER THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For two years now, San Diego commercial real estate brokers have been urging 
investors to buy apartments, saying that the residential units would soon be as 
good as gold. But buyers, still leery of hard times investors suffered during 
the mid-1980s when a glut of apartments were built, seemed to shy away from 
such advice. 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
Investors, particularly from Los Angeles and Orange counties, are increasingly 
turning to San Diego County for properties to buy, especially in North County. 
With new residents flooding into the region, many of them unable to buy San 
Diego's pricy homes, newcomers tend to become tenants, which raises demand for 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ideal situation," said Bruce Blumenthal, director of acquisition for 
Schickler &amp; Meringoff Properties, a Los Angeles-based real estate 
investment firm. Blumenthal's firm spent $22 million in March to purchase 
Emerald Point apartments, a 456-unit complex in Vista. He added, "We're looking 
to acquire more in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
So is Paul A. Laubach, president of Providence Capital Group, an Orange-based 
real estate investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking in Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still looking in Oceanside . . . and I would love to pick up a building in 
the beach communities, Del Mar or Encinitas," Laubach said. Providence Capital 
Group has already purchased 210 units in San Marcos, Escondido and Fallbrook 
for $10.5 million. In addition, Laubach said, the firm has 374 units worth $20 
million in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Laubach and Blumenthal are just two of the many Los Angeles and Orange county 
investors -- discouraged by the limited number and more expensive buildings in 
their region -- who are turning south to cash in on investment opportunities, 
according to Kevin Mulhern and Edward Aloe, apartment specialists at Coldwell 
Banker Commercial Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 44 transactions involving apartment projects with 15 or more 
units (67% of 3,026 units sold) in North County so far this year have involved 
buyers from Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to Aloe. Industry 
experts say even more investors, including out-of-state and foreign buyers, 
will be eyeing the San Diego market as well in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
High demand has helped push up the price per unit that investors are paying for 
apartments here to an average $70,000, up from $45,000 to $50,000 per unit four 
years ago, said George Carlson, an apartment broker with John Burnham &amp; Co. 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was ranked in the top 10 in economic growth between 1983 and 1988 
and is also projected to be in the top 10 through 1993," said Aloe, citing a 
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. study released at the 1989 Annual Apartment 
Conference held this month in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is also in the top 10 for population growth," Aloe said. "Those are 
two factors that will drive any real estate market." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frenzied Sales Activity 
</P>
<P>
In addition, today's high construction costs and slow-growth ordinances should 
prevent new units from coming on line, making existing apartments all the more 
valuable, industry experts say. That has spurred frenzied sales activity, said 
Carlson of John Burnham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent apartment sales report released by Burnham, 1,029 
projects (or 16,155 units) have been sold in the county through August, up 12% 
over the 913 projects (or 11,959 units) sold during the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"At the current pace, 1989 sales activity is running slightly ahead of 1985's 
record pace," Carlson said. "In fact, this could be San Diego's strongest sales 
year this decade." 
</P>
<P>
But even enthusiastic investors, such as Blumenthal, express some reservations 
about the San Diego apartment market's potential. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't miss on anything that you buy -- that's what a lot of the brokers 
want us to believe, but that's not necessarily true," Blumenthal said. "San 
Diego is a wonderful marketplace, but it's not a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Variables' 
</P>
<P>
"If all the indicators come through, yes, we'll probably have an attractive 
market with annual rent increases," Blumenthal said. "But there are a lot of 
variables and, if any one of them turns against us, we could have a lot of 
problems. For example, if we go into a recession, you can forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Although many brokers tout what they expect to be double-digit rent increases 
in coming years, Blumenthal reminds investors that rents have remained flat for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's still a glut of apartments, and, although many cities have 
building moratoriums in place, I've seen plenty of developers get around such 
limits." 
</P>
<P>
Without question, however, apartment construction has slowed dramatically -- a 
natural occurrence following overbuilding between 1984 and 1986, and in part, 
because of slow-growth initiatives and higher construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rental Prices Flat 
</P>
<P>
"Back then rent prices were increasing by 10-12% each year," said Mulhern, 
referring to the early 1980s. "Developers were saying, 'Wow!' and came running 
over here to build apartments. Such a building spree resulted in an annual 
average gain of 25,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
"The developers built themselves right out of a rent increase market," said 
Mulhern, adding that rental prices stayed flat from 1986 to 1988. Consequently, 
construction has declined; according to Coldwell Banker analysts, only 7,000 to 
8,000 apartment units will be built this year, down from about 15,000 units in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts expect even fewer apartment units in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so much growth lately that there is a backlash now, a lot of 
slow-growth, anti-growth sentiment," Mulhern said. "People are asking, 'What 
about schools? What about parks?' 
</P>
<P>
"And, even if a city doesn't have a slow-growth ordinance, practically every 
city has slapped on expensive building fees," Mulhern added. "That alone is 
enough to deter developers." Building fees and rising land costs are the 
principal factors that have escalated the price of building apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surplus Absorbed 
</P>
<P>
Such curbs on construction and a net migration last year of more than 70,000 
new residents into the county each year are combining to finally allow the 
absorption of surplus apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people moving into San Diego County are not ready to become first-time 
home buyers," Mulhern said. "With the median county home priced at $179,000, 
the majority of these people are going to be renters." 
</P>
<P>
Already such factors have helped lower vacancy rates to about 6% countywide 
from 10% to 12% two years ago. Once vacancy rates drop to 5% -- a pivotal 
figure that industry analysts say signifies a switch from a renter's market to 
a landlord's market -- San Diego should see true rent increases for the first 
time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might say that they have increased rents in recent years, but that's 
deceiving," Mulhern said. "In many of those cases, owners may have been 
charging higher prices, but at the same time they were offering a lot of 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Aloe says the era of concessions is coming to an end and expects true rent 
increases starting in 1990. Industry experts say 5% to 8% annual increases in a 
year or two are probable. Opportunistic investors are hoping for more. 
</P>
<P>
"We've looked all around, Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura . . . they're all 
overpriced," Laubach said.

SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENT MANAGER UPDATES 'BIBLE' OF HIS INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Literally hundreds of "how to" investment books are published each year, many 
by dubiously qualified authors. But a new guide by Del Mar-based investment 
manager Charles Brandes could have a legitimate claim to investors' attention. 
</P>
<P>
Brandes, whose book entitled "Value Investing Today" was published in July by 
Dow Jones-Irwin, knows what he is writing about. Barron's, the financial news 
weekly, recently rated Brandes Investment Management as the seventh best global 
equity management firm -- based on a 26% increase in value of funds managed in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Brandes, whose funds under management now total $174 million, up from $130 
million on Dec. 31, also placed 17th best in Barron's five-year performance 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Pittsburgh native decided to write the book as a sort of update 
of "Intelligent Investor," one of the two books he describes as "bibles of the 
investment industry" that were co-written by Benjamin Graham. A former La Jolla 
resident who died in 1976, Graham and David Dodd co-authored Brandes' other 
bible, "Security Analysis." 
</P>
<P>
After making Graham's acquaintance in the early 1970s, Brandes adopted his 
"value investing philosophy completely." Greatly simplified, that approach is 
to never pay more than "two thirds of the intrinsic value of any stock. That 
gives you a margin of safety if problems arise." 
</P>
<P>
Brandes said he learned from Graham always to "question conventional Wall 
Street thinking. He was always thinking through from a fundamental standpoint 
what was going on, what things were really worth, what you should pay for 
them," Brandes said. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult part of "value investing" is the discipline not to overpay 
for stocks, according to the Graham formula, and the patience to wait to sell 
until the market recognizes the stocks' value, Brandes said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, at the tender age of 31, Brandes figured the time was right to quit 
the San Diego retail stock brokerage where he was employed because the stock 
market was then at a cyclical low and cheap stocks abounded. So, with only 
about $300,000 in funds committed, he hung out his shingle in Del Mar, where he 
has been ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Finding cheap stocks is always difficult, particularly in the current bull 
stock market. Brandes and his staff of four investment managers scan data bases 
and corporate financial statements of stocks the world over to make buys. His 
firm charges 1% of funds managed as an annual fee and does not accept accounts 
of less than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
His book has sold about 4,000 copies so far, a respectable showing, Brandes 
said. He said he wrote the book mainly with the idea of better educating his 
500 clients. CHRIS KRAUL

BUSINESSMEN LET VOICES DO WALKING IN YELLOW PAGES

<P>
When Vladimir Berelson and Boris Kushnir left the Soviet Union a decade ago, 
that nation's telephones were outmoded, computers were virtually non-existent, 
and the telephone book was still a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the two men live in Orange County, and they have combined all three 
elements in a state-of-the-art referral service known as talking yellow pages. 
</P>
<P>
Berelson and Kushnir launched On-Line Yellow Pages recently and made 20 to 30 
referrals a day from a computer data base that includes telephone numbers, 
addresses and short descriptions of more than 1,500 businesses in south Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 40 advertisers have paid $200 or more to be listed with Kushnir's and 
Berelson's business. Consumers in search of a service or a store can call their 
toll-free 800 number and are referred to one of the companies that has bought a 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
If no company has sponsored an ad in a given category, the caller is referred 
to a non-paying company. 
</P>
<P>
Kushnir and Berelson, brothers-in-law who left their native Odessa in 1979, 
believe that their service will succeed because Americans have too much of a 
good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many telephone books in the area that you never have the right 
book available when you need it," Kushnir said. "And even if you do, it's bulky 
and inaccessible, so we think our service will be very useful." 
</P>
<P>
After moving to the United States, Kushnir worked for several local companies. 
In 1984, he opened a design business with his wife, Alla. Berelson worked as a 
quality-control expert at several local companies. 
</P>
<P>
The men started discussing the idea of a talking yellow pages 2 1/2 years ago 
and have been researching local businesses and competitors ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Five operators will work around the clock from their Lake Forest headquarters 
to answer calls from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
'We call it high tech with a personalized touch," Berelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Talking yellow pages first appeared about four years ago in the United States 
and Canada. Presently, there are 15 to 20 in general service, according to Dan 
Maitland, president of BDR AudioTex, a Toronto-based company that provides 
talking yellow pages services. 
</P>
<P>
Two companies have failed in attempts to begin similar yellow page services in 
Orange County. A third, Los Angeles-based Primex Talking Yellow Pages, has 
functioned throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties since late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Amin, President of Primex, said his company's switchboard attracts 
15,000 calls a day from across the metropolitan area and its advertising budget 
has swelled from $10,000 per month to $100,000 per month over the last four 
years. He said the company is presently making a profit but declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Primex has specialized in providing information on professionals such as 
doctors and lawyers, and its advertising prices, which begin at $350, are 
higher than those of Kushnir and Berelson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to beat the Yellow Pages at what they do," Maitland said. "It's 
difficult to make this work unless you're backed up by the telephone company." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone companies are prohibited from entering the audio-referral market 
until 1992. Maitland said he believes that talking yellow pages cannot succeed 
on a large scale until the telephone companies bring their massive resources to 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McCourt, owner of Freeline Inc., a Mission Viejo-based company that 
recently dropped out of the business, said the high cost of advertising was his 
downfall. He said his service attracted up to 300 calls a day, but he didn't 
have the money to adequately advertise the business and increase demand.

JACK SMITH: GRAMMAR SOUNDS GOOD WRITTEN BY EAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel it is time again to answer some of the many criticisms from readers 
about my alleged errors in grammar. Naturally, I choose to answer only those 
that I can offer authoritative arguments against. 
</P>
<P>
Harriett Sprague takes me to task for this sentence (speaking of faraway 
places): "I know they won't look any different than they do in the movies and 
pictures I've seen. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She circles the word than and comments: "From, Jack, from." 
</P>
<P>
The notion that from, not than, should follow different has many advocates, but 
the consensus of modern grammarians is that than is proper when from would have 
to be followed by an awkward phrase. 
</P>
<P>
(I might have used simply than, and dropped they do, to avoid the more awkward 
from the way they looked.) 
</P>
<P>
Bergen and Cornelia Evans are eloquent on the point in their Dictionary of 
Modern American Usage, noting that different than is found in Addison, Steele, 
Defoe, Richardson, Goldsmith, Coleridge, De Quincey, Carlyle and Thackery, 
among others, and that John Maynard Keynes, "another master of clear and 
beautiful prose," wrote, "How different things appear in Washington than in 
London." (His alternative to than would have been to write from the way they 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
The Evans conclude that different from is established usage and may be used in 
any construction; "But no one has any grounds for condemning others who would 
rather say different than, since this construction is used by some of the most 
sensitive writers of English and is in keeping with the fundamental structure 
of the language." 
</P>
<P>
In "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," Roy H. Copperud reports that 
different than is accepted as standard by his panel. The Harper Dictionary of 
Contemporary Usage concludes that several leading grammarians agree that "the 
use of different than is becoming more popular among careful writers when the 
object of the preposition is a clause, as in "Please inform us if your address 
is different than it was in the past." 
</P>
<P>
T. G. Stafford of Ojai deplores my use of the objective me in the clause "the 
daylong plunk of tennis balls struck by those more energetic than me." 
</P>
<P>
"Since you seem to put yourself forward from time to time as a grammarian," he 
says, "I felt that this occasional error should be brought to your attention. 
The correct pronoun, of course, should be I, as in 'He is shorter (or taller, 
thinner, fatter, smarter) than I (am short, tall, thin, fat, smart),' the 
latter part of the clause being understood rather than stated." 
</P>
<P>
First, I have never put myself forward as a grammarian. I write by ear, and 
usually in the vernacular. Though I have 18 feet of bookshelves devoted to the 
English language, in all its maddening perversity, I am merely a student of the 
language; I am constantly guided by reference to those works, and often misled 
into error by my ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the Evanses say: "If one says it is me, one would also say is she 
taller than me? But if one says it is I, he should also say is she taller than 
I? The objective form is generally preferred." 
</P>
<P>
A point of diction is raised by Carl G. McIntire, a speech consultant. He says 
I have misued the word bemused in the sense of amused, when it means 
"thoughtful -- to muse." I have never used bemuse to mean amuse. (Why would I?) 
I use the word bemused ironically, and perhaps McIntire is misled by the fact 
that I am often bemused by things that others find merely amusing. 
</P>
<P>
McIntire also complains about the general use of insignia as a singular noun, 
and insignias as a plural. In fact, he says, the singular is insigne and the 
plural insignia. 
</P>
<P>
Copperud notes that "both major dictionaries, as well as American Heritage, 
recognize insignia as the singular and insignias as the plural." He adds: "This 
may be regarded as the consensus." The Evanses, by the way, note that "in the 
U.S. Army insignia is used officially as a singular and is given a regular 
English plural insignias." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, memorandums is standard as the plural of memorandum.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: DON'T PAPER OVER DAMAGED CONDITION OF PRINTED ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: You keep emphasizing that condition is important in making a 
collectible purchase. Could you be more specific in terms of collecting paper 
items, as opposed to, say, glassware? -- S.G. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Condition is crucially important in determining the price of almost any 
collectible item. This has become increasingly apparent at auctions and 
collectors shows as individuals become more and more selective -- and 
competitive -- in what they buy. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of paper collectibles, for example, even a slight tear, burn or 
glue mark on a newspaper or print can immediately detract from the item's 
value. At that point, the collector should balance rarity against condition. 
</P>
<P>
If the item is extremely rare, the collector must decide whether to further 
invest in the collectible in an effort to restore it to a level of significant 
value. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of glassware, major problems involve chipping and cracks, which 
also will detract from value. Again, skilled restorers can be hired if the 
restoration price is within your budget. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there is a difference between damage and normal wear. 
</P>
<P>
Political buttons, for example, can show handling wear, but this won't 
necessarily detract from their value. What's more, attempting to erase wear 
marks on any collectible in an effort to make it take on a "new" appearance can 
end up damaging the collectible's value. 
</P>
<P>
A general rule of thumb, according to veteran dealers and collectors, is to 
attempt to keep a collectible item in as original condition as possible -- and 
to consider carefully any decision to restore. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they say, pay attention to auction and dealer condition "scales." 
Usually, this ranges from "mint" and "excellent" to "good," "average," "fair" 
and "poor."

YOUR BOOKSHELF: HOW TO CONQUER CLUTTER BY STEPHANIE CULP (WRITER'S DIGEST 
BOOKS: PAPER, $10.95). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSELLE M. LEWIS

<TEXT>
<P>
America's cornucopia of plenty too often results in useless plethora, giving 
rise to a book such as Stephanie Culp's creative and humorous guide. 
</P>
<P>
Author of a previous work on ways to create order from chaos, Culp draws on her 
experiences as the owner of The Organization, a business that tidies up 
people's lives. She begins by describing some of her clients. One had a "fright 
room"; another rented storage units for life's overflow, while Hilda's house 
became so cluttered someone called the health department. 
</P>
<P>
Among 10 important commandments are: Never procrastinate; "bequeath," while 
alive and well, that jewelry, china and bibelots to those who will enjoy them; 
and this above all: learn to keep everything in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Moving swiftly through the house -- from attic to basement, assessing contents 
of storage areas, drawers and closets -- Culp shows what to jettison and what 
to keep. Display antiques and collections, rather than storing them. Prune the 
contents of your closets frequently (When you return to Size 8, styles will 
have changed); but learn to shop for clothes by choosing coordinates and 
classics. Get rid of trendy kitchen appliances and gadgets (Whatever happened 
to the crock pot and the yogurt or pasta maker?), and purge your mail of all 
but essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Some will find it impossible to throw out books, college papers and texts, 
despite their taking up immense space, but most will agree that keeping love 
letters "makes you feel young and special." 
</P>
<P>
This guide to shaping up by shipping it out would make a fine gift for 
professional pack rats, nostalgia buffs or folks whose possessions have gotten 
way out of control. ROSELLE M. LEWIS

Pat Heinemann of Whittier, who wanted a purse-size battery-operated fan, now 
has her own fan club. Mary Jean Dorris, vice president of Diamond-U Products, 
1429 Magnolia Ave., Long Beach, Calif. 90813, says these fans can be 
mail-ordered from her firm for $5 each. Mrs. M. Spencer of Hollywood suggested 
the same company and said the fan comes with its own carrying case but no 
batteries. Vera Van Iwaarden says she recently bought one of these fans at Toys 
R Us. Mark A. Samuel of Chatsworth has two mail-order sources: Solutions, P.O. 
Box 6878, Portland, Ore. 97228-6878, and Colonial Garden Kitchens, Hanover, Pa. 
17333- 0066. The fans Samuel describes are somewhat larger than the others; 
what's more, they have a suction cup for attaching to any flat surface, but 
they would undoubtedly fit into a medium-size or large purse.

TEACHERS UNSURE ABOUT FLUNKING; 
</P>
<P>
SOME STUDENTS BENEFIT, BUT OTHERS SUFFER FROM LOWERED SELF-ESTEEM

<P>
The letter last June from Sun Valley Junior High School to Miguel Hernandez's 
parents, informing them that their son would have to repeat seventh grade 
didn't exactly come as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
All year, Miguel's teachers and parents had warned him that if he didn't shape 
up and do his work, he would flunk. And all year, Miguel hadn't listened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lazy," said Miguel, 14. "I went to class, but I didn't do anything else. 
They told me I would flunk, but I didn't pay any attention to them." 
</P>
<P>
The letter changed that. Faced with watching his friends go on to eighth grade 
without him and having to live with the humiliation he said he felt, Miguel 
suddenly got a new attitude. He signed up for summer school and attended math 
and computer classes, even when other students with similar problems were 
encouraging him to leave school. He pulled his grades up to B's and C's. And 
when school began in September, Miguel entered eighth grade with his friends, 
grateful to have gotten a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed about it," he said about the possibility of retention. "I 
don't know anyone who wants that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Miguel's story of sudden motivation isn't the most commonly heard one when 
educators discuss retention. In most cases, the debate over the pros and cons 
of holding a child back have traditionally focused on a few key issues: Does 
retaining a child give him a chance to catch up with his peers and increase the 
likelihood of his succeeding in school? Or does it do the opposite, instilling 
in him a sense of low self-esteem that sets him up for later failure? 
</P>
<P>
Faced with new research that suggests the latter may be the case, educators, 
teachers and parents are beginning to more closely examine retention. For 
example: 
</P>
<P>
* A recent study of 70,000 students in four school districts found that 
students who are forced to repeat a grade are 20% more likely to drop out of 
high school than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
* Research at the University of Colorado found that students who spend two 
years in kindergarten because they failed kindergarten readiness tests fared no 
better in first grade. 
</P>
<P>
* One study on teacher attitudes toward retention showed that among those 
surveyed, the majority of teachers exaggerated the benefits of retention and 
held beliefs not necessarily borne out by statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that if a child didn't get what was being taught, we just held 
him back," said Carol Fox, curriculum consultant with the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education. "Now we're finding that retention has all sorts of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at a very young age," she added, "it can show up later in low 
self-esteem. It's a very serious move that leaves its mark." 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, the last year for which figures were available, 29,786 out of 
586,590 students in kindergarten through 12th grade were retained districtwide, 
according to the Los Angeles Unified School District's office of research and 
evaluation. That number reflected no significant change from 1983, when 27,168 
out of 549,198 students were retained. 
</P>
<P>
Although the decision to hold a child back must be approved by the parents, Fox 
said, many teachers overestimate the benefits of retention and may convey that 
at decision-making time. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the study on teacher attitudes, she said, "They believed that retention 
early on tended to prevent it in later grades, and also that it took students 
from the bottom of one class and put them at the top of another. But neither 
has ever been substantiated by research." 
</P>
<P>
Research or no research, some education experts believe retention is a positive 
option in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Retention at the elementary school level, if it's not done as punishment for 
failure to achieve but instead as a chance for something different, can pay off 
and be valuable," said David Bower, administrator of the student guidance 
services division for the LAUSD. "The problem comes later on in junior and 
senior high school, when it almost becomes a set-up for failure." 
</P>
<P>
Some parents apparently share that opinion. One school administrator recalled a 
case two years ago in which the parents of twin girls in fourth grade asked 
that one of the girls be retained. Although the principal advised against it, 
the parents felt that the girl's lagging academic skills, which were two years 
below grade level, warranted the move. The school finally agreed, and both 
girls have reportedly adjusted well. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, however, questions such a move. "Especially considering the close 
relationship most twins have, it's bound to have an effect on her self-esteem 
later on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Jane Moody, a sixth-grade teacher at West Vernon Elementary School in Los 
Angeles, sees the issue from a slightly different perspective: "I think it 
lowers a child's self-esteem a lot more to be in a class and not be able to 
read what the other children are reading or to be able to answer a simple 
question. To me, that is worse." 
</P>
<P>
Moody had three children in her fifth-grade classroom last year whom she 
recommended for retention. When she was given the sixth-grade teaching 
assignment, she later decided to bring the three children into that classroom 
instead. The combination of her knowledge of their weak areas and hard work on 
their part, she said, will give them another chance to bring their skills up to 
grade level. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side are students who are not held back but who perhaps should be. 
"You have to understand that there is a battle of ages going on. The student is 
getting older," said Linda Markham, an eighth-grade teacher at Sun Valley 
Junior High School. "If a student has a number of fails, some are passed on not 
because of academic merit, but because of their age. You can't have a 
16-year-old in seventh grade." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of retention has come to the attention of more and more parents in 
recent years, especially in the face of a growing national trend to give 
children standardized tests to determine whether they are ready for 
kindergarten or first grade. According to the Washington, D.C.-based National 
Assn. for the Education of Young Children, it is not uncommon for 20% of young 
children to be held back from entering kindergarten, put in to a remedial or 
developmental program or be held back from entering first grade. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens despite the fact that research shows retention has potential 
long-term effects on children's self-esteem," said Asa Hilliard, an Atlanta, 
Ga., psychologist and professor at Georgia State University. "Significantly, 
research does not show that retention has a positive effect on children's later 
academic achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the developmental programs vehemently disagree. Instead of 
putting socially or academically ill-prepared children in school just because 
they are legally old enough to be there, they say, the transitional programs 
allow them to mature and enter school a year later with stronger skills and a 
positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Although developmental or transitional programs for kindergarten-age children 
have been adopted by about 25% of the Los Angeles County's 74 districts with 
elementary schools, Fox said, they are not endorsed by the state Department of 
Education. In a recently published report, she said, a departmental task force 
said districts should concentrate instead on creating "integrated educational 
programs" that are "age and individual appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking until now has been that the curriculum was OK, but that the child 
wasn't ready for it. Now that's changing," Fox said. "Schools and teachers are 
beginning to think that maybe it's not so much that the child isn't right for 
the program, but that the program isn't right for the child. Still, we don't 
have a magic wand to make the change overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some assumptions, the greatest number of children who are retained 
in elementary school do not have identified learning disabilities, said student 
guidance administrator Bower. Instead, he said, they are children "who are not 
achieving up to their potential, for as many reasons as exist." 
</P>
<P>
As with Miguel Hernandez, who simply chose not to do his work, teachers say it 
isn't always so much that Johnny can't read, as much as Johnny won't read. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide poll, conducted by the Institute for Motivational Development 
in Chicago, teachers said that 40% of students don't work to capability. Adding 
to the problem, parents are often either disinterested or too busy working to 
take part in the educational needs of their children; kids may have an 
emotionally difficult situation at home; and those children who have fallen 
behind in a few classes may become overwhelmed, believing there is nothing they 
can do to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Although the debate about retention is likely to rage for some time, teachers 
and educators do appear to agree on one factor: the importance of parental 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how often a parent will be contacted about a student who is 
failing, and the parent will express tremendous concern and then not do a 
thing," said sixth-grade teacher Moody, who is trying to devise creative ways 
to bring the children up to grade level. 
</P>
<P>
"To help these kids outside the classroom, I told their parents I would be at 
school each morning at 7:30 a.m. for homework help. So far this year," she 
said, "only one student has showed up once."

CONSULTANTS MAKE IT EASY TO COPE -- BUT NOT CHEAPLY

A few years ago, Sally Ryan was forced to acknowledge that her business had 
grown a little quicker than she had expected. Her office was such a mess that 
it might have qualified as a community redevelopment project. She didn't hide 
behind mere piles of files and paper work; her vision was obscured by mountain 
ranges of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
When Ryan, a public relations specialist based in Granada Hills, spotted an ad 
for an office organizing service in Los Angeles magazine, she wasted no time 
hiring an expert to help sort through the paper jam -- even though it meant 
spending a few hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It has brought order and sense into my life," Ryan said. "It was well worth 
the money I spent to have an office that functions. I could never have done it 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Like Ryan, a growing number of people are turning to consultants to solve 
problems that were once considered to be within the exclusive purview of the 
individual or the family. In the Los Angeles area, there are people who can 
plan a wedding, baby-proof a home, help one dress for success and tend to the 
needs of a depressed family dog. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to $5,000 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, such services aren't cheap. A party consultant can charge $3,000 to 
$5,000 for a single event, and that fee doesn't cover the food or 
entertainment. An image consultant may charge a minimum of $75 an hour. But in 
today's frenzied society, there seem to be plenty of people willing to spend 
their hard-earned dollars to let somebody else do the thinking and worrying for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Viamant, an image consultant who, along with partner Shelly Wessler, runs 
At Your Service in Tarzana, offers personalized shopping at $50 an hour. 
Typically, the women will interview a client (and sometimes do a color 
consultation) before going to department stores to choose a selection of 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
They're not the only ones who see green in color and image consulting. Vivian 
Dobay, who runs Style Connection in Encino, has done costuming for television 
shows for 12 years and has had her own business for the last eight years. She 
charges $35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Her clients range from college graduates on a limited budget to those who have 
made it and don't mind spending it. Thus, her shopping expeditions can take her 
to Rodeo Drive or the Cooper Building downtown. "It's easy to buy a wardrobe 
for somebody who has $5,000 to spend," she said. "It's harder for someone who 
has only $500. And those people still have to look good." 
</P>
<P>
(For $500, Dobay said, a man can count on a suit, a couple of shirts and ties, 
and a pair of shoes. A woman might get a couple of business dresses, an evening 
dress -- no designer labels -- and various accessories. Five thousand dollars 
buys some variety. A male client might expect several suits, sweaters and 
shirts, some sportswear, a coat and accessories. A woman could add 
designer-label suits and dresses and gowns -- or even some custom-made outfits 
-- to her closet.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Essential Service 
</P>
<P>
It's a service that Patricia Foote said she couldn't live without. Over the 
last four years, the Monrovia woman has used Style Connection dozens of times. 
"I tell her what I want, and she finds it. It's not only a service, she has an 
uncanny talent for putting together a wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, clothes are only part of the picture. Brian Brase, a Reseda-based 
trainer, charges $60 an hour to visit clients in their homes, where he 
constructs and supervises custom-tailored fitness programs. His clients range 
from the "very sedentary" to "high-level athletes in the prime of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Brase, who has a background in business and athletics, has about 35 clients -- 
some of whom he works with at gyms such as the Mid-Valley Athletic Club, Gold's 
Gym in Northridge and the Nautilus Fitness Center at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"These people use a trainer to make the time they are exercising more 
efficient," Brase said. "A lot of people go to the gym unsupervised and spend a 
majority of their time not working out purposefully. This is a very good use of 
discretionary time." 
</P>
<P>
Maureen McDade, a Northridge resident who works in the finance division of 
First Interstate Bank, uses Brase's services as often as three times a week. 
"There's a lot more to exercise than just sitting on a machine," she said. "I 
want to get the maximum results out of my workouts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elaborate Parties 
</P>
<P>
People who want the maximum results from their parties sometimes turn to 
consultants. Life's A Party! in Van Nuys will produce elaborate handmade 
invitations, have them delivered by limousine, concoct a multi-course menu and 
set up elaborate decorations that can transform a back yard into, say, a 
Polynesian paradise. 
</P>
<P>
And as if all this isn't enough to make one's head spin, the firm can arrange 
to have parachutists drop in on the gala event, or can orchestrate a dolphin 
show in the swimming pool. All, of course, for a hefty price -- which can range 
anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People today want to do something different. They want a fabulous evening, but 
they don't have the time or the inclination to do it themselves," said company 
President Charlie Scola. Life's A Party! subcontracts much of the work to other 
firms; it generally charges a 10% to 15% service fee for its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Marti Snider runs A-to-Z Organizing Services, a Van Nuys company that 
eliminates office clutter for $35 to $65 an hour. "Some people are notoriously 
behind in handling paper work. They get to the point where they can't do their 
job efficiently," she said. "We help them sort everything out. Afterward, they 
usually feel freed from something that has been bugging them for years." 
</P>
<P>
A typical job can take anywhere from two hours to two weeks, but Snider also 
offers a maintenance service to prevent things from slipping back into chaos. 
In addition, she handles closets and storage areas in the home. 
</P>
<P>
How does one decide on a qualified consultant? According to David Lord, 
managing editor of Consultants News, a trade publication based in Fitzwilliam, 
N. H., it's best to check references and ask if a consultant belongs to an 
association that has specific guidelines, if not a code of conduct. "It's 
important to see if they can really do for you what they profess to have done 
for others," he said. "There are some people with some weird schemes out 
there."

VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY: HORSING AROUND WITH FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"On Saturday nights at the L.A. Equestrian Center, I bet at least 20% of the 
audience is dressed for polo and they don't even know how to ride a horse," 
muses Ron Volpe, owner of Burbank Pet &amp; Equestrian Supply in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
When the Western look came into style in the '70s, some non-riding 
clotheshorses were inspired to check out the tack shops for more authentic 
apparel. The Western style remains strong, but this fall the English riding 
style is in the forefront of women's fashion: high-top boots, form-fitting 
vests, hunt coats that resemble long-tailed blazers, jodhpurs -- and for a 
touch of whimsy, fringed leather gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"The fashion designers copied the look, but they don't have quite the right fit 
as genuine equestrian attire does," says Harlene Gordon Gilroy of the Paddock 
Riding &amp; Sports Shop in Burbank. "The whole idea behind the English riding 
look is that it's very fitted to the body. We know how to do the alterations 
here to get that fit." 
</P>
<P>
Women from Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Malibu are trekking over the hill to 
Valley tack shops for another reason as well. "Some of the stores over there 
are carrying the genuine riding clothes, but they charge twice what we do for 
them," notes Nancy Wyman, manager and buyer of Dominion Saddlery at the L.A. 
Equestrian Center in Burbank. "On Saturday nights at the polo games here we 
sell more clothes to non-riders than to riders." 
</P>
<P>
Many riders are amused -- but not fooled -- by the latest trend. Laughs Suzanne 
Peika, polo coordinator at the L.A. Equestrian Center, "You can tell they don't 
really ride because their clothes are never dirty!" 
</P>
<P>
Firewood Facts 
</P>
<P>
Do you feel twinges of foolishness when you call to order firewood? Typically, 
a supplier rattles off a forestful of wood types, extolling the virtues of his 
company's custom blend. Who are you to debate the merits of pinion over pine? 
</P>
<P>
A typical mistake buyers make is in thinking that soft wood burns fast and hard 
wood burns slow. Not so. "Soft wood has snap/crackle, and hard wood doesn't," 
says Norma Vaughan of Brigg's Firewood in Canoga Park. It's density that 
affects the rate at which wood burns. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-burning woods include eucalyptus, oak, olive, almond and citrus. 
Fast-burning woods include pine, elm, fir and avocado. Woods that burn at a 
medium speed include pinion, walnut, juniper and plum. (In case you're 
wondering, a cord of oak costs about $300. More typically, firewood is a mix of 
woods such as oak, pine and juniper and costs about $265 a cord.) 
</P>
<P>
Medical Condominiums 
</P>
<P>
"I think most doctors want to own their own office space," says Dr. Robert 
Hesselgesser, president of Coastal Radiation Oncology Medical Group in Thousand 
Oaks. Yet most physicians are renters. In two months members of Hesselgesser's 
group will open a branch at Westshore Medical Plaza in Westlake Village where 
they will own their office space -- because the Plaza is a medical condominium. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a building with so many offices, and each physician owns his 
particular space within it," says Ted Walters, assistant vice president at the 
Money Store Investment Corp., which provided the financing for the Thousand 
Oaks facility. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Heuer, owner of Townsgate Financial in Westlake Village and developer of 
Westshore Medical Plaza, says, "The idea has probably been around for 10 or 15 
years, but it's been a difficult one for developers because of a lack of 
available financing. Residential condos in the '60s and early '70s had the same 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
"It's most common to find doctors renting, less common to find them having 
ownership interest in a building, and least common to find them purchasing 
medical office condominiums," says Michael Zugsmith, president of Zugsmith and 
Associates, a commercial real estate brokerage with two offices in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hesselgesser views the purchase as a business investment. "Real estate in 
California only goes up, and plus we're in control here. No one can come in 
down the road and tell us they're raising our rent or they sold the building 
and we have to move out." 
</P>
<P>
The 51,000-square-foot, two-story Westshore Medical Plaza has 30 units, two of 
which are unsold. Prices ranged from $160,000 to more than $1 million, 
depending on size. Heuer's company is in various stages of developing four 
other medical condominiums in Southern California, with a combined value in 
excess of $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
What got him started on this path? 
</P>
<P>
"Demand," he says simply. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween's New Status 
</P>
<P>
It used to be a simple occasion requiring only a few bags of candy, a pumpkin 
and a costume. But Halloween is moving in to the major leagues of 
merchandising, according to retailers across the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything: Halloween ribbons, wreaths, tole painting, shirt designs 
or plasterwear you can paint yourself, decorative picks to stick in plants, 
lapel pins, you name it," enthuses Susan Thomson of Judy's Carousel Crafts in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween is becoming more cute rather than scary. The manufacturers are 
trying to make it a more fun holiday. A lot of our ghosts and witches have 
smiles." 
</P>
<P>
Kids aren't the exclusive target audience of this merchandising blitz. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much more commercialized now," states Monique Bourget, manager of 
Aahs, a card and gift shop in Sherman Oaks. "The prices are higher too. People 
are paying more this year for Halloween decorations. Among the best-selling 
items in the store are mechanically operated Draculas and bats for $210 apiece 
that light up and flail around. 
</P>
<P>
Bourget also notes that many parents are buying small knickknacks such as 
wind-up toys, key chains or plastic eyeballs to hand out to trick-or-treaters 
instead of candy. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Party World in Van Nuys has doubled the amount of store space 
devoted to Halloween merchandise. "There are a lot of new families nowadays 
with the baby boom," theorizes manager Jeff Goodman on the occasion's growing 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween fashion accessories are popular impulse items. "We sell Halloween 
hairpieces, clip-on ties, earrings -- things employees can wear to work," says 
Fred McPhillips, owner of Rainbow Stationers in Sun Valley. "Hallmark even has 
a new line this year for infants -- shirts, bibs and little caps with devil 
horns." 
</P>
<P>
All you need now is extra storage space in your closet.

NOH DRAMA REACHES ACROSS AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 people gathered in the plaza outside the Japan America Theatre 
Tuesday to watch an evening of Noh theater. Many in the crowd could decipher 
the ancient words. But even for them the performance was "different." And for 
those who didn't know the language, it was very different. 
</P>
<P>
But not defeatingly so. This is obviously a connoisseur's art, with great 
importance attached to the way a sleeve is tossed or a flute note is attacked. 
There is a language under the language, and it needs to be closely read. If 
this is true of Kabuki theater, it is even more true of Noh, which scorns wow 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Yet you didn't need to be an expert to enjoy Tuesday's performance. (It was 
repeated Wednesday night in Costa Mesa.) To begin with, there were the 
curiosities of the form -- the torches, the walkway, the drums, the flute, the 
square-rigger costumes, the masks, the ceremonial movement, the interplay 
between single actor and chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Like Kabuki, but different. Slower and plainer. A show still, but less 
dedicated than Kabuki to being a show. The idea wasn't to excite the audience, 
but to calm it down -- to get it to attend to its own heartbeat. The story (one 
of them was about a beautiful lady who turned into a witch) would be like the 
figures on a jar. Looking at the jar would be the real exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Noh never quite becomes a rite. It is a theatrical performance. And the 
second reason Tuesday's show went so well is that it was conducted by experts. 
Masters? Not entirely. Some of the faces were rather young. (The main 
performers were from the Kita School of Noh, with the comic interludes -- known 
as kyogen -- performed by the Nomura Family.) 
</P>
<P>
But clearly we were in the hands of artists who knew their metier and how to 
hold a crowd. Concentration is a big part of this, and the company needed it 
Tuesday night. The sky over the plaza was as noisy as it is at LAX. A police 
helicopter even sent a searchlight down. One or two of the actors raised their 
eyes, but the mood wasn't broken. 
</P>
<P>
"Masters" does apply to Kita Sadayo as the double-faced devil-woman and to 
Nomura Mansaku in the droll sketch about the servant searching for a snail -- 
an actor who knows how to laugh, a rare skill. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't an evening without emotion, but the emotion was generally kept under 
wraps, something sensed from the waver of a voice or the fall of someone's 
eyes. Noh seems a stoic form, one that lets the audience read between the 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
What is on the line is most precise, particularly in terms of sound. Older 
Catholics in the audience were reminded of the old Latin High Mass. An even 
better comparison might be to Gregorian chant in a Trappist monastery -- the 
surprising eloquence of plainchant carried by male voices of varying timbres. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the chorus would seem to pick up the hero's sentence and finish 
it for him. This was confirmed by the translated libretto, where we saw, too, 
that the chorus and principals would narrate their own story, "Nicholas 
Nickleby"-style, as well as act it. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing new under the sun in theater. Noh goes back to beyond 
Shakespeare's day, and in the torchlight seemed to go back even farther than 
that, to the priestly dance-dramas that prefigured Greek tragedy. (The nimble 
kyogen episode suggested servants and masters of Roman comedy.) 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Noh can provide hints to those who want the theater to ask 
bigger questions than "Why was Mother so mean to me?" and "Where did the '60s 
go?" A lot to think about, between helicopters.

Singer Billy Joel was recovering Wednesday from surgery to remove a kidney 
stone. The 40-year-old entertainer collapsed Sunday at New York's Kennedy 
Airport as he was about to board a plane for London, where he was to promote 
his new album, "Storm Front," which will be released next month. He underwent 
surgery on Tuesday and is expected to make "a speedy recovery," said his wife, 
model Christie Brinkley. Shauna Snow

The New York City Opera has threatened to cancel the rest of its season if a 
two-week-long musicians' strike is not settled by Oct. 8. "Unless there is 
movement, we aren't going to have a season," said Martin J. Oppenheimer, vice 
chairman and chief negotiator of the City Opera. The warning followed the 
collapse of a Monday night bargaining session. No further talks are scheduled.

CULINARY SOS: FROM GENIO'S IN BURBANK, A DOUBLE HELPING OF A PEPPERY MEAT LOAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: My husband swears Genio's in Burbank has the best meat loaf to be 
found anywhere. Could you possibly get the recipe? I'd love to make it for our 
fifth wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LISA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LISA: Chef-owner Gene Cecchini graciously parted with his recipe, which 
was given in double portion. You can prepare two loaves and freeze one for a 
future meal or simply cut the recipe by half. 
</P>
<P>
Cecchini also suggested adjusting the seasonings to personal taste. If you 
don't like peppery meat loaf, use less pepper than called for in the recipe. 
You can also omit the cumin, cinnamon, hot pepper sauce or caraway seeds, and 
use your own blend of herbs and spices, if you want. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Add caraway and cumin seeds, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Stir in egg and hot 
pepper sauce to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Pack mixture into 2 (9-inch) loaf pans and place in larger pan filled with 
1/2-inch water. Bake at 350 degrees 1 1/2 hours or until browned. Let stand 10 
minutes before serving. Makes 6 servings per loaf. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Serve with mushroom gravy or other favorite sauce, if desired.

<P>
DEAR SOS: I recently had dinner at a restaurant in San Francisco where they 
served a fried slice of Polenta, which was great. Do you have a recipe for 
Polenta? I would love it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ELIZABETH 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ELIZABETH: Polenta, which is nothing more than cornmeal mush, is a typical 
staple found in various forms and names in countries from Southern to Northern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Polenta can be spooned or sliced to serve with tomato sauce or gravy. Slices 
can also be pan-fried to serve as an accompaniment with roasts in place of 
potatoes or rice. We love it with roast pork or with crumbled cheese as an 
appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
POLENTA 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 quarts water 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups finely ground polenta or yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
Tomato Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Bring water and salt to full, rolling boil in heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan over 
high heat. Pour polenta meal into boiling water slowly so boiling does not 
cease. Stir to keep mixture smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce heat and simmer polenta, stirring frequently, 20 to 30 minutes. Polenta 
is done when thick enough so spoon stands up unsupported in center of pan. 
Serve at once with Tomato Sauce. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Polenta may also be served with gravy, butter or cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Tomato Sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup minced onion 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chopped Italian plum tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in 2- or 3-quart saucepan, add onion and cook over medium heat 7 to 8 
minutes or until onion is tender, but not brown. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 
basil, sugar, salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Simmer over very low heat, with pan partially covered, about 40 minutes, 
stirring occasionally. Makes 1 1/2 cups.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is a free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To delight family and friends with something a little different, try a 
stove-top pizza. Serve it as a main course or as an appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
STOVE-TOP PIZZAS 
</P>
<P>
1 cup semolina flour

HINTS FROM HELOISE: EASY SHINES FOR ALUMINUM POTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I hope you can help me get my aluminum pots bright and shiny 
again. They are fairly new, but it seems every time I boil something in them 
they turn black. 
</P>
<P>
I usually end up scrubbing them with steel wool, but they still don't look so 
great. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. B., Dallas 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. B.: Don't scrub one more minute. You can easily clean them with cream 
of tartar that you'll find at the supermarket in the spice department. 
</P>
<P>
Simply fill the pan with water up to the rim and add about one tablespoon per 
quart and bring it to a boil. You'll see the black disappear before your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Last week I volunteered to bake a few cakes for my church. I 
thought I had four cake pans, but I remembered after I mixed the batter that I 
only had two left. I couldn't get to the store to buy more so I improvised. I 
found two stainless-steel mixing bowls and filled them with batter and put them 
in the oven to bake. 
</P>
<P>
I was really surprised to see that they turned out beautifully. I put them 
upside-down on a cake plate and put icing over them. I actually got compliments 
on my unusual-shaped cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DORIS, Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My husband is so clever, I wanted to share this hint with you. 
</P>
<P>
I put a pot of boiling water on top of my kitchen countertop. It made a 
terrible brown burn mark. I knew we couldn't afford to replace the countertop, 
so I thought I'd have to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
My husband is a carpenter by trade, and he bought a 12x12-inch cutting board 
and cut the burned area out and replaced it with the cutting board. He trimmed 
all four sides with a stainless-steel trim. It looks beautiful and really comes 
in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- AMY, Toledo, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I used to use a powdered coffee creamer in my coffee until I took 
a minute to read the ingredients. Did you know that most of them contain 
coconut, palm or other oils that are very high insaturated fats? 
</P>
<P>
I found a much healthier substitute: low-fat dry milk. I not only save money, 
but also calories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOYCE, Phoenix 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a couple of young children and am very conscious of their 
safety. It only takes a second for a child to get hurt in a kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
When my first child started exploring, I made sure all my cleaning products 
were stored in a top cabinet. I used to keep knives in a drawer, but not any 
more. I bought a nice knife rack and hung it on my cabinet door. It's 
convenient and out of my children's reach. 
</P>
<P>
I also put safety covers on all the electrical outlets. Young children can grab 
just about any small object and stick it into an outlet. 
</P>
<P>
My stove has knobs on the front that makes it dangerous for small children. I 
got in the habit of keeping the knobs off until I use the stove. All I have to 
do is push them on, and when I'm finished I remove them and keep them in a 
basket on my countertop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GINA, Miami 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: We have an automatic drip coffee maker in our office. The coffee 
tastes great as soon as it's done, but an hour later it tastes burned and old. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything wrong with this coffee maker or does this happen with all of 
them? 
</P>
<P>
 -- CAROL, Roanoke, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CAROL: We get a lot of complaints about coffee tasting stale only after an 
hour or so. When you keep the pot on the heating element, it seems to cook the 
coffee rather than just keep it hot. In our office, as soon as the coffee is 
brewed we take what we want and put the rest in a thermos. It keeps it fresh 
tasting and hot for quite a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
You can pick one up that holds about eight to 10 cups. I found one in a local 
department store that is just beautiful and its made for coffee, tea or cold 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My family loves corned beef and cabbage, but we can't stand the 
odor of cabbage cooking. Any ideas on how to eliminate the smell? 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETTY, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BETTY: You can help eliminate the odor by adding some vinegar to the water 
while boiling it. Vinegar has a multitude of uses and its versatility makes it 
an indispensable product. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Industries have improved tamper-resistant packaging and continue 
to seek better and safer ways to package medicines. However, we as consumers 
should also do our part to guard against criminal tampering with 
over-the-counter medicines. 
</P>
<P>
Always inspect the outer packaging, and examine the product inside when you 
open it at home. 
</P>
<P>
Never take medicines in the dark or in poor lighting. Look at the label and the 
medicine every time you take a dose. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking any medication, it is very important to always inspect it for any 
signs of change in appearance, whether it is in liquid, tablet or capsule form 
or in a tube or jar. Remember, not every change in the appearance or condition 
of a product means that the package has been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
The change could have been made by the manufacturer or the product may have had 
rough or unusual handling in shipping. Or changes can occur in medications that 
have been opened, used, then stored for long periods of time at home (check the 
expiration date). Also, some minor product variations may be normal. 
</P>
<P>
If you suspect anything to be out of the ordinary, take it to the pharmacist or 
the manager of the store where it was purchased and have them look at it. If 
indeed there is a genuine problem with the product, they will report it to the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
To be on the safe side, never use a product that shows evidence of tampering or 
that just doesn't seem right. It's not worth taking a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My husband and I go to our favorite Chinese restaurant at least 
once a month. We have found a great recycling hint for the disposable wooden 
chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
They make great sturdy plant stakes for indoor potted plants that need a lift 
or a little support.

MY BEST RECIPE: THIS HEARTY VERSION OF RUSSIAN CABBAGE SOUP HAS ITS OWN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In an effort to duplicate a fabulous Russian cabbage soup I had when living in 
Moscow in 1936, I located a book of Russian recipes put out by the Russian War 
Relief in 1942. Never-fail, here it is," writes Marian Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner suggests removing the meat, serving it separately as boiled beef, and 
using good rye or pumpernickel bread as an accompaniment to the soup. The Test 
Kitchen taste panel found the meaty chunks of beef were also delicious as a 
part of the hearty soup. 
</P>
<P>
RUSSIAN CABBAGE SOUP 
</P>
<P>
1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
6 cups water 
</P>
<P>
3 pounds beef brisket 
</P>
<P>
2 soup bones 
</P>
<P>
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds cabbage, coarsely shredded 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
Dash cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
Dash paprika 
</P>
<P>
Combine tomatoes and water in large stockpot and bring to boil. Remove all but 
thin layer of fat from beef and cut into large chunks. 
</P>
<P>
Add beef, bones, tomato paste, cabbage, salt, sugar, lemon juice, cayenne and 
paprika to stockpot, stirring to blend. Simmer, with lid ajar, 2 to 2 1/2 hours 
or until meat is tender. 
</P>
<P>
Remove bones before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If desired, beef may be removed and served separately as boiled beef.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: HEALTHFUL ENTREES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PEAK SEASON FOR 
APPLE CROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrival of the fall apple crop blew in like the old North wind last week, 
with prices reported as low as 29 cents per pound at some supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
That's not particularly surprising given the current atmosphere for apples, 
thanks to a pesticide-cancer scare earlier this year which sent shock waves 
throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
Producers have slashed the price of their product and are touting its fiber 
content (in the form of pectin) as a major reason for consumers to resume 
consumption of the maligned fruit. Newspaper advertisements urge shoppers to " 
. . . rediscover the delicious and nutritious reasons to enjoy new crop apples 
. . .." 
</P>
<P>
But some consumers are still a little reluctant to resume their apple-eating 
gusto because of a widely publicized charge made on a broadcast of "60 Minutes" 
in February by the National Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apple Preservative 
</P>
<P>
The group warned parents that children face "a massive public health problem" 
from pesticide residues, particularly from the pesticide Alar, which is used by 
growers to preserve red apples, and the ingredient into which the product 
breaks down, UDMH. 
</P>
<P>
Despite NRDC's allegations to the contrary, however, the scientific community 
was quick to acquit Alar (scientific name Daminozide) as a potential 
carcinogen. And most consumers recovered from the "scare." (Even the Los 
Angeles Unified School District returned the beloved fruit back to its luncheon 
menu after hastily removing it from children's plates.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some children who are not so quick to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"No mommy, don't buy the red ones," a little boy was overheard to say in the 
produce section of a supermarket recently, "they'll make you sick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is reason to once again trust in apples, according to scientists, 
toxicologists and dietitians who have investigated the major media event. 
Today, as they did then, these professionals continue to stress that there is 
no need to be alarmed about the potentially toxic effects of possible Alar 
residues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exaggerated Risks 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carl Winter, Department of Entomology, UC Riverside, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that the risks from Alar in apples were greatly 
exaggerated," said the extension toxicologist, "and that the decisions to 
remove Alar were based more on emotional and legal battles than on scientific 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Winter explained that the process by which the government determines the 
"cancer potency" of a particular product was not used by NRDC. Likewise, the 
Environmental Protection Agency and other policy-making organizations 
complained that the data used by NRDC to support their claims had previously 
been rejected by independent scientific peer groups, such as the Scientific 
Review Panel, as early as 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"There shouldn't be a real concern about the apples because there is still a 
lot of questions about whether or not the breakdown product is even a 
carcinogen . . . I don't really have any reservations about limitations . . . 
liberal amounts pose no undue risk of cancer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Tribole, media spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that in general, in populations that eat higher amounts of fruits 
and vegetables, there is a decreased rate of death from cancer. The key, she 
reported, is to maintain variety. 
</P>
<P>
"Have an apple today, a banana tomorrow and so on, so that you minimize 
exposure to possible contaminants in our diet and maximize key nutrients," 
Tribole said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,500 Varieties Grown in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons to again buy apples is that there are so many varieties from 
which to choose. With about 7,500 types of apples grown worldwide and 2,500 
types grown on U.S. soil, each offers its own shape, size, sweetness, aroma, 
color and crispness. The assortment of qualities allow for much dietary 
variety. They can be eaten fresh, baked, stir-fried or used as a garnish. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritionally speaking, one medium apple is a fat bargain, offering less than 
0.5 gram for its 81 calories. Among its attributes is its contribution to the 
daily requirement for dietary fiber. The pectin it contains (1.07 grams) makes 
it a good source of soluble fiber. 
</P>
<P>
But since children seldom eat foods for nutrition, here are some 
delicious-tasting apple recipes, one of which was developed by Tribole to serve 
to her 2-year-old daughter, which should help restore faith to the wary. 
</P>
<P>

BACK TO BASICS: SIMPLE BATTER PREPARATIONS FOR MAKING SPECTACULAR-LOOKING 
POPOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Popovers look spectacular, yet are really very simple to prepare. They're an 
American cousin to English Yorkshire pudding -- the same batter, baked in a 
buttered popover pan or custard cups rather than in a roasting pan of beef 
drippings. 
</P>
<P>
The shell-like structures, hollow in the center, are simply leavened by the 
steam produced during baking. It's not unusual for the batter of eggs, milk, 
flour and salt to triple in volume. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare popovers, measure the ingredients accurately and combine, beating 
with an electric or rotary mixer (Step 1) until smooth and the consistency of 
whipping cream. Note, however, that overbeating the batter prevents the 
popovers from rising properly. 
</P>
<P>
Ladle (Step 2) or pour the batter, filling the prepared cups about 3/4 full. 
Place in an oven preheated to 450 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
This initial high oven temperature converts the moisture in the batter to steam 
and the popovers begin to rise (Step 3). Lowering the oven temperature to 350 
degrees after the first 25 minutes slows browning and dries the interior of the 
popovers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popovers Can Collapse 
</P>
<P>
Do not open the oven door during baking. A draft of air will cause the rising 
popovers to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
For extra crisp popovers, loosen them from the pan when the total baking time 
has elapsed, tilt at an angle and pierce the sides of the popovers with a 
wooden skewer. Turn the oven off and allow the popovers to stand with the oven 
door slightly ajar for eight to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Popover are best served immediately. Well-prepared popovers are large in volume 
and have a crisp, nicely browned exterior (Step 4). The interior cavities 
should be moist, but not soggy. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC POPOVERS 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs 
</P>
<P>
2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon melted butter 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs lightly with electric mixer or rotary beater. Add milk, flour, salt 
and melted butter. Beat just until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Fill eight (3/4-cup) greased popover pan cups about 3/4 full. Bake at 450 
degrees 25 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake 20 minutes 
longer, until puffed and golden brown. Makes 8 popovers. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Oven-proof glass custard cups may be substituted for popover pan.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: VITAMIN A: THE REASON TO EAT YOUR CARROTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Eat your vegetables" was a refrain familiar to most of us when we were small. 
We also learned that carrots are nutritious and help us see better at night. 
</P>
<P>
Besides promoting vision, the Vitamin A in carrots and in many other vegetables 
plays a vital role within our bodies. The health of bones and skin depends on 
it. Vitamin A and its relatives may aid in preventing certain cancers and 
ensuring the smooth running of our immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin A is not a single entity but a family of compounds with similar 
chemical structures and functions. Members include the parent compound, retinol 
(found only in foods of animal origin, such as eggs, cheese, liver and milk), 
and beta-carotene (an orange pigment found mostly in fruits and vegetables). 
Before it can work as a vitamin, beta-carotene first must be converted to 
retinol by the intestines, a rather inefficient process. Nonetheless, most of 
the Vitamin A used by the body comes from fruit and vegetable sources since 
these are generally more abundant in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stored in the Body 
</P>
<P>
Like vitamins D, E and K, Vitamin A is fat-soluble. This means it can be stored 
by the liver, so we don't need to consume it every day. But our ability to 
store the vitamin also creates the possibility of toxic side effects when too 
much is ingested. Food sources present little danger of toxicity. But high-dose 
vitamin supplements may contain enough to do real harm, as the vitamin in 
excess attacks body tissues it normally helps. 
</P>
<P>
One such normal function is Vitamin A's role in vision, as part of a pigment in 
the retina called visual purple. At night, when incoming light hits the retina, 
the visual purple is "bleached." The chemical change sends a message to the 
brain that is converted to a meaningful image. In this bleaching process, some 
of the Vitamin A is destroyed; a steady supply is required to replace it. If 
you're deficient in Vitamin A, you'll develop night blindness, characterized by 
an inability to recover vision after a flash of bright light. Luckily, 
correcting the deficiency provides a complete cure. 
</P>
<P>
Vitamin A is also needed to maintain moist and healthy tissues throughout the 
body, including the eye. With deficiency, the eye becomes dry and opaque and 
sometimes, if left untreated, irreversibly scarred. Children are particularly 
susceptible: Worldwide, Vitamin A deficiency is responsible for 500,000 cases 
of childhood blindness each year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vital to Healthy Skin 
</P>
<P>
The skin also reacts to a shortage of Vitamin A, turning cracked and dry, 
losing the protective barrier against germs that healthy skin provides. Of 
course, dry skin has many causes, and dietary Vitamin A can help only when 
Vitamin A deficiency is the culprit. Recently, however, dermatologists have 
begun using Vitamin A derivatives to treat various skin disorders, including 
acne and psoriasis. 
</P>
<P>
The skin cream Retin-A, also intended for use against severe acne, lately has 
received publicity for claims that it may reduce wrinkles and dryness linked to 
aging. In all these cases, Vitamin A-like compounds are being used as drugs, 
not nutrients, and must be monitored by a doctor. Dangerous side effects, 
including fetal birth defects, can result from careless use. 
</P>
<P>
What about evidence on Vitamin A as an anti-cancer agent? Although still 
inconclusive, it does suggest that both beta-carotene and retinol-like 
compounds, called retinoids, may have cancer-preventing properties. Population 
studies have shown lower rates of lung, stomach, bladder, colon and prostate 
cancer where beta-carotene intakes are high. Possibly, beta-carotene reduces 
the damage that certain forms of oxygen cause the cell. Other research 
indicates that retinoids, experimental drugs derived from retinol, might keep 
cancer-causing substances from binding with a cell's genetic material, thereby 
preventing the uncontrolled cell division characteristic of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immune System Connection 
</P>
<P>
A diet rich in Vitamin A may also help bolster the immune system, which battles 
bacteria and viruses. This system is dually composed of special proteins called 
antibodies and white blood cells, including lymphocytes. Together, the two 
teams recognize and destroy foreign invaders. Studies have found that Vitamin A 
stimulates the activity of both divisions of the immune system. The positive 
effects, however, depend on the amount of the vitamin. High doses may actually 
suppress immune function. 
</P>
<P>
The final conclusions on Vitamin A and beta-carotene in cancer prevention may 
be years away. We do know for certain that large doses of the parent compound 
are toxic. Vitamin A should never be taken as a single supplement except under 
the continued supervision of a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, consuming generous amounts of Vitamin A itself, particularly 
from fortified low-fat and skim milk, and hearty servings of beta-carotene rich 
fruits such as cantaloupe, yellow peaches and apricots, and dark green and deep 
yellow vegetables, makes very good sense. It will provide the full quota of 
Vitamin A for those needs we know about, and may offer added benefits besides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Guidelines on Blood Cholesterol 
</P>
<P>
Question: Throughout the years I have received conflicting information about 
what is a reasonable blood-cholesterol level. Has the figure dropped? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes. By now you've probably heard of the National Cholesterol Education 
Program, launched four years ago by the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute. The goal is to reduce elevated blood-cholesterol levels in the 
United States, thereby helping to cut down on illness and deaths from heart 
disease. As part of its activities, the NCEP established several expert panels 
to develop recommendations and guidelines. One, the Adult Treatment Panel, has 
issued new guidelines for classifying and treating individuals with elevated 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The classification process begins with a blood test. A serum cholesterol less 
than 200 milligrams per deciliter is considered desirable; those between 200 
and 239 milligrams, borderline-high risk; and those above 240 milligrams per 
deciliter, high risk. 
</P>
<P>
People with cholesterol levels in the borderline-high range who also have 
definite coronary heart disease or at least two other risk factors (being male, 
having a family history of premature heart disease, current smoking of more 
than 10 cigarettes a day, high blood pressure, diabetes, a history of specific 
types of circulatory disease, and obesity), and those whose cholesterol falls 
into the high range should also undergo further tests to measure levels of 
lipoproteins. 
</P>
<P>
The results of those tests enable the physician to decide whether a treatment 
program is indicated. The need for this second level of screening is far from 
rare. It has recently been estimated that lipoprotein analysis will be 
indicated for as many as 41% of all adults after an initial cholesterol 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I love fresh figs. Given their sweet taste, I assume they are high in 
calories. Can you tell me about their nutritional value? 
</P>
<P>
A: As with anything else, calories are a function of size. A large fig, about 2 
1/2 inches in diameter, and weighing just over two ounces, provides 50 
calories, nearly all of them from the sugar they contain. In fact, a syrup made 
from figs was used as a sweetener as far back as 3000 BC in Assyria. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to calories, figs provide small amounts of a number of B vitamins 
and, like many other fruits, they are a good source of potassium. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know about potential risks to the fetus linked to using alcohol during 
pregnancy. I also know that drugs show up in human milk. But have there been 
studies of the effects of alcohol use by mothers on the nursing infant? 
</P>
<P>
A: The question is difficult to study, and any firm conclusions require further 
research. Nonetheless, one recent study does suggest that alcohol use while 
nursing can have a negative effect on development. 
</P>
<P>
It's been recognized for some time that nursing infants are exposed to alcohol 
through human milk, although the amount is only a fraction of that consumed by 
the mother. Investigators compared the effects of exposure to alcohol through 
breast milk in a group of 400 1-year-old children. No difference in mental 
development could be detected. 
</P>
<P>
But motor control was significantly lower in infants exposed regularly to 
alcohol in breast milk. Moreover, there was a direct relationship in average 
scores and performance on the test of motor development. That is, scores 
declined directly as alcohol exposure increased. More than 100 other possible 
factors that might help explain the differences were ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
We should point out that there was no difference in test performance between 
infants who were exposed to no alcohol and those who were exposed to only very 
small quantities.

JUDGE ALLOWS ABORTION FOES TO USE 'GREATER EVIL' DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A female prisoner argued that she should not be punished for engineering a 
jailbreak to prevent the greater evil of an imminent lesbian rape. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer patients claimed that they should not be prosecuted for smoking 
marijuana to prevent the greater harm inflicted by chemotherapy treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Carter, Abbie Hoffman and 13 others contended that they were innocent of 
alleged infractions in a campus protest because they were trying to stop the 
greater evil posed by local CIA activities. 
</P>
<P>
And three anti-abortionists said this week that they should not be convicted 
for blockading a Ventura abortion clinic to stop the greater evil performed 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner and the patients and the campus protesters successfully used the 
"defense of necessity." 
</P>
<P>
The three abortion protesters were found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, their case was noteworthy, apparently marking the first time the 
necessity defense has been allowed in an abortion-protest trial in a California 
municipal court, according to attorneys familiar with such cases. 
</P>
<P>
The necessity defense says that laws can be broken to prevent greater harm or 
"significant evil." 
</P>
<P>
Judges have routinely barred the necessity defense in abortion cases because 
abortion, which must be shown to cause a greater harm to make the defense work, 
is legal. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura County Municipal Judge Steven Hintz's highly unusual decision to 
allow the necessity defense could help establish case law. 
</P>
<P>
The three defendants are appealing the guilty verdict that was returned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Their appeals do not focus on the necessity defense, but the state appellate 
court may take the opportunity to comment on the use of the defense, according 
to attorneys on both sides of the case. 
</P>
<P>
National anti-abortion groups, which have been repeatedly thwarted in their 
attempts to use the necessity defense, proclaimed the Ventura case a step 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Judie Brown, president of the 179,000-member American Life League, said she was 
surprised and encouraged by a California judge allowing the necessity defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Stafford, Va.-based group seek a constitutional amendment that would 
recognize the "personhood" of the unborn. 
</P>
<P>
"The necessity defense is the key to all of the efforts with the pro-life 
movement to save children," Brown said. "Protesters are taking action to 
protect the innocent children who live in the wombs of the mothers' bodies." 
Some legal experts said they doubted whether other judges would follow Hintz's 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
To use the defense, Roe vs. Wade, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that 
legalized abortion, must be ignored, said Carol Sobel, an attorney for the 
American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
California law now states that women have a right to an abortion during the 
first 24 weeks of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, use of the necessity defense is a red herring, Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
She said it focuses attention on the question of whose rights are more 
legitimate -- those of the fetus or of the clinic -- but ignores the 
constitutional rights of women seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"The women who are targets of this outrageous behavior are lost in the 
necessity argument," Sobel said. "It was as if those fetuses got to the clinic 
by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its ramifications may be, the case reflects the county's heated-up 
battle over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The National Organization for Women is preparing for what it hopes will be the 
biggest pro-abortion event ever in the countyCin Ventura on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups have united into the Alliance for the 
Protection of Children. 
</P>
<P>
And daily demonstrations outside county abortion clinics continue. Last 
Saturday, more than 300 protesters from both sides confronted each other at the 
Ventura clinic. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura demonstration that eventually went to court arose on July 6, when 
50 protesters grouped around the entrance of the Family Planning Medical 
Associates clinic for five hours, blocking access to women who wanted abortions 
and other services. Of the 17 protesters arrested, 14 pleaded no contest and 
were convicted of obstructing a public passage and refusing to disperse. Three 
stood trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hintz, who was unavailable for comment, told the jury that they could render a 
</P>
<P>
not-guilty verdict if they found that the protesters believed the blockade was 
the only way to prevent a significant evil. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed the defense to introduce literature about abortion and to argue 
about when life begins. However, he blocked introduction of two videotapes that 
depict actual abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice E. Koenig argued that the issue was not at what 
stage life begins but whether the protesters had indeed blocked the building. 
</P>
<P>
The jury subsequently found Loren Broyles, 27, Catherine Garziano, 27, and 
Raymundo Rodriguez, 29, guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The judge sentenced Rodriguez and Garziano to one year summary probation, 
during which they cannot come within 100 feet of the clinic. They also must pay 
a $275 restitution fee and spend 10 days in a work-release program. 
</P>
<P>
Broyles, who said he could not promise to stay away from the clinic, refused 
those terms. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail and 10 days in the 
work-release program. He also was ordered to pay the restitution fee and a $500 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert D. Silver said he will appeal on grounds that the judge 
should have allowed admission of the abortion videotapes as evidence. He also 
will argue that parts of the prosecution's rebuttal were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Silver said the trial was noteworthy because it proved that abortion 
could be debated rationally without the players falling prey to emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"The really tremendous thing of this case is that the district attorney's 
office said if the necessity defense was allowed, there would be so much 
prejudicial emotion, people couldn't have a fair trial," Silver said. "Our jury 
decision proves they're rational, even on real hot issues." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig maintains that use of the necessity defense could allow people to break 
the law in any number of ways provided they believed they were preventing evil. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous concept: 'I believe this is a significant evil; therefore, I 
can break the law,' " Koenig said. "It's opening the door for lunatics of all 
varieties." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some nearby courts have approved its use. In Santa Barbara last year, 
Municipal Judge Frank J. Ochoa Jr. allowed it in the trial of 35 University of 
California, Santa Barbara students charged with trespassing in the chancellor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The students were protesting the university's hiring of a CIA agent to teach a 
political science course. 
</P>
<P>
The states of New York, Illinois and Texas recognize the defense by statute, 
said George P. Fletcher, a professor at the Columbia University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher sees both positive and negative in the tactic. "The promise of the 
necessity defense is that it opens criminal trials to the political factors 
that motivate individual acts of conscience," he wrote in a commentary for the 
Los Angeles Times. "The peril is that governments and their agents will seek to 
justify illegal uses of power as acts necessitated by the public good." 
</P>
<P>
The necessity defense seldom works, said Peter Arenella, a professor of 
criminal law at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Documented cases using the defense go back to the 1800s. Perhaps the most 
famous case occurred in 1884, when three sailors and a cabin boy were 
shipwrecked. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors killed the cabin boy and fed off his remains until they were 
rescued. Charged with murder, the sailors argued that they killed one person to 
prevent the greater harm of all four starving to death. 
</P>
<P>
The necessity defense was rejected when it was ruled that the cabin boy's life 
was worth no less than the lives of the sailors and that they should have drawn 
lots to determine who would be eaten. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, defendants who are motivated by political or moral causes use the 
necessity defense in hopes of swaying the jury with their beliefs, Arenella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited groups trying to argue that they blocked nuclear power plants in order 
to avoid the greater harm of a nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
However, the defense rarely results in acquittal when used in political cases, 
Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
John Erlichman and others involved in Watergate argued that burglary 
wasnecessary to serve the greater good of the United States. The courts 
rejected their argument.

PROSECUTORS ACCELERATE USE OF GENETIC FINGERPRINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving fast after obtaining the first murder conviction in California based on 
genetic fingerprinting, Ventura County prosecutors have already introduced 
similar genetic evidence in two other cases and plan to rely increasingly on 
the scientific breakthrough in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the cases that has already reached the trial stage involves a Ventura 
oil field worker named Larry D. Davis, 29, accused of murdering Dawn Holman, 
20, of Oxnard in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The other case, still in early hearing stages, is that of David Luna, 42, a 
Mexican national who is accused of raping a Ventura County woman in December 
while she was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, part of the evidence in both cases includes DNA 
samples drawn from semen found on the victims that matches the genetic cell 
pattern of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent J. O'Neill Jr., chief deputy district attorney, said the use of genetic 
fingerprinting in major felony cases "is going to increase steadily" in Ventura 
County in the wake of the Sept. 13 murder conviction of Lynda Axell. 
</P>
<P>
Axell, 35, was found guilty largely because of DNA tests that matched her hair 
with strands of hair found near the body of George White, 63, who was stabbed 
to death during an attempted robbery at a Ventura hamburger stand last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A First in State 
</P>
<P>
The Axell case was the first in California to make use of such evidence. A 
state appellate court will review the case, possibly paving the way for routine 
use of the method throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of genetic fingerprinting will increase most rapidly once there is 
state legislation passed establishing regional testing labs throughout the 
state and once the appellate courts uphold it as a valid tool," O'Neill said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said that while genetic fingerprinting may ultimately be as commonly 
used by prosecutors as fingerprinting itself, one limiting factor at this stage 
is the cost of hiring experts on DNA cell matters -- about $13,000 in the Axell 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be using it more and more," he said. "But in a case that is otherwise 
strong -- where DNA evidence would make it an absolute cinch for conviction -- 
there might be some hesitancy because of the extra cost." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said he believes that the hesitancy will gradually fade as the use of 
genetic evidence becomes more commonplace and less costly.

2 COUNCILMEN CLASH OVER CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a debate this week over the building of a civic center in West Hollywood 
Park, City Councilmen John Heilman and Steve Schulte swapped accusations but it 
was unclear whether either won any converts. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to what one member described as "the Heilman-Schulte fight," a 
sharply divided West Hollywood Democratic Club, which sponsored the public 
forum, decided Tuesday night against endorsing either of two initiatives on the 
November ballot aimed at giving West Hollywood voters a say in whether the 
center is built in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the civic leaders of this city are split on the issue, and if I 
had to guess, I'd say the election is going to be too close to call," said Gary 
Kramer, the club's president, who moderated the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman and Mayor Abbe Land are the authors of an initiative that would allow 
the civic center to be built in the park, while Schulte supports a competing 
initiative, sponsored by the Save Our Parks Alliance, which would prohibit the 
center's being built there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Delay 
</P>
<P>
Amid uncertainty over the election, city officials, who had hoped to start 
construction in January of a five-level parking garage in the park to help 
serve the civic center, now say construction is not expected to begin before 
next September. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement, first disclosed by project manager John Given before the 
Public Facilities Board two weeks ago, has fueled criticism from the project's 
supporters that delays are costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman sounded that theme Tuesday, blaming Schulte and others for the delays, 
and saying that "with each passing month, it's costing us $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Schulte and Heilman, whose past differences have often served to enliven City 
Council debate on a range of issues, exchanged barbs that sometimes bordered on 
the personal during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman accused Schulte of "hiding behind the park (issue)" in order "to foster 
his own political ambitions," and blamed his council colleague for "stirring up 
dissatisfaction over the civic center by spreading misinformation about it." 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, on the other hand, accused Heilman of "playing loose with the 
figures," insisting that the project's proposed $23-million first phase "will, 
if it is built, end up costing more like $40 million." He charged that Heilman 
and other supporters of the project would "turn the park into little more than 
a well-manicured lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Both men face reelection next April, and have hinted that they may not seek 
another four-year term. But neither has discussed his plans publicly, fueling 
speculation that each is waiting to see how the initiatives fare in November 
before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divisive Issue 
</P>
<P>
The November election promises to give voters the chance to weigh in on an 
issue that has been politically divisive since the civic center was proposed 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the city cannot build anything that reduces the amount of recreational 
space available in the eight-acre park. City officials have long acknowledged 
that the park is poorly laid out, and say the construction of a city hall, 
council chambers, new library, parking garage and other facilities would be 
accompanied by a park redesign and the removal of an auditorium, library and 
other structures there now. 
</P>
<P>
By law, if both measures pass, the one with the most votes would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the city attorney concluded that, as drafted, the park group's 
initiative violates state law, Heilman and Councilwoman Helen Albert said that 
they do not intend to be bound by the initiative, even if it wins. 
</P>
<P>
In a 12-page legal opinion, City Atty. Michael Jenkins concluded that the 
initiative prohibiting use of the park for the civic center illegally "binds 
the hands" of present and future city officials to "exercise their inherent 
right" under state law to govern public property. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, the only council member to oppose placement of the center in the park, 
and Councilman Paul Koretz, who supports construction of the center there, have 
both said they will respect the outcome of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wait and See' 
</P>
<P>
If the initiative backed by Schulte prevails, it could mean that the decision 
whether to challenge it in court or scrap the current civic center plans could 
rest with Mayor Abbe Land. 
</P>
<P>
She has not said what course she might take in such an event. "I think the 
wait-and-see approach is still where I'm at right now," the mayor said, in an 
interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
With the election less than six weeks away, supporters of each initiative are 
claiming important endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood Individuals for a Stable Environment, whose members are drawn 
from about a dozen neighborhood associations, has endorsed the initiative 
supported by Schulte. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Monday, an ad hoc group that includes city Commissioners Rachelle 
Smith and Brad Crowe, and City Treasurer Jonathan Ahearn, announced its support 
of the pro-civic center initiative and pledged to undertake an extensive 
get-out-the-vote campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Heilman-Land initiative also has been endorsed by the Coalition for 
Economic Survival, the large renters' rights group that dominates many aspects 
of West Hollywood politics. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman, Land, and Councilwoman Albert are members of the Coalition's 21-member 
steering committee, and Heilman and Land lobbied vigorously for the group's 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
However, Larry Gross, the coalition's executive director, said the endorsement 
did not imply a stand "one way or the other" on the issue of whether a civic 
center should be built in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're supportive of the council having the ability to do work in 
the park, to provide services in the park, and to ensure that the park is 
better maintained and configured for better public use," Gross said. The 
steering committee, he said, "isn't for or against the civic center at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Schulte dismissed the endorsement as "wishy-washy." 
</P>
<P>
"It means the coalition is trying to save face for council members who support 
the civic center in the park even though there's obviously a lot of 
divisiveness in their own camp over the issue. From our standpoint, we've got 
to be encouraged by that." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Heilman said he was "perfectly pleased" with the coalition's 
action. "The endorsement is what we wanted all along and they've given it to 
us, and so we're very pleased with that," he said.

ARDEN HOUSE CELEBRATES ITS REPRIEVE FROM CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are a close-knit lot, the bunch that meets regularly on the second floor 
of the grand old Glendale Moose Lodge building. 
</P>
<P>
Old and young, men and women, white, black, brown, they share a common bond: 
knowing firsthand the pain of being cruelly shunned as outcasts or slighted for 
their shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
They are members of the special fraternity of Arden House, a day-care center 
for severely and chronically mentally ill adults. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they had reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
That is when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors partially restored 
funding to some mental health facilities, including Arden House. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Arden House members whooped and cheered when Anne Middaugh, program 
director, shouted the good news after receiving a phone call from her 
supervisor at the Verdugo Mental Health Center, which operates the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic and very relieved," Middaugh said, adding that many members had 
complained that they had been unable to sleep nights because of worry over the 
future of the program, which had been in jeopardy for months after Gov. George 
Deukmejian cut state funding to counties last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors allocated $4.7 million from a property tax windfall. Arden 
House, which costs $250,000 a year to operate, relies heavily on state funds 
channeled through the county. State money accounts for 80% of the annual 
$1.8-million budget at the Verdugo center, a private, nonprofit organization 
that provides contract services to the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Cut Loomed 
</P>
<P>
Without the supervisors' action, the center would have been forced to cut its 
staff by 20% Friday, significantly curtailing the scope of the day-care 
program, which regularly serves about 120 mentally ill residents of Glendale, 
Burbank, Eagle Rock and Highland Park, Middaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts were threatened at a particularly critical time, following closure in 
June of the East San Fernando Valley Mental Health Center in North Hollywood, 
which referred 88 patients to the Verdugo center, said Lynn Brandstater, 
Verdugo's director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
The caseload in Glendale is expected to increase again Monday with the closing 
of the West Valley Mental Health Center in Canoga Park, one of eight county 
clinics where services will cease or be severely curtailed this week. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, members of Arden House wrote letters to their state and local 
representatives pleading that the Glendale program be spared. Fifteen members 
Tuesday joined more than 700 other mentally ill patients and counselors who 
demonstrated for more funds before the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I got pretty shook up," Charlotte Bear of Burbank said when she first heard of 
the threat to Arden House, where she is learning secretarial skills. Middaugh 
said part of the center's program is to teach clients skills that will help 
them find work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dowdy Quarters 
</P>
<P>
The program features daylong, largely unstructured activities in the dowdy, 
unheated and unair-conditioned upstairs of the Moose Lodge at 357 Arden Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Members are assigned to work units such as the kitchen crew that prepares the 
daily lunch. The tablecloths in the dining area were sewn by members, who are 
now making handcrafted Christmas decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Remedial classes are taught by an adult education teacher from Glendale 
Community College, and a pool table and game areas are provided to encourage 
members to socialize. 
</P>
<P>
Bink Fiese, a counselor who has been with the program since it began almost 
eight years ago, said the fraternity-like atmosphere of the center helps 
members develop their personalities in a safe and stable setting. "There is no 
place else for them to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Find Jobs 
</P>
<P>
There is no limit on how long members can participate. But many have dropped 
out of regular attendance after finding part-time jobs in the community, Fiese 
said. He estimated that the program costs taxpayers about $25 a day for each of 
those who use it, far less than the alternative faced by many of them -- 
hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Whitrock, 60, said she "was a bag lady" before she joined Arden House 
three years ago on the advice of a doctor. The mother of three, who gave up her 
youngest to a foster-care home, said: "I lived on the street at Brand and 
Colorado for two years. I had a lot of friends on the street but they're mostly 
all dead now. I see a lot of new people on the street. I don't know them, but I 
feel bad for them." 
</P>
<P>
She now has her own apartment in Los Angeles and gets up long before dawn on 
weekdays to ride two buses to the center, where she helps plan and prepare the 
meals and assists in the remedial education class. "This is home for me," 
Whitrock said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Arden House will quietly celebrate their victory with a special 
lunch today -- homemade enchiladas. Whitrock has baked a cake.

THE MAVERICK WHO TIED KNOT FOR PLAYBOY KING

<TEXT>
<P>
This summer, Charles D. Ara began receiving telephone calls from strangers and 
friends he had not heard from in years. 
</P>
<P>
Ara, who performed the marriage ceremony for Hugh Hefner, founder of the 
Playboy empire, was suddenly a very popular person. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the calls were former Catholic priests who, like Ara, are married and 
no longer considered to be priests by the Catholic church. "Some of them said 
they wished they had been chosen to perform the wedding," Ara said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Priests Offered to Help 
</P>
<P>
Others were from priests who jokingly asked if they could participate in the 
July 1 marriage of Hefner to Kimberly Faye Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
"Some asked me if they could hold the Bible during the ceremony," said Ara, a 
marriage, family and child counselor in private practice in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie was always known as a maverick who is very committed to his beliefs," 
said a priest in the Los Angeles Archdiocese who did not want his name used. He 
caid that a number of priests who discussed Ara's role in the Hefner marriage 
said it would be bizarre for them as Catholic priests to perform the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
But another priest, Father Terrence Richey, said: "I couldn't imagine doing the 
wedding, but I'm not horrified that Charlie did it." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of television talk show host Pat Sajak called and invited Ara 
to appear on the Sajak program. 
</P>
<P>
Ara did not hesitate. He accepted. In fact, he appeared on the show on two 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The talkative and humorous Ara showed no signs of nervousness while on TV. At 
one point during the first appearance July 7, Sajak joked that he could not 
shut Ara up long enough to get a word in himself. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said during the show that his marriage was similar in some ways to Hefner's 
marriage to Conrad, who is Playboy's reigning Playmate of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Is Younger and Taller 
</P>
<P>
Just as Hefner, 63, is older than his wife, who is 26, Ara, 59, pointed out 
that he is older than his wife Shirley, who is 47. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is much taller than I, and Kimberly appears to be an inch or two 
taller than Hef," Ara said. 
</P>
<P>
Ara says he is 5 feet 5 but his 5-foot-8 wife quipped, "He might be stretching 
it a bit." 
</P>
<P>
The couple were married in 1970 and live in Cerritos. They have five children, 
ranging in age from 9 to 16. They met when Ara was a priest at St. Cecilia's 
Catholic Church in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love, got married and gave up my chance to be Pope," said Ara, who 
was born in Los Angeles and attended St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Ara was invited to make a second appearance on the Sajak show, he said, after 
the show received a few calls from viewers who wanted to know how he could be 
married and still refer to himself as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rivera, public affairs director for the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, 
said the church had no comment on Ara's performing the ceremony for Hefner. 
</P>
<P>
Ara "is ancient history (as a former priest). As far as we are concerned, he is 
just another lay person," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Still Helping' 
</P>
<P>
But Ara says he still performs the duties of a priest. He regards himself as an 
ordained Catholic minister and consequently empowered by the state to perform 
weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"I added matrimony to my priesthood. I'm still helping people. I help them get 
over their hurt," said Ara, who is active in CORPUS (Corps of Reserve Priests 
United for Service). It is a national organization that lobbies the church for 
changes to allow married priests to serve again. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he was surprised when he got a call from the bride-to-be asking him to 
preside over the wedding. "You could have knocked me over with a feather," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had seen me perform another wedding in Malibu. They thought I was funny 
and did a good job," said Ara, who prides himself on being able to pitch 
humorous, but thought-provoking, one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Even in his practice as a therapist, Ara says he tries to inject humor to help 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
During a session, Ara said he sometimes switches on a flashlight and tells the 
person: "Lighten up." 
</P>
<P>
He might tell a person who has been fired: "Losing your job might be the 
greatest thing for your wealth. Now, you can decide what you really will enjoy 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he advised the Hefners: "The grass isn't greener on the other side. 
The grass is greener where it is watered." 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he was attempting to tell the couple that people "need to take care of 
their love." 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he is planning to write a book based on a philosophy that also is the 
cornerstone of a workshop he is scheduled to teach Oct. 6 at Cerritos College 
titled "The 'A's' of Successful Marriages." The three-hour workshop, which 
costs $20, will begin at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he believes that successful relationships depend on several "A" words, 
including having affection, giving attention to each other, acceptance of 
faults and appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he had fun mingling with the guests at Hefner's Holmby Hills estate 
during the wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
The Hefners must have enjoyed his performance, Ara said. 
</P>
<P>
"They invited me and my wife and all of the kids for hamburgers at their home. 
The butler cooked hamburgers for everyone, including Hef."

COMPTON SCHOOLS NEAR TEACHER QUOTA DESPITE TURNOVER, HIGHER ROLLS 
</P>

<P>
Officials in the Compton Unified School District say they have filled all but 
five teacher vacancies, despite enrollment figures that are running ahead of 
previous years and despite the loss of 154 teachers who resigned to take jobs 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we are in excellent shape," said Thurman C. Johnson, assistant 
superintendent in charge of personnel services. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wiley Jones, director of the Compton Education Assn., said the union 
is conducting its own survey this week to determine how many classes are being 
taught by substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Substitutes 
</P>
<P>
"We have teachers that have reported to us that there are still vacancies at 
their schools. Some are being filled by day-to-day substitutes, some by 
long-term subs," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said long-term substitute teachers have been assigned to five 
classrooms while the district continues to interview applicants until it finds 
the most qualified people. Two elementary school classes, a middle school class 
and two high school classes are being taught by substitutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 13% of the district's 1,185-member teaching staff resigned this year. 
Three weeks before the start of school Sept. 11, district administrators still 
had 70 teaching positions to fill. 
</P>
<P>
The union attributed the resignations to low pay and poor working conditions. 
Many of the departing teachers were drawn to jobs in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, where a teacher strike last spring resulted in a pay increase 
that would give a veteran Compton teacher who switched to Los Angeles about 
$10,000 more a year in salary. 
</P>
<P>
Although their official count will not be taken until Oct. 6, Compton district 
officials said student enrollment appears to be up over the last two years. On 
the 10th day of school, for example, there were 25,891 students, up from 25,084 
a year ago. Enrollment totaled 25,465 on the 10th day of school two years ago. 
This year, enrollment has gone up steadily every day of school, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One of Best Efforts' 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the classroom overcrowding feared by teachers has not occurred. 
"It's one of the best efforts the district has ever made," Jones said of the 
teacher recruiting and allocation. "The issue is, now can it hire the remaining 
teachers it needs to cover the classrooms?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says he believes the district will be able to hire the teachers. An 
aggressive recruiting effort begun a few years ago by the district is beginning 
to bear fruit, he said. "I feel better this year than I have in the past two 
years because the quality of the people we're getting is a heck of a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The district has advertised heavily across the country for teachers, especially 
on college campuses. Like other districts in the area, it has also sent 
representatives as far away as Spain, Canada and the Philippines to recruit 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The Compton district and its teacher union, however, have a turbulent labor 
history. There was a bitter strike three years ago, and the teachers and the 
district have been at an impasse for weeks over a new contract. The old 
contract has expired. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides met with a state mediator Tuesday but no progress was made, Jones 
said, adding that the district asked for fact-finding. A three-member panel 
will be formed to take testimony from district and teacher union 
representatives about wages and the financial resources of the district. The 
panel will decide which set of facts are closest to the truth. That process 
could take from one to six months, meaning the teachers will continue to work 
without a contract, Jones said.

JUDGE TRIMS CHARGES AGAINST PUBLIC DEFENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge has dismissed two of three misdemeanor charges against a public 
defender who was arrested at a 1987 demonstration against a speech by an avowed 
racist outside the Glendale Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
On the third day of testimony in the trial of Deputy Public Defender John 
Michael Lee, 49, Glendale Municipal Judge Charles E. Horan dismissed charges of 
obstructing police work and unlawful assembly for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Horan denied a motion by Lee's attorney, Hugh R. Manes, to dismiss the charge 
of failing to disperse. Lee's jury trial on that charge continued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Philip Heeger showed the jury several videotapes 
of the disturbances, which broke out at a November, 1987, rally protesting an 
appearance by white supremacist J. B. Stoner. After viewing the tapes, Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner decided to file charges against Lee and three other men. 
</P>
<P>
One showed Lee shouting at police officers as he moved with a crowd moving west 
along Pioneer Drive near Pacific Avenue. Other segments showed fights between 
demonstrators and youths with shaven heads, identified as the neo-Nazi group 
the Skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
A Glendale police officer testified that he ordered the protesters to disperse 
several times through a hand-held megaphone and that Lee was yelling almost 
hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
In dismissing the charge of obstructing officers Monday, Horan said Lee could 
not be held responsible for the actions of others. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the trial, Manes told reporters that he intended to show that police 
officers arrested Lee because they did not like his anti-racist message. 
However, Horan placed a gag order on the trial, prohibiting attorneys and the 
defendant from discussing it publicly. In his opening statement, Manes made no 
mention of racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other three defendants, Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin, 
pleaded no contest in July to failure to disperse and was fined $772 and 
sentenced to one year of probation. The other two men are scheduled to go on 
trial later this month.

POMONA GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO $50-MILLION RETAIL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a preliminary agreement with an Anaheim developer 
who is proposing a $50-million retail complex in downtown Pomona that would 
include a relocated, modernized Buffums department store. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plans are tentative, council members said the project could 
revitalize the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the best ideas that has come along in a long time," said 
Councilwoman Nell Soto. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which would include a supermarket, furniture store, other retail 
shops and offices, would be built on 30 acres bounded by Mission Boulevard on 
the south, 3rd Street on the north, Garey Avenue on the west, and Eleanor 
Street on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The site is just south of the Pomona Mall, where the last major retailer, 
Buffums, is planning to vacate its building when its lease expires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buffums' Interest 
</P>
<P>
Although Buffums has not made a commitment to the plan, Frank Buehler, vice 
president of operations for the 16-store Buffums chain, said his company is 
"very interested in staying in Pomona," but not in its present building. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very high rent structure, and we're in an aging building," Buehler 
said. In addition, he said, the current store is twice as large as Buffums 
needs. He said the company would like to move its Pomona store to a building 
with 60,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made it very clear that we want to stay in Pomona," Buehler said. "Our 
business has been very good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successful Sale 
</P>
<P>
Sales volume declined several years ago, he said, but has improved in the last 
two or three years. He said the store staged a highly successful warehouse sale 
in August, which grossed nearly $1 million in a single weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The project proposed to the City Council by Marshall Krupp, president of CSA 
Real Estate Development Inc., would include efforts to find new uses for the 
existing Buffums store, perhaps as retail shops, offices or as a movie theater 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Nymeyer said that, although "Buffums ought to stay and I'd like 
to help them," the relocation of that department store will not by itself add 
anything new to Pomona. The project, on the other hand, would give Pomona a 
badly needed new supermarket, as well as other stores. 
</P>
<P>
CSA Real Estate and the Redevelopment Agency will have 160 days to negotiate a 
disposition and development agreement that will spell out terms of the project, 
including the commitments of the developer and the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Help 
</P>
<P>
Krupp said his firm will need the city's assistance in acquiring land and 
financing the project. Because the site is in an area where private financing 
would be difficult to obtain, the complex could not be built without some 
public financing, Krupp said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement approved this week outlines the negotiating process 
and sets various deadlines for the project. It calls for the developer to 
submit a statement to the city within 15 days that will outline the proposed 
expenditures and revenues from the project and the requested financial 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Krupp said about 60% of the property is already owned by the city or the 
Redevelopment Agency. The eight-square-block area contains at least two 
buildings -- a branch of the Bank of America and an office building -- that 
would be integrated into the project. The site includes some parking lots, a 
few houses and a number of businesses, including gas stations, a car wash and 
fast-food outlets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Solid' Proposal 
</P>
<P>
William P. Curley III, deputy city attorney, said Pomona has received other 
development proposals for the downtown area, but "nothing of this magnitude or 
this solid." 
</P>
<P>
Soto urged the city to use caution in negotiating a development agreement. 
"There isn't anything I would like better than to revitalize downtown," she 
said, "but sometimes in our anxiety to get development, we give away the 
store." 
</P>
<P>
Krupp and Curley assured the council that the city will not be committed to the 
project until the financial details are worked out and approved by the council.

DYMALLY SEPARATES HIMSELF FROM TUCKER RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) was quick this week to separate himself from 
a recall movement being organized against one of his political foes, Compton 
Mayor Walter R. Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter that Dymally released to the public, he told the mayor, "There is 
no justification for disgruntled citizens to seek to remove you from office. . 
. . You were overwhelmingly reelected. . . . The people have spoken." 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort is being promoted by Concerned Citizens of Compton, a group 
that was formed this summer by Benjamin Holifield and Basil Kimbrew. They claim 
to have 120 members. Holifield, a local businessman, was an unsuccessful City 
Council candidate this year. Kimbrew, a political consultant, managed the 
campaign of Tucker's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew also managed the campaign of Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who was 
elected with some help from her former boss, Dymally. Tucker has accused Moore 
of being behind the recall effort. She denies it. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew said this week that his citizens group is still planning to serve the 
mayor with a recall notice at Tuesday's council meeting. City police and 
firefighters are threatening to join the recall effort because Tucker is 
advocating that the city abolish its public safety departments and contract 
with the county for those services at a lower cost.

HEARING SLATED ON COUNTY PESTICIDE WAREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) has scheduled a public hearing on a 
laboratory and pesticide warehouse that the county is building on its Rancho 
Los Amigos property in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Epple told the Downey City Council on Tuesday night that he opposes county 
plans to use the warehouse to store pesticides and rodent poison. He said he 
will invite state health and agricultural officials to the meeting to help 
determine if the facility will pose a danger to the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory and warehouse will be used by the Agricultural Commissioner and 
Department of Weights and Measures, which will move from its facility in nearby 
Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
County officials contend that the facility will be safe. But city officials and 
residents say it could be dangerous in the event of a pesticide spill or fire 
because it will be near residential neighborhoods and the Rancho Los Amigos 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of placard-carrying residents demonstrated against the facility in 
front of Downey City Hall on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The public hearing will be held at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 11 in the City Council 
chamber. The facility is scheduled to be completed in April.

67-HOME PROJECT ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider on Monday a zone change to accommodate a 67-home 
development on 8 1/2 acres next to the Azusa Greens Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 18, the council tentatively approved rezoning the land, which 
developer Johnny Johnson bought from Glendora in August, from water 
conservation area to residential. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $1.1 million he paid for the property, Johnson is paying for 
improvements on Glendora water facilities at the southwest corner of the parcel 
and has granted the city several easements through the 111-acre country club. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has also deeded to Glendora two 5,000-square foot parcels of country 
club land as future well sites.

AUTOMATED TRASH PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An additional 8,000 homes will be converted to curbside automated trash service 
under the second phase of a four-year conversion plan, approved Tuesday by the 
Pasadena Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Service to the second group of homes will begin July 1, 1990, bringing to 
11,000 the number of homes using the service. 
</P>
<P>
The city provides trash pickup to 27,000 homes in Pasadena, most of which still 
receive back yard trash-pickup service. Collectors ride scooters into 
residents' back yards, dump the trash into the scooters, then drive the loads 
out and dump them into a waiting trash pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in landfill and labor costs have forced the city, however, to change 
to the cheaper curbside service. The new service uses trucks with specially 
equipped mechanical arms to lift and dump trash cans placed at the curb by 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Residents using the new service receive a $6 reduction in their monthly trash 
pickup fee of $18.70.

2 LEVELS FOR GOLF FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena residents and the 700 members of the Brookside Men's and Women's Clubs 
will pay less than non-residents at the Brookside Golf Course when golf fees 
are raised Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Under the fee hike approved Tuesday by the Pasadena Board of Directors, yearly 
revenues will increase by 22% to $3.3 million, using a resident and 
non-resident fee structure. 
</P>
<P>
Residents' fees for 18 holes of weekend golf will rise $1 to $14, and club 
members will pay residents' rates. Non-residents will pay $17 for the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were approved after city staff members determined that 
non-residents play 80% of the estimated 186,000 rounds of golf at Brookside. 
</P>
<P>
American Golf Corp., which operates the course, each year will use $75,000 of 
the estimated $607,415 annual revenue increase for course improvements over the 
next three years.

DOG RUN GETS 6-MONTH TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved a "dog run" at Memorial Park for a 
six-month trial period, making it the first place in the city where canines 
will be allowed to run free. 
</P>
<P>
The run is to be 21 feet by 230 feet and fenced. Dogs will be allowed to roam 
without leashes, but must be accompanied by an adult. People will be required 
to pick up after their pets. Small scoops might be provided by companies that 
produce pet products, according to Barbara Franklyn-Moran, director of cultural 
and recreation services. 
</P>
<P>
The run, near Olympic Boulevard, will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The 
council vowed that, if the dog run is successful, more open space would be 
provided for dogs. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica group called Pets are Worth Sharing (PAWS) had been campaigning 
for the run and collected about 1,000 signatures supporting the idea. One 
proponent of the run said "New York City is a less hostile place to dogs than 
Santa Monica," which bans dogs without leashes from all parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
One critic of the plan said the run is too small and dilapidated. He called the 
park a "doggie ghetto" and said it is occupied by homeless people.

WATER BILL FOR EACH TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Future apartment residents may have to pay their own water bills. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week directed the city attorney to prepare an ordinance 
that would require the installation of individual water meters for each unit in 
new apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment buildings are now monitored through one meter, and the owner, not the 
tenants, are billed for the water. Some landlords have complained that tenants 
who waste water cannot be identified. The proposal would make individual 
tenants liable for costs, as well as legally responsible under a new city 
ordinance prohibiting water waste. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members question the costs involved in installing the additional 
water lines, water heaters and gas and electric lines required for individual 
metering. Councilman Ken Genser also asked that city staff try to determine the 
additional amount of natural gas and electricity individual lines would 
involve. 
</P>
<P>
The draft ordinance and staff reports are expected in about a month.

CITY MAY DELAY RIFLE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buyers of rifles in Santa Monica in the future could be subject to a 15-day 
wait before purchasing the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday directed the city attorney to draft an ordinance 
designed to discourage the purchase of long guns. The council did not set a 
deadline for the draft ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The council had feared that such a law would clash with state regulations that 
prohibit cities from imposing waiting periods for criminal record checks. But 
City Atty. Robert Myers said the ordinance would sidestep the issue. He called 
the wait a "cooling-off period" that would douse potential criminal passions 
but would not be used for background checks. 
</P>
<P>
However, Myers expects court challenges to the law, if it is approved. An 
optimistic Councilman David Finkel, who proposed the ordinance, said "It will 
heighten the discussion throughout the land on firearms."

COUNCIL CRITIC ACQUITTED OF GIVING DEATH THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack C. Guarino, a long-time critic of Lakewood city government and himself an 
unsuccessful City Council candidate, was found not guilty of making death 
threats against three public officials. 
</P>
<P>
The acquittal occurred Sept. 20 in the Orange County Superior Courtroom of 
Judge Richard Weatherspoon. Guarino, 53, was arrested by sheriff's deputies 
Jan. 18 after a rambling message that allegedly contained death threats was 
left on the telephone answering machine of Press-Telegram reporter Richard 
Howland. 
</P>
<P>
Guarino said: "I'm going to do a little killing," and then named Norwalk 
Superior Court Judge Robert Higa, Assemblyman Willard H. Murray (D-Compton) and 
Lakewood Assistant City Atty. Scott Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
Guarino, who has tangled several times with Lakewood officials over a court 
order to clean up his yard, insisted that the word "killing" referred to 
political death. His message, he and his attorney pointed out, also said: "I 
won't have to fire a shot," and contained references to the three officials 
dying "on the vine."

The annual Maritime Days celebration hoists sail in Channel Islands Harbor this 
weekend with dancing, a chowder cook-off, yacht tours and other vaguely 
nautical events. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the event, which runs from Friday to Sunday, will be a 
display of classic yachts and pre-World War II motor vessels from 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The motor vessels will be on display at Peninsula 
Park dock, while the yachts will be at West Bank dock. Boarding and tours will 
be allowed on some vessels at the owner's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Rare, vintage vessels making an appearance include the Cheerio II, a 1931 
three-masted yawl once owned by Errol Flynn, and the Los Amigos, a 43-foot 1879 
yacht built in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheerio was named the Scirocco when it was owned around 1934 by the 
cinematic swashbuckler -- who named all his yachts Scirocco, according to 
Juanita McNish, who, with her husband Dick, has owned the boat for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn used the boat mainly for quick trips to Catalina, buying bigger craft for 
later ocean cruises, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1932 Yacht 
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy motor craft include the MV Deerlap, an 80-foot 1929 Hoffer-Beeching 
sailboat that has carried the likes of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe and 
has appeared in television movies, and the Sea Dog, a 55-foot 1932 Stephens 
yacht that served as a kind of floating hardware store for the owner of a 
nautical parts company. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 13 yachts will be on display. Beginning at 10 a.m. Sunday, the yachts 
will parade through the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the celebration is the third annual Shipwreck Party from 6 to 11 
p.m. Friday in the Santa Barbara Room of the Lobster Trap. Shipwreck-themed 
attire is in order. The buffet dinner starts at 7 p.m. The Happy Haole Dancers 
will provide live Polynesian entertainment starting at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 
per person in advance and $18 at the door. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's chowder cook-off offers prizes and restaurant gift certificates for 
best all-around chowder, showmanship, best costumes and best team name in four 
categories -- New England clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder, fish chowder 
and vegetable chowder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judging at Noon 
</P>
<P>
The contest is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., with judging at noon. Entry fees are $20 
for amateurs and $25 for professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Fisherman's Wharf will be transformed into a dance floor Saturday with "Dancing 
on the Dock" from 6 to 10 p.m. to the local group Hot Wax. Seafood meals, 
including chowder and jambalaya, will be available. There is no admission 
charge to the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Other nautical events for the weekend include knot-tying demonstrations, an 
arts and crafts marketplace, children's activities, a sand sculpture contest 
Sunday, marine exhibits and displays, and a pancake breakfast both mornings.

STATION CLOSURES, UNDERSTAFFING CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD FIREFIGHTERS WARN OF PERIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard firefighters, pointing to occasional closures of fire stations over the 
summer, warned the City Council that cutting services to save money had 
endangered citizens. 
</P>
<P>
They also criticized Tuesday the city's failure to meet their labor contract 
demands. The 87 members of the firefighters union have worked without a 
contract for about three months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a dangerous job understaffed in the best conditions," said Robert 
Thorp, an Oxnard firefighter for seven years. "It's a matter of priorities and 
we feel the priorities should lie in public safety." 
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a 1989-90 budget in June that included service level 
reductions totaling $1.9 million. As part of the cutbacks, vacancies in the 
fire stations and other city offices are not immediately filled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manpower Shortages 
</P>
<P>
Since July 1, there have been 48 days when manpower shortages took one squad 
out of commission, 16 days when two squads were unavailable, and 14 days when 
two squads and a station were closed, Firefighter Tom Sugawara said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a closure may increase response time by up to five minutes, time that is 
crucial in emergencies, Sugawara said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council has no choice, said Councilwoman Ann Johs. The council 
disclosed last week that estimated 1988-89 revenues are about $1.7 million less 
than expected. At the same time, expenditures are about $850,000 more than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad in this decline of revenues that we can't give them the raise they 
want, much less the staffing," Johs said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said they were angry over stalled contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Haggling Over Details 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and the city are haggling over small details, said union attorney 
Stephen H. Silver. 
</P>
<P>
The city has offered to increase salaries by 3% in November and an additional 
2.5% in April. The union wants a 6% increase in January. The difference in city 
expenditures, Silver said, amounts to about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
More than 25 union members protested Saturday at a dedication ceremony for 
Oxnard State Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 30 showed up at the City Council meeting, waving signs that said: 
"Oxnard's Budget Balancing Means Fire Station Closures" and "Do You Really 
Care?" 
</P>
<P>
Silver said the next step is to go door-to-door in Oxnard, passing out leaflets 
to make citizens aware of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, there are no plans for a walkout.

RED CROSS SEEKS FUNDS FOR HURRICANE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local branch of the American Red Cross is asking for donations to help 
victims of Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people sought refuge in 302 Red Cross shelters during the peak 
of the hurricane, which devastated sections of the eastern coast of the United 
States, Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
American Red Cross costs for the disaster are estimated at more than $42 
million. The Ventura County chapter has pledged to raise $62,000. 
</P>
<P>
Checks may be made payable to American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund. 
Donations should be sent to American Red Cross, P. O. Box AR, Ventura 93002.

EPA BACKS REWARDS FOR TIPS ON TOXIC POLLUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In front of a huge "toxic crime map" of the San Gabriel Valley, the West 
Coast's top federal environmental official and mayors from five cities this 
week pledged support for an unusual proposal to offer rewards to people who 
blow the whistle on suspected toxic waste polluters. 
</P>
<P>
The crime map, complete with skull-and-crossbones to indicate severity, shows 
pollution patterns in the valley. The pollution is largely the result of 
degreasing solvents once used by area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel W. McGovern, regional administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, said his agency will help pay for advertisements to solicit specific 
information about ground-water pollution in the San Gabriel Valley. But he said 
the agency is prohibited by law from contributing directly to the fund being 
established by the East Valleys Organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Could Fill a Gap' 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the reward program, "could fill a gap . . . and provide 
significant support for our enforcement effort." The gap is a significant one, 
he said, "because we are likely to find that much, if not all, of the 
contamination in the San Gabriel Valley" resulted from actions predating 
today's pollution laws by as much as 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
McGovern spoke Monday at a Baldwin Park pollution conference sponsored by Rep. 
Esteban Torres (D-Pico Rivera), Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and the East Valleys 
Organization, a community activist group that originated the idea for a reward 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Worst Problems 
</P>
<P>
Environmental authorities consider the area to have one of the state's worst 
ground-water pollution problems. McGovern said it will require $800 million to 
restore the quality of the ground water to an acceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
South El Monte Mayor Albert G. Perez told the gathering at the St. John the 
Baptist Church that he will try to persuade his fellow council members to 
donate $15,000 to the fund. Mayors from Baldwin Park, Azusa, Rosemead and West 
Covina also said they will solicit support from their councils. Unlike state 
and federal reward programs, this one would not require the criminal conviction 
of a polluter in order for a tipster to get a reward. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone praised the program. Assemblywomen Sally Tanner (D-El Monte), 
among the dozens of community, state and federal officials at the meeting, 
expressed concerns. Perhaps, she said, the reward program will be more trouble 
than it is worth. 
</P>
<P>
It would do no good, she said, if people called and said they saw someone 
dumping a yellow liquid into the ground 20 years ago. "How does one know what 
the yellow material was and how does one prove that the yellow material was 
toxic?" Tanner asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Points Well-Taken 
</P>
<P>
"Your points are well-taken," McGovern replied. In a speech, he said, "What's 
needed is not a shotgun blast, but instead carefully timed rifle shots to 
solicit information our investigators and enforcement attorneys need." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he cited the ads the EPA placed in newspapers during the summer, 
soliciting information from people involved with firms that may have dumped 
toxic wastes at a dump once run by Operating Industries Inc. in Monterey Park. 
He described those ads as extremely successful, saying EPA received more than 
100 calls, "a majority of which provided useful information." 
</P>
<P>
The effort, he said, would not only be aimed at what happened in the past but 
also to help sensitize people to preventing future pollution. 
</P>
<P>
John Korey of the EVO said he hopes the reward will attract people who actually 
performed the dumping or had first-hand knowledge as employees or former 
employees of firms that used toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming month, Korey said Reiner, Torres and representatives of the 
East Valleys group will work out details of the reward program, which Korey 
said may be in effect by early next year. Reiner said he will push for 
legislation that would require that, as a condition of probation, polluters who 
are convicted would be required to contribute to the reward fund. 
</P>
<P>
A number of the politicians used the meeting as an opportunity to criticize the 
EPA's pollution cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"What about treatment facilities? How much (money) would that take? 
Considerably less," Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres wanted to know why the EPA does not expand its staff working on the 
pollution project in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Baldwin Park Mayor Leo King said: "I'm appalled that nothing has been 
done to this date. We cannot tolerate this any longer." 
</P>
<P>
"You're absolutely right," McGovern said. "We should clean this site as quickly 
as we can. But we can't come up with quick fixes to problems that were 30 and 
40 years in existence." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Torres said, he had not been pleased with the manner EPA has 
handled the issue of the ground water pollution. But he said he is now "pleased 
to say EPA has become more responsive to community concerns." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting's conclusion, many participants signed a letter asking EPA 
Administrator William Reilly to come to the valley to hear residents' concerns 
about the pollution.

TOXIC CLEAN-UP ISSUE DELAYS PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
MARINA DEL REY CONDOS SHOULDN'T BE AFFECTED, DEVELOPERS INSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 1992 in Marina del Rey, and a bunch of workers in moon suits shows up 
next door to a pricey, new 96-unit condo project. They are not men from Mars 
but workers assigned to clean up toxic waste discarded there 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeowners will be in the middle of a state Superfund cleanup," said 
environmental attorney Barry Groveman, who posed the above scenario in an 
interview. "There's going to be bloody hell to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Groveman, who represents an industrial property owner in the area, last week 
raised those concerns to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission, arguing that 
an environmental impact report is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
He persuaded the commissioners to delay -- at least for three weeks -- plans to 
build luxury condos across the street from the movie-theater end of the Marina 
Marketplace at Glencoe and Maxella avenues, plans that a lot of people had 
hoped to see approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Withheld 
</P>
<P>
The commission, on the advice of the city attorney's office, withheld final 
approval of the project to reconsider its environmental ramifications. The 
matter is back on the commission's agenda Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The project is unusual in that the developers' biggest boosters are homeowner 
groups from the four phases of the nearby Villa Marina condominiums, who favor 
residential over commercial development. Developers Jeffrey Rosen and Paul 
Plotkin consulted with residents even before buying the property, and the final 
plan is a group effort. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Doebler, a Villa Marina resident who lives across the street from the 
proposed condominiums, told the commissioners at a crowded public hearing: "We 
do not see the hazard." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Novak, a consultant for the developers, said the participants should be 
rewarded for "one of the few successful examples of developer-homeowner 
cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorsed Project 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has endorsed the project in a letter to the 
commission. Galanter's planning deputy, Jim Bickhart, said in an interview that 
the site has to be cleaned up but that this should not interfere with the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Another representative of the developer denounced Groveman for using what he 
called terrorist tactics to stall the development. Attorney Lawrence Straw Jr. 
said Groveman's references to "toxics and PCBs" were "merely an attempt to 
create some hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Groveman, a former environmental-crime prosecutor and one of the authors of 
Proposition 65, the Clean Water Act, said the site next to the proposed 
condominium project was contaminated with industrial solvents called PCBs 
(polychlorinated biphenols) and other toxic substances by Cornell-Dubulier 
Electronics, which operated there until 1971. He said the site is on the state 
Superfund cleanup list and is scheduled to be cleaned up in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Plotkin charged that Groveman is lying about the severity of the 
problem, which he and his consultants insist will not be worsened by 
construction of the condos 300 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin's partner, Rosen, said: "Essentially, the toxic issue is truly a 
non-issue with respect to our proposed project. It's being used to keep 
residential development out of the area." 
</P>
<P>
According to Novak, an environmental impact report is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Groveman, however, said such a report is legally mandated. If one is not 
forthcoming, he said, he is prepared to seek a court injunction. 
</P>
<P>
To proceed otherwise is "irresponsible and reckless," Groveman said. "We're not 
saying, 'Don't build.' We're saying, 'What's the hurry to do it in 10 days?' " 
</P>
<P>
Both sides point to consultants' reports that back up their claims. They argue 
over why the cleanup has been delayed to 1992, and the developers charge that 
Groveman has puffed up the toxic issue when his real aim is to protect his 
client's option to buy the property on which the toxics sit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Liability 
</P>
<P>
Groveman readily concedes that he is trying to protect his client from 
potential liability from lawsuits from irate condominium owners looking for 
someone to blame. 
</P>
<P>
But he insists that his example of men in moon suits arriving in 1992 is the 
most likely scenario. Even if further study determines that the contaminants 
will probably not be spread by construction, the PCBs and other toxics are 
scheduled to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Their removal is bound to trigger legal actions from people who have paid 
$500,000 for a condominium without being aware of the problem beforehand, 
Groveman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said PCBs are among the most toxic of contaminants and must be trucked to 
disposal sites in Arizona or Texas. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 report prepared by Meredith/Boli &amp; Associates for the electronics 
firm responsible for the toxic spill said contaminants were detected in ground 
water. The developers' consultants point to findings that the contaminants have 
not migrated for 17 years and are unlikely to do so now. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial tenants say a separate issue underlying the controversy is the 
encroachment of residential development onto the dwindling number of light 
industrial enclaves on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an inroad to eradicating light industry in this area," said Kerry 
Feldman, owner of Fineline Studios, a tenant in the building closest to the 
proposed condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Feldman said he had just bought a tear-down home in Venice near 
his business. He questioned the rationale of urban planning that would 
ultimately force businesses such as his to relocate far from home, adding 
people like him to commuter freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said his company's blast furnace operates 24 hours a day, emitting a 
"white noise" that he believes will drive the new condo owners to distraction 
-- and legal action. "It's the beginning of a battle that will ensue for 
years," he said.

GLENDALE READY FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT BUS WITH NO COOLING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Cicuto spent all of last week preparing his Glendale College football team 
for the adversity the Vaqueros were sure to face during their game at 
Bakersfield College. 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto talked about the crowds, which often exceed 10,000, and the referees, 
who sometimes seem to bow to the wishes of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing Cicuto couldn't prepare his team for, however, was the bus. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros left Glendale at 3 p.m. for their 7:30 game in Bakersfield, but 
were slowed when the bus overheated in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"We were preaching adversity all week and we had it five minutes after we got 
on the bus," Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
With no spare buses available, the Vaqueros stayed aboard and endured a slow 
ride, with the bus frequently pulling over to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale arrived in Bakersfield at 7 and played the Renegades to a 19-19 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously would have preferred a win," Cicuto said. "But under the 
circumstances, I thought our players handled the situation very well." 
</P>
<P>
He'll take it: Cicuto is hoping that he'll be able to enjoy the festivities 
that surround Saturday night's game between Glendale and Pierce at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is still searching for its first win after a season-opening loss to 
Pasadena and last week's tie. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter at Bakersfield and 
escaped with a tie on David Bowen's field goal with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we came back makes me feel confident that we are getting better and 
that we will be a very fine football team by the end of the season," Cicuto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Up and coming: Glendale faces a Pierce team that has responded to the presence 
of Bill Norton, a former assistant coach at Glendale who is now the offensive 
coordinator at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas, who finished 1-9 last season, have defeated East Los Angeles and 
lost to Santa Barbara. They are averaging 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Norton scouted for Glendale in 1987 and coached the Vaquero running backs in 
1988 before joining Bob Enger's staff at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's (Norton) the main reason their program has turned around," Cicuto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the shuffle: While Occidental's Gary Little and Pomona-Pitzer's Chris 
Smith dueled Saturday to see which of the freshman tailbacks would end up with 
the most yardage, Occidental fullback Malek Doulat quietly stole the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Little gained 215 yards in 24 carries to outdistance Smith -- who rushed for 
191 yards in 29 carries -- as Occidental defeated Pomona, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 5-foot-9, 193-pound Doulat had more workmanlike numbers -- 82 
yards in 25 carries -- but had several key third-down runs that resulted in 
first downs. 
</P>
<P>
On the fast track: Patrick Pearson of Sunland was named Most Improved Driver in 
the LuK Clutch Challenge International Sedan Series sponsored by the 
International Motor Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, 38, drove a Nissan 200SX in the 10-race series contested at tracks 
throughout the United States. His best finish was eighth place in the series 
finale at Sears Point near Sonoma, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Horse sense: The Flintridge Riding Stables is playing host this week to the 
Flintridge Amateur Horse Show and $25,000 Samsung Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which begins today and continues through Sunday, is expected to 
attract more than 400 competitors from throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
Competitions will be held in several equitation and jumping classifications. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix, a World Cup qualifying event, will be held Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic: UCLA is sponsoring a clinic for high school basketball coaches Oct. 21 
at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA head coach Jim Harrick, Pat Foster of Houston, Sonny Smith of Virginia 
Commonwealth and Steve Popovich of Marina High in Huntington Beach are the 
featured speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 213-206-6276 
</P>
<P>
Paper chase: The Occidental football team has improved its record to 2-1 as the 
result of a clerical error by Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which lost to Azusa Pacific, 14-0, two weeks ago, was awarded a 2-0 
forfeit win this week because Azusa Pacific used a player who was ineligible 
due to a transcript discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Hamlow, athletic director at Azusa Pacific, declined to identify the 
player who played in two series against Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the school was awaiting an official transcript from the player's 
previous school.

In 1960, Rafael Galindo left his native Cuba for California with only $5 in his 
pocket. He didn't speak a word of English but was able to land a job in a 
cannery and enroll in night school. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 30 years later, Galindo runs his own real estate firm, which according 
to Hispanic Business magazine is the largest Latino-owned business in 
California and the eighth-largest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Galindo expanded his operations to the San Gabriel Valley with the 
opening of a third office at 1071 E. Amar Road in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty agents will work out of the West Covina office, which will handle 
residential and commercial property sales, including escrow services. 
</P>
<P>
Galindo Realty has sold more than $800 million worth of real estate. Last year, 
the firm processed $118 million in transactions.

L.A. COUNTY FAIR IS HOST TO SOME HIRED GUNS: MARAUDING 'KILLER' SNAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people go to the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona to see pigs wallowing 
in sawdust or to ride the Giant Slide or to buy the latest slice-and-dice 
contraption or to admire the prize-winning decorated cakes. 
</P>
<P>
But some go for the snails, says Raymond Harrie. "I've heard a lot of people 
say they wouldn't come if it wasn't for the snails," says Harrie, a slight man 
with stringy blond hair and bloodshot blue eyes that make him look as if he's 
been spending a lot of time in a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Harrie, 34, a resident of Apple Valley, has about a quarter of a million of 
them over in the commercial part of Flowers and Garden, right there among the 
bonsai trees and miracle plant food and wind chimes and convertible hammocks 
being hawked by tradesmen. Seed your yard with Harrie's killers, he suggests, 
and they'll blow away those pest snails that have been eating your dahlias. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the tough new snail on the block," says Harrie, who brims with 
good-natured snail humor. 
</P>
<P>
Browsers in the exhibit hall see Harrie's sign, complete with blow-ups of 
killer snail throttling pest snail, and they move apprehensively toward the 
booth, ready to stop short if some leashed gastropod mollusk the size of a 
Labrador retriever, antennae quivering, should suddenly dart out from under the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
"What do the killers eat?" asks one browser. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch those fingers," says Harrie mischievously. "Don't fall asleep in the 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
Take away the livestock exhibits and the home arts, and the County Fair is a 
lot like a big medicine show, with pitchmen giving demonstrations of scroll 
saws or synthetic chamois cloths or signing up passers-by for hot tub drawings 
and encyclopedia raffles. The fair, snake oil salesmen and all, runs through 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the time-honored tradition of the medicine show, there's often an element of 
exaggeration to those enticing sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
One weekday last week, for example, hawkers were selling wood lathing machines 
("They'll make any man happy"), cushions with battery-operated "fingers" 
(offering "the secrets of Shiatsu, a 1,000-year-old Japanese tradition in 
finger pressure massage"), amazing buffing rags and vegetable slicers that can 
make scalloped potatoes in 10 seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
At first sight, Harrie's claims about his killers seem a little exaggerated, 
too. The snails look a lot like little sea mollusks. Dead ones. 
</P>
<P>
Harrie, who runs a snail-growing company called Bio-Con Systems, keeps them in 
little plastic containers, like cottage cheese vats, which go for $20 apiece. 
There are 100 to a container, thin, elongated creatures that don't seem to be 
moving at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the wrong time of day," says Harrie blithely. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, he says, compared to his little Rumina decollata snails, the garden 
variety pest snail is a world-traveling marauder, ranging freely across gardens 
and yards, stopping for a meal or two of marigold or lettuce before moving on 
in a perpetual journey of destruction. The Genghis Khan of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
But in a good year, the killer snail, a burrower who was probably introduced to 
California many years ago on citrus trees imported from North Africa, may 
travel 60 feet. That's the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
"What he does is consistent with what you're trying to do in your yard," Harrie 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the little crawlers don't climb all over your walls and 
windows, leaving slime trails on your driveway or destroying your plants, like 
the pest snails. But they do eat dead leaves and help to aerate the soil, like 
earthworms. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a composter," says Harrie. 
</P>
<P>
Not so the marauders (Helix aspersa). They proliferate in slimy concentrations 
of 2 million per acre, Harrie says, and they love irrigated freeway medians and 
shoulders. In San Bernardino County, before the county introduced killers like 
Harrie's 15 years ago, there were so many pest snails that they created slick 
spots on freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"People were sliding into bridge pilings," says Harrie, an agricultural 
biologist who works full time for the San Bernardino County Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials confirm that Decollata snails have been used for at least 
seven or eight years to stop pest snails. "The main problem was that the pests 
were detrimental to plants," says Paul Drew, area superintendent for Caltrans' 
Los Angeles metropolitan district. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not a problem any more," added Drew, a 22-year veteran of Caltrans who 
used to work as a landscape specialist. "Eight years ago, there was a big 
anticipation (of pest snail proliferation). Then we went into Decollata." No 
more Helix aspersa. 
</P>
<P>
And no chemicals were spread in the process, Drew said: "It's biological 
control."

CONSORTIUM GETS $60,000 FOR TRAFFIC-REDUCTION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consortium of Glendale employers working to relieve downtown traffic has been 
awarded a $60,000 state grant to develop a computerized ride-sharing program 
and other trip-reduction plans. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is one of 24 awarded in the state since Gov. George Deukmejian 
launched a traffic reduction program last year, said John Wolf, chief of the 
governor's special transportation management task force. 
</P>
<P>
It will be used by 18 major local employers, including the city of Glendale, 
which have pledged to work together to cut peak-hour congestion and to comply 
with state-mandated orders to reduce automobile-generated air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Develop Programs 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said the money is to help local employers develop programs "to encourage 
their employees to drive a lot less." He said the programs are expected to take 
about two years to develop before they will become self-sustaining through 
contributions from employers and their workers. 
</P>
<P>
The grant was awarded to Glendale Partners, a group of major business leaders 
formed several years ago to promote development in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will come from the California Department of Transportation. It will 
be administered by the Glendale Transportation Management Assn., which is in 
the process of becoming incorporated, said Tom Horne, city traffic and transit 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Charter members of the transportation association include Security Pacific 
Automation, Walt Disney Imagineering, Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health 
Center, Glendale Federal Bank, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Verdugo Hills 
Hospital and the Glendale Galleria.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL DESIGN APPROVED FOR $8-MILLION THEATER 
COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved final design plans for an 
$8-million multi-screen theater complex to be built in the Exchange, a 
two-block downtown renovation project. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the eight-screen, 1,800-seat, two-story movie complex -- to be 
built between Maryland Avenue and Louise Street north of Broadway -- is 
expected to begin in November with completion scheduled for next summer, said 
William Holderness of Brand Development, the builder. 
</P>
<P>
The complex will feature a dramatic $100,000 antique leaded- and stained-glass 
dome and marquee at the Maryland entrance leading to a long passageway flanked 
by restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Mann Theatres will lease the complex, which will eventually replace several 
outdated theaters operated by Mann on Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be the most state-of-the-art theater built in Los Angeles 
County," Holderness said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE TO GET STATE FUNDS FOR PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale elected officials this week said the city will receive $500,000 in 
tobacco tax funds to purchase parkland in the San Rafael Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which will be matched by $250,000 from the city's $1-million park 
acquisition fund, will purchase about 150 acres for preservation as open space 
in the mountains east of the Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The money was a last-minute addition to the annual "Christmas tree bill" in 
which state legislators fund pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday morning in the mountains, Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale) said he learned the day before the session closed that money was 
available through the 5% of the tobacco tax set aside for wildlife and open 
space protection. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan asked Glendale parks officials for proposals. The city identified several 
parcels that could be purchased with the money, said Nello Iacono, director of 
parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Iacono declined to identify specific parcels because the owners had not been 
notified of the city's interest.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRESERVATION VOTE FOR MEYERS HOUSE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission last week delayed action on 
designating a 93-year-old house on Eagle Rock Boulevard as a historic-cultural 
monument, but several developers have stepped forward with plans to move and 
renovate the deteriorated structure. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey B. Samudio, chairman of an Eagle Rock citizens preservation committee, 
said at least four people have expressed interest in saving the two-story 
Meyers House, which stands vacant in a fenced-off field in an industrial and 
commercial neighborhood at 4340 Eagle Rock Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Samudio said he toured the house last week and found it "to be in remarkably 
good shape. All of the fixtures are original, both gas and electrical. 
Structurally, it is very sound." The house has been vacant for more than 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the owner of the house told commission members that the 
owner supports a proposal to designate the structure a monument but would like 
the building moved from its boulevard site, said Nancy Fernandez, commission 
executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of a quorum delayed action until Oct. 4.

LESSON FOR LIFE;

<P>
COLLEGE BEGINS NEW SEQUENCE OF ENGLISH COURSES THAT TEACH CULTURAL 
UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS LANGUAGE SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject for the day was dating and courtship. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Arteaga, a waiter from Mexico, sat across from Juachan Jandharawatana, a 
woman from Thailand. Both sipped imaginary cups of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to go to the dance with me?" asked Arteaga, flashing his most winning 
Latin smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't dance," said Jandharawatana, demurely averting her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," Arteaga said, "We can just go to the dance and not dance. You want me to 
call you tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," the woman said with an air of finality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exercise in Idioms 
</P>
<P>
The young man lingered uncomfortably before excusing himself and returning to 
his seat in the classroom. The two had just shared an exercise in English 
idioms as well as an exploration of cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
These differences form part of a course called Intercultural Communication. It 
is part of a new sequence of courses at Long Beach City College's English as a 
Second Language department that, according to some educators, is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely necessary to make it in the workplace," Mary Jean Kolasa 
said of the cross-cultural understanding and language acumen that the course 
strives to induce in immigrant students through role playing and other 
unorthodox techniques. "(The immigrants) are here to stay; they're not going 
away." 
</P>
<P>
An ESL teacher, Kolasa created the courses last year after a survey of 
intermediate-level ESL students on the campus indicated a desire for more 
classes emphasizing English fluency rather than grammar or theory. 
</P>
<P>
The new course series, she said, has two major goals: to improve English usage 
through the study and practice of idioms specific to common situations, and to 
increase students' ability to function comfortably in a multiethnic society by 
exploring the cultural differences that often hamper communication. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those differences, Kolasa said, are obvious to anyone willing to watch. 
Women from Asian countries, for instance, traditionally speak in low voices, 
avert their eyes when speaking to a man, refuse to touch or even shake hands 
with a man to whom they are not married, and expect to stand at least four feet 
away from people with whom they converse. That can be especially problematic, 
Kolasa said, when they are dealing with Latino men who tend to be more 
outgoing, less physically restrained and comfortable with distances of two feet 
or less. People brought up in the United States, she said, are somewhere in the 
middle on the space issue, preferring interpersonal distances of about 36 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differences Explored 
</P>
<P>
Students in the program explore their cultural differences by setting up 
imaginary role-playing situations, engaging in discussions of their national 
customs and, in some cases, sharing mementos of their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Intercultural Communications course, which explores such issues as 
proper dating etiquette and the meaning of gestures, the program offers five 
other courses covering such topics as social interaction, occupational language 
skills, idiomatic language and useful expressions. 
</P>
<P>
Students taking the courses, Kolasa said, get regular college credit 
culminating in a certificate of completion from the college. About 240 students 
are enrolled in the sequence: 70% of them from Spanish-speaking countries. Most 
of the rest are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Educators at other institutions say that, although many ESL classes touch on 
these issues, most are not specifically dedicated to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is unique and I think it is addressing needs that are very 
important," Karen Fox, director of the American Language Institute at Cal State 
Long Beach, said of the LBCC program. "They're hitting the nail on the head as 
far as making people employable and making them fit in. We assume that people 
who have fairly correct grammar are automatically OK, but that's a lot of 
garbage. They need to be instructed specifically in how to respond in a 
culturally appropriate way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Instructional Skit 
</P>
<P>
During a recent class session, the students seemed to be enjoying the 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hitting the ceiling!" said one Latina student, playing the wife of a man 
returning home late with the smell of alcohol on his breath in a skit designed 
to teach idioms. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't jump the gun," replied her pretend husband, speaking slowly with a 
Chinese accent. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Alex Lu, an immigrant from Taiwan who owns a Chinese restaurant in 
the San Gabriel Valley, explained why he liked the course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the teacher speaking and the students listening," he said. "In 
this class we have a chance to do something."

CULVER CITY AT CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culver tailback John Haqq rushed for 266 yards and three touchdowns last week, 
his second straight 200-yard game, and the Centaurs (3-0) trounced Salesian, 
39-7. Haqq's touchdowns included runs of 74 and 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Haqq's game-breaking runs are a big reason why Culver's fortunes are on the 
rise, but quarterback Troy Dunlap took some heat off Haqq with three touchdown 
passes,including 32- and 27-yarders to Greg Hooks. 
</P>
<P>
Haqq and Dunlap are also getting plenty of opportunities because Culver's 
veteran defense has been stopping opponents. Centaur defenders have one shutout 
and have surrendered just a touchdown apiece in two other games. 
</P>
<P>
The Centaurs will open Ocean League play at 7:30 tonight at Centennial (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills at Hamilton 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills had better hope that Hamilton's Jay Fields still has a sore knee. 
There's no telling what running back-kicker Fields may do if he is sound when 
Hamilton plays host to the Highlanders at 3 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton opened the season with a 42-6 rout of Hollywood, and Fields rushed for 
178 yards, scored four touchdowns, including a 43-yarder, and kicked four extra 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (2-0) will be a much stiffer test for the Yankees than Hollywood. 
The Highlanders have beaten two tough teams, Westchester, 17-14, in their 
opener and Franklin, 19-7, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Against Franklin, Highlander running back Brett Washington carried 18 times for 
158 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica at Torrance 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica (2-0) has been winning without the best efforts of star running 
back Mark Harper, who has been hobbled by an ankle injury. Harper reinjured his 
ankle in last week's 24-8 victory over Palisades and is doubtful for the 
Vikings' Bay League opener at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Torrance (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
Because Harper has seen limited action, Santa Monica has been passing more 
often than usual. Junior quarterback Bob Aylsworth threw two touchdown passes 
to Robert Reese against Palisades and has tossed four scoring passes in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax at Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood ought to consider scheduling its non-league games with teams outside 
the neighborhood. Last week the Sheiks were pummeled by Hamilton, 42-6, and 
this week they will play host to defending Metro League champion Fairfax at 3 
p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax is smarting from its season-opening, 20-16, loss to El Camino Real. The 
Lions got out to a 16-6 lead against the Conquistadors but could not hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax running back Mario Mattison made an auspicious debut, rushing for 207 
yards on 27 carries and scoring three touchdowns and two 2-point conversions. 
</P>
<P>
Other games today: Venice at Monroe, 3 p.m.; Crenshaw at Granada Hills Kennedy, 
7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other Friday games: Eagle Rock at University, 3 p.m.; Dorsey at San Diego Point 
Loma, 3 p.m.; Westchester at El Camino Real, 3 p.m.; Rolling Hills at Beverly 
Hills, 3 p.m.; Brentwood at Webb, 3:30 p.m.; Artesia at St. Bernard, 7:30 p.m.

DAIVA'S NAME IS LITHUANIAN, HER VOLLEYBALL PLAY ALL-AMERICAN;

'GODDESS' RATES HIGH AS MIDDLE BLOCKER

<P>
UCLA volleyball star Daiva Tomkus says that her first name is the Lithuanian 
word for goddess. It fits her. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 1-inch senior is Junoesque in stature, and she is a commanding 
presence on the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
Mortals have given her countless honors, and her numerous athletic achievements 
verge on the miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
A middle blocker's middle blocker, Daiva (pronounced DYE-vah) was the first 
player on any UCLA women's volleyball team to become an All-American as a 
sophomore and the first to be named Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year. 
If she is named a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. All-American again this 
season (which looks like a cinch), she will be the first Bruin selected three 
times for that honor. 
</P>
<P>
She was also named a U.S. Volleyball Assn. All-American this year. She played 
with the U.S. national team last summer and plans to play with the U.S. again, 
possibly including the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>

She seems well on her way to becoming the best woman volleyball player in UCLA 
history. She is in the top 10 in all categories of school records: first in 
career hitting percentage (.335), second in service aces, third in unassisted 
blocks and block assists, fifth in total blocks, sixth in digs, seventh in 
kills and 10th in kill attempts. 
</P>
<P>
She needs 14 solo blocks, seven block assists and 104 total blocks to move into 
the top spot in those categories. 
</P>
<P>
Tomkus has never declared herself a divinity because of her achievements, but 
she has proceeded in that direction in stages. 
</P>
<P>
At Chaminade High School in West Hills, she excelled in basketball, track and 
volleyball. San Fernando Valley League championship and was named to the 
All-CIF Southern Section first team. She was also selected as a homecoming and 
prom princess. As a UCLA freshman, she had to play behind Lisa Ettesvold and 
Sharyl Bilas. But as a sophomore, she fulfilled her promise by making 
All-American in her first year as a starter. She was an All-American again last 
year, but that achievement was overshadowed by the team's extraordinary year. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Bruins became the first team to finish the regular season with an 
undefeated record. UCLA headed into the NCAA playoffs with a 31-0 record and 
won three more matches before losing to Texas in three games in the playoff 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA had twice defeated Texas last year on the road, once in four games and 
another time in three games, so the loss to the Longhorns in the NCAAs was a 
shocking upset. 
</P>
<P>
Tomkus said she thinks that Texas had "wholeheartedly prepared for us" in the 
NCAAs and that UCLA may have overlooked the Longhorns because it had beaten 
them twice during the regular season. She said she heard the Texas coach say 
after the match that the Longhorns had spent a great deal of time reviewing 
films of UCLA. She said the Bruins probably didn't spend as much time in 
preparation as Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tomkus and the Bruins have achieved many records and honors, she has 
missed out on the one tribute that would mean more than any: an NCAA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
She said the thought of adding to her records doesn't motivate her. "In that 
sense, the records are not a concern. But the enthusiasm and the spirit of my 
teammates is. It's so alive; that's something you can feel." 
</P>
<P>
The goddess believes that her game still has flaws. "I have to work on my 
passing and digging. I also have to improve on adjusting my hitting styles to 
our new setters (junior Traci Broadway and sophomore Jennifer Gratteau). 
(Self-improvement) doesn't really ever stop; you just have to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the game "is getting harder for me because there is so much more 
that I want. I want the team to win the NCAA championship, and volleyball is 
taking more of my time than it used to because I want (a national title) so 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally top-ranked Hawaii, which handed the third-ranked Bruins their only 
loss of the season in a road match, and Stanford are among the teams to beat 
for an NCAA title. But Tomkus thinks the Bruins can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have to do is get together and play well," she said, "because this team 
is really talented. We have so much talent that (Coach Andy Banachowski) 
doesn't know what to do with us." 
</P>
<P>
Banachowski has experimented with a variety of lineups, and Tomkus has been the 
one big constant. The team's biggest loss from last year was All-American 
setter Ann Boyer, quarterback of last year's 34-1 team. Broadway and Gratteau 
have been starting in place of Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
Tomkus, 21, acknowledges that the team misses Boyer. "I grew up with her, and I 
learned how to connect with her really well. Ann would get us into the flow of 
things, but the setters we have now are doing really well. 
</P>
<P>
"The largest problem for Coach Banachowski is getting us together to play as a 
team rather than as individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Togetherness is something Tomkus seems to value. As she was being interviewed 
on campus, a group of football players walked by, and several went out of their 
way to say hello and to kid her about her status as a volleyball star. 
</P>
<P>
She said the men were her friends, not her boyfriends, and she added: 
</P>
<P>
"Athletes almost have to stay together. (The football players) go to our games, 
and we go to theirs. We're kind of like one big family." 
</P>
<P>
Tomkus, the youngest of three sisters, is not the only talented volleyball 
player in her family. Sister Monika, 22, played at the University of 
Pennsylvania before graduating last June. 
</P>
<P>
Tomkus said she is majoring in psychology, with an emphasis on business, and 
hopes one day to work in the business management field. She thinks her study of 
psychology has helped her in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychology helps me figure out the next moves of other players" and how she 
should respond," she said. "It also helps me understand my own coaches and 
fellow players." 
</P>
<P>
If only psychology could help her figure out what she should do with her life. 
Should she go to work right away or keep playing volleyball, at least long 
enough to make the U.S. Olympic team and play in the 1992 Games? 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to play for the U.S. team next summer and would like to remain a 
member and play in Barcelona. "The only thing holding me back is a lack of 
commitment. I have to decide whether to give that commitment or go on to 
something else."

UCLA SOCCER TEAM TO HOST SANTA CLARA SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's soccer team (8-0), ranked second nationally, will play host to 
No. 4 Santa Clara (7-0) at 2 p.m. Sunday at the North Soccer Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have shut out their last six opponents and have outscored foes, 
27-1. Santa Clara, with its highest national ranking ever, has four shutouts 
and has outscored opponents, 27-4. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, UCLA defeated New Mexico, 2-0, before an Albuquerque crowd of 8,000. 
Senior goalkeeper Anton Nistl, who has seven shutouts this season to lead the 
nation, recorded his 32nd career shutout, extending his school record. Cobi 
Jones, among the nation's scoring leaders with 18 points, scored one goal and 
made it eight straight games in which he has had either a goal or an assist. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is off to its best start since 1980, and Nistl is having a sensational 
season. He has not allowed a goal in his last 544 minutes, and his 
goals-against average of 0.13 is the best among West Coast goalies and puts him 
among the nation's leaders. In his UCLA career, he has been in the net for 46 
victories, two less than the school record held by Tim Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, coached by former UCLA assistant Steve Sampson, defeated UCLA, 
1-0, last year, but the Bruins lead the series, 8-3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's soccer team (0-2) will play today at 3 p.m. at 
Orange Coast, defending Orange Empire Conference champion. The Corsairs have 
been idle for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked UCLA water polo team (4-4) will play host to No. 1 California 
at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time All-American Alex Rousseau and Mark Maretzki, both seniors, lead the 
Bruins in scoring, each with 14 goals. Sophomore goalkeeper Danny Hackett has 
67 saves in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The third annual Bruin Invitational will be held Oct. 14-15 at the Sunset 
Canyon Center. Teams include the Harvard Super Club, Loyola Marymount, UC San 
Diego, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Air Force. Games start at 9 a.m. Oct. 14 and 
10 a.m. Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 4 Pepperdine water polo team, coming off a second-place finish at the 
Air Force tournament, will play at No. 9 UC San Diego at 6 p.m. Friday. 
Earlier, the Waves (9-3) defeated UCSD, 15-7, in the UC Irvine tournament. 
</P>
<P>
At the Air Force tournament, Pepperdine lost to No. 2 Irvine, 15-12, but then 
defeated UC Santa Barbara, 17-9; Army, 17-4, and Air Force, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Sasa Poljak tops the Waves with goals, followed by sophomore Geoff Clark 
with 32 and senior Rafael Gandarillas with 25. Sophomore goalie Wells Guthrie 
has 98 saves in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College water polo team (3-3 as the week started) will open 
Western State Conference competition when it plays host to Los Angeles Valley 
at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Corsairs defeated San Bernardino Valley, 15-13, but lost to Long 
Beach City, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College football team, (2-0) overall, which defeated Los 
Angeles Harbor, 40-13, last week in its Western State Conference opener, will 
continue its conference schedule at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Ventura College 
(2-0). 
</P>
<P>
SMC tailback Charles McKinzie had 15 carries for a career-high 151 yards and 
scored two touchdowns against Harbor. Linebacker Randy Cole and defensive 
tackle Rodney Scott were named the Corsairs' defensive players of the game. 
Cole had five unassisted tackles with 18 assists and two sacks, and he forced a 
fumble and deflected a pass. Scott was in on 11 tackles and forced a fumble and 
recovered it. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is coming off a 36-0 rout of Compton and shut out Porterville, 30-0, in 
its debut. The Pirates are led on offense by tailback Ryan Rapoza, who is 
averaging 6.2 yards a carry, and on defense by nose tackle Eeron Wilson, 
linebacker Lee Jaitt and defensive back Kyron Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
SMC is ranked 12th in the state and 10th in Southern California, and the 
Pirates are ranked 15th in Southern California. The Ventura defense has been 
holding opponents to just 154 yards a game in total offense; the Corsairs have 
been giving up an average of 187.5. 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked UCLA women's volleyball team (7-1 overall, 2-0 in the Pacific 
10 Conference) will play Friday at No. 20 Washington (6-5, 2-2) and Saturday at 
Washington State (6-10, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins extended their home winning streak to 22 matches by 
defeating No. 10 Arizona in four games and Arizona State in three. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA senior middle blocker Daiva Tomkus was named Pac-10 player of the week 
after she had 23 kills, 17 blocks, nine digs and one service ace against the 
Arizona schools. Junior outside hitter Samantha Shaver added 21 kills, 10 digs 
and three combined blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's volleyball team, two-time defending West Coast 
Conference champion, will open its conference schedule this week on the road. 
The Waves (5-5) will play tonight at Santa Clara, Friday night at St. Mary's 
and Saturday night at the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Pepperdine upset No. 13 UC Santa Barbara, winning in three games at 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Cari Delson leads the Waves with a .347 hitting percentage and 
has 128 kills, outside hitter Tami Seidenberg has a team-high 141 kills and 
freshman middle blocker Debbie Merandi tops the team with 29 total blocks. 
</P>

Corsairs lost to Cerritos, 15-4, and were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's golf team, which won the Brigham Young invitational last week, 
and Bruin senior Jean Zedlitz won the individual competition with a 
four-over-par 220 for 54 holes. UCLA is competing this week at the University 
of Oregon invitational.

WHEN PENNANT RACE WAS REALLY PENNANT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's difficult determining when, exactly, a kid becomes a baseball fan. I mean, 
a card-collecting, lineup-memorizing, argue on the playground, ear next to the 
radio all summer baseball nut. There's a sneaking suspicion that a mad pennant 
scramble or two might have something to do with it, however. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 70,000 games ago, the kids around my way were under the 
impression that pennants were never decided before the last weekend of the 
season, if then. Who could blame us? 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1948 and the Boston Braves had clinched the National League flag 
with about a week to go, so all attention turned to the American League where 
the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians were stepping on one 
another's toes entering the final weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Boston eliminated New York with a victory in the next to last game, and visions 
of a "Trolley Series" prevailed in Beantown. After all, anyone who could beat a 
pitching staff of Vic Raschi, Allie Reynolds and Eddie Lopat, with Joe DiMaggio 
knocking in 166 runs, could prevail over Cleveland, certainly. 
</P>
<P>
The Tribe hung tough behind 20-game winners Gene Bearden and Bob Lemon, and Bob 
Feller wasn't bad either with 19. Clear to memory is the Sox bypassing Jack 
Kramer, Joe Dobson, Mel Parnell, Earl Johnson and Ellis Kinder and sending 
Denny Galehouse to the mound to face Bearden because, it is reliably reported, 
when Manager Joe McCarthy asked who wanted to pitch the playoff, Galehouse 
(8-8) was the only one to raise his hand. 
</P>
<P>
It probably didn't matter because by the fifth inning the Sox were hopelessly 
out of it as Indians manager and league MVP Lou Boudreau already had swatted 
two home runs ... just as Robin Yount did against the Baltimore Orioles a few 
years back on swan-song Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After not missing so much as an inning or two all summer, the old Zenith was 
shut down with the home team foundering somewhere in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
New England was still in deep mourning the next summer when an even better race 
to the wire surfaced. The Red Sox of Ted Williams (43 homers and 160 runs 
batted in), Vern Stephens (39 and 159) and Bobby Doerr (18 and 109) could no 
doubt nurse a one-game lead over the Yankees through the final weekend. 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't and, after winning twice, the hated New Yorks traipsed off to the 
World Series to meet the Dodgers, who won in extra innings the last day to edge 
St. Louis by one game. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, the leagues were compact enough (two time zones) and several cities 
had entrants in both loops, so radio moved to serve everyone's interest well. A 
good example was the Dodgers-Philadelphia Phillies last-day showdown in 1950, 
which suddenly created a Boston-to-St. Louis network. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies were backing up in the stretch, but Richie Ashburn saved them one 
more time by throwing Cal Abrams out at the plate with two outs in the ninth to 
force extra innings. Dick Sisler's three-run shot in the 10th won it. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning to get the picture? Year after year with pencils, scorecards and 
radio at the ready, fans settled in for final-day delirium. Adding to the fall 
frenzy, and as if to celebrate the advent of national television, Bobby Thomson 
stroked the "Shot Heard 'Round the World," as the Giants swept away a Brooklyn 
lead of 13 1/2 games in mid-August and prevailed in the last inning of a 
best-of-three playoff in '51. 
</P>
<P>
Nerves had just about become unharried when, in 1956, another series of 
garrison finishes ensued. The Dodgers trailed the Braves by a game with three 
to play, but they won out by sweeping Pittsburgh as St. Louis was taking two of 
three from Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
With a week remaining in 1959, the Giants led the Dodgers and Braves by two 
games before stepping aside and allowing their pursuers to move on to a playoff 
won by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The cross country rivals, Los Angeles (nee Brooklyn) and San Francisco (nee New 
York) engaged in a best-of-three playoff in 1962 that had everyone waxing 
poetic about the fabled showdown 11 years previous. The teams had won a game 
apiece and the Dodgers led, 4-2, entering the ninth inning of Game 3. Once 
again, the Giants pushed across three runs to win. Deja choke. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fantastic flag finishes used to be the rule and not the exception 
before expansion, division play, the DH, trampoline fields and championship 
series stealing thunder from the World Series took over. 
</P>
<P>
Being of a generation where a couple of teams ending up all but tied on the 
last day of the season was fairly commonplace, one assumes a blase attitude 
toward the Orioles and Blue Jays being head-and-head with a millennium-like 
four days to go. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday should prove an interesting day, particularly if it leads to another 
game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the baseball season doesn't seem so long anymore, does it? Welcome 
aboard, you're a fan.

DODGER ORGANIZATION HAS ENDURED LEAN YEARS BUT IT MAY BE CHANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the middle of another 105-degree afternoon in an 8,000-seat ballpark last 
week, Guy Wellman turned from the baseball game in front of him to glare at a 
Dodger prospect in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The kid's biggest problem was, he was also the only person in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"Be awake up there," shouted Wellman, the Dodgers' minor league field 
coordinator. "It's your job to pick up the foul balls, and there's foul balls 
everywhere!" 
</P>
<P>
It is here, in the isolation of the Arizona Instructional League, that Wellman 
and his instructors have once again been given the hope of the Dodgers' future. 
For the next month, with no fans or newspaper coverage, the Dodger prospects 
will work on everything from new curveballs to old swings to the proper way to 
collect foul balls. 
</P>
<P>
For such a high-profile organization, this kind of privacy can be unnerving. 
But this fall, it is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is here one notices that although the Dodgers have some of the best 
prospects in baseball, most of them are not real close to Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them, in fact, have just started receiving paychecks. Most of them 
spent last season in places such as Great Falls, Mont., and Bakersfield, Class 
A towns. Many will spend next summer in San Antonio, the double-A town. And 
then there will be a summer in triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
It is here, then, that one realizes the Dodger future is not now, but more like 
1992. And it is here that one can plainly see why. 
</P>
<P>
On one mound is 1988's No. 1 draft pick, Bill Bene, a pitcher working on 
control that at one point was so poor last year, the only hitter he was allowed 
to face was a mannequin. 
</P>
<P>
On another mound is 1987's No. 1 draft pick, Dan Opperman, who because of 
injuries suffered before the draft has pitched 19 games in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's 1986's No. 1 draft pick, Mike White. He's not on any field. After 
batting .227 for San Antonio this summer, he was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sitting home, trying to figure out why he had such a poor year," Wellman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a series of bad and unfortunate drafts have been transferred 
from here all the way to the big league Dodger lineup card. In a recent 
September series against Atlanta that featured an average of five Brave 
prospects on the field per night, the Dodgers had one -- shortstop Jose 
Vizcaino, a non-drafted signee from the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouting is just a guessing game," said Ben Wade, who has been the Dodgers' 
scouting director since 1973. "You have to be lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball people used to say that Dodger scouts weren't just lucky, but good. In 
1968, with many of the same scouts who work today, the Dodgers put together 
what is generally agreed as the best draft in history. They signed nine players 
who later made the major leagues, among them Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes and Ron 
Cey. 
</P>
<P>
That picture has changed. Not counting last June's, it has taken the Dodgers 
their previous five drafts combined to find nine big league players. And of 
those nine, only pitcher John Wetteland, drafted in 1985, plays a major part in 
immediate Dodger plans. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 active Dodgers who will end the season, only eight were acquired in 
the draft. And in the annual September recall of triple-A stars, only five 
players were recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had some seriously lean years over there," one scout said of the 
Dodgers. "They always took players nobody else would touch, like they thought 
they were smarter than everyone else. Lately, they haven't looked so smart." 
</P>
<P>
They recovered in last June's draft to make three first-round picks that became 
the envy of baseball. Pitchers Kiki Jones and Jamie McAndrew combined to go 
19-0 with a 1.62 earned-run average for Great Falls in the Class A Pioneer 
League, and outfielder teammate Tom Goodwin hit .308 and stole a league-record 
60 bases in 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
But even those players know the problems they were hired to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are coming in to try and rebuild the Dodgers," Jones said during a 
break in Arizona. "We know we've got the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that there isn't talent closer to the big leagues. Albuquerque sent 
the Dodgers two players who became starting pitchers at midseason -- Ramon 
Martinez and Wetteland. And the Dodgers double-play combination of the future 
is at Albuquerque (soon-to-be second baseman Vizcaino) and San Antonio 
(shortstop Jose Offerman). 
</P>
<P>
But considering this is an organization that could use a power hitter, there is 
little help above Class A Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Only three players at Albuquerque hit double figures in both homers and runs 
batted in. One, Mike Huff, struggled in limited major league action. Another, 
Javier Ortiz, was traded and still another, Tracy Woodson, quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
Only one player at San Antonio had double figures in homers and RBIs, Luis 
Lopez. But even though he was a No. 2 draft pick, his future is not considered 
bright since he was picked six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be the first to admit, we have had better younger players in the last few 
years," said Wade, who was a Dodger scout in the 1968 glory days. 
</P>
<P>
The scouting department's slump began in 1983, when the Dodgers decided that 
they needed a left-handed pitcher. So in the first round, they passed on a 
young right-hander from Texas named Roger Clemens and took Wichita State's Eric 
Sonberg. You can reach Sonberg in the office of Beverly Hills agent Dennis 
Gilbert, where he is embarking on a new career. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to have that left-hander," Wade said. "That happens sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
The next year, their first pick was another left-hander, Oklahoma State's 
Dennis Livingston. He has long since been released by this organization, and 
several others. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, their first pick was outfielder Chris Gwynn of San Diego State. 
Because of injuries, he has appeared in only 61 big league games since. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never know what kind of pick that was until he stays healthy," Wade 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the first of three first-round picks, from which the Dodgers have yet 
to recover: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outfielder Mike White, 1986: He was the Tennessee high school player of the 
year, a great contact hitter who could run. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were stunned when he was taken in the first round," said one longtime 
scout, who said he immediately asked his boss if he should have been checking 
White out. 
</P>
<P>
"My boss told me no, that he wasn't even on our organization's first 
three-round list," the scout said. "It was like the Dodgers knew something 
nobody else knew." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wade: "It's easy to second-guess now. But we liked the kid." 
</P>
<P>
Wade, however, admitted he never saw him. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I never saw him play, but we had enough people who did," he said. "I guess 
right now, I'd have to admit it was a bad pick." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Dan Opperman, 1987: The Las Vegas high school star would have been 
everyone's first pick except for a twinge in his right elbow. The Dodgers were 
the only ones who had the elbow examined. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told he was fine," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours after he reported to Great Falls, while pitching in the bullpen, 
the elbow collapsed. A couple of weeks later, he had reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, in his last simulated game before trying a regular-season 
comeback, the elbow collapsed again. There was another operation, this time to 
clean out scar tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Put on a slow rehabilitation schedule that allowed only a couple of innings per 
start, Opperman finally began pitching this year for Class A Vero Beach. 
Because he left most of his games before he was eligible for a victory, he went 
0-7 despite a 3.54 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
But in his last start, he pitched a strong 5 1/3 innings. And because he is 20, 
the Dodgers remain hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"I would take him again," Wade said. "Nobody in the organization has said a 
word to me about it, nobody has laid any blame on me, because he can still be a 
good pick." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, he will be a pick with a motive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try and stop all this bad talk about me," Opperman said quietly. 
"I know it's put-up or shut-up time for me. And I'd like to shut everybody up." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Bill Bene, 1988: The scouts knew that this former Cal State Los 
Angeles outfielder still had an outfielder's wild arm. The Dodgers, as usual, 
saw this not as a problem but a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Give them credit," one scout said. "Most of us were afraid to take a 
first-round chance on taming this guy. If they can do it, it's a great pick." 
</P>
<P>
So far, they haven't done it. In a streak of wildness unmatched this summer in 
professional baseball, the quiet, polite Bene walked 56 batters in 27 innings 
at Bakersfield and Class A Salem. He had nearly as many wild pitches, 18, as 
strikeouts, 24. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in only 14 games, not because he was injured, but because the 
Dodgers couldn't trust him. When he was so wild in one Bakersfield batting 
practice that he broke the wrist of outfielder Bryan Beals, the Dodgers thought 
they would try something innovative. They had no idea one little mannequin 
could cause such a stir. 
</P>
<P>
"I go into the clubhouse after a road trip one day and I see this 
feminine-looking mannequin at my locker," Bene said. "They wanted me to pitch 
to it. I said fine. I would try anything." 
</P>
<P>
So he put a mustache on the dummy, dressed it up like a Dodger, called it 
Harold, and pitched to it. But just twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Then a couple of infielders started pitching to it and hit it right across the 
pelvic area," he said. "Its arms went one way, its legs went another way, and 
that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Said minor league pitching instructor Dave Wallace: "As strange as it may seem, 
it probably worked." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers hope something will work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gamble, and I know if he doesn't make it, a lot of people are going 
to take some heat," Wade said. "But look at all he's overcome. He'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, all he's got to do is throw the ball over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Bene sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it ends soon," he said of his wildness problem. "This has been like a 
joke. This has been the nightmare of my life."

IRVIN RETURNS TO RAMS, SAYS HE'S READY TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After his 30-day substance-abuse suspension was announced last Aug. 29, Ram 
cornerback LeRoy Irvin took his two young sons and headed for Big Bear, hoping 
there his problems would disappear into the thin mountain air. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to hide," Irvin said Wednesday, his first day back at Rams Park 
since his suspension was lifted. "But people would recognize me in Big Bear. I 
figured there was nowhere I could hide, so I'd better go try and get help, so 
that's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, a two-time Pro Bowl player, checked himself into a substance 
rehabilitation center and began to face the problem he thought he never had. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of shocked and upset," Irvin said of his suspension. "At the time I 
didn't feel bad for myself, I felt bad for all the people that respected me, 
the coaching staff, players, fans, especially the children out there who I 
spend a lot of time with. I really felt bad for those people. Then, as the 
suspension wore on, I started feeling bad for myself, because I had the 
problem. They didn't have the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin's problem has never been clearly defined, although it is believed to be 
associated with either alcohol or marijuana. Irvin tested positive for 
marijuana use last summer and has been tested regularly since. He tested 
positive again after a reported binge during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Again on Wednesday, Irvin would not reveal what substance he violated, saying 
it wasn't relevant. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can say is, regardless of what the substance is, a person can 
have a problem," he said. "A person can have a problem with marijuana, you can 
have a problem with alcohol, you can have a problem with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"The substance is put in the forefront a lot of the times. But it's not really 
the substance, it's the problem. What are you trying to hide? What are you 
trying to mask? It's not the substance, it's the person. I really don't want to 
talk about any substances." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said he underwent serious personal reflection during his suspension, and 
hopes a new spiritual acknowledgment will lead to changes in his life style and 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many changes in my life," he said. "I no longer want to go in bars, 
things like that. The main thing is that I'm back, I'm in shape and I'm ready 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said he kept close watch on the Rams while he was away. Former teammate 
Eric Dickerson called Irvin in the hospital and offered to videotape 
Dickerson's return to Anaheim Stadium on Sept. 17. The game was blacked out 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric called me a few times," Irvin said. "I really respect him for calling me 
when I was in the hospital. Doug Reed called me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said he would do what he could to restore his image in Orange County, 
where he was active in the community and a Little League coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids look up to you as sort of an American hero," he said. "Now during 
this time all the heroes are seemingly getting shot down. This is another blow 
to them, but I think they all have to realize that we're all human and everyone 
makes mistakes. And if they're going to try be like somebody, try to be like 
Jesus Christ . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad that it had to happened, it'll make me a better person and I think 
it was the best thing to happen to me at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin returned to practice Wednesday and was worked in quickly at his right 
cornerback position. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his suspension, Coach John Robinson said Irvin's loss would only 
be a distraction if teams started throwing over his right cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's exactly what has happened to Cliff Hicks, Irvin's replacement, who 
has been beaten on several long passes. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Irvin would likely start Sunday's game against San Francisco at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that means covering All-Pro receiver Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"Man," Irvin said. "I have no comment on that." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin said he's actually up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really ready to play until I covered Henry Ellard on a route," Irvin 
said. "That told me this is how the receivers are in this league. I think Henry 
is by far the best receiver in the league right now, he and Rice are without a 
doubt the two best in the league. I told him if I work against him during the 
week I'll be ready for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin was glad to be back. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't awkward," he said of facing teammates again. "Because everyone knew. 
It was hard leaving. The first three days were the hardest. Coming back wasn't 
hard at all, because now everything is in the open. There's no reason to hide, 
or feel ashamed, because it's all behind me now." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin was tired of being a fan anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned into quite a critic," he said. "Now I get a chance to be a player 
again. I realize I had a problem, went and got help." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The team released wide receiver Mike Williams off injured reserve. . . . 
Receiver Aaron Cox bruised his shoulder in a practice collision with Jerry Gray 
and is listed as day-to-day. . . . Tackle Irv Pankey (strained back) didn't 
practice Wednesday, but he's probable for Sunday's game.

GIANTS ARE SWEPT BY DODGERS BUT STILL WIN NL WEST; 
</P>
<P>
BELCHER PITCHES A FOUR-HITTER IN A 1-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen grown men in their underwear crowded into a tiny food and laundry room 
in the back of the Dodger Stadium visitors' clubhouse late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them draped their arms around each other. Others placed their hands on 
their heads. All of them stared at a tiny brown radio. 
</P>
<P>
Together, after their 1-0 defeat by the Dodgers, the San Francisco Giants were 
counting down the last out in the 13th inning of the San Diego Padres' loss to 
the Cincinnati Reds that would give them the National League West championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh and one!" they shouted when Cincinnati's Norm Charlton threw a first strike 
to San Diego's Garry Templeton with two out and the Padres trailing, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh and two, oh and two!" they chanted on the second strike. 
</P>
<P>
Then came news of a third strike, followed by a second of disbelieving silence 
. . . followed by an eruption. They punched out a board in the ceiling, they 
overturned the burners on the stove and then they paraded into a bath of 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Who says you have to celebrate on the field? The Giants realized it feels just 
as good anywhere as they clinched their second division championship in three 
years despite losing three consecutive games in a courageous but fruitless 
roadblock by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a four-game lead with three games in San Diego remaining, the Giants' 
next important stop will be in Chicago, where they will meet the Cubs Wednesday 
in the first game of the National League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
"This feels as good as doing it on the field -- this feels even better than 
when we did it in 1987," shouted Will Clark, parading around in just his jeans 
and a Giant hat that read, "We Won, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Added Clark: "In 1987, we felt like we were lucky. Now, we feel like we've got 
a World Series to get to." 
</P>
<P>
Other Giants had no such explanations. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart is thumping so loud right now, I can hardly breathe," Chris Speier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On a night that was as unusual as it was long, that figures. The Giants' loss 
to the Dodgers on a four-hit shutout by Tim Belcher ended about 9:30 p.m. 
Minutes earlier, the Padres had tied the Reds, 1-1, in the ninth at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
So, while the Dodgers were in their clubhouse celebrating that they might be 
sending the Giants into a three-game showdown in San Diego, the Giants were in 
their clubhouse listening to the radio and being confused. Their wait lasted 
nearly an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's OK, if the Padres win; we can just beat them tomorrow," Mike Laga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was informed that the first game of the Padre series was not today, but 
Friday, he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows you how pumped up we are," he said. "Shoot, we'll play them in an 
intrasquad game tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessary. In fact, today the Giants will have their team party at Manager 
Roger Craig's home east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do that if the Padres win or lose," Matt Williams said before 
hearing the news. "We need to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they had just been swept in a series for the first time this season. 
They had not lost a series this season until Belcher recorded his seventh 
consecutive victory and league-high eighth shutout, while four Dodgers made 
big-league catches behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before 34,210 fans at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers got their 
game-winning hit in the first inning. But even that hit had drama as Mike Davis 
singled home Alfredo Griffin from third base for his first RBI since June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a heck of a lot to celebrate for us, not a heck of a lot to look 
forward to," Belcher said afterward. "So tonight was it." 
</P>
<P>
Give that man not only a gold star, but a purple heart. Moments after the game 
began, it was announced that he would have surgery today to remove bone chips 
in his right hand. After the game, he revealed that he had broken the hand 
April 30 but had asked the Dodgers to keep the news quiet until now. 
</P>
<P>
"What was the use of telling anybody?" Belcher said. "If I did, then everytime 
I pitched bad somebody would blame the fracture. And everytime I pitched good, 
they would call me a he-man. 
</P>
<P>
"That didn't make sense. You've got to pitch with pain in this game, and 
there's nothing huge or unusual about it." 
</P>
<P>
And so he finished with his most huge and unusual game of the season. The 
game's first batter, Brett Butler, looped a ball into left field for a single. 
But then Belcher didn't give up a hit to the next 21 batters, walking only one 
during that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up a bloop single by Ernest Riles with two out in the seventh, he 
then yielded a Ken Oberkfell single in the eighth and a Kevin Mitchell single 
in the ninth. In all three late-inning rallies, he was saved by the glove. 
</P>
<P>
After Riles' single, Williams hit a fly to deep center field that John Shelby 
leaped and caught at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it had a chance to get out," Williams said. "Just found the biggest 
part of the park." 
</P>
<P>
It also found one of Wednesday's biggest players, as Shelby did nearly the same 
thing in the eighth. After Oberkfell had singled with two out, and pinch-runner 
Donnell Nixon had moved to second base on a wild pitch, Butler hit a fly to 
deep center that Shelby chased down for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to lead off the ninth, right fielder Jose Gonzalez made a leaping 
catch of Laga's fly ball against the right-field wall. Then Billy Bean made a 
diving catch of a Clark bloop in left field. 
</P>
<P>
After Mitchell's single, Gonzalez made another running catch of a fly ball to 
end a game that had, appropriately, started when Willie Randolph made a diving 
stop of Clark's grounder in the first inning to stop Butler from scoring from 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"Those plays kind of took the wind out of their sails," said Randolph, who 
offered a different sort of Dodger view on the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the kind of guy who gets all goofy over this stuff," he said. "The 
bottom line is, they are going to the playoffs and we aren't. And no matter 
what we do, that's no fun." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Norman Zemel will perform Tim Belcher's hand surgery this morning at 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center. Belcher injured his hand while batting in 
St. Louis April 30. The ball hit him during a check swing. The hand would swell 
after he pitched but usually felt better four days later. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Dave Anderson said Wednesday that if the Dodgers did not offer him a 
contract by the end of the World Series, he would probably declare himself a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants will tentatively use a playoff pitching rotation of Scott Garrelts, 
Rick Reuschel and Don Robinson.

CHICAGO CARRIES ON, CARRIES TEAM ON ITS BIG SHOULDERS AFTER NL EAST IS WON

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Odds are that Pablo Picasso wasn't much of a Chicago Cubs fan, but Wednesday 
the huge Picasso statue that stands guard over the Loop's Civic Center plaza 
was sporting a huge, blue Cub cap with a big red C in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Someone also put a Cub jersey on the statue of Nathan Hale in front of the 
Chicago Tribune building. And the streets were suddenly awash in Cub jerseys, 
buttons, banners and banter. 
</P>
<P>
"WE'RE IN," declared the banner headline in the Chicago Sun-Times, and anybody 
who had to ask who the We referred to surely must have been a foreigner, 
extra-terrestrial or worse. It was the Cubs, the break-your-heart, 
swoon-in-June, they'll-find-a-way-to-blow-it-somehow Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Not this year, however. Or at least not so far this year. The Cubs, who 
stumbled through spring training and began the season a reasonably good bet to 
finish in their customary spot near the bottom of the standings, clinched the 
National League's East Division title Tuesday night with a 3-2 victory over the 
Expos in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago went wild. Within minutes of Tuesday's last pitch, thousands of 
shrieking fans poured into the streets near Wrigley Field. Police chased them 
off after about an hour's worth of singing, chanting and drinking, but the 
party was just starting. 
</P>
<P>
Although the team was still in Montreal for another game, the city held a huge 
noontime pep rally in the civic center plaza that featured local sports and 
media stars and, of course, politicians eager to bask in the glow of a winner. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 fans roared approval as Mayor Richard M. Daley painted a big 
black X next to the word division on a huge banner that also had spots reserved 
for future marks next to the words pennant and World championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are all Cubs fans," declared Daley, who grew up in the shadow of 
Comiskey Park, home of the White Sox -- who figure to finish last in the 
American League's Western Division and are definitely the second team in this 
second city. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, such hoopla might seem a bit premature. After all, the Cubs still 
have to beat the Western Division champions, probably the San Francisco Giants, 
just to get into the World Series. But Cub fans are a special breed, steeped in 
pessimism and inured to adversity. No matter how well the team is doing, the 
average Cub follower knows that failure is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The team hasn't won a World Series since 1908 and hasn't even played in one 
since a few weeks after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. The Cubs did win the 
division title in 1984, but then blew a two-game lead and lost the playoffs to 
the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Chicagoans are still muttering about 1969, the infamous year the Cubs built a 
huge lead going into the closing weeks and still managed to drop the division 
title to the Amazin' Mets. 
</P>
<P>
With such a dubious record behind them, Cub fans can't afford to pass up a 
reason to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they would make it this far," said Dave Livingston, 22, who 
turned out for Wednesday's rally. " . . . All the way!" he chanted. 
</P>
<P>
Another fan, Rob Pierson, 27, drove more than 20 miles from his suburban home 
to join in the postgame revelry outside Wrigley Field Tuesday night, and he was 
on hand for Wednesday's celebration as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We're it!" he screamed, in a hoarse voice. 
</P>
<P>
Cub fever also triggered a run on Cub memorabilia Wednesday as customers 
flooded sporting goods shops and other stores to snap up T-shirts, caps and 
other products with the team insignia on them. Long lines formed outside the 
two official Cub stores in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wisniewski, merchandising manager for the shops as well as for 
concession stands at the ballpark, said the stores sold more than 20,000 
shirts, sweaters and other garments, 5,000 caps and another 5,000 pennants 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I ordered 20,000 garments to take us through the first two games," he said. 
"It didn't last the first day." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the impossible, fans placed more than 28 million calls over the 
weekend to a special phone line as they tried to order playoff and World Series 
tickets. The dialing deluge jammed circuits in northern Illinois for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kadota, waiting patiently in line to buy a Cub cap, said he personally 
accounted for 500 of those calls -- and never got through. But then Cub fans 
know how to live with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Blumentha knows. The die-hard Cub fan, an art student, said she is 
willing to pay up to $100 for a ticket to get into a playoff game. Even at that 
price, she said, it will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>

South African-born runner Zola Budd sent a wreath but obeyed the wishes of her 
murdered father and did not join 200 mourners at his funeral in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Budd, 56, who was shot to death last week in his farmhouse near the the 
Orange Free State city of Bloemfontein, said in his will that he did not want 
Zola and her two sisters at his graveside.

<P>
However, the sisters, Estelle Budd and Cara van der Westhuizen, were among the 
mourners.

OLIVARES HAS SURGERY FOR BROKEN ANKLE AFTER SPILL AT FAIRPLEX; OUT 3 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockey Frank Olivares, who broke his right ankle in a spill Tuesday at Fairplex 
Park in Pomona, had surgery Wednesday and is expected to be out for about three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares was injured in the eighth race when his mount, Zaida's Best Man, was 
unable to avoid Steffi's Eagle, who went down in the middle of the clubhouse 
turn after clipping the heels of another horse. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black, the rider on Steffi's Eagle, suffered multiple bruises. Olivares 
and Black were treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares then underwent 90-minute surgery at Centinela Hospital Medical Center 
in Inglewood Wednesday. The jockey will wear a cast for three to six weeks and 
then undergo therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Chandler, who performed the surgery, said two screws were used to 
help repair the ankle.

NORTHRIDGE FLAT IN LOSS TO USC; 
</P>
<P>
LADY MATADORS FAIL TO OVERCOME SLOW START, POWERFUL TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team began filling the doorways 
at the Cal State Northridge gym about two games into Wednesday night's 
nonconference women's volleyball match between Northridge and USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Globetrotters were on hand to practice their routines for an exhibition at 
the campus later this week. 
</P>
<P>
And for a while, it looked as if Northridge would extend the Trojans and make a 
late-night Globetrotter workout begin even later. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, Northridge was unable to come up with enough power or 
flair as USC defeated the Lady Matadors, 15-9, 15-11, 14-16, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ranked fourth in the nation in the Tachikara Division II poll, is 
9-6. USC, ranked 10th in the Division I poll, improved to 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy because I saw a lot of improvement in the things we've been working 
on," Northridge Coach Walt Ker said. "No one in Division II is going to be that 
good and we played fairly consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, however, was unable to offset the powerful hitting of USC's Megan 
McCallister and Lonise Norfleet. 
</P>
<P>
McCallister, a six-foot junior middle blocker from Manhattan Beach who was a 
first-team All-Pacific 10 Conference selection last season, had a match-high 22 
kills and 16 digs. Norfleet, a 6-2 junior outside hitter from Illinois, added 
17 kills and 17 digs. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, coming off Pac-10 wins over Arizona and Arizona State last 
weekend, played most of the match without senior outside hitter Yleana 
Carrasco, who was nursing a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little flat," said first-year USC Coach Lisa Love. "We got up and 
played some good volleyball last Friday and Saturday. . . . Tonight, we were a 
little complacent." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which won the the Portland State tournament last weekend, also 
looked a bit flat at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors spotted the Trojans two games before rallying from a 9-5 
deficit in the third game to avoid the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Carrasco entered the match midway through the fourth game to stabilize USC and 
she provided the Trojans with match point on a kill. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Dixon led Northridge with a team-high 17 kills and 16 digs. Keira 
Middleton had 13 kills for the Lady Matadors and Alissa Evans and Marianne 
Dixon each had 11 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Ker was encouraged by CSUN's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played competitive teams all September," Ker said. "I like my team and I 
think we're going to be in very good shape by the end of the season."

A BIRTHDAY WISH; 
</P>
<P>
L. A. SOUTHWEST'S STAR LINEMAN CHRIS MIMS WANTS TO BE FIRST OF FAMILY IN 
UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Mims turns 19 on Friday, and for his birthday he wants success. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to make it," Mims says in a gentle tone. "I want to be the first 
one in my family to go to a university." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Southwest's star lineman has several other birthday wishes. He wants the 
Cougars to have a winning season, he wants to average three sacks a game and he 
wants to finish the year with 110 combined tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Sound like a difficult task? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Mims doesn't seem to think so, and neither does Southwest Coach Henry 
Washington, who says the 6-foot-6, 230-pound defensive end is the best athlete 
he's ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
That says a lot about Mims, because this year's defensive unit is the best in 
the school's history, according to Washington. The Cougars' powerful front line 
includes Mims on the weak side, defensive end Bernard Dafney (6-7, 285), and 
tackles Clidell Gipson (6-1, 280) and Anthony Arley (6-1, 290). 
</P>
<P>
The burly linemen played key roles in both of the Cougars' victories this 
season. In a 17-16 win over Rio Hondo, they allowed only 11 yards rushing, and 
last week, in a 41-0 stomping of West Los Angeles College, they allowed a mere 
69 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defense was excellent against us," said Rio Hondo Coach Clint South, who 
would rather forget the Southwest game. "They had a real good guy that played 
on the end, and he was tough. They were all tough." 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that South remembers Mims, although he prefers not to. Mims 
can't easily be forgotten. He is, after all, every quarterback's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I'm known for speed and excitement," Mims said modestly. "I guess 
when you least expect it, I'll get you a sack. When the game is down and we 
need something, I'll try my best to get it." 
</P>
<P>
In the Cougars' opener against Rio Hondo, he forced a fumble, deflected a pass 
and had three sacks, six solo tackles and three assisted tackles. Against West 
L.A., he recovered a fumble and had seven solo tackles and two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an incredible athlete," Washington said. "He's got size, speed and 
quickness. He's now approaching his potential, but he hasn't reached it. When 
he does, he has no business in this league. He'll belong at the Division I 
level." 
</P>
<P>
That's probably where Mims, a sophomore, will end up, providing he maintains 
his 2.76 grade-point average. Academics prevented Mims from playing at a 
four-year college after a successful career at Dorsey High School, where he 
also played basketball. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Dorsey, Mims broke school records for tackles and sacks in a 
single season and was an all-Southern League and all-City selection. He was 
also named most valuable player in the Senior Bowl, one of many high school 
summer all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
"In 10th grade," said Dorsey football Coach Paul Knox, "he was a tall, thin 
guy, but he really developed and became a dominant force on our team. We'd have 
to take him off the field when we practiced offense because he'd ruin it. We 
couldn't go through with the plays because no one could block him." 
</P>
<P>
Mims turned down a football scholarship to the University of Hawaii because, 
under Proposition 48, he would have been forced to sit out one season. The 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule stipulates that incoming freshmen must 
score at least 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he rented an apartment in Woodlyn Hills with some friends and played 
football at Pierce College, which had reinstated its program. 
</P>
<P>
Mims was a star, but the team finished with a dismal 1-9 record. He led Pierce 
in tackles, sacks and blocked passes. He was also a second-team Western State 
Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just an exceptional athlete," said Pierce Coach Bob Enger. "He's by far 
the best defensive player I've seen, and he's definitely one of the best 
all-around athletes I've ever worked with." 
</P>
<P>
That spring Mims was the starting center on Los Angeles City College's 
basketball team, since Pierce doesn't have a program. He averaged eight points 
a game and helped lead L.A. City to the semifinals of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tremendous competitor, and he's very inspirational," said L.A. City 
basketball Coach Reggie Morris. "He really made our team a better team. He's a 
rebounder, he's extremely aggressive and he's even an intimidator at times. 
Also, his speed is incredible for the size he has." 
</P>
<P>
Mims hasn't decided if he'll play basketball this season. Southwest doesn't 
have a program, so he would return to L.A. City. At least, he says, he's closer 
to that school now. 
</P>
<P>
Mims transfered to Southwest so he could live at home, in South-Central Los 
Angeles, with his mother and siblings. Washington was ecstatic, since last year 
his team lacked depth and finished with a 5-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
A top-notch player such as Mims, Washington says, is a prize addition to this 
year's roster, which includes quality backups in key positions. 
</P>
<P>
After only two games, Mims' aggressive play has already attracted scouts from 
UCLA, USC and Alabama. It's also earned his teammates' recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is so much easier with Chris in the backside," said Dafney, who noted 
that lack of manpower made his job twice as hard last year. "He wants to be in 
on every tackle and every sack. He always goes 100 miles per hour every time 
the ball snaps. If you want to make the tackle, you gotta beat Chris, and 
that's hard to do. He's always there." 
</P>
<P>
Dafney should know. He and Mims made a bet at the start of the season to see 
who would get more sacks and tackles. 
</P>
<P>
The bet serves as a motivator for Mims, but his biggest concern is with the 
team's performance as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to shock this state," Mims said. "If they only knew how much 
talent we have. Just to think about it puts a smile on my face." 
</P>
<P>
At least he'll look happy on his birthday, even if all his wishes don't come 
true.

Five players from the host Squash Club International, 19016 S. Vermont Ave., 
recorded divisional places in the recent California State Squash Championships. 
The three-day event used six courts and more than 90 players from around the 
world participated. SCI placers were: Ashra Fissa, second, and Nigel 
Chamberlain, third in the C Division, and Mark Granger (D Division), Dave 
Gordon (A over 35 years old) and Abe Woodson (C over 35), all of whom won their 
divisional titles.

Colorado Springs, Jennifer Furman (lightweight) and Diana Radakovich 
(flyweight) were part of a 20-person team representing the United States 
against teams from Canada, Korea, Taipei, Spain, Italy and Egypt. The U.S. team 
finished second in the competition. Furman, 15, is a second-degree black belt. 
She is a sophomore at San Pedro High School. Radakovich, 16, holds a 
third-degree black belt. She attends a magnet program at Narbonne High in 
Harbor City. The girls, who train under master K. S. Choi of San Pedro, hope to 
earn a spot on the Olympic demonstration team for 1992.

CSUN VOLLEYBALL ROTATION GOING IN CIRCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The season is almost a month old and Walt Ker, coach of the Cal State 
Northridge women's volleyball team, still does not have a set lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Ker, in his 11th season as coach of the Lady Matadors, says that he cannot 
remember taking so long to make a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
On the final day of the Portland State tournament last Saturday, three freshmen 
-- setter Alison Wool, middle blocker Nancy Nicholls and outside hitter Patty 
Fitzsimmons -- were in the CSUN starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We still beat Regis (Colo.) and played a competitive match against Portland," 
Ker said. "It still being this early in the season, I was encouraged a lot. I 
know they'll improve a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Although CSUN lost its match against defending NCAA Division champion Portland 
State, the Lady Matadors finished with a 3-1 record and won the tournament on 
the basis of points won. 
</P>
<P>
Ker was particularly impressed with CSUN's team defense and the continued 
strong play of junior Marianne Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, a second-team All-American as a middle blocker last season, has been 
moved to the left-side hitting position to bolster the Lady Matadors' attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I see her out there, the more I like her," Ker said. "Nancy Nicholls 
has been doing such a nice job in the middle, we could afford to move her 
outside." Nicholls is a freshman from Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping up with Jones: Cobi Jones, a midfielder on the UCLA soccer team, set 
what is believed to be a school record by registering either a goal or an 
assist in each of the Bruins' first eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a graduate of Westlake High, recorded six goals and six assists for UCLA 
(9-0). The sophomore had his streak snapped Tuesday against UC San Diego, but 
his 18 points are among the leaders in the NCAA Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely having a better year than we expected," UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid 
said. "With the injury to Bill Thompson, our All-American forward, it has 
really forced Cobi to shoulder a big load. So far he's been up to the task." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a walk-on who has earned a scholarship, worked his way into the Bruins' 
starting lineup seven games into last season. 
</P>
<P>
Another Valley-area player, Paul Ratcliffe, a freshman walk-on from Calabasas 
High, has a goal and three assists this season. He has played in all nine 
matches, starting twice. 
</P>
<P>
Untimely tune: Seconds after Pomona-Pitzer's public-address announcer informed 
spectators that alcoholic beverages were not allowed inside the stadium during 
the Sagehens' football game last Saturday against Occidental, the school band 
struck up the Budweiser theme. 
</P>
<P>
Trading compliments: The best winless team in the NCAA Division II? That would 
have to be Central (Okla.) State, says Bob Burt, coach at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge defeated Central State, 31-28, last Saturday on a 17-yard touchdown 
pass from Sherdrick Bonner to Anthony Harris with 11 seconds left. Central 
State is 0-3-1 but has been outscored by only 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the quickest team and one of the best teams talent-wise that we've 
played in the four years I've been here," said Burt, whose team is 2-2. "They 
haven't won yet, but I promise you they will." 
</P>
<P>
Central State's defense -- led by linebacker Keith Traylor, a 6-3, 251-pound 
transfer from the University of Oklahoma -- was particularly impressive. 
Northridge had only 22 yards rushing in the first half, largely the result of 
six quarterback sacks. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Northridge compiled 138 rushing yards, including 99 by 
tailback Albert Fann, who drew a rave review from Central State Coach Gary 
Howard. "He's a big-time player," said Howard, who watched Fann run for 137 
yards. "I can't imagine that there are too many guys around better than he is." 
</P>
<P>
Wrestle-mania: Moorpark College begins its wrestling season Friday night when 
it plays host to El Camino at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Serge Mezheritsky and Carson Wollert, both of whom placed in last season's 
state championship meet, are expected to be the Raiders' top wrestlers. 
Mezheritsky, who was second in the state at 142 pounds, will wrestle at 150 
this season. Wollert will compete in the 190-pound class, in which he finished 
fourth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen to watch include Del Ochoa from Hueneme (118 pounds) and Robby Cook 
from Rio Mesa (134 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be very similar to last year," said Moorpark Coach John Keever, 
whose team placed fifth in last season's state meet. "We'll be a strong 
tournament team, and dual-meet-wise we'll be in a battle with every team 
because we do have some holes." 
</P>

Honoring the wounded: Valley placekicker Jim Harper was a preseason 
All-American selection by the JC Grid-Wire. As a freshman, he converted 12 of 
17 field-goal attempts and 28 of 29 extra-point attempts in earning All-Western 
State Conference honors. 
</P>
<P>
So how is he dealing with success? 
</P>
<P>
Not very well -- but through no fault of his own. Harper has been hampered all 
season by a pulled quadriceps muscle in his right (kicking) leg. He has made 
only one of three field-goal tries. 
</P>
<P>
In Valley's 23-0 loss to Moorpark on Saturday, Harper was short from 40 yards, 
wide left from 40 yards and had another attempt blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"He injured his leg before the first game and he hasn't kicked in practice 
since then," Valley Coach Chuck Ferrero said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Ferrero, injured or not, Harper is still the Monarchs' best 
kicker.

CAN THE SOAPS STAY AFLOAT?; 
</P>
<P>
LARRY HAGMAN STILL RELISHES BEING TV'S OILIEST VILLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 11 1/2 years of playing the same role, Larry Hagman says he's still 
thoroughly enjoying himself as the villainous J.R. Ewing on "Dallas." And why 
not? He works three days a week, is paid millions and maintains good 
relationships with his co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real close family on the show," Hagman said. "My thing is to keep an 
ensemble group working like in a summer stock theater -- except that you don't 
change shows (every few weeks) and we don't do Shakespeare, Shaw or Ibsen. . . 
. But believe me, I'm not sure 'Dallas' will be remembered as long as 
Shakespeare, Shaw or Ibsen, but it will sure make a hell of a lot more money 
than they did." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a brown pinstripe suit and jogging shoes, Hagman was in the best of 
moods recently when he slipped away from the "Dallas" set at Lorimar Studios 
long enough for lunch. Alternately jocular, optimistic and witty, he had plenty 
of reasons for good humor, even though his Caesar salad was too laden with 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
After completing 12 episodes for this season, Hagman and his wife, Maj, were 
off to Europe the next day for a four-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
And just the night before at Chasen's, the couple had celebrated a new contract 
that will make him both producer and star of an upcoming TV miniseries based on 
the life of Texas billionaire H. L. Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Further brightening Hagman's demeanor as he departed for Scotland, Germany, 
Greece and Turkey was knowing that his "Dallas" character -- oilman J.R. Ewing 
-- is back to his thoroughly devious ways. 
</P>
<P>
J.R. -- one of television's most famous villains -- has undergone several 
personality changes over the years, some of which have not pleased Hagman. But 
this season, the "sex, greed and avarice" are back with a vengeance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The show, the longest running drama currently in prime time, began its 13th 
season last Friday on CBS. Although a host of actors and actresses have come 
and gone, Hagman is one of only two (the other is Ken Kercheval's Cliff Barnes) 
who have remained a fixture on the series since it debuted in April, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hagman seemed surprised when it was pointed out that he is one of the 
show's few constants. 
</P>
<P>
"By God, you're right, I had not thought of that. It never occurred to me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The success of "Dallas" is surely due to the public's fascination with J.R., as 
much as the constant conflict that swirls around him. The character has the 
power to strike back at enemies with impunity, the wealth to launch the wildest 
schemes and the wherewithal to force his will on the timid or unsuspecting. 
Part of the appeal, according to Hagman, is that the character is not 
invincible and does, on occasion, lose. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy always comes swinging back, though," he said. "What else can you do 
in life?" 
</P>
<P>
J.R.'s standing is helped by the fact that the character is the focus of much 
of the show even when Hagman is not on camera. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing about this part is (that the other characters) talk about you 
all the time, always building up your entrance. They say, 'God, what is J.R. 
gonna think about this?' I don't have to do a thing. . . . Hell, that's better 
than being on the screen. It's more of a threat. Then when you come on they 
say, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill us.' And then you appear on camera smiling 
and having a good time . . . and still kill 'em," he said with the hearty laugh 
that is one of television's most familiar and sinister. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike J.R. Ewing, though, Hagman was mostly gracious about the competition his 
show has faced from other networks. Notable among these was NBC's "Miami Vice," 
which was moved, amid heavy publicity, from 10 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday nights 
in an attempt to knock "Dallas" off the air in the fall of 1986. The final 
episode of "Miami Vice" ran last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those things. 'Miami Vice' was a hell of a show and if we 
are ever knocked off the air then I hope it is by a quality show. If we had 
been knocked off by 'Miami Vice' then that would have been OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But then Hagman added, with a devilish grin, that the reason "Miami Vice" did 
not do better against "Dallas" was because he had put a "hex" on it. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of playfulness extends to the "Dallas" set. Earlier in the day, in 
fact, he and co-star Patrick Duffy taped a bawdy video message to be broadcast 
at the bar mitzvah of Omri Katz, who plays Hagman's son, John Ross, on the 
show. He also enjoys good-naturedly needling Charlene Tilton between breaks. 
The petite actress is quick to return the fire, but without the rancor that 
pervades their characters' relationship. Both Duffy and Tilton had left 
"Dallas," but were persuaded to return to the show, in part by Hagman. 
</P>
<P>
Another such departure is not likely to be remedied, except by occasional guest 
appearances. Linda Gray, who played Sue Ellen Ewing, J.R.'s wife and frequent 
foil, left as a regular "Dallas" cast member at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda Gray was my favorite female co-star," he said. "She was the greatest 
leading lady I've ever worked with. She was here for 12 years. There was a lot 
of electricity and a lot of subtle work between us. We would always find pieces 
of the story that weren't written into the script. She was the best (female 
co-star) so far in my life, but hopefully there'll be others." 
</P>
<P>
As has frequently been the case with the series, three major characters have 
been added to the cast for this season. Kimberly Foster turned up last Friday 
as April Stevens' sister, the show's new femme fatale; Michael Wilding debuted 
as an art dealer who will develop a romantic interest in J.R.'s wife, and Sasha 
Mitchell will soon be introduced as a man who claims to be J.R.'s 21-year-old 
illegitimate son. 
</P>
<P>
Hagman, who since last season has been co-executive producer of "Dallas" with 
Leonard Katzman, is upbeat about this season's story and glad to be rid of some 
of his character's vulnerabilities that surfaced last year. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently gone are scenes such as one last season when J.R., while traveling 
in Vienna, atypically rebuffed the advances of a glamorous European aristocrat 
who had been his former lover. The oilman's philandering had been tempered by 
his marriage to a much younger woman, played by Cathy Podewell. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was kind of dumb, to tell you the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says, 'What is the purpose of 'Dallas?' The purpose is to entertain. 
It's for entertainment and we don't do it for any morality plays or anything 
like that. We're here to entertain people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for surviving so long on "Dallas"? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that makes me feel rich -- and don't forget modest and smart," he said 
in his distinctive laugh. "Yeah, rich, smart and modest." 
</P>
<P>
J.R. Ewing couldn't have said it better.

CBS NEWS DENIES N.Y. POST ALLEGATION ITS AFGHAN WAR COVERAGE WAS FAKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS News said Wednesday that it was standing by the accuracy of its coverage of 
the war in Afghanistan in the wake of a newspaper report that said it had aired 
faked battle footage and false news accounts in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was contained in a front-page story Wednesday in the New York 
Post. Most of the questioned footage was shot by free-lance cameraman Mike 
Hoover, who reportedly was on his way back to the United States from New 
Zealand Wednesday and not available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the goal of CBS News in every instance to gather and report the news 
accurately, fairly and with integrity," said David Burke, president of CBS 
News. "In the case of the Afghan war, we believe we have done so." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Dan Rather, anchor and managing editor of the "CBS Evening News," nor 
executive producer Tom Bettag was available for immediate comment on the 
report, which questioned the authenticity of some of the footage that it said 
was included on the "CBS Evening News" in 1984 and in a 1987 "CBS Reports" 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, Rather anchored a documentary, "The Battle for Afghanistan," 
that included footage shot by Hoover that previously had aired on "CBS Evening 
News." At the time, CBS said that the footage in the documentary represented 18 
trips that Hoover and his crew had made into Afghanistan over three years. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News sources said Wednesday that Rather was very concerned about the 
staging allegation. "He would never stand for that," said one source. Others at 
the network questioned why the report was surfacing now, more than two years 
after the "CBS Reports" aired. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post story, quoting sources that it said included an Afghan rebel 
who served as Hoover's translator and an Afghan-British journalist who was 
Hoover's second cameraman on a second project in Afghanistan, alleged that 
Hoover staged scenes of guerilla sabotage and edited in video footage of a 
Pakistani plane to make it appear to be a Soviet jet bombing Afghan villages. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover, who has covered Afghanistan as a regular freelancer for CBS News for 
several years, has been well-regarded by the network, according to CBS News 
sources. In a 1987 interview with The Times, Hoover said that Rather was 
"really the muscle" behind his CBS assignment to cover the war. 
</P>
<P>
In The Times interview, Hoover, an Academy Award-winning documentary film 
maker, said that he didn't consider himself a news cameraman in the traditional 
sense. "I'm really kind of a film maker," he said.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
FOR FORMER EAGLE DON HENLEY, THERE'S JUST NO LOOKING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a year when lots of classic rock artists are wowing crowds by doing their 
great old songs, Don Henley has a better idea. In his first tour in four years, 
the former Eagle is treating audiences to some outstanding new songs. 
</P>
<P>
Though he co-wrote some of the finest songs of the rock era during his Eagles 
period, Henley waited until nearly an hour into his set Tuesday night at the 
Universal Amphitheatre to perform any of those '70s numbers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Henley is going out of his way to snub his Eagles legacy by 
stressing the present. The singer-songwriter also included only one song (the 
snarling "Dirty Laundry") from his highly regarded 1982 solo album. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on material from his last two albums cost him some early response 
from the near-capacity crowd -- a point he noted midway through the show, when 
he made a passing remark about the traditional opening-night reserve of "those 
industry audiences" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All it took, however, to draw robust cheers from the fans was the slightest 
hint that he was going to do some of the oldies. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be in a group," he said teasingly -- and the crowd erupted with 
applause at the first notes of the Grammy-winning "Hotel California." 
</P>
<P>
But Henley included only two more Eagles compositions -- the biting "Life in 
the Fast Lane" and delicate "Desperado" -- in the rest of the nearly two-hour 
show. 
</P>
<P>
If Henley sacrificed some early audience response in sticking to the new 
material, the decision fueled his show with an immediacy and drive that makes 
his tour arguably the most rewarding of the year by an American pop-rock 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Henley's strength is his complexity. He understands life's 
contradictions and he works them into his songs with an accessibility that has 
characterized his work with the Eagles and on his own. His best tunes speak of 
social and personal challenges with equal cynicism and innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm brave enough to be crazy, strong enough to be weak," he says in "I Will 
Not Go Quietly," a song (co-written by Danny Kortchmar) from his new album "The 
End of the Innocence" that seems to summarize Henley's attitude about music and 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The contradictions also surface on stage. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who once subscribed to a no-frills, anti-show-biz stance with the 
Eagles, he is certainly style-conscious now. He dresses in a self-consciously 
fashionable (baggy) suit and wears his hair fashionably long (complete with 
ponytail). His nine musicians dress smartly enough (the female bassist and 
three backup singers in minidresses, the men in suits) for them to play at a 
country-club wedding. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a tad of humor in all this -- but it might also be Henley's desire 
to express a flashier side of himself that was bottled up all those years 
behind the drums in the old band. (He now spends his time on stage up front, 
only returning to the drums for two Eagles songs.) 
</P>
<P>
Henley's talk between songs is equally outgoing. You don't know whether he's 
going into a speech or a song each time he approaches the microphone. Just as 
he can sometimes be polemical in his lyrics, he can't resist taking quick shots 
at big targets (he cited Exxon and the federal government when introducing a 
song decrying what he feels is a general lack of accountability in society 
today). 
</P>
<P>
In his music, however, Henley speaks with an artful and sophisticated edge that 
can be equally effective on biting themes ("If Dirt Were Dollars," a slap at 
both tabloid mentality and flag-waving politicians) and disarming tales of 
romance that seem uncommonly personal. His best songs bring together both the 
personal and the social. 
</P>
<P>
Why should Henley do an old Eagles song about the search for lost values when 
he comes up with new songs as moving as "The End of the Innocence"? Sample 
lyrics from the song, co-written by Bruce Hornsby: "Who knows how long this 
will last/Now, we've come so far, so fast/But somewhere back there in the 
dust/That same small town in each of us." 
</P>
<P>
The band (which combines the Eagles' old guitar emphasis with more contemporary 
synthesizer touches) plays with aggression and spark, punctuating the tender 
moments in his music as well as the blistering ones. The volume is at a 
chest-thumping level that is no concession to any desire for nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Henley's tour -- featuring the recently reviewed Edie Brickell &amp; the New 
Bohemians as the opening act -- continues Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
then Saturday at the Santa Barbara County Bowl and Sunday at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa.

<P>
RATINGS PROMPT REVAMPING OF AGING PRIME-TIME VAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The soap king is dead. Long live the soap. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the cry of network executives and television producers these days, who 
all tend to slough off the notion that the demise of "Dynasty" last spring and 
the faltering ratings of CBS's three remaining prime-time soap operas foretell 
the imminent death of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few years ago, four of TV's 10 highest-rated shows, including the top 
two, were prime-time soaps, and imitators were springing up faster than those 
corner mini-malls. Today, all the imitations are extinct and the top finisher 
among the four old warriors last season, "Knots Landing," ranked 25th. "Dallas" 
was 26th, "Falcon Crest" came in 47th and "Dynasty" was tied for 58th. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, television insiders argue, the "nighttime serial," as some 
producers prefer to call it, is far from washed up. Witness: 
</P>
<P>
* "Knots Landing." Though cursed with a tough time slot against "L.A. Law," 
this sexy series actually improved its rating last season over the year before. 
"This is the one soap that has a chance to run forever," said David Jacobs, the 
creator and executive producer of the show, which begins its 11th season 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
* "Dallas." Granted, the popularity of the granddaddy of the current crop of 
prime-time soaps, which has three No. 1, two No. 2 and seven Top 10 finishes in 
its 12 seasons, has plummeted, losing more than 25% of its audience in the last 
two years alone. Still, it won its Friday night time period throughout last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
* "Falcon Crest." It's no secret that this series has faded badly -- its 
characters and plot lines growing as stale after eight seasons as an open 
bottle of Thunderbird Red. But a radical revamping designed to infuse it with 
new life is in place for Friday's season premiere. It has several new stars, 
new producers, new music, a whole new attitude. "It is now a hybrid of a 
nighttime soap and an action show like 'Miami Vice' or 'The Equalizer,' " said 
co-executive producer Joel Surnow. 
</P>
<P>
* ABC and NBC. Both networks are still eyeing the genre hungrily. ABC has a new 
soap, "Twin Peaks," in the works for a mid-season rollout sometime next year. 
And NBC, the network that built its commanding ratings lead without ever 
begetting a winning prime-time soap, is at least talking about getting back in 
the game. "The soap kings are dead and that represents an opportunity for us," 
said Warren Littlefield, NBC's executive vice president of prime-time programs. 
"The form is the staple of daytime television and it is a legitimate component 
of prime time. With the traditional soaps clearly on the fade, the audience 
probably has an appetite for a new one." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the networks never again hit with a traditionally styled soap, the 
continuing story line pioneered by "Dallas" in 1978 thrives in more 
serious-minded dramas such as "L.A. Law," "Wiseguy" and "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
"Night-time soaps have never been more alive," Surnow said. " 'thirtysomething' 
and 'L.A. Law' are soaps. Today's audience today just wants a little more 
reality with their soaps." 
</P>
<P>
Before "Dallas," most TV episodes were self-contained. What happened one week 
had no bearing on what would happen the following week. TV heroes such as Kojak 
or the Bionic Woman never changed. But the prime-time soaps, building on the 
kind of character development first seen on "The Waltons" and "Family," 
succeeded in offering characters -- albeit exotically rich, greedy, sex-crazed 
and villainous ones -- who evolved from week to week. 
</P>
<P>
Then shows like "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere" came along and usurped 
and transformed the soap formula by casting it in a more realistic hue -- 
setting it in a police station or a hospital instead of a luxurious Texas 
ranch, and peopling it with hard-working lawyers or housewives rather than the 
likes of Joan Collins' Alexis Colby on "Dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
None of these more realistic dramas use spectacular cliffhangers such as the 
infamous "Who shot J.R.?" episode of "Dallas" to lure viewers back to the 
screen each season. But one of the downfalls of the traditional soap, one 
producer said privately, is that "after you do 'Who shot J.R.,' what else is 
there? How can anyone top that?" 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, who also created "Dallas," concedes that the soaps are more 
melodramatic than this new generation of serialized dramas. "Knots Landing" 
will have burglars hold the entire cast hostage, while "thirtysomething" will 
depict the bankruptcy of a small business. But Jacobs said that his show also 
started out telling "reasonable stories" and was forced to move toward 
sensationalism to keep it exciting. He expects the producers of 
"thirtysomething" to run up against the same problem in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
The only notable difference between the two genres, Jacobs said, is that shows 
like "L.A. Law" win truckloads of Emmys while avoiding the demeaning "soap 
opera" tag. But he applauds them for adapting the form and offering the sort of 
entertainment that differentiates network television from everything else. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't compete with cable when it comes to action shows," Jacobs said. "We 
don't have the money to do 'Midnight Run' every week. We can do a sexy show, 
but we can't compete with Kim Basinger's exposed breasts in '9 1/2 Weeks.' So 
we have to give the audience something they can't get anywhere else. And that's 
continuing drama, continuing involvement with characters that evolve and 
change. That's the lasting contribution of shows like 'Dallas' and 'Knots 
Landing,' even if the audience is bored and tired of them after all these 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Though none of the existing serials will ever score the kind of ratings they 
chalked up in their "Who shot J.R.?" heyday, CBS still believes in its three 
old gladiators. David Poltrack, CBS' senior vice president of planning and 
research, said that all three have made "midstream corrections" away from the " 
'Dynasty'-like" infatuation with fantasy-driven characters and story lines and 
have given their viewers more "identifiable and empathic relationships." 
</P>
<P>
It is also cheaper to retool a floundering soap such as "Falcon Crest" with new 
characters and direction, Poltrack said, than to take the "high risk" 
alternative of introducing a new program. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs believes that "Knots Landing" has the best chance of surviving because 
it is the most realistic of the three. He said the show has made a comeback 
because of what he calls the producers' "Friday morning beauty parlor meetings, 
where we try to figure out what we can get them talking about in the beauty 
parlor that will make people who didn't see the show sorry they missed it. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a flashback to when Abby (the show's ruthless vixen, played by Donna 
Mills) lost her virginity in the hope that people might say, 'Oh, they showed 
Abby's first love,' and maybe grudgingly they will tune us in again." 
</P>
<P>
"Knots Landing" will have to survive this season without Mills, who left the 
show at the end of last season. But even without its sexiest actress, it is 
still the sexiest soap and perhaps the sexiest series on television. One 
episode last season featured two characters playing a saucy game of "strip 
croquet" and another found Michele Lee's character dressing up in revealing 
lingerie and then flashing her husband in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"Falcon Crest" has portrayed its own share of sex over the course of its eight 
seasons, and its new producers have no intention of denuding it of the 
requisite bedroom romps. But the show has been revamped, Surnow said, because 
ratings were plunging. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception was that it was campier than 'Knots Landing,' but that 
perception will change," said Surnow, who formerly produced "Miami Vice" and 
"The Equalizer." "We look at it now as if we were doing 'The Godfather' as a 
soap." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Harrison, the former star of "Trapper John, M.D.," has joined the cast 
as what Surnow describes as a greedy "Gordon Gecko-Michael Milken" type 
character. 
</P>
<P>
Surnow also said that one of the failures of the soaps in recent years was that 
they took too long to tell their stories. "Falcon Crest" will still present 
continuing threads from week to week, but Surnow said the audience will see a 
"pay off" at the end of each episode. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of the prime-time soap, NBC's Littlefield said the networks 
must find fresh programs to fill the void as these old ones slowly die off. 
Though he refuses to volunteer any specifics, Littlefield contends that the 
time is ripe for a new soap -- one NBC could broadcast "30, 40, even 52 weeks a 
year" to help combat the audience erosion plaguing the networks during months 
of summer reruns. 
</P>
<P>
"But you won't see a bigger, brighter, richer 'Dynasty,' " Littlefield said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time in America, in terms of the Reagan era, that 'Dynasty' was 
able to exploit wonderfully," said Ted Harbert, executive vice president of 
prime time at ABC. "But the nation has moved away from that infatuation with 
the rich and famous, and now it's time to do a different kind of soap." 
</P>
<P>
ABC has something different in mind with "Twin Peaks." Created by "Blue Velvet" 
director David Lynch, it is set in a northwestern city where, TV critic Tom 
Shales of the Washington Post has written, "mists rise eerily from forests 
primeval and bad boys thrown into jail howl like wolves in the night. . . . 
Whatever else is true of 'Twin Peaks,' it is daringly, perhaps insanely, 
different. . . . It is one of the most intoxicating combinations of grimness 
and giggles ever made for television. But is it the kind of thing America wants 
to watch?" 
</P>
<P>
Shales doubts it. Littlefield says, no way. Harbert says, "If I had a nickel 
for every time the competition or a reviewer said people wouldn't watch 
something, I'd be rich man." 
</P>
<P>
Long live the soap.

STAR RUNNING BACK HELPS SPARK BASSETT'S DRIVE IN DIVISION V; 
</P>
<P>
LEADING RUSHER CATCHES EYES OF MAJOR RECRUITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Marshawn Thompson remembers the prediction his father, Troy, made when he was 
still playing youth football as an eighth grader. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me and he told everyone in the neighborhood, 'One day Marshawn's going 
to put Bassett High on the map," he says. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, that probably seemed to be a rather outlandish statement. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Bassett did not have a winning tradition and Thompson had yet to 
play a down of high school football. 
</P>
<P>
But, since he joined the varsity three years ago, Thompson has made his father 
seem prescient. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old has shattered most of his school's rushing records and played a 
central role in Bassett's transformation from a perennial also-ran into one of 
the emerging powers in the CIF Southern Section Division V. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Thompson has been the leading rusher in the San 
Gabriel Valley for the last two seasons. He rushed for 1,701 yards and 16 
touchdowns in 301 carries as a junior and has run for 584 yards and 8 
touchdowns in 77 carries after only three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Toss in 243 yards rushing as a sophomore and Thompson has rushed for 2,528 
yards in his three years as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
It is no coincidence that the fortunes of the Olympians have also risen since 
Thompson has been a starter. Bassett finished with a 5-5 record in Thompson's 
sophomore season; the Olympians were 8-3 last year and won their first Montview 
League title, and the team is 2-1 this season and is ranked No. 6 in Division 
V. 
</P>
<P>
That's a far cry from the 2-7 record Bassett posted the year before Thompson 
joined the varsity. It was a mark that was more the rule than the exception at 
Bassett and, at the time, Thompson said it was a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a freshman here, I was thinking to myself, 'I hope it isn't like 
that when I'm a sophomore,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the team improved in his sophomore year, it was hardly a showcase 
season for Thompson. "As a sophomore, I didn't really get the ball enough to 
prove I could carry the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thompson's fortunes, as well as the team's, changed for the better 
when Coach Mark Pettingill installed "The Toss" as Bassett's offense before 
last season. The run-oriented offense utilizes only one running back and 
hoisted Thompson into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also credits more of a take-charge approach toward his development as 
a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought right then, 'It's my junior year and I have to do what I can,' 
" he said. "This is a small school (with 1,350 students), and you have to do 
something impressive to get noticed. Last year, I just tried my hardest, and 
fortunately we ended up with a pretty good season." 
</P>
<P>
With his impressive junior year, Thompson has received considerably more 
attention this season. A consensus prep All-America selection, he was named to 
preseason squads selected by The Sporting News, G &amp; W Recruiting Report of 
Pennsylvania and super scouts Max Emfinger of Texas and Tom Lemming of 
Illinois, among others. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Thompson is the first legitimate major-college prospect the program 
has produced in recent years. He is certainly the only Bassett player in recent 
years who has an opportunity to go directly to a top NCAA Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people go to Division I schools before, but most have had to go the 
(junior college) route first," Pettingill said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he started receiving recruiting letters toward the end of last 
school year. "I started getting recruited about a month before school ended and 
during the summer the phone was ringing off the hook," he said. "It's still 
ringing off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that he has received recruiting letters from nearly 100 schools 
and has been recruited intensely by about 20 of those, including Colorado, 
Fresno State, UCLA, USC, Nebraska and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
The attention, Thompson says, can be a distraction at times. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're sitting there watching a good movie or you're doing your homework 
and then you get a call and you're on the phone for 30 minutes or an hour, it 
kind of gets to you," he said. "But you just have to adjust to it. You don't 
want to hang up on them because you might end up going to that school." 
</P>
<P>
Pettingill said he first was concerned that Thompson might receive too much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season I was concerned that he would be getting favoritism at the 
expense of the rest of the team, but that hasn't been the case," he said. "In 
fact, he's even helped some of the other kids get noticed." 
</P>
<P>
The coach also feared that, because of the attention Thompson was receiving, he 
would become a marked target on the field this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought that would be the case, but he's pretty much on pace with 
where he was last year at this time and he's got more touchdowns," Pettingill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it may seem as if it is a carbon copy of last season, Thompson says 
opponents have treated him differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot more respect from them," he said. "They come after me harder, 
especially in the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Thompson, he says he has also improved his overall game since 
his junior year. He credits that to hard work during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel much stronger this year," he said. "I came into the season in better 
shape. Last year I was just good enough to finish the game and that's it. This 
year I feel a lot stronger in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has strengthened himself through an intensive weightlifting program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real strict weight program with coach Pettingill," Thompson said. 
"If you're not working out over the summer and in the fall, you're not going to 
be in the program because you're not dedicated. You have to be motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson draws motivation from the scouting reports in the past that have 
labeled him a step slow. He says he will dispute that with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"People say it looks like I'm not running, but at the same time I'm out-running 
the safety who's trying to catch me," he says. "I'm pretty sure that other 
teams look at me and say, 'Well, he's not that fast.' That's what I've always 
been told since I've run the ball in high school. I look like I'm going slow, 
but I run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash and no one can catch me." 
</P>
<P>
He credits assistant coach Ed Sifuentes with improving his quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"Our running back coach helps us out a lot on our foot speed and agility, and 
that's helped improve my speed and quickness this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One area that Thompson has not had to improve is his work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't much work coaching him," Sifuentes said. "His work ethic is second to 
none. He's only missed one practice (this season) and that was to watch the 
USC-Illinois game. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first year of coaching here and I thought it might be hard working 
with a player who's all-state," he said, "but it's been just the opposite. It's 
been a real pleasure working with him." 
</P>
<P>
Pettingill said Thompson is an excellent role model for the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real coachable," he said. "He'll do anything that we ask. He works real 
closely with the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also not the kind who's going to get caught up in drugs or drinking," 
Pettingill said. "He's not that type of person." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said he credits that to Thompson's father. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big advantage for him," Pettingill said. "He's got a father that's 
right on top of him." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said his father has been the strongest behind-the-scenes force in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that's the one thing that's motivated me," he said. "He wants me to be 
successful and play college football, and I think that helps." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is his father who has prodded him to study and prepare for college 
entrance examinations, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test and American 
College Test. 
</P>
<P>
"He preaches to me almost every night that you have to make your grades and 
pass the SAT and ACT," Thompson says. "He doesn't really care about where I go 
to college until I pass those tests. After that, we'll sit down and talk about 
where to go." 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson is not going to worry about recruiting until after the season. For 
the moment, he has other things on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm just trying to worry about the season and work towards winning 
a championship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those are words that Thompson admits he never could have uttered in the past.

USAir and federal investigators dismissed a report that the pilots of a 
jetliner that skidded into the East River last week had been drinking for five 
hours before getting into the cockpit. Meanwhile, National Transportation 
Safety Board investigators said a device that holds the rudder steady for the 
pilot during takeoff was wrongly set in the full left position, which could 
account for the drift the pilot reported that led him to abort the takeoff. 
Responding to the drinking report, USAir spokesman David Shipley in Arlington, 
Va., said the cockpit crew had only about two hours between the time they 
arrived at LaGuardia Airport and the time they reported to the gate for the 
flight.

El Salvador's leftist rebels said they have inflicted more than 200 military 
casualties in their new offensive, but they still promised to take part in 
planned peace talks. The rebels' Radio Venceremos said the offensive, begun 
late Monday in at least nine of El Salvador's 14 provinces, left 228 government 
troops dead or wounded and nine captured. It said 11 rebels died. The armed 
forces, however, said that 33 rebels and 24 soldiers died in the offensive, 
while 38 guerrillas, 19 government troops and seven civilians were wounded. The 
attacks came less than two weeks after the rebels and the government agreed to 
monthly peace talks. Rebel commander Joaquin Villalobos said the rebels will 
participate in the next session, scheduled Oct. 16-17.

Under a new policy, University of California students face discipline, ranging 
up to dismissal from school, if they use derogatory racial or sexual epithets 
to harass another person on campus. UC President David Gardner announced that 
the new rule on so-called "fighting words" was in response to several incidents 
of racial antagonism in recent years on UC campuses and other schools around 
the nation. He said the policy is not intended to limit free speech, but that 
it recognizes "that words can be used in such a way that they no longer express

In a move that could further delay the production of a scarce gas needed for 
nuclear warheads, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered additional testing 
of the government's tritium reactors before they are restarted. Watkins said 
all three tritium-producing reactors at the Savannah River plant near Aiken, 
S.C., would undergo ultrasonic testing for cracks. He provided no details. His 
spokeswoman, Christina Sankey, said it was "too early to tell" whether the 
additional testing would mean a further delay in restarting the first reactor, 
designated K reactor. Watkins had announced Sept. 7 that low-power testing of 
the reactor would begin next summer.

CHILD CANCER CLUSTER GROWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Another childhood cancer case has been discovered in the tiny Kern County 
farming town of McFarland. The latest victim is a 5-year-old boy who state 
health officials said has lymphoma. He is the 13th confirmed childhood cancer 
victim in the town of 6,200 in the last 14 years. Dr. Lynn Goldman, the 
epidemiologist in charge of the state investigation into the McFarland cancer 
cluster, said: "I think it's an indication that the above-normal cancer rate is 
continuing to occur since you don't expect even half of a case a year to occur 
in a community of that size. New childhood cancer cases were found in the 
community in 1987, 1988 and now in 1989." State and county officials still have 
not found a clear cause for the McFarland cancer cluster and the investigation 
is continuing. Goldman said nine types of cancer have been involved among the 
13 confirmed cases in McFarland.

MISSOURI ABORTION RULING BRINGS UNFORESEEN RESULTS 
</P>

CARROLLTON, Mo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The moment she saw the blurred outline of the fetus on the sonogram on Sept. 
11, Maralee Dinsdale knew something was horribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"There just wasn't a definite round little head," Dinsdale recalled, starting 
to cry quietly. She spelled the word that the doctor used: 
a-n-e-n-c-e-p-h-a-l-i-c. It meant that the 22-week fetus would be born without 
a brain. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, she might have had an abortion at either of the two hospitals 
where her doctor practices. But when he tried to schedule one for her earlier 
this month, both facilities refused, saying they had changed their policies to 
conform with a Missouri law that had been upheld in July by the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Dinsdale, confused and desperate, was advised to cross the state line to get 
her abortion at a clinic -- one that was not as well equipped as a hospital to 
handle the potentially dangerous medical complications that arose. 
</P>
<P>
For all the attention that has been paid the Supreme Court decision in Webster 
vs. Reproductive Health Services, neither side of the abortion debate expected 
the Missouri law to have much of an immediate impact. The law's relatively 
narrow restrictions were seen as merely a first step -- and a very small one, 
at that -- toward the gradual chipping away of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
The statute bars the state from using its money, facilities or employees for 
abortion, except in cases where the woman's life is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the law is being implemented, it is having some unexpected 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be more far-reaching than many at first recognized," said Barbara 
Hackett, president of Missouri Citizens for Life. "It's really a hopeful 
situation, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Now the chickens are coming home to roost. There are all these crazy 
situations happening in Missouri," said Roger Evans, litigation director for 
Planned Parenthood and counsel in the Webster case. 
</P>
<P>
Though Dinsdale's case was extreme, her experiences are only one example of the 
effects that the Supreme Court decision is having on availability of abortion 
here. It is being felt in several areas, among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- More hospitals than initially expected have stopped performing abortions, 
leaving women with fewer options, and forcing a few, such as Dinsdale, to take 
greater risks to get an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In apparent contradiction with assurances that the Missouri attorney 
general made to the U.S. Supreme Court, at least one state college has put its 
staff on notice that it may not provide anyone with information on abortion. 
Other state officials say they are unsure how far their employees may go in 
discussing the topic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blockades Allowed 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two judges have ruled that the law's preamble justifies such tactics as 
sit-ins and blockades by anti-abortion groups seeking to shut down abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the law was thought to apply mainly to Truman Medical Center, a 
private facility located on public land in Kansas City. But several other 
hospitals have since announced that they can no longer do abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Mandina, president of the anti-abortion group Missouri Lawyers for Life, 
said some hospitals will define the law's prohibition as broadly as possible. 
"Some of those people were looking for excuses to get out of (abortion) and 
this was a convenient excuse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of public facilities does not present a major obstacle for the vast 
majority of women seeking an abortion in Missouri. Fully 90% have the procedure 
in private clinics, which are not covered by the law. 
</P>
<P>
But Dinsdale was well beyond the point in her pregnancy where most clinics will 
do the procedure, and she was fast approaching a time where it would be 
difficult to get one anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dinsdale, a 32-year-old substitute teacher and girls basketball coach, could 
have carried her doomed fetus to term. But she and her husband, Kevin, had been 
devastated by both a fetal death and a miscarriage in the past three years. She 
could not bear thinking what it would be like "to feel it move every day, to 
know every day that when it was born, it wouldn't live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shocked by Options 
</P>
<P>
After some hasty consultation with a colleague, her doctor recommended that she 
go to Comprehensive Health for Women, a clinic in Kansas. Had she had more time 
and information, Dinsdale might have continued her search for a private 
hospital in Missouri that still does abortions. But Dinsdale and her husband 
were shocked and confused at the limited options presented to them. Her doctor 
did not return a call requesting an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Health officials say they have seen several women forced across 
the state line by the Supreme Court decision. However, Dinsdale's case caused 
them particular concern. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier delivery, placenta had adhered to her uterine wall and she had 
hemorrhaged. Doctors at Comprehensive Health knew that could happen again, and 
were uncomfortable about performing the abortion there. 
</P>
<P>
"With her history of bleeding . . . the abortion should have been done in a 
hospital," said clinic director Adele Hughey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Begins Bleeding Heavily 
</P>
<P>
As they feared, Dinsdale began bleeding heavily as soon as they completed it 
and suffered an adverse drug reaction, according to nurse-practitioner Ada 
Anderson, who attended the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic staff quickly summoned an ambulance, and Dinsdale recovered in a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that cutting off access to public facilities won't really hurt 
women, but it already has," said Lynn M. Paltrow, an attorney with the American 
Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri hospitals are not the only institutions in the state distancing 
themselves from abortion. The law also prohibits use of public funds, 
facilities or employees for "encouraging or counseling" abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 13 memorandum to top officials at Southwest Missouri State 
University, Vice President Herbert L. Lunday warned that university employees 
are not to discuss the subject "when an individual (client, patient or other) 
raises the issue of abortion with an employee of the university" or "if an 
individual requests referral to an abortion clinic." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision was based in part on assurances from Missouri Atty. 
Gen. William L. Webster that the statute "is directed solely at those persons 
responsible for expending public funds" and "does not prohibit the use of 
public funds to provide information regarding abortions or to inform a woman of 
the options she may have to cope with an unwanted pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Retain Policy 
</P>
<P>
However, university attorney John Black said Southwest Missouri State plans to 
stick by its new policy. "Any public employee, I would think at this point in 
time, has some reason for concern," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"There had been great concern on our part early on as to even mentioning the 
word (abortion). . . . Anything any one of our staff does is supported with 
state funds," said Michael R. Henry, director of legal services for the 
Missouri Department of Social Services. "At this point, we have not issued any 
instructions to staff." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion groups argue that while the law's limitations may make it more 
complicated for some women to obtain an abortion, they do not make it 
impossible, or even difficult. "Basically, the Webster decision hasn't stopped 
one abortion," said Mandina, the president of Missouri Lawyers for Life. 
</P>
<P>
Far more significant, he said, is the new interpretation that some Missouri 
courts are giving the law's assertions that "the life of each human being 
begins at conception" and that "unborn children have protectable interests in 
life, health and well-being." 
</P>
<P>
The state had argued that this passage was "abortion-neutral," and the Supreme 
Court left it up to Missouri courts to decide what that section of the law 
means. 
</P>
<P>
It has been cited in a number of unusual cases since July, including one in 
which a defendant accused of underage drinking is trying to add nine months to 
his age and another in which a pregnant imprisoned woman is claiming her fetus 
is illegally incarcerated because it committed no crime. 
</P>
<P>
What has elated abortion foes, however, are separate decisions last month by 
two state judges, who cited that language from the law's preamble as their 
justification for freeing protesters charged with trespassing on abortion 
clinic property. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis Judge Arthur Miorelli acquitted four protesters, saying: "I'm 
satisfied that Missouri law provides for the protection of these children." 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier case, Associate Circuit Judge George R. Gerhard acknowledged 
that 11 people had disrupted a clinic, but said their actions were "necessary 
as emergency measures" to prevent the "death and maiming of unborn children." 
</P>
<P>
Judges in other parts of the country, including Los Angeles and San Diego, have 
rejected such "necessity defenses" by anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two Missouri cases may be appealed, but the issue is expected to 
ultimately reach the state supreme court. 
</P>
<P>
If the necessity defense is upheld, "I don't know how the abortuaries could 
stay open here, because there would be so many people who would be sitting in. 
. . . They would shut (abortion clinics) down, day in and day out. They would 
have to move out of the state," Mandina said. 
</P>
<P>
But St. Louis County prosecutor Tom Wehrle said: "We don't read the law that 
way. Our county police will still be there making arrests."

ARCO HYPE MAY BE RIGHT -- GASOLINE CAN BE CLEANER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everywhere you turn, you encounter the hype: on radio, the basso profundo voice 
of actor James Earl Jones talking about cleaning up the environment; on 
television, images of gasoline pumps jutting from the Los Angeles skyline; in 
newspapers, full-page ads singing the praises of Arco's new Emission Control-1 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
For once, the hype may be correct. 
</P>
<P>
Arco says EC-1, designed to replace the leaded regular gasoline used by 
pre-1975 cars, cuts pollutant emissions from those older cars by 20%. The 
amount is substantial considering that such cars represent only 15% of all 
automobiles registered in Southern California but account for 30% of automotive 
pollution. If all owners of the older cars were to use EC-1, the company 
promises, "350 tons of pollutants would be removed from the air each day." 
</P>
<P>
State and local authorities, even environmentalists, agree that the claims are 
on target. Arco is definitely "ahead of the pack" in reducing auto emissions, 
said Alan Lloyd, chief scientist of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. "We've been trying to get people to do this for years," added William 
Kelly, an AQMD spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Other gasoline companies seem likely to follow suit -- if not immediately, at 
least in the foreseeable future. Already, several refiners have contacted Arco 
seeking information about the new gasoline, and the company says it will 
release full details of its manufacture and testing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of redesigning gasolines to reduce emissions -- "reformulating," in 
industry jargon -- will soon spread to fuels used by newer cars. Within the 
next year, the California Air Resources Board will mandate that petroleum 
companies selling in California reformulate all grades of gasoline in a similar 
fashion to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this month, petroleum companies and U.S. auto makers confirmed the 
formation of a consortium to work toward combining reformulated gasolines with 
improved engine technology in an effort to avoid government-imposed shifts to 
alternative fuels, such as methanol, by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But even the most enthusiastic supporters of reformulation agree that EC-1 is 
not a panacea. Arco has the capacity to produce only 36 million gallons per 
month, all of it destined for use in Southern California. But it is only a 
fraction of the total needed for the 1.2 million pre-1975 cars and pre-1980 
pickup trucks in the region. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the fuel cannot be used in newer cars without using a funnel. The big 
nozzles on the EC-1 pumps fit only into older cars. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, extending the same principle to other gasolines will require at 
least four years and a substantial capital investment, according to Dan 
Townsend, Arco's manager of operations support. The company's refineries would 
need to be upgraded, resulting in an increased cost to consumers. For now, the 
company is selling EC-1 for the same price it charges for leaded regular. 
Nonetheless, the advent of EC-1 is "a good sign," according to Mary Nichols of 
the Natural Resources Defense Council. It shows that the petroleum refiners 
"can make gasoline a whole lot cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
Arco created EC-1 by taking three major steps to change its regular gasoline: 
removing lead, lessening volatility, and reducing the concentration of 
so-called aromatics and olefins -- hydrocarbons that contribute to air 
pollution and so are themselves health risks. 
</P>
<P>
Volatility refers to the ability of gasoline to evaporate so that it can 
readily be mixed with air and drawn into the engine for combustion. High 
volatility promotes good drivability when the car is first started, but it also 
promotes evaporation of gasoline into the atmosphere when the car is parked, 
particularly when the engine is warm. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said Arco was able to reduce the volatility of EC-1 by about 14% 
without impairing performance, primarily by removing butane, which was used for 
cold-start drivability. California had already forced refiners to cut butane 
content below levels in other areas of the country and Arco simply went one 
step further. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB will require all refiners to meet the volatility level of EC-1 during 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Lead compounds represent an inexpensive way to raise the octane of gasoline. 
Octane is a measure of the energy content of the fuel and the speed with which 
it burns. High octane is necessary to prevent premature ignition of gasoline, 
which produces the "pinging" or "knocking" that robs a car of its power and 
increases pollutant emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Lead compounds already have been removed from about 85% of all gasolines 
because lead fouls the catalytic converters that reduce exhaust emissions on 
newer cars. Lead is also a health threat, causing a wide variety of 
neurological damage, and refiners have slowly been reducing the amount of lead 
in gasoline for vehicles without catalytic converters. 
</P>
<P>
But without lead, something else must be added to maintain high octane. In the 
unleadedgasolines now marketed, octane comes primarily from olefins and 
aromatics. These have a high energy content and they burn slowly so that 
premature ignition is avoided. 
</P>
<P>
But because they burn slowly, some of the aromatics and olefins escape into the 
exhaust system, according to Ron Jones of the Washington-based American 
Petroleum Institute. In cars equipped with catalytic converters, the compounds 
are generally destroyed. But in older cars, they escape into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In the skies, the unburned components react with other pollutants to form smog. 
Some also are health hazards in themselves. One aromatic, benzene, is a 
carcinogen that is "the No. 1 toxic in Southern California air," according to 
ARB spokesman Bill Sessa. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, about one-third of the olefins and aromatics have been removed from 
EC-1, and about 50% of the benzene. 
</P>
<P>
To replace them, Arco uses a compound called methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or 
MTBE, an oxygen-containing molecule. Like olefins and aromatics, MTBE has a 
high energy content and is slow burning. But if it escapes into the air, it 
does not contribute to smog formation and it has no adverse health effects. 
</P>
<P>
A different gasoline formulation that includes MTBE already is used in 
high-altitude cities, such as Denver and Phoenix, where the oxygen it contains 
promotes complete combustion of gasoline during winter. 
</P>
<P>
But it is more costly than olefins and aromatics, raising the manufacturing 
cost of EC-1 about 2 cents per gallon above the cost of leaded regular. Arco 
has decided to absorb the extra cost to maintain a competitive pricing 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Two independent laboratories recently tested the reformulated gasoline in 16 
Japanese and American cars from model years 1970 to 1978 and four Japanese and 
American pickups from model years 1975 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The labs found that EC-1 cut evaporative emissions by 21%, carbon monoxide by 
9%, nitrogen oxides by 5% and hydrocarbons by 4%, Townsend said. Drivability 
tests conducted by Arco, he said, also showed that it gave "more power and 
performance under load" than leaded regular. 
</P>
<P>
The labs have so far tested EC-1 in five new cars as well. Preliminary results 
indicate, Townsend said, "that this will clean up new cars just as good or 
better than it did the older cars. " 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, producing a complete line of gasolines like EC-1 will require 
renovating the refineries, at a cost of at least $100 million apiece. Before 
Arco makes that kind of investment, Townsend said, it wants to make sure there 
is not a better formula than EC-1. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend estimated that it would require one to two years to develop the 
specifications for gasolines to replace the current unleaded fuels, then three 
years to rebuild the refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the petroleum and auto companies are planning to test reformulated 
fuels in 40 new cars over the next year to determine which combinations of 
fuels and technology produce the lowest emissions. Although some companies may 
offer their own versions of EC-1 in the near future, changes in gasoline for 
new cars are unlikely before the end of the trials. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the chairman of one company, Unocal's Richard Stegemeier, said, 
"We don't plan to do anything drastic until the study is over."

SONY TO PAY $3.4 BILLION FOR COLUMBIA PICTURES; 
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE FIRM WILLING TO OFFER HIGH PRICE TO GET FILM, TV SOFTWARE FOR VIDEO 
EQUIPMENT IT MAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the largest U.S. acquisition to date by a Japanese firm, Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment agreed Wednesday to be acquired by Sony Corp. for $3.4 billion in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Sony immediately pledged to put the 65-year-old movie and TV studio in the 
hands of Sony's U.S. subsidiary and to "keep it as independent as possible, as 
a full-fledged member of the U.S. film industry." 
</P>
<P>
Sony executives said that they were in talks with producers Peter Guber and Jon 
Peters, co-chief executives of Guber-Peters Entertainment Co., about taking 
some management role at the company. Industry sources say Sony is considering 
making Guber Columbia's chief executive and speculated that Sony might also buy 
up the small, publicly traded Guber-Peters firm. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment includes the Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star 
studios, television programming and syndication operations, a huge film and TV 
library and the 820-screen Loews movie theater chain. The 2,500-employee 
company has been secretly talking with Sony intermittently for more than a 
year, and it received a firm buyout proposal last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's board voted on the Sony proposal at a meeting in New York at 8:30 
a.m. Wednesday and sat down to sign papers with Sony executives an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is part of a consolidation that the film industry is undergoing as 
increasing entertainment viewing worldwide has driven up the studios' values. 
Already this year, the Warner Bros. studio has been sold to Time Inc. with its 
parent, Warner Communications; and MGM/UA Communications has agreed to be sold 
to Qintex Group of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia deal represents the first time that a Japanese concern has 
purchased a major Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
Sony was willing to pay a lofty $27 a share for a company with meager earnings 
because of the strategic value of Columbia's films and TV programs to a concern 
with a strong hold on emerging TV and audio technologies, analysts said. 
Columbia's films will provide the "software" for Sony videocassette recorders, 
for example, and for the 8-millimeter recorder Sony is trying to popularize. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the studio "extends Sony's long-term strategy of building a 
total entertainment business around the synergy of audio and video hardware and 
software," said Michael P. Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the high price offered by Sony makes it unlikely that a 
competing bid will emerge at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Co., Columbia's largest shareholder, with a 49% stake, has given Sony 
an option to purchase those shares, Sony said. Coca-Cola's management has 
pledged that it will recommend sale of the shares at a board meeting set for 
Oct. 2. Allen &amp; Co., the New York investment banking firm that holds a 3% 
stake in Columbia, has given Sony an option to buy its shares as well. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's two top executives, President and chief executive Victor R. Kaufman 
and chief operating officer Lewis Korman, will leave the company when the sale 
is completed, Columbia said. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof said in an interview that he has held "conversations with Peter Guber 
and Jon Peters, and we're hopeful some kind of an arrangement can be reached." 
He would not elaborate. Trading in Guber-Peters stock was suspended at 9:26 
a.m. Wednesday after rumors of the talks were publicized. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of Guber's possible appointment raised questions in Hollywood about 
Columbia movie chief Dawn Steel's future, as well as the future of other senior 
personnel at Columbia. Some observers wondered if Guber's connections with 
Warner Bros. suggested that the new regime might lure talent from that studio. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof said Columbia is "run by very capable people" and described the 
studio's future as "business as usual." He refused to comment on Steel's future 
or on how effective he believes she has been since she began trying to reverse 
the movie unit's sagging fortunes last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know her only by reputation, and obviously the company thinks very highly of 
her," said Schulhof, who is also a director of Sony. 
</P>
<P>
A key player in the Sony-Columbia talks has been Walter Yetnikoff, chairman of 
Sony's CBS Records unit. Schulhof said Yetnikoff would have a voice in 
Columbia's "strategic decisions" but added that Columbia would be "independent" 
of CBS Records. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof said major layoffs are "not our style . . . . We're not a (leveraged 
buyout) outfit; we didn't buy the company to carve it up." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that employment has increased at CBS Records since Sony purchased it 
from CBS Inc. early last year for $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was acquired, CBS Records has again moved into music publishing and 
has begun manufacturing compact discs for the first time, he said. In all, Sony 
Corp. of America employs 12,000, operates six major factories and is "very much 
an American company, run by Americans," Schulhof said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not expect the company's Japanese ownership to be an obstacle in 
Hollywood, where personal relationships are so often crucial. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will mean that Coca-Cola will end its difficult seven-year 
adventure in entertainment with an enormous profit. The stock sale will bring 
about $1.5 billion before taxes, or $1.2 billion after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The soft drink company scaled back its involvement in 1987, when it combined 
Columbia, Tri-Star and its other entertainment units into one company and spun 
off 51% of it to the public. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain on Wednesday, former Columbia Pictures movie chief David Puttnam 
said he believed that Coca-Cola had been looking to sell its remaining shares 
even in 1987. "I had no doubt . . . this was going to happen," said the 
director, who alienated many of Hollywood's most powerful figures during his 
iconoclastic reign. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Columbia Chairman Donald R. Keough said Sony was "an ideal 
buyer . . . . It has all the right characteristics and, very importantly, has 
the ability to take the company to its next important step."

BUSH PLANS NEW AID TO COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. HOPES TO COUNTER PRESSURE ON BOGOTA TO END ANTI-DRUG WAR 
</P>

<P>
President Bush plans to offer new assistance to Colombian President Virgilio 
Barco Vargas, including possible support for financially depressed coffee 
growers, to counter mounting pressure on Bogota to call off its war on the drug 
cartels, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will discuss the additional U.S. help at the White House today in what 
will be his first face-to-face meeting with Barco since the Colombian leader, 
backed by $65 million in emergency U.S. military assistance, declared war on 
drug traffickers last month. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the Barco government has been unable to contain a wave of 
terrorist attacks launched by the powerful cocaine cartels, and influential 
Colombians have begun urging the government to negotiate with the drug 
kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Moral Support' 
</P>
<P>
"The specific signal is (that) you want to show support for him and put an arm 
around the guy and say, 'We're with you,' " a White House official said. He 
called the scheduled session a "meeting of moral support." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the specific contents of the assistance package 
have not yet been determined. "We want to find out what we can do that would be 
most helpful to him," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the momentum of the Colombian crackdown is of crucial importance to 
the Administration's new anti-drug strategy, which places increased emphasis on 
U.S.-backed efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs at their source in the 
Andean nations of South America. 
</P>
<P>
Any sign of capitulation by the Colombian government could weaken congressional 
support for the rest of the Administration's Andean initiative, which calls for 
$2 billion in military and economic assistance to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real make-or-break time," said Robert J. Kurz, a scholar at the 
Brookings Institution. "Either you redouble your efforts and get stronger, or 
you begin to drift back to the normal kind of bickering." 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly," an Administration official said, "we're coming to an important 
juncture." 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on Barco to back away from the anti-drug crackdown have resulted, 
in large part, from the relentless bombings that are part of the cartels' 
"total war" on the government. 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative effect of more than 100 attacks so far appears to have persuaded 
important sectors of Colombia's population that the struggle against the 
powerful traffickers is not worth the risk it entails. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extradition Decision Due 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Colombian Supreme Court is nearing a long-awaited 
decision on the constitutionality of a major weapon in the crackdown: a 
provision that permits extradition of some traffickers for trial in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
With most observers expecting the court to undermine the government's power, 
some fear that the days of the anti-drug offensive already are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
"A crackdown is an episodic application of force," said Renssalaer Lee, an 
adjunct professor at American University who is an expert on Colombia. "I don't 
think that the Colombian government can maintain the current crackdown with the 
current level of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Among the plans being considered by the White House to help bolster the 
beleaguered government are a pledge to take the lead in repairing an 
international coffee agreement. Collapse of the pact last month produced a free 
fall in coffee prices that could cost Colombia up to $400 million in 
foreign-exchange income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coffee Price Accord 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official emphasized that the international nature of the accord 
means that the United States cannot by itself resurrect the price agreement. 
But he said he expects the White House to offer to convene new negotiations 
aimed at boosting prices paid to Colombian growers. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible offers could include U.S. promises to lower barriers to key 
Colombian imports, including cut flowers, and to accelerate the deployment of a 
fleet of armored cars already promised for the protection of Colombian judges, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the President indicated that he expects to honor an earlier 
request from Barco that the United States sponsor a "high-level drug meeting 
with the presidents of various countries." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be very interested in his view on it and . . . how that could help on 
this fight," Bush said in an interview with a small group of reporters in the 
Oval Office. The President said he believes such a meeting would be "a 
constructive thing." 
</P>
<P>
Such gestures could help assuage Colombian concerns that the United States has 
given too high a priority to military solutions to that country's drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Bogota have complained that the $65 million in U.S. assistance 
provided so far has been largely ill-suited to the anti-drug effort. Instead, 
they have urged economic assistance to prop up impoverished sectors of their 
country's legal economy. 
</P>
<P>
Before departing for Washington, Barco made clear through the Colombian Embassy 
in Washington that he plans to ask the United States for help in restoring the 
system of coffee quotas. The Colombian press also reported that Barco will seek 
tariff reductions as part of a bid for more "international backing" for his 
anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressures against him, Barco has stood firm in his determination to 
persist in the anti-drug offensive and has refused to consider negotiations 
with the drug lords. And White House officials insisted there are no 
indications that Barco's resolve is crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise address Tuesday evening, broadcast nationwide on television and 
radio, Barco warned Colombians that the traffickers want to "destroy the most 
precious thing Colombians have -- their democracy." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he announced the conclusion of a peace accord with the April 
19 movement, also known as M-19, a 2,000-member guerrilla organization that has 
been battling government forces for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The government continues to negotiate with five other guerrilla forces. Its 
willingness to strike deals with such adversaries, but not with the cocaine 
cartels, is seen as evidence of Barco's determination to concentrate government 
resources on the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to shore up Barco, the White House might include 
assistance without making the details public, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, Bush and Barco likely will discuss contingencies under 
which Colombia could continue to wage its anti-drug effort even if its Supreme 
Court invalidates the extradition treaty. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, given the suspicions felt by many Colombians about U.S. 
intentions, other aid might be more beneficial if offered quietly, rather than 
with a made-in-the-U.S.A. label, the official added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that we want to be helpful to Barco," he said. "It's not clear that 
everything we do would be helpful if it is done publicly."

UC EXPANSION PLAN CRITICIZED AS UNNEEDED IN STATE ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In one of the strongest criticisms of the University of California's expansion 
plans, the legislative analyst's office said Wednesday that UC's expected 
enrollment growth could be handled without building the three new campuses the 
university is planning. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe there is a justification" for the three campuses UC officials 
hope to open in the next decade, Stuart Marshall of the legislative analyst's 
staff testified at a hearing of the Senate Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said there is room for the 63,000 additional students UC is expecting 
by the year 2005 on existing campuses, especially at the under-utilized UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst noted that UC already plans to house about two-thirds of the new 
students on existing campuses, leaving slightly more than 20,000 "unhoused" 
graduate and undergraduate students in the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
If UC Riverside were to grow to an enrollment of 25,000 in that time, instead 
of the planned 15,000, Marshall said, half of the university's anticipated 
excess capacity could be accommodated on the Southern California campus. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative analyst's office also believes that UC is planning on 6,000 
more graduate and professional students than can realistically be expected in 
the next 15 years, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
If that number is subtracted from the expected "unhoused" students, about 4,000 
remain, the legislative analyst's office believes, and these could be 
accommodated on the university's seven other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to start one new campus at most," Marshall said, "but they 
could do it (the expansion) with slight over-enrollments on all the present 
campuses." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's discussion, which took place before Senate Education Committee 
Chairman Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), the only committee member present, 
presaged a debate that will become increasingly heated in the state capital 
next year, as all three higher education segments -- UC, the California State 
University and the campus community college system -- all press their requests 
for new campuses. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Baker, UC vice president for budget and university relations, 
replied that sending much of the new enrollment to Riverside would create 
undesirable strains on that campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes chaos when you grow too fast," Baker said, citing the experience at 
UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s and '70s, when "people were milling about, with 
no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to repeat that," he said. "We think it would be a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Frazer, senior vice president for academic affairs, said that 
Riverside "already is growing more rapidly than any other campus" and that it 
would damage "academic quality" to grow faster. 
</P>
<P>
He said the faculty would have to increase in size by 10% a year, forcing 
current faculty members to spend too much time recruiting new colleagues and 
leading to a decline in the "quality of the faculty recruited." 
</P>
<P>
UC Davis Chancellor Theodore L. Hullar said UC generally needs to increase its 
percentage of graduate and professional students from the current campus 
average of 18% to at least 20% in order to compete with the nation's best 
research universities. 
</P>
<P>
But Marshall noted that UC San Diego has built a reputation as one of the 
country's best research universities, especially in several scientific areas, 
with a graduate enrollment of about 13% of the total number of students. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three campuses UC is seeking, Cal State wants another five, 
in addition to the San Marcos campus in northern San Diego County that will 
open next year. Community college system officials estimate that they will need 
at least 16 new campuses by 2005, to go along with the 107 existing campuses, 
to accommodate estimated enrollment growth.

2 INDICTED IN ARTIFICIAL GROWTH HORMONE SALES 
</P>

<P>
A Sacramento-area bodybuilder and a Carmel man have been charged with 
distributing a genetically engineered human growth hormone, a drug increasingly 
sought by top athletes as a non-detectable substitute for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Cambra Jr., 31, of Carmichael and James V. Sorrano, 29, of Carmel 
were named in the 12-count indictment filed Wednesday in San Diego federal 
court. The indictment also included charges of conspiring to sell the synthetic 
hormone, distributing steroids and distributing counterfeit steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were the first by federal prosecutors involving the distribution of 
the synthetic hormone, an expensive drug prescribed only for children with 
growth deficiencies but in increasing demand among world-class athletes seeking 
to pass drug tests, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Phillip L. B. Halpern of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was unsealed after the arrest of Cambra Wednesday morning in 
Carmichael, a Sacramento suburb. Known as a national-class bodybuilder and 
owner of a Carmichael gym, Cambra was being held pending a bail hearing today 
in U.S. District Court in Sacramento, Halpern said. Police were searching for 
Sorrano, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, both face up to 38 years in prison and $3 million in fines. 
Cambra ran a nationwide network that distributed large amounts of the synthetic 
hormone and bogus anabolic steroids, the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The hormone substitute costs between $600 and $1,200 per dose on the black 
market, Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of that it's not used by every Tom, Dick and Harry who wants to use 
steroids," he said. "Only top-level athletes, be they bodybuilders, track and 
field, etcetera, would want to use human growth hormone." 
</P>
<P>
The hormone is so hard to detect under the drug tests currently given to 
athletes, Halpern said, that "if you took it in the last Olympics, it would not 
have been caught." 
</P>
<P>
The hormone is the compound Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner 
recently was accused of taking. Sprinter Darrell Robinson told the West German 
magazine Stern that he sold Griffith Joyner 10 cubic centimeters of the hormone 
for $2,000 in 1988. Griffith Joyner, who retired from competition in February, 
denies the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
Because the risk of being caught using the growth hormone is so low, an 
"expanding" segment of the $200-million to $400-million black market in 
steroids is turning to the hormone, according to Halpern, who is acknowledged 
as the nation's leading prosecutor of illegal steroid sales. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows only two American firms to make 
the compound, Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, which calls the drug 
Humatrope, and Eli Lilly Co. of Indianapolis, which calls it Protropin. Sold at 
retail for $450 per dose, Halpern said, it is prescribed for children whose 
pituitary glands do not naturally secrete enough growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
It aids athletes, Halpern said, because it produces effects similar to 
steroids, which help the body build and repair tissue, even under tremendous 
workout stress. To use the synthetic hormone, two refrigerated substances, one 
crystalline and one liquid, must be mixed and then injected, Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
Cambra and Sorrano were charged in connection with the Sept. 23, 1988, sale to 
undercover agents of $100,000 worth of the Lilly hormone, Halpern said. Worth 
$250,000 to $500,000 on the black market, the hormone had been trucked down 
from Northern California to the buy site, a motel in El Centro in Imperial 
County, Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known how much, if any, of the hormone substitute allegedly 
distributed by Cambra and Sorrano actually was sold to athletes.

ABORTION PILL MAY HELP TREAT RARE TUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversial abortion pill RU 486, which is sold in France and China but 
not the United States, may prove effective in treating a rare tumor of the 
brain and spinal cord, according to preliminary findings to be made public 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The results, to be presented by USC researchers at a meeting of neurological 
surgeons in Tucson, raise the possibility that the drug could eventually be 
approved for U.S. use, not to terminate pregnancies but to control tumor 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Our study has nothing to do with abortion, " said Dr. Steven Grunberg, the USC 
oncologist who headed the study. "The drug happens to have the hormonal effect 
that we're looking for to try to treat this tumor." 
</P>
<P>
The abortion pill, which can be taken up to five weeks after conception, is 
viewed as a revolutionary step in fertility control: It promises a safer, 
easier and more private abortion than the traditional surgical approach, 
advocates as well as critics acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
But intense opposition by groups opposed to abortion prompted the drug's 
manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, to suspend distribution in France last October 
shortly after it was approved for sale. The company resumed distribution later 
that month on orders from the French government. 
</P>
<P>
No pharmaceutical company has applied for permission to market RU 486 in the 
United States. Opponents of abortion have vowed to organize a consumer boycott 
of all the products of any U.S. drug firm that tries to distribute the pill. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the French researcher who developed the pill, Etienne-Emile 
Baulieu, was awarded the Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award, one of six 
prestigious prizes given annually by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inoperable Tumor 
</P>
<P>
Baulieu predicted that the award would help make the drug more widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
According to Grunberg, his research group gave the pill to 14 men and women 
with an inoperable meningioma -- a tumor, usually benign, of the covering of 
the brain and spinal cord. The slow-growing tumor causes symptoms ranging from 
headaches to impaired mental functioning. 
</P>
<P>
In four patients, the tumor shrank about 10%, Grunberg said. In six, it 
remained stable. Two others were referred out of the study for chemotherapy 
after their tumor proved malignant. One other patient's tumor grew, and one 
dropped out of the study for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited and encouraged because we feel that four of the 14 have 
shown a response," Grunberg said in an interview. He said the shrinkage was 
small but "in the skull, even a few millimeters can make the difference between 
a major neurologic problem or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Disease 
</P>
<P>
Meningiomas are rare: About one new case per every 100,000 population is 
diagnosed each year. The tumor expands slowly and the usual treatment is 
surgery, but in some cases the tumor is located in a place that makes it 
dangerous to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Grunberg stressed that further studies in larger numbers of patients are needed 
to confirm his findings. He was scheduled to present his results today at the 
annual scientific meeting of the National Academy of Neurological Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
RU 486, also known as mifepristone, is a synthetic steroid with a chemical 
structure resembling that of the hormone progesterone. By attaching itself to 
progesterone receptors in the body, it effectively blocks the action of real 
progesterone. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of meningiomas appears to be influenced by hormones. The tumors are 
three times as common in women as men, and they increase during pregnancy. 
Furthermore, scientists have identified progesterone receptors on the surface 
of meningioma tumor cells. 
</P>
<P>
As an abortion pill, RU 486 brings on a woman's menstrual period by blocking 
the action of progesterone. Progesterone helps thicken the lining of the uterus 
so a fertilized egg can become implanted and develop.

The crash of a Grand Canyon tour plane Wednesday is likely to spark new debate 
over whether more restrictions should be imposed on aircraft flying over 
national parks. 
</P>
<P>
A deadly collision over the canyon in 1986 was responsible for the passage of a 
law the following year prohibiting aircraft from flying below the canyon rim 
and restricting planes to certain routes and altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
But environmental groups have pressed for a complete flight ban over the canyon 
to preserve its quiet and tranquility, and the National Park Service is 
studying the possibility of putting more of the Grand Canyon and other national 
parks off limits to aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's crash, which killed 10 passengers, occurred at an airport 
about seven miles from the park, it "once again raises questions of just how 
safe this whole operation is," National Park Service spokesman Duncan Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If flights are going to be tightly controlled over the canyon, it may require 
the investment of a major traffic control system at Grand Canyon Airport," he 
said. "This crash will raise again the question of just how reliable the air 
traffic control system is." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Park Service has wanted the Federal Aviation Administration to 
build a radar system at the Grand Canyon Airport to regulate flights within the 
park. Even though the absence of radar was not blamed for Wednesday's accident, 
the crash gives opponents of the flights more ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a tourist, I would be asking some questions," said Maggie Fox, 
southwest regional director of the Sierra Club, which favors a more tightly 
"orchestrated" air traffic control system. "You have to find out why this plane 
crashed, but I also would be asking what are the parameters of controls over 
these flights. There is an unfortunate history here." 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has rejected Park Service requests for radar. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic doesn't meet radar requirements," George Sullivan, an FAA manager 
responsible for Grand Canyon air traffic, said Wednesday. "There just isn't 
enough (traffic), and radar is very expensive. Now if Congress comes back and 
says they want us to do that (install radar), we'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan refused to speculate on whether radar will be necessary if new 
regulations are adopted to further restrict aircraft over the canyon. Those put 
into effect after the 1986 crash have already squeezed more aircraft into a 
smaller air space. 
</P>
<P>
"We do compress them," Sullivan said. "There's no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules have also made canyon flights safer, he added. Even though pilots 
continue to operate under visual flight rules, which means "see and be seen," 
planes flying in different directions now must fly at different altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club wants aircraft banned from the canyon altogether and at a 
minimum, supports more restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"If you determine you don't have any flights below the rim, and certain areas 
are off limits, and you have a whole lot of tour operators that want to fly 
over it, you are going to have to orchestrate exactly who takes off when and 
exactly what patterns they take once they take off," the Sierra Club's Fox 
said.

BLOCKADE STRANGLING ARMENIAN CAPITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past three weeks, the Armenian capital of Yerevan has been slowly 
strangled by an economic blockade imposed by the neighboring Soviet republic of 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Freight trains carrying food and fuel to Armenia have been halted in 
Azerbaijan, the major highways into Armenia are blocked by armed gangs, and 
military airlifts have been able to bring in only limited supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In a power play unprecedented in Soviet politics, Azerbaijan has squeezed 
Armenia hard in an effort to force it to give up its demand that the region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of Armenian Christians in Muslim Azerbaijan, be 
ceded to it. 
</P>
<P>
"They said that nothing would pass, and virtually nothing did," Shchors B. 
Dartian, a member of the Armenian Communist Party leadership, said here 
Wednesday. "It was a tactic based ultimately on starvation, and if our people 
died, well, no matter to the Azerbaijanis. We know they are fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
In Yerevan, traffic dwindled to a trickle of emergency vehicles, and even most 
of them stood idle for a lack of gas. Factories closed one after the other as 
they ran out of supplies and the city rationed power to conserve fuel. Shop 
shelves were quickly emptied, even of matches, and they remained bare. 
</P>
<P>
More than 26,400 rail cars -- carrying more than 600,000 tons of goods -- have 
been held up in Azerbaijan, according to Armenian officials. About 85% of 
Armenia's goods pass through Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
For Yerevan's 1 million residents, life in the last three weeks became an 
endless hunt for increasingly scarce food, long walks to work when the buses 
stopped running and, above all, a growing realization of Armenia's embattled 
position in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer just a struggle for Nagorno-Karabakh, as central as that 
issue is for us, but a struggle for the survival of Armenia," Dartian said in 
an interview. "The Azerbaijanis have their hands at our throats, and so it is 
becoming a fight to the death." 
</P>
<P>
For Armenians, after the devastating earthquake last Dec. 7 that killed more 
than 25,000 of their people, the struggle with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh 
has added to what officials call "our traumatized historical memory." 
</P>
<P>
"When we feel Azerbaijan reaching out to strangle us with this blockade, it 
immediately brings back everything associated with the 1915 genocide against 
Armenians," Levon G. Ehramjenz, chief of political information at the Armenian 
Foreign Ministry, said. "And when we see so little help coming for us from the 
rest of the Soviet Union to resolve this crisis, our fear of disappearing as a 
people becomes all the greater." 
</P>
<P>
Initial efforts by the central government to end the blockade through mediation 
failed. The troops guarding the convoys of trucks through Azerbaijan were fired 
upon and, under orders to avoid bloodshed, were forced to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned both republics Monday that they 
had exhausted the patience of the Soviet leadership over Nagorno-Karabakh, and 
he gave them two days to agree to negotiate the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The first few trains, seven of them with a total of 500 cars, arrived in 
Armenia on Tuesday. But this was just a fraction of the 50 trains that normally 
arrive daily, and they brought little hope of a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cars carried only construction materials, the food in the boxcars 
had rotted long ago and was infested with vermin, and half of the fuel cars 
were filled with water or were simply empty. 
</P>
<P>
"These freight trains were just a cruel joke," Yuri S. Mkhitaryan, a senior 
official at the Armenian State Construction Committee, said in an interview. 
"We are used to that from the Azerbaijanis, but this is a trick that they are 
playing on Mikhail Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of the central government, until now, to use its power to break 
the blockade and to enforce the law has left many Armenians skeptical about 
Gorbachev's resolve in dealing with the country's mounting ethnic problems. Now 
an acute crisis that stretches across much of the nation, these problems also 
involve the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Byelorussia, 
Moldavia and the Ukraine and Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
And the struggle that began nearly two years ago over Nagorno-Karabakh, a 
fertile plateau in the Caucasus Mountains, has implications for the stability 
of the whole Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the principles -- the rule of law or the use of force -- on which 
this country will be run?" an Armenian deputy to the Supreme Soviet demanded 
this week in Moscow. "When the law is flouted by those using force, as it now 
is in Azerbaijan, what will our central government do? When reason and 
persuasion and conciliation fail, as they have done, how do we restore order? 
</P>
<P>
"And when one Soviet socialist republic imposes an economic blockade, something 
that is normally regarded as an act of war, against another fraternal republic, 
what is the meaning of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics?" 
</P>
<P>
Armenians say now that they would accept presidential rule for 
Nagorno-Karabakh, putting it under the central government until passions are 
calm and a permanent solution can be found. 
</P>
<P>
But Azerbaijan's Parliament voted 10 days ago to resist any such move and 
demanded restoration of its authority over the disputed region. The blockade 
had begun with a general strike called by the radical new Azerbaijan Popular 
Front to force the republic's leadership to take stronger stands on the 
Nagorno-Karabakh and other nationalist issues there. 
</P>
<P>
When the strike ended, bands of militants from the Azerbaijani Popular Front 
maintained the blockade, and the republic's leaders appear unable to restore 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"The knot gets tighter and tighter all the time," Ehramjenz of the Armenian 
Foreign Ministry said, "and it is very hard to say how it can be untied or even 
cut through." 
</P>
<P>
Arkady Volsky, the central government's special representative for 
Nagorno-Karabakh, said in Moscow last week that he can see no solution, that 
negotiations broke down long ago and that not a single agreement reached in 
earlier talks had ever been kept. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh has been critical so long that the term has 
lost its meaning there, Volsky said. It has been under blockade for 18 months, 
it has virtually severed all its ties with Azerbaijan and it operates under 
effective martial law. 
</P>
<P>
"Slowness in untying the Karabakh knot and the escalation of tensions in 
relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan have created a situation that is close 
to critical," Volsky said in a television interview. "And there is no talk of 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
The blockade of Armenia had eased enough Wednesday so that trucks bringing food 
from the countryside were able to sell meat, fruit and vegetables along the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Long lines quickly formed at the city's few gas stations as drivers waited for 
hours to fill their tanks with gasoline, brought around Azerbaijan through 
Georgia, another Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
"The harvest saved us," one Yerevan newspaper editor said, explaining how the 
city's residents have survived the blockade. "Agriculture remains strong, but 
there were problems getting the food from the fields into the towns and even in 
harvesting it. In Yerevan, we have eaten through virtually all our reserves. In 
our family, we are on our last jar of jam."

STRATEGIC ARMS PACT LIKELY BEFORE SUMMIT, BUSH SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In his most upbeat assessment yet of the prospects for reaching an agreement to 
cut strategic nuclear arms, President Bush said Wednesday there is "a good 
likelihood" that a treaty will be ready for signing by the time he meets next 
year with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush balked at accepting a Soviet challenge to halt all nuclear weapons 
tests, arguing that they are needed to maintain confidence in the safety and 
soundness of the warheads. 
</P>
<P>
With senior Soviet and U.S. officials publicly trading optimistic forecasts 
almost daily -- much as they have engaged in hostile verbal attacks in past 
years -- the President's comments reflect what he twice called the "civil 
climate" marking Washington's current relations with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the remarks in an interview in the Oval Office with a small group of 
reporters before flying by Marine Corps helicopter to Charlottesville to attend 
a two-day meeting of the nation's governors. Bush called the sessions to 
examine the state of education in the United States. A transcript of the 
interview was made available here by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who is scheduled to meet with Gorbachev in late spring or early 
summer, said the agreement to meet the Soviet leader "perhaps will serve as a 
catalyst for moving forward" in the effort to cut U.S. and Soviet arsenals of 
strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a given," he said. "But I would agree that we have a good likelihood 
that might happen." 
</P>
<P>
The President added: "I don't want to set it up so that if we don't have every 
't' crossed and 'i' dotted, that the summit next spring or summer is considered 
a failure." 
</P>
<P>
His optimism on the prospects for an arms agreement echoed that of Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who said in an address Tuesday to the 
U.N. General Assembly that by the time of the summit conference, "we may have 
passed the last turn on the road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive 
arms. These are real prospects." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also challenged the United States to ban all production of its 
newest forms of chemical weapons -- a step that Bush said he "absolutely" 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bush said in a speech at the United Nations that the United States 
would cut its stockpile of poison gas by 80%, if the Soviets would reduce their 
larger supplies to a level that would be equal to the reduced American 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet foreign minister also had said that the Soviet Union would reinstate 
a previous moratorium on nuclear tests "any day and hour if the United States 
reciprocates." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush said Wednesday: "As long as we are dependent for a deterrence based on 
nuclear weapons, I would have difficulty eliminating all testing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that these weapons be safe. It's important they be sound," he 
said. His opposition to halting the tests reflects a long-running Pentagon 
concern that a failure to routinely check the operations of its long-range 
missiles and nuclear warheads would lead to uncertainty about whether they will 
function accurately -- and thus serve as a deterrent to others' aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, Bush said that "we don't 
have a disconnect with Mr. Gorbachev," a condition that has eased discussions 
of "contentious regional issues or arms control issues." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times . . . when it was very difficult even to bring subjects 
up without getting a rhetorical diatribe on the question," he said. "And now 
you can talk about any subject very openly. This is a very constructive 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the President said, the two nations "will probably have strong 
differences for a long time." He added: "I don't want to do something naive or 
silly in defense just because we are working more closely with the Soviets 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Answering complaints by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) that 
his response to the greater political openness in the Soviet Union has been too 
timid, the President said, "The team I have here (in Washington) knows what 
it's doing." 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Mitchell called on the Administration to grant 
most-favored-nation trading status to the Soviet Union. He urged Bush to grant 
Moscow a temporary waiver of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which denied 
trade concessions until the Soviet Union allowed Jews and others to emigrate 
freely. Gorbachev lifted most emigration restrictions last year. 
</P>
<P>
But a White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said that the Administration does 
not plan to lift the Jackson-Vanik restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we would have to see some legislation, some 
institutionalization of the right of emigration, before lifting Jackson-Vanik," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President defended Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's warnings of the risks of 
too close a relationship with Moscow, and said: "We speak with one voice. 
Cheney's voice is loud and clear. And he's saying, don't do anything dumb. 
Don't make the mistake of unilaterally disarming -- knocking out significant 
strategic modernization programs at the very minute that the Soviet Union is 
going forward on the modernization front."

NEW U.S. RULES MAKE SOVIET IMMIGRATION MORE DIFFICULT 
</P>

<P>
The United States, overwhelmed by a dramatic surge in the number of Soviet 
citizens permitted by their government to emigrate, has changed its rules so 
that Soviets will face far more difficulty in being allowed to settle in 
America, a senior U.S. official told reporters here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, which take effect Monday, not only close the door to some 
would-be immigrants but also reflect a significant change in the way the United 
States views the issue of Soviet emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, U.S. officials, citing human rights violations, protested regularly 
that Moscow should give exit visas to all who wished to go, and virtually every 
Soviet citizen who received permission from his government to leave was 
welcomed into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Moscow has opened its doors much wider, permitting about 300,000 
Soviet citizens to seek U.S. immigration visas in the year that will end Sept. 
30, the United States is forced into the uncomfortable role of setting limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a bit of a moral quandary," a top-ranking U.S. official in Moscow 
said. "We insisted for years that all Soviets who wanted to should be allowed 
to go to the United States. Now we're the ones telling them no." 
</P>
<P>
The regulations, under which 70,000 to 80,000 Soviet citizens are expected to 
be allowed to emigrate to the United States in the next fiscal year, require in 
the majority of cases that new immigrants have either parents, children, 
brothers, sisters or spouses living in the United States, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. government leaflet being distributed to Soviets in Moscow, 
U.S. immigration officials will make exceptions in cases "of special concern to 
the United States," but those with no close family ties "will face long delays, 
and may wish to explore alternative destinations." 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations are likely to please Israel, because they will eliminate 
the so-called "dropout phenomenon." This involves Soviet Jews who have been 
granted visas to Israel but who, once in a third country, usually Austria or 
Italy, then seek and receive U.S. visas. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the U.S. official said, Soviet citizens sent to third countries 
on their way to Israel will no longer be granted visas to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger Testimony 
</P>
<P>
The announcement underscored recent testimony in Washington by Deputy Secretary 
of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the increase in emigration "a great success for our American foreign 
policy," Eagleburger, nevertheless, said that the practice of granting visas in 
third countries posed an insoluble and overwhelming problem with the rapidly 
rising tide of applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"While we applaud these developments, we must be honest in appraising our 
national ability to respond to unprecedented, unpredictable and previously 
unmanaged flows of people," he told the Senate's Judiciary Committee's 
subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish organizations in the United States supported the changes as constructive 
efforts to deal with the unprecedented surge of emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive director of the Conference of Presidents of 
Major American Jewish Organizations in New York, called the new policy "a 
thoughtful approach." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to the United States, as well as victims of 
more recent persecutions such as Christian Armenians living in areas under the 
control of Muslim Azerbaijanis, fear that their chances may be worsened by the 
new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet citizens who gather daily outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow seeking a 
visa to emigrate said Wednesday that they were confused about the new rules and 
concerned about how they would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who talked with reporters with the understanding that he 
would not be further identified, said the United States is simply trying to 
treat the Soviet Union like any other country, and added, "This is the way 
refugee business is done all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials interviewing would-be immigrants will be taking greater 
care to differentiate between victims of persecution and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, applicants will pick up questionnaires in Moscow, fill 
them out and send them to Washington, where immigration officials will study 
them and, within three or four months, notify those they find to be acceptable 
candidates for immigration. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates will receive in the mail a letter notifying them of a time for 
an appointment with U.S. officials in the embassy in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have close relatives living in the United States and are found by the 
Moscow interviewer to be victims of persecution will be granted refugee status. 
This carries with it about $7,000 each in resettlement aid, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Those with close relatives living in the United States who are not victims of 
persecution, but are selected by Washington, will be allowed to enter the 
country as "parolees," without official status but with permission to live and 
work there.

QUAYLE TO HOLD TALKS ON CAMBODIA POLICY

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, winding up a two-week tour of Asia that concentrated 
on U.S. security issues, plans to meet today with officials of four Southeast 
Asian nations in a bid to revive U.S. policy toward Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will meet with representatives of Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and 
Indonesia shortly after arriving in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, a senior 
U.S. official traveling with the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is, we don't know very much about what's going on inside 
Cambodia," the official said. "The function of the meeting will be to get their 
views about exactly where we stand." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle also plans to meet with Malaysian officials to soothe feelings ruffled 
last month when officials of neighboring Singapore suggested that they might be 
willing to play host to U.S. naval facilities now in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Singapore have had troubled relations in the past, and Malaysian 
officials are not eager to have their neighbor playing host to a major military 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the U.S. bases in the Philippines dominated the past two days of 
Quayle's trip. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Quayle presented President Corazon Aquino with a letter from 
President Bush formally asking that negotiations over the future of the bases 
begin in December. In a reply letter to Bush, Aquino agreed to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I, too, envision fruitful discussions in the spirit of amity that has marked 
our long relationship," Aquino wrote. 
</P>
<P>
While negotiations over the bases promise to be difficult, advancing U.S. 
policy in Cambodia has proven all but impossible for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Goal Realized 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks the United States has seen one goal realized -- the withdrawal 
from Cambodia of Vietnamese troops. But the broader goal espoused by the U.S. 
government and its Southeast Asian allies has proven elusive. 
</P>
<P>
The goal has been to free Cambodia from Vietnamese domination without restoring 
to power the brutal Khmer Rouge, blamed for the deaths of more than 1 million 
Cambodians by disease, starvation and execution during a 3 1/2-year rule that 
ended with the Vietnamese invasion of late December, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to both the Communist Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese-backed 
government headed by Hun Sen, the United States has pushed a coalition of 
non-Communist resistance groups. Earlier this year, Quayle helped lobby through 
Congress a bill authorizing military assistance to those forces. 
</P>
<P>
But aid to the resistance remains controversial, because the non-Communist 
groups are allied, at least for now, with the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>

With the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, and the collapse last month of Paris 
talks on a Cambodian settlement, further fighting is expected between Cambodian 
government troops and the three-party resistance forces. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle hopes that the ambassadors he meets will offer some ideas about steps 
that might stave off renewed large-scale fighting in Cambodia. He also would 
like to see a new endorsement of the policy of aiding the non-Communist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The policy disturbs some Administration officials and many in Congress because 
it runs the risk of returning the Khmer Rouge to at least partial power.

JACKIE MASON LINKS VOTES FOR BLACKS TO GUILT 
</P>

Comedian Jackie Mason was dropped Wednesday as a high-profile advocate for 
Republican mayoral nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani after telling the Village Voice 
that Jews are voting for Democrat David N. Dinkins out of guilt and that 
Dinkins "looks like a black model without a job." 
</P>
<P>
The comments in an interview published Wednesday caused an immediate uproar by 
directly raising the issue of Dinkins' race in a way that Giuliani has avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, a former rabbi who performs stand-up routines with a Yiddish accent and 
stars in the new ABC-TV comedy "Chicken Soup," was denounced by the American 
Jewish Committee and other Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
Mason's presence in the campaign was meant to humanize the generally dour 
Giuliani. The 57-year-old comedian told reporters Wednesday that his comments 
had been taken out of context and in some cases misquoted and that he meant 
them to be off the record. But he repeated some of the remarks during a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sick Jewish problem of voting for a black man no matter how unfit 
he is for the job," Mason told the Village Voice. "All you have to do is be 
black and don't curse the Jews directly, and the Jew will vote for a black in a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"Jews are sick with complexes. They feel guilty for the black predicament as if 
the Jews caused it. . . . The Jews are constantly giving millions of dollars to 
the black people. Have you ever heard of a black person giving a quarter to a 
Jew?" 
</P>
<P>
At another point, he said: "You don't need a guy like Dinkins, who spends his 
whole life putting on shirts and jackets and parting his hair. Dinkins looks 
like a black model without a job. The man has accomplished absolutely nothing 
in his life. . . . If Dinkins was white and you put his track record against 
Giuliani's track record, he wouldn't get a single Jewish vote." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani, whose campaign recently aired a television ad featuring Mason, said 
he found the remarks as published "offensive." Dinkins, the Manhattan borough 
president, called Mason's comments "nonsense."

FORMER HUD AIDE REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

A former aide to ex-Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. followed Pierce's 
example Wednesday and refused to answer House investigators' questions, 
invoking the Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Wilson, who is accused of profiting handsomely from his government 
service, appeared under subpoena a day after Pierce had exercised his 
constitutional right to remain silent about his eight-year tenure at the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Like his old boss, Wilson accused the House Government Operations subcommittee 
that is investigating political favoritism and influence peddling at the 
department of prejudging him. But members of the panel dismissed his claims as 
self-serving and irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), the subcommittee chairman, said that Wilson has 
made millions of dollars from HUD-related projects since he left the agency and 
has received consulting fees to use his influence with HUD officials, whom he 
entertained lavishly on his expense account. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, now a $325,000-a-year executive with a Wall Street investment firm, 
refused to explain what he did to earn a $10,000 check that he received from 
retired HUD official Alexander Naclario in May, 1988, when he apparently was 
moonlighting from his full-time job with PaineWebber Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Naclario, taking the stand after Wilson was excused, said that he paid Wilson 
the money to end the opposition of Hunter Cushing, former deputy assistant 
secretary of housing, to an application for FHA mortgage insurance on a big New 
York City apartment project. 
</P>
<P>
Another HUD official, Naclario testified, told him that Cushing had asked why 
he should help Naclario. 
</P>
<P>
Naclario said that he then called Wilson and offered him $10,000 to persuade 
Cushing to drop his opposition. Wilson reported shortly afterward that Cushing 
had denied making any such remark and would not oppose the application if the 
HUD technical staff approved it, Naclario said. 
</P>
<P>
Cushing, now an official with the Commerce Department, previously invoked the 
Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination when he was called to testify 
before the congressional panel. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Naclario said, he was summoned to Washington in 1982 by Wilson to help 
get HUD approval for a project in Puerto Rico that was backed by a major 
political contributor to George Bush, then vice president. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled to the island and met the contributor, Delio Rojo, Naclario said, 
and found that the proposed housing project for the elderly was to be located 
in a building that included a gambling casino, restaurants and swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
To meet HUD requirements for subsidized housing, he said, he recommended that 
the casino, pools and restaurants be regarded as "off-site" properties that 
would pay rent to the project to reduce the amount of rents paid by low-income 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, he said, he paid Wilson $5,000 for helping another 
unidentified Puerto Rican developer with a HUD grant application. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Lantos said that Wilson played a key role in pushing an 
application by Leonard Briscoe, a Ft. Worth, Tex., developer, for a $7-million 
HUD urban development grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The . . . project was awarded funds over the strong objection of the HUD 
regional office career staff, who viewed the project as ill-conceived, 
ill-designed and undercapitalized," Lantos said. Wilson refused to answer a 
question about the Briscoe grant. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving HUD, Lantos said, Wilson received a 15% interest from Briscoe in 
another development in Florida worth about $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since he began work at PaineWebber in 1986, the subcommittee chairman said, 
Wilson has spent more than $10,000 on lunches, dinners and receptions for HUD 
employees, including a $1,000 dinner for his hand-picked successor at HUD, 
Deborah Gore Dean. Earlier, Dean also invoked the Fifth Amendment.

RIVAL TAX PLAN BACKERS BRACE FOR POLITICAL TEST; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE DEMOCRATS WAGE UPHILL FIGHT AS BUSH ADVANCES CAPITAL GAINS RATE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a high-stakes game of political hardball over taxes, Democrats and 
Republicans in the House braced for an expected showdown vote today on the most 
bitterly partisan legislative issue in Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leaders, acknowledging that they still face an uphill fight, 
struggled to round up votes to defeat a White House-supported proposal to cut 
the maximum capital gains tax rate to 19.6% from the current 33% maximum. They 
were pressing their own alternative that promises to raise tax rates on the 
wealthy and restore incentives for individual retirement accounts that were 
taken away from millions of taxpayers in the 1986 tax revision law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test of Bush 
</P>
<P>
The vote has emerged as a critical test of President Bush's political strength 
and a challenge to new congressional Democratic leaders who generally had 
sought until recently to compromise with the White House rather than confront 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a defining issue for the President," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento). "If he wins this one, the wimp image is gone for good. It 
establishes a certain level of political power." 
</P>
<P>
The maneuvering in advance of the vote is reminiscent of the summer and fall of 
1981, when former President Ronald Reagan enlisted support from conservative 
Democrats to win approval of his sweeping economic program of tax and budget 
cuts. As Reagan did in 1981, Bush appears to enjoy a slim margin for his 
capital gains tax cut. But the contest is close and apparently still hinges on 
about 30 undecided House members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats Rally 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders, who hold a 257-176 vote advantage in the House, convened a 
closed caucus to rally support against the capital gains tax cut, which they 
consider an unnecessary giveaway to the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of Southern conservatives, who long have supported lower capital 
gains taxes, are supporting the Bush plan. They are joined by several other 
lawmakers representing farming and timber districts where many of their 
constituents would gain directly from provisions of the tax bill approved by 
the House Ways and Means Committee two weeks ago on a 19-17 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), who is opposed to the capital gains plan, told 
reporters that he still does not see enough votes to block the cut. "I think we 
can catch up," he added, however. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans met with Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, in their own strategy session. They attacked the 
Democratic plan, which would substitute more liberal IRAs for the lower 
capital-gains tax, as a ploy to raise taxes. The expanded IRAs -- which would 
allow all taxpayers to receive at least a 50% deduction on contributions up to 
$2,000 and would permit penalty-free early withdrawals to pay for a first home 
or college education expenses -- would be financed by a tax hike on families 
earning more than $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, families with taxable incomes from $75,000 to roughly $200,000 are 
subject to a marginal tax rate of 33%. But each dollar over the ceiling of 
about $200,000 is taxed at 28%. The Democratic alternative would tax earnings 
above the ceiling at the 33% rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exactly the kind of tax increase . . . (Democrats) proposed in 1984," 
said Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the assistant Republican leader. "I think 
we'll find the extra five or six votes necessary to win." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans contend that the tax cut on profits from investments in stocks, 
real estate and most other assets would stimulate the economy, encourage new 
businesses and end up boosting government revenues over the long run. Democrats 
dispute those claims. 
</P>
<P>
The capital-gains cut is one of several divisive issues attached to the 
$16.6-billion deficit-reduction bill that the House is scheduled to debate this 
week and next. The bill also includes provisions to scale back the 
controversial catastrophic health care program for the elderly and to help poor 
families struggling to meet child care expenses. It is designed to meet the 
requirements of the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law for the fiscal year that 
begins on Oct. 1 and avoid automatic spending cuts in most federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rule Wiped Out 
</P>
<P>
In action Wednesday, the House overwhelmingly approved an amendment offered by 
Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) to wipe out the controversial Section 89 rules 
that had been designed to prevent companies from providing fringe benefits for 
their top executives on a more favorable basis than for ordinary employees. 
Complaining that the rules are an unnecessary burden on business, lawmakers 
rejected a provision aimed at preserving at least a vestige of the 
anti-discrimation rules. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to put pressure against the Democratic tax plan, Bush has vowed to 
veto any tax hike that emerges from Congress even if it delays approval of the 
deficit-reduction bill well past the Oct. 15 deadline at which the widespread 
spending cuts would go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"A President has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish the ends for 
which he was elected," Bush said Tuesday. "And I plan to do exactly that."

DINGELL SEEKS GENERIC EPILEPSY DRUG TESTS 
</P>

<P>
The congressman who is heading a far-reaching investigation of the Food and 
Drug Administration said Wednesday that he has "no confidence" the agency can 
ensure the safety of generic drugs used to treat epilepsy and other conditions 
requiring precise dosages. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee as well as its oversight and investigations subcommittee, asked the 
FDA to increase its scrutiny of the nation's leading generic drugs to include 
all epilepsy products and other narrow therapeutic range medications. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee investigators said that Dingell's comments signify a major "break 
of faith" with the FDA, which has been cooperating with a federal inquiry into 
bribery and fraud in the generics industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The compliance people -- the people doing the work in the field -- are fine," 
one subcommittee investigator said. "The real problems," he added, involve the 
FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which handles approval and 
regulation of brand-name and generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials refused to comment on Dingell's charges. 
</P>
<P>
But subcommittee investigators, after meeting Wednesday afternoon with FDA 
Commissioner Frank E. Young, said that Young "had indicated a favorable 
response" to Dingell's request to include the additional generic products among 
the drugs it is testing. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that Young has been concerned about these epilepsy drugs for a long 
time," the subcommittee staff member said. "He's given many speeches and said 
publicly many times that he was concerned about them." 
</P>
<P>
The federal inquiry, which also involves the U.S. attorney in Baltimore, began 
with disclosures that chemists in the FDA's generics division had accepted 
bribes from industry executives in return for speeding the approval of certain 
generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
So far, federal officials have found no evidence that the generics scandal has 
resulted in unsafe products reaching consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But Dingell said that he is especially worried about reports that a generic 
company -- Pharmaceutical Basics Inc., of Chicago -- substituted a cheaper raw 
material for a more expensive one in carbamazepine, an epilepsy drug. 
</P>
<P>
After the substitution, "breakthrough" seizures were reported by a number of 
patients who may not have absorbed enough of the medication. Breakthrough 
seizures occur when a patient is on medication designed to prevent them. 
</P>
<P>
At least two patients taking the firm's carbamazepine product died, although no 
direct evidence links their deaths to the drug. But a report written by the 
FDA's Denver district office and released by the subcommittee said that a 
toxicology test of one of the patients showed the level of the drug to be 
"subtherapeutic." The drug has since been recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret the additional resource drain this imposes on FDA laboratory 
facilities," Dingell wrote in a letter to Young. "However, the demonstrated 
failures in the generic drug approval process make essential a review of the 
dissolution and potency of sensitive generic drugs currently being marketed." 
</P>
<P>
For most conditions, exact dosages of drugs are not usually necessary. But some 
afflictions -- epilepsy, asthma and certain cardiac conditions, for example -- 
require a precise amount of medication to ensure therapeutic effectiveness.

BILL REGULATING JAILHOUSE SNITCHES SIGNED INTO LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Legal Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian signed into a law Wednesday a bill regulating the use of 
jailhouse informants. 
</P>
<P>
Key features of the bill include a requirement that judges routinely instruct 
jurors to view jailhouse informants' testimony with caution, and a requirement 
that prosecutors tell an informant's crime victim that he is being given 
leniency in return for his testimony against another criminal defendant. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which was drafted by defense lawyer groups and sponsored by 
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), also bars law enforcement from paying 
an informant more than $50 "in return for an in-custody informant's testimony." 
</P>
<P>
It also requires prosecutors who rely on the testimony of an informant to 
disclose to the court any favors he has received. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will change the way prosecutors treat informants, (the way) juries 
treat informants, and I think people will stop and think now before they use 
these informants," said Los Angeles defense lawyer Gigi Gordon, who lobbied for 
the measure on behalf of the Criminal Courts Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was an outgrowth of a demonstration last year by veteran 
jailhouse informant Leslie Vernon White of how dangerous informant testimony 
could be. 
</P>
<P>
White showed Los Angeles County sheriff's officials that he could convincingly 
fake the confession of a murder suspect he had never met. A glib robber and 
kidnaper, White gathered inside information on the case by using a jail 
telephone and posing as a law enforcement officer. Then he showed officials 
that he could create a phony record that he shared a cell with a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Standards 
</P>
<P>
White's demonstration prompted Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner to issue 
tough new corroboration standards for use of informants and spawned an ongoing 
grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Similar corroboration standards were written into early drafts of the 
legislation, but defense Bar lobbyists agreed to delete them in exchange for 
support of the California District Attorneys Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association contends that tougher statutory standards are unnecessary 
because the problem of jailhouse informants fabricating confessions is confined 
to Los Angeles.

SUIT ALLEGING PLUTONIUM DANGER WILL SEEK TO BLOCK SHUTTLE LAUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NASA's long-delayed shuttle launch of the Galileo mission to Jupiter, already 
several years behind schedule because of the Challenger disaster, now faces a 
legal battle that could jeopardize next month's scheduled launch. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington-based public interest law firm, the Christic Institute, and 
several other organizations plan to file suit today in Washington in an effort 
to block the launch. The suit -- which climaxes several months of growing 
concern over the safety of the launch -- will argue that the launch will 
endanger the public because an accident could release 48 pounds of highly 
radioactive plutonium 238 carried aboard Galileo. 
</P>
<P>
The plutonium is used to generate electric power to run Galileo's many 
components. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was a terrible idea" to launch the shuttle Atlantis with Galileo 
and its radioactive generators in its cargo bay, said Lanny Sinkin, an attorney 
with the institute. National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials 
have said the plutonium is packaged in such a way that even an explosion like 
the one that destroyed Challenger would not likely release significant amounts 
of the deadly substance, but Sinkin believes the risk is just too great. 
</P>
<P>
The battle promises to be a bitter one, and it has even divided the community 
that would normally be expected to stand united against a launch carrying 
radioactive materials. 
</P>
<P>
"After going through mountains of material and soul-searching, I am comfortable 
with the launch," said Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst with the 
Federation of American Scientists. Aftergood, who has led the fight to block 
the use of orbiting nuclear reactors, has personally watched some of the many 
tests that NASA has used to evaluate the safety of the generators. He said he 
is "persuaded that the safety risks are small and the scientific payoffs are 
large." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to see it go forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is safe or we wouldn't propose to launch," said John Casani, 
longtime manager of the Galileo program and now a top executive with NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Williams, who will command the Atlantis, said he isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have looked at this quite a lot, and I'm convinced in my own mind 
that it's absolutely safe to fly," Williams said at a recent Florida press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Challenger explosion, Chernobyl and the Valdez accident, we have 
learned that technology can go terribly wrong," Bruce Gagnon of the Florida 
Coalition for Peace and Justice said. The coalition is expected to be a party 
to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will challenge the adequacy of NASA's environmental impact report, 
which declares the risk minimal. A federal interagency panel, however, does not 
rule out the possibility that some cancer deaths could occur if the plutonium 
is somehow pulverized and released into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis is scheduled for launch Oct. 12. If the suit delays the launch 
past Nov. 24, the mission will have to be postponed for 18 months because it 
will be that long before the planets are aligned in a way that would make the 
encounter possible. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the White House Office of Science and Technology formally 
approved the launch, setting the stage for the coming legal skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's opposition has been motivated partly by the space agency's lack of 
credibility in the field of risk-benefit analysis, as demonstrated by the 
Challenger disaster, and partly by defection by some respected members of the 
space community. Richard Cuddihy, a radiation expert and a member of the panel 
that recommended that the White House give its required approval for the 
launch, has filed a minority report claiming that the launch "puts a large 
number of people at risk." 
</P>
<P>
"Our real bottom line is, go find an alternative to the plutonium," Sinkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But NASA and independent experts contend that there is no alternative. Galileo, 
like 22 other space probes launched with radioactive generators, will operate 
in areas so far from the sun that solar energy is not practicable. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo will have two "radioisotope thermoelectric generators," each powered by 
24 pounds of plutonium 238. As it decays, the plutonium gives off heat that is 
converted directly to electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The same type of power plant was used aboard the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which 
recently capped a 12-year tour of four outer planets last month when it zipped 
past Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike all the other space probes with nuclear generators, Galileo is to be 
the first launched by the shuttle. The fight to block the launch is fueled 
largely by memories of the Challenger fireball over the Florida coast four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although 22 spacecraft using a total of 38 radioisotope generators have been 
launched, the record is not without its blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. navigational satellite failed to reach orbit April 21, 1964, and its 
power supply disintegrated in the atmosphere "as it was designed to do in case 
of re-entry," Aftergood noted in a position paper on Galileo. The accident 
"tripled the worldwide inventory" of plutonium 238 and "increased the total 
world environmental burden from all plutonium isotopes by about 4%." A federal 
report predicted that six fatal cancers would develop as a result of that 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
NASA maintains, however, that it has taken great precautions with the Galileo 
probe, significantly reducing any risk to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Plutonium is most dangerous when it is in the form of a fine powder because it 
is most harmful when it is inhaled. Once inhaled, a single particle can produce 
fatal cancer by irradiating nearby cells. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce that danger, the plutonium carried aboard Galileo is in 72 solid fuel 
pellets encased in metal. The fuel itself is in a ceramic form, so even if the 
generator is destroyed the debris should consist mainly of larger particles 
that if ingested by humans will tend to be excreted, safety officials maintain. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the space agency, the federal Department of Energy has subjected 
generators to pressures up to 2,200 pounds per square inch, although the 
maximum explosion in the Challenger has been estimated at 400 pounds per square 
inch, and the coating that surrounds the pellets remained intact, according to 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The generators have been shot with bullets made of material that would simulate 
fragments from various shuttle components. They have been exposed to intense 
fire for up to 10 minutes and slammed into steel and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The tests show that under some circumstances, some fuel would be released, so 
the space agency's own findings do not rule out the possibility of some hazard 
in the event of a major accident. NASA has maintained that the risk is 
extremely low, and even an explosion on the launch pad would release only 
enough radiation to cause "0.7 fatalities." 
</P>
<P>
However, a federal Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Panel found NASA's 
estimates too low and concluded that a launch accident could result in 80 fatal 
cancers. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest risk could come months after a successful launch. 
</P>
<P>
The space probe's solid-fuel rocket propulsion system is not powerful enough 
for Galileo to fly directly to Jupiter, so the spacecraft will fly first to 
Venus and then pass by the Earth twice, using the two planets' gravitational 
fields to boost its speed so that it can venture far out into the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
The second near-Earth encounter will bring the probe within 200 miles of the 
surface, and if the craft should somehow re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and 
break up in a fireball, more plutonium could be released in a more hazardous 
powdery form than even a massive explosion on the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
The interagency panel estimated that an accidental re-entry into the Earth's 
atmosphere could produce from zero to 2,000 cancer fatalities.

DEVELOPER OF DISPUTED ABORTION PILL RECEIVES PRESTIGIOUS AWARD 
</P>

<P>
America's most prestigious medical award was given Wednesday to the developer 
of the controversial French abortion pill, a decision criticized by 
anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners of Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards were Lewis Thomas, the 
writer and doctor, and four scientists who study how cells receive chemical and 
physical messages. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu studied the workings of hormones for nearly 30 years 
before provoking an international ethical debate with his discovery of the drug 
RU 486, which prevents a fertilized egg from developing into a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Approved in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, reportedly being used for about 15% of elective abortions in France, 
has not been approved in the United States, but it has provoked a storm of 
controversy here nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have threatened boycotts of any company that should choose to sell it 
in the United States, and abortion-rights advocates have promised to lobby for 
the pill's sale in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Willke, president of the National Right To Life Committee in 
Washington, was sharply critical of the Lasker jury's recognition of Baulieu. 
</P>
<P>
"His achievement is to kill people," said Willke, who learned of the award 
before it was announced. "It's outrageous that they would give this to a man 
whose achievement is to develop chemical warfare against the unborn." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for 
Women, applauded the award, saying, "It's an encouraging sign that the 
know-nothings are not going to stop the medical research community from 
honoring Baulieu's contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chairman of the Lasker awards jury, said the 
controversy surrounding RU 486 did not influence the jury's selection of 
Baulieu. 
</P>
<P>
Baulieu's award was for clinical, or applied, research. The award for basic 
research recognized four researchers who study the substances in cells that 
allow cells to respond to hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters, the 
awards jury said. 
</P>
<P>
The four are: Michael J. Berridge of the University of Cambridge, England; 
Alfred G. Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in 
Dallas; Edwin G. Krebs of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the 
University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, and Yasutomi Nishizuka 
of the Kobe University School of Medicine in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Thomas, scholar-in-residence at Cornell University Medical College in New 
York and president emeritus of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York, received the Albert Lasker Public Service Award for his writings on 
medicine that, the committee said, "have heightened and transformed the 
public's perception of biomedical science." 
</P>
<P>
The Lasker awards are a kind of American Nobel Prize for medical research and 
often foreshadow the choices of the Nobel judges. Forty-six Lasker Award 
winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, often within a few years of 
receiving a Lasker Award.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERMAN URGES IRS TO START TAXING ELKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the public should not be compelled to subsidize racial discrimination, 
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has called on the Internal Revenue 
Service to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Van Nuys Elks Lodge, which 
rejected two black men for membership twice this month. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the IRS this week, Berman said the Van Nuys lodge has "forfeited 
the right to a tax exemption." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the lodge rejected Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. 
Montgomery on the same night two other black men were finally admitted to the 
Lompoc lodge after months of controversy. Bagneris and Montgomery reapplied and 
last week were rejected for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Elks officials have repeatedly denied charges of racism. "The men have a right 
to vote the way they feel," said Robert Verte, secretary to the national 
organization's grand exalted ruler. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Vasquez, a Los Angeles-based IRS agent specializing in tax-exempt 
organizations, said the IRS has investigated other fraternal organizations for 
alleged civil rights violations in the past, but has never revoked any such 
organization's tax-exempt status.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 10 STUDENTS INJURED IN SCHOOL BUS CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car struck the back of a school bus in Santa Clarita on Wednesday, causing 
minor injuries to 10 junior high school students, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths complained of minor head and neck pain, officers said. Seven were 
treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia and three were 
taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
They were among about 90 students on their way home from Arroyo Seco Junior 
High School in Valencia when the accident occurred at 2:45 p.m. at Bouquet 
Canyon Road and Camargo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Bus driver Rene Altamirano, 27, of Canyon Country, was not injured, nor was the 
car's driver, Evelyn Maxine Robinson, 52, of Saugus, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson turned left onto Bouquet Canyon and apparently failed to see the bus, 
which was moving north on the same road, investigators said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER SENTENCED FOR ROLE AT CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer on disability leave has been sentenced to three 
years' probation, fined $1,000 and ordered to do 600 hours of community service 
work for his role in the operation of unlicensed medical clinics, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Veronica Simmons McBeth sentenced Kelly Klatt, 37, 
who was convicted Monday of paying employees below minimum wage, failing to 
withhold state and federal taxes and failing to pay employees for overtime 
work. 
</P>
<P>
He also was found guilty of knowingly working for clinics that were staffed by 
unlicensed medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Unlicensed staffers at the clinics -- two in Los Angeles' Westlake District and 
one each in Boyle Heights and Wilmington -- routinely conducted blood and 
pregnancy tests, prescribed and dispensed drugs, set broken bones, took X-rays 
and supervised physical therapy for accident victims, said Deputy City Atty. 
Ellen Pais, who prosecuted Klatt. 
</P>
<P>
The State Board of Medical Quality Assurance began investigating the case in 
May, 1988, after receiving an anonymous tip. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a difficult case to prove," said Pais. "Individuals who worked at the 
clinics had no employment records. Often, they signed checks at the clinic and 
were then given cash."

JUDGE RESCINDS FRAUD RULING AGAINST SHIPYARD ON NAVY CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has withdrawn a judgment in which he ruled that one of the 
largest shipyard companies on the West Coast committed mail fraud and acted 
with fraudulent intent against the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In settling a lawsuit between competing shipyards, U.S. District Judge Stanley 
A. Weigel on Tuesday withdrew an earlier summary judgment against Southwest 
Marine Inc., according to a court clerk and shipyard attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 8 judgment found that the company acted "with intent to deceive, 
manipulate and defraud" the Small Business Administration and the Navy in the 
fall of 1983 to win a contract worth up to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment was a precursor to a trial to decide a lawsuit brought by three 
competing shipyards against Southwest Marine. The lawsuit alleged that 
Southwest Marine used unfair means to win a contract to fix four Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Finding 
</P>
<P>
Despite Weigel's latest action, a spokeswoman for the Navy's Sea Systems 
Command, which oversees the repair of naval vessels, said Wednesday that Navy 
officials were still considering sanctions against Southwest Marine in light of 
the judge's earlier finding. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine maintained in a statement, however, that the rescinding of the 
judge's order eliminates the possibility that the company would be barred from 
bidding on future government jobs. Repairs on Navy ships provide about 80% of 
the workload for Southwest Marine's 2,500 employees, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Southwest Marine said the judge's latest decision gives the 
company a "clean bill of health" in its dealings with the government. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, it's (back to) business as usual," said Lloyd 
Schwartz, vice president and legal counsel for the San Diego-based ship 
repairer. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Marine is one of the largest remaining ship repair businesses 
remaining in the West, with facilities in San Pedro, San Diego, San Francisco, 
Portland and American Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Weigel, through his clerk, declined to comment on the decision to rescind his 
earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The judge issued the first ruling in August in reaction to a finding that the 
company fired more than 500 employees for a single week in late 1982, only to 
hire them back a week later. The practice allegedly was a thinly veiled attempt 
to qualify as a small business under SBA rules. Only businesses with 1,000 
employees or fewer were eligible to bid on the lucrative Navy contract.

ANGRY CROWD DEFENDS KING HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An incensed and animated crowd of more than 100 people gathered at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts on Wednesday to protest the 
removal of the hospital's long-time administrator, William Delgardo, and demand 
the ouster of the county's health services chief, Robert Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Gates successfully urged the county supervisors on Tuesday to transfer Delgardo 
out of King. He acted after federal officials threatened Monday to cut off $60 
million in public health care dollars to the hospital unless massive, 
system-wide patient care deficiencies are corrected by Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the supervisors ordered the county Department of Health 
Services to investigate the hospital following articles in The Times which, the 
supervisors said, pointed out "poor administration, a lack of highly skilled 
medical staff, and a severe shortage of space, staff and funding to adequately 
deal with the . . . increasing load" at King. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital press conference, which attracted numerous medical center 
employees during their lunch hour, speakers charged that Delgardo's transfer 
was a direct result of "irresponsibly written . . . erroneous" articles in The 
Times. They said Delgardo has been made a scapegoat by top county officials, 
including Gates, who have repeatedly refused to give him the budget he needs to 
do his job. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was also attacked for allegedly failing to keep an earlier promise to 
consult with the "black community" before making any changes in leadership at 
the hospital. As speakers called for his resignation, the crowd chanted, "Gates 
must go!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met With Activists 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, has said that he 
attempted several months ago to move Delgardo to another county hospital, but 
shelved the plan after meeting with community activists who are Delgardo's 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Dr. Lewis King, dean of the Charles R. Drew School of 
Medicine and Science, which is affiliated with King, denounced Delgardo's 
transfer and negative publicity about King as a "travesty of justice and 
perpetuation of racism in our society." 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was called by Lillian Mobley, a member of the Los Angeles 
Healthcare Task Force and a member of the community advisory board of the Drew 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Her written statement declared that the medical center has suffered, "not 
because of Delgardo's leadership, but because of the Board of Supervisors' 
unwillingness to allocate appropriate funds and resources." 
</P>
<P>
"The King-Drew Medical Center has been forced to practice military medicine 
under civilian conditions with an inadequate budget." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Mary Henry, also a member of the Drew community advisory board, said, 
"There's no reason under the sun for the county to decide abruptly to change 
the administration of this hospital. I'm not saying the hospital is perfect . . 
. but it's our hospital and we want to make it right." 
</P>
<P>
As for scathing state and federal evaluations of the hospital that were 
released last week, Henry called them unfair. "The fact that we have 'Martin 
Luther King' in the name of our hospital means that we don't get a fair 
evaluation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vannoy Thompson, a private builder who served in 1972 on the Southeast General 
Hospital Authority that helped build King, asserted that the medical center has 
been "evaluated differently than the other hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
State health inspectors released reports last week that faulted the hospital 
for major breakdowns in six fundamental areas of patient care: nursing, dietary 
services, infection control, quality assurance, administration and physical 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection reports were prompted by a national study released in January 
that analyzed death rates of elderly Medicare patients nationwide and ranked 
King among the bottom 50 of 5,577 hospitals surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson denounced the inspection reports of King as biased and lambasted 
The Times for putting black leaders in headlines only when they are accused of 
making mistakes. In Delgardo's case, Thompson said, he's "been doing a good job 
for 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson did distribute a 14-page report that dealt with stories published 
in The Times Sept. 3 through Sept. 5. King's medical director, Dr. James 
Haughton III, and the chiefs of three medical departments were listed as having 
helped in the preparation of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the report addressed individual cases of patient care that 
medical experts had reviewed for The Times and which they said raised serious 
questions about the quality of care provided. The report took issue with the 
following cases detailed by The Times: 
</P>
<P>
* The case of an 18-year-old girl whose throat was cut during what experts said 
was a "botched" attempt to open a small airway so that she could breathe. Both 
jugular veins were cut during surgery, triggering a "massive hemorrhage," 
according to a General Surgery and Emergency Medicine Joint Conference report 
of Dec. 9, 1988. In their response, King officials acknowledged that the 
jugular veins were severed, but said the bleeding was not substantial and 
"could be controlled by simply applying finger pressure." 
</P>
<P>
* The case of a 27-year-old woman with meningitis who needed an immediate 
operation to relieve swelling of the brain, but who died after lingering for at 
least five hours without evaluation by a neurosurgeon. Medical experts who 
reviewed the case for The Times said the patient did not receive timely care. 
But in their response, King doctors said that waiting to operate was a 
"reasonable medical judgment" and that her brain death was precipitous and 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
The report also defended King physicians who are engaged in private practice 
outside the hospital. The Times documented cases in which physicians had failed 
to properly disclose their outside practices or misrepresented the hours they 
worked. But the King response stated that doctors with outside practices had 
disclosed them as directed by county ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report defended several senior emergency department physicians 
who, The Times documented, were not present in the emergency room when they 
were supposed be. For example, a doctor who signed a time card claiming to have 
worked a full day at the hospital on Nov. 18, 1988, was actually present for 
less than four hours, The Times discovered by observing him that day. The King 
response, however, stated that he and other doctors cited by The Times were 
given "the liberty" of working off the premises, being called in only for 
"extreme emergencies and internal disasters."

3 CHARGED IN KIDNAPING OF 2 WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
COULD FACE LIFE TERMS ON COUNTS OF SLAVERY, RAPE, OTHER FELONIES 
</P>

<P>
A man and two women accused of raping and torturing two Central American 
refugees during months of captivity inside a beat-up camper were charged 
Wednesday with kidnaping, slavery, rape and a host of other felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all charges, they each face two consecutive life terms plus 400 
years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew J. McMullen, who filed the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything quite like this," McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Guilty Pleas 
</P>
<P>
The three, who were arrested Monday night, entered not guilty pleas at 
arraignment in Los Angeles Municipal Court Wednesday afternoon. Each is being 
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing for the three has been set for Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the male defendant had identified himself to police as Robert A. 
Gonzalez, 38. But when Judge Glennette Blackwell asked him if that was his real 
name, he shook his head "no" and gave his name as Paul Garcia, one of several 
aliases the victims had said he used. He told the judge he was born in Mexico 
but had no birth or baptismal certificates to prove his identity. 
</P>
<P>
The women arrested with him were identified as Yolanda Garcia, 28, and 
Margarita Ruvalcaba, 30. Ruvalcaba is pregnant. It was not known if Yolanda and 
Paul Garcia are married or related. 
</P>
<P>
Six children who also lived inside the camper remained in protective custody 
Wednesday. McMullen said the children, who ranged in age from infancy to 9 
years, witnessed the beatings. The children apparently were fathered by Garcia, 
but it is not clear who their mothers are. 
</P>
<P>
All three defendants were charged with 10 criminal counts including kidnaping, 
robbery, false imprisonment, slavery, assault with a deadly weapon and 43 
counts of forcible rape in concert. McMullen said he planned to file additional 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charge Called Unusual 
</P>
<P>
He said the slavery charge is highly unusual but was pressed because the women 
were forced to work against their will. 
</P>
<P>
The three are accused of kidnaping a 27-year-old immigrant from Guatemala City, 
Guatemala, on July 12 of last year and holding her prisoner inside their camper 
for 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
She has told police she was repeatedly raped, beaten, shocked with electrical 
wires and forced to cook and clean. She escaped Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Garcias and Ruvalcaba are also accused of kidnaping a 24-year-old woman 
from San Salvador, El Salvador, on June 5 of last year. She has said she 
escaped about three months later after enduring an ordeal similar to the 
Guatemalan woman's. For about two months, both victims were in the camper 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Both women were lured to the camper with promises of work and were threatened 
with death if they tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran woman told police she did not step forward earlier because she 
feared no one would believe her. Only when composite sketches of Garcia were 
circulated after the Guatemalan woman's escape did she feel emboldened to 
contact authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Defenders Named 
</P>
<P>
Public defenders were appointed for the three accused, who sat silent and 
expressionless during their arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lindner, the attorney appointed to represent Yolanda Garcia, complained 
that scant evidence was submitted with the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not enough information here for anyone to know what was going on," he 
said. "Some woman gave an oral report to police, and then they filed charges." 
</P>
<P>

BIGGEST FAILURE PUSHED SONY TO LATEST SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sony Corp., the company that came so triumphantly to Hollywood on Wednesday, 
shelling out $3.4 billion to buy Columbia Pictures, is now a $16-billion 
(sales) giant in two industries, entertainment and electronics. It's both the 
world's largest record producer and the world's leading manufacturer of compact 
disc players; it's a leading maker of television sets and now the owner of a 
movie studio and film library. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, scarcely six years ago, Sony was troubled. Its sales, then less than 
$5 billion, had been stagnant for years and its profits were declining. Worst 
of all, the Betamax videocassette recorder, a product into which it had poured 
20 years of effort and research, was on the verge of commercial failure. 
</P>
<P>
So how did the company go from trouble to triumph in six years? 
</P>
<P>
The immediate reason for the Betamax failure was competition. Sony's rival 
Matsushita had developed the VHS system and licensed it to any manufacturer or 
retailer who wished to slap a brand name on it -- from Sears to General 
Electric. The result: More VHS sets sold, which led to more films being 
available on VHS, which led to more VHS sets selling -- and to Sony recognizing 
Betamax's ultimate failure (the company discontinued the product in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Were Subtle 
</P>
<P>
However, Sony's real problem was not competition but overweening pride. Sony's 
renowned chairman and founder, Akio Morita, had decreed that Betamax could only 
sell under the Sony brand name and at a higher price than VHS -- because it was 
higher quality. It may have been, but the public didn't care and didn't buy. 
</P>
<P>
The Betamax debacle caused Sony to take a long look at its business and to make 
some changes. To be sure, Sony didn't go through a restructuring, as American 
corporations do; there was no manic selling of divisions at the company's 
Spartan headquarters in Tokyo, where all employees, including top executives, 
still wear uniform jackets -- a reminder of the firm's beginnings after World 
War II, when Japan was devastated and poor. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were subtle. Morita in 1984 began to step back from day-to-day 
management, and Sony President Norio Ohga emerged. Ohga, who is chairman today, 
is an opera singer by training who caught Sony's attention by prodding it to 
make a better tape recorder. He is a self-taught engineer, according to one 
Sony veteran, who understood that the firm had to shift direction. 
</P>
<P>
Sony began to seek industrial customers to lessen its dependence on consumer 
markets, which were becoming fickle as more and more companies, Korean as well 
as Japanese, flooded stores with electronic gadgetry. In such a market, Sony 
was unable to charge higher prices for its higher quality. 
</P>
<P>
But quality still counted with industrial customers. So Ohga departed from 
tradition and began to sell Sony technologies to other companies. The company's 
Trinitron TV screens now grace Apple Macintosh and some IBM computers. Sony, 
the first Japanese company to license Bell Labs' transistor in the 1950s, now 
sells $2 billion worth of its semiconductors to other manufacturers. Result: 
Non-consumer business now accounts for more than 25% of Sony's sales -- and the 
company aims to make it 50%. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, the Betamax episode led Sony to think seriously about 
software, about making and selling not only the electronic gadgets but the 
songs and programs that play on them. Ohga and Morita and others at the firm 
asked themselves if Betamax might have done better if Sony had its own films to 
put on cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
The model for much of its thinking was N. V. Philips, the giant Dutch 
electronics firm. "Philips is our greatest competitor," Morita said in an 
interview last year. "And Philips benefited from software -- it owned Polygram 
Records, and that helped its compact discs." 
</P>
<P>
And so Sony moved into musical software in 1987 when it agreed to buy CBS 
Records for $2 billion. "Having software is important," said Michael Schulhof, 
who helped negotiate the CBS purchase. Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of 
America, was one of the key men involved in Sony's negotiations with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly software pays off. CBS Records now gives Sony 15% of its sales and 
double the operating profit of its traditional hardware business, according to 
analyst Thomas Chesser of the Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. brokerage 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glowing Signpost 
</P>
<P>
But quick profit is not the vision that moved Sony into records or into movies. 
That vision was what the software could do in combination with the hardware, 
especially new, advanced hardware like Sony's digital audiotape and 
high-definition television, or HDTV. "Software is important because it helps 
boost your technology," explains William Connolly, president of Sony Advanced 
Systems, a New Jersey outpost of the global firm (Sony is the most 
international of Japanese companies, with 20% of its production outside Japan). 
"If you can get the technology going, program makers are going to produce for 
the most advanced mode. They'll begin shooting HDTV because they think of the 
rerun market, of the future value of their product." 
</P>
<P>
That's a glowing signpost to where Sony is headed. (Connolly headed advanced 
technology for CBS Television before that company stopped pursuing advances in 
TV equipment.) Sony intends to broaden acceptance for digital audiotape -- a 
recording product so pure that near-perfect copies are possible -- by using its 
own CBS music. Sony, which spends $1.3 billion a year on research and 
development, intends to broaden acceptance of HDTV by using the 2,700 films and 
23,000 episodes of television programing in the Columbia library -- either 
directly on HDTV broadcasting or in videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Sony marches into the era of global entertainment and information 
industries as a potent giant, capable of pushing the envelope in both hardware 
and software. The only truly comparable American firm was Radio Corp. of 
America, RCA, the pioneer of radio and television technology as well as the 
developer of network radio and TV with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But RCA no longer really exists. It has been sold and resold, and its brilliant 
technical people have been scattered. Happily, though, they are not unemployed 
-- many of the best of them now work for Sony.

U.S. Plans No Action in Eastern Strike: The Bush Administration does not plan 
to intervene in the Eastern Airlines strike, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. 
Skinner said. Skinner said he has written to Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and called a proposed congressionally mandated committee on 
the issue "entirely inappropriate." The Senate may consider a version of a 
House bill that would force President Bush to establish a panel to make 
recommendations on the dispute between Eastern and its three major labor 
unions. Skip Copeland, leader of the striking Eastern Airlines pilots, said 
they are "appalled" at Skinner's comments.

An investment group headed by J. Thomas Talbot and Peter V. Ueberroth, the 
former major league baseball commissioner, said Wednesday that it will not buy 
troubled Hawaiian Airlines as planned unless it gets hefty concessions from the 
airline's unions. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ueberroth group 
said it is seeking a three-year wage freeze from the unions and changes in work 
rules that would increase productivity 30%. The Ueberroth group told the SEC 
that it must obtain the concessions, worth an estimated $6 million over three 
to five years, by Oct. 5 to complete the Hawaiian Air transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group last month agreed to pay $22 a share to obtain a majority 
stake in HAL Inc., the airline's parent firm. However, it is not clear whether 
the group will try to acquire the entire company, which is 20% owned by a 
subsidiary of Japan Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Replace Officers 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group also told the SEC that it expects to place "substantial 
additional indebtedness" on Hawaiian Air as a result of the transaction. The 
borrowed money would be used for working capital and equipment, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ueberroth group said it plans to replace the corporate 
officers of HAL Inc. and some of the airline's senior managers. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Talbot refused to discuss negotiations with 
the airline's five labor unions, saying the talks were confidential. Spokesmen 
for the Air Line Pilots Assn. and the Assn. of Flight Attendants, however, said 
talks had been productive and that they were hopeful that an agreement would be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the pilots and the flight attendants, the Ueberroth group is 
negotiating with the International Assn. of Machinists, which represents 
mechanics, and two smaller union groups that represent dispatchers and other 
communications workers. Talbot said about 83% of the airline's 3,000 employees 
are union members. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are unlikely to hold up the Hawaiian Air acquisition, said 
Daniel A. Hersch, aviation industry analyst with the Los Angeles investment 
firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. If the unions do not strike a deal with 
Talbot and Ueberroth, he said, members who work for Hawaiian are likely to be 
looking for new jobs, because the airline's survival hinges on a sale or some 
other deal that will result in a sizable infusion of cash. And any deal will 
depend on union concessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiating Tactic 
</P>
<P>
"At least Talbot and Ueberroth aren't asking for wage cuts, but for a wage 
freeze and changes in work rules to get more work for the same buck," Hersch 
said. "That is a fair request because that company needs to improve its cost 
structure" to stop its losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all they are doing is trying to force labor to come to terms," he 
said. Filing a report of stalemated talks with the SEC, Hersch said, "is just a 
negotiating tactic."

PEOPLE: SEVEN PROMOTED AS PEPSICO REALIGNS FOREIGN OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepsico Inc.'s foreign beverage operations are being reorganized into six new 
units carved out along geographic lines in an attempt to expand Pepsi's 
international soft drink business. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Enrico, president and chief executive of the company's Pepsico Worldwide 
Beverages division, named presidents of each of the six units, which he said 
would be self-sufficient with broad local authority in areas such as marketing, 
sales and technical operations. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher A. Sinclair, a veteran Pepsico executive who most recently headed 
the central division of Pepsi-Cola USA with responsibility for 11 Midwest 
states, was named president of Pepsi-Cola International. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the foreign operations were divided into 15 regions that reported 
to four middle managers based in Somers, N.Y. Under the new foreign alignment, 
the regional presidents report directly to Sinclair in Somers. 
</P>
<P>
The six foreign regions, the presidents and bases of operations are: Western 
Europe, Frederick Meils, London; Latin America, Luis Suarez, Rio de Janeiro; 
Middle East-Africa, David Jones, Nicosia, Cyprus; Asia Pacific, Richard 
Blossom, Singapore; China-India-West Asia-Eastern Europe, Les Ham, Hong Kong, 
and Canada, Wayne Mailloux, Toronto.

DOW ADDS 9.12 DESPITE IBM'S WEAK SHOWING

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices finished mixed Wednesday in a session marked by pressure on some 
technology issues but strength in other blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up about 10 in early trading and down 
about 4 at mid-afternoon, added 9.12 to close at 2,673.06. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 626 up, 826 down and 514 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 158.40 million shares, against 158.35 million Tuesday. 
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
185.41 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The market had to contend with some renewed weakness in the dollar and an 
accompanying rise in credit market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also weighed down by International Business Machines' disclosure 
that it expects its third-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts' 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
IBM shares fell 6 to 111 1/2. Elsewhere in the technology sector, Digital 
Equipment dropped 1 3/8 to 93 5/8, Unisys 3/4 to 18 7/8 and Apple Computer 1/2 
to 44 3/4 in the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers said buyers were encouraged by takeover news and rumors, notably in 
the entertainment industry, that seemed to ease recent fears that Wall Street's 
boom in buyouts and mergers might be near an end. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which agreed to be acquired by Sony Corp. for 
$27 a share, rose 1/4 to 26 1/2 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Communications, another prominent player in entertainment, climbed 1 
1/8 to 57 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 3/8 at 
43; General Electric, up 1/2 at 56; Philip Morris, up 3 7/8 at 160 1/2, and 
Merck, up 2 7/8 at 74. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks retreated for the first time in five trading days. The Nikkei 
225-share index closed down 74.25 to 35,370.57. 
</P>
<P>
Shares closed slightly lower in London on continued nervousness about the 
direction of British interest rates and corporate profitability. The Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down 4.9 at 2,332.0. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
Central banks sold dollars for a third straight day Wednesday, pushing the 
currency lower after an agreement last weekend that it had risen too much in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The losses left the dollar 4% lower against the West German mark and Japanese 
yen than it was late last week, back to its levels of late July and early 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The central banks squashed a rally attempt at mid-morning in New York. Still, 
the slight rebound in the dollar signaled to some traders that the official 
bankers had won the battle against the $300-billion-a-day currency market, but 
not yet the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Do they want it to get off the mat or do they want to kick it while it's down? 
Assuming they're playing a serious game, I think you'd go for the kidneys now 
rather than later," said Charles Taylor, an international economist at 
Prudential-Bache Securities in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A strong dollar tends to swell the U.S. trade deficit by making imports cheap 
and pushing up the price of American goods in foreign markets. At a meeting in 
Washington, finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed 
Saturday that the dollar's rise was "inconsistent with longer-run economic 
fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the frequency of sales rather than their size was pushing down the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar, which 
often moves in tandem with the U.S. dollar, and the British pound, which was 
weighed down by a worse-than-expected trade deficit report. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6155 from $1.6215 late Tuesday. In New 
York, the pound fell to $1.6167 from $1.6190. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.45 Japanese yen to 141.35 yen. Later, in London, it 
dropped to 139.45 yen. It was quoted at 140.32 yen in late New York trading, 
down from 142.35 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold edged higher in active European trading. In London, the metal rose to a 
late bid of $368 an ounce from $367.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, 
Switzerland, gold also rose to a late bid of $368 from $367.75 bid late 
Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at a bid of $369.92. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $367.60 from $368.50. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold 
was bid at $366.20, down from $367.30 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.28 an ounce, down from $5.31 
bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell 
to $5.245 from $5.263 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell slightly in a continued reaction to the dollar's slide. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped about 1/8 point, or $1.25 
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield edged up to 8.24% from 8.23% late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond investors fear that the value of their Treasury bond portfolio will be 
damaged if the dollar continues to lose ground against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues declined 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/8 point to 3/16 
point, and long-term issues lost 1/16 point to 1/8 point, according to Telerate 
Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.08% as the discount jumped 6 
basis points to 7.82%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.26% as the discount 
gained 2 basis points at 7.83%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.36% as 
the discount rose 5 basis points to 7.77%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9%, unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Exports demand pushed down grain futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
Crude oil futures rose amid OPEC-member opposition to an accord increasing the 
cartel's production ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, wheat prices were mixed, corn drifted lower, livestock and 
pork fell, and precious metals declined. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been very strong export demand for wheat," said Jerry Zusel, manager 
of CBOT floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Zusel said Egypt late Tuesday tendered for 500,000 metric tons of wheat and the 
Agriculture Department on Wednesday morning targeted Egypt for 1 million metric 
tons of export bonus wheat. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices were mixed, weakened by a lack of commercial buying while 
supported by strong export demands, traders said. Corn slipped lower from lack 
of any major demand. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of crude oil futures moved higher when news reached the New York 
Mercantile Exchange of OPEC member opposition to an Iranian proposal to 
increase the oil cartel's production ceiling for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil settled 6 to 24 cents higher, with November at $19.59 a barrel; 
heating oil was 0.70 to 0.90 cent higher, with October at 58.46 cents a gallon, 
and unleaded gasoline was 1.64 cents lower to 0.27 cent higher, with October at 
58.74 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for livestock and pork were 
mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for live hogs and frozen pork bellies moved lower as traders, awaiting 
Friday's hog inventory report from the Agriculture Department, were concerned 
over some weakness in the cash markets, said Paul Hare, an analyst in Chicago 
with Linnco Futures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Sizable deliveries of cattle to farmer markets weighed on cattle futures, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices for precious metals were lower on the Commodity Exchange in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled 50 cents to $1 lower, with the contract for delivery in September 
at $367.60 an ounce; silver was 1.8 to 2.2 cents lower, with September at 
$5.245 an ounce.

RAMONA SAVINGS FRAUD TRAIL NEARS END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first criminal trial involving owners of a failed Southern California 
thrift, the prosecution told jurors Wednesday that the former top officials of 
Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in Orange were engaged in deception and fraud "right 
from the get-go." 
</P>
<P>
"This was a federally insured savings and loan institution. We are not talking 
about some piggy bank or some toy," Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein 
said during his closing arguments in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles at the 
end of an 11-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona collapsed in September, 1986, and subsequently required a $65.5-million 
federal bailout of depositors. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Molinaro and Donald P. Mangano Sr. each face more than 30 charges in 
U.S. District Court, including bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with a 
Palm Springs real estate deal that prosecutors allege led to the thrift's 
collapse. Both men have pleaded innocent. Molinaro's lawyer is scheduled to 
make closing statements today. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano's attorney Robert S. Horwitz began his closing arguments by questioning 
the truthfulness of some of the prosecution's witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano, a real estate developer, and Molinaro, a former carpet salesman, 
bought Ramona in April, 1984, and spent about $25 million, or a quarter of the 
thrift's assets, building Cherokee Village condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which the government alleges was designed to enrich the two men 
rather than Ramona, was a failure. 
</P>
<P>
Zipperstein said Wednesday that Molinaro and Mangano dreamed up a complicated 
scheme to sell Ramona before the thrift became insolvent and Cherokee Village 
went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
The government said their plan was to make Ramona, which recorded a $4-million 
profit on the deal, look healthier to a potential buyer. Molinaro took a 
$2-million dividend from Ramona around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense said the government's allegations were unfounded. Horwitz said 
the plan, which involved dummy corporations, was devised for tax reasons and 
because Mangano wanted to protect his credit-worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Molinaro -- the sole owner and operator of Ramona Savings at the 
time of its collapse -- faces a maximum prison sentence of 165 years and $8.3 
million in fines; Mangano could receive a 155-year setence and $7.8 million in 
fines.

BILZERIAN GETS $1.5-MILLION FINE, 4-YEAR PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Wednesday sentenced former Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. 
Bilzerian to four years in prison and a $1.5-million fine for the nine counts 
of securities and tax fraud on which he was convicted in June. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward said he was convinced that a prison sentence 
was warranted, even though Bilzerian had never before been convicted of a 
crime, because the former corporate raider had lied on the witness stand during 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that he was a first (time) offender and he had a right to go to 
trial," the judge said. "But he did not have the right to take the stand and 
present false testimony." 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian, 38, had been accused of illegally amassing millions in profits from 
failed raids in 1985 and 1986 on Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.; H. H. Roberts &amp; 
Co., and Hammermill Paper Co. He was also accused of failing to disclose a 
large investment in Armco Inc. After six weeks of testimony, a jury convicted 
him on all the counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
The government had charged that Bilzerian evaded Securities and Exchange 
Commission disclosure requirements and had filed false tax returns. Bilzerian 
resigned as Singer's chairman within weeks after the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the prison term and fine, the judge sentenced Bilzerian to two 
years of probation and 250 hours of community service. Bilzerian would be 
eligible for parole after serving 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Depth of Despair' 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ward, however, allowed Bilzerian to remain free on bail pending the 
outcome of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The case was part of the series of criminal prosecutions that resulted from 
former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky's cooperation with the government. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Bilzerian showed little emotion but at times listened 
with his eyes closed and occasionally stared down at the table in front of him. 
In a letter delivered to the judge some time before the sentencing, Bilzerian 
had written: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you understand the depth of my despair. My trial and conviction has 
(sic) publicly humiliated me and I am sorry for any shame and sorrow I have 
caused my friends and family. I never intended to cause harm to anyone. I wish 
I could turn back the clock of time and correct whatever mistakes I may have 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian's lawyer, Arthur Mathews, had argued that because his client had no 
previous criminal record he should be sentenced only to community service. 
Mathews suggested work in a drug treatment program for children near 
Bilzerian's home in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors, in a document filed with the court, said Bilzerian had 
"displayed contempt for the legal system" and since his conviction had 
"displayed absolutely no contrition or remorse." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Bilzerian, who holds a degree from Harvard Business School, 
testified that he didn't know it was illegal for him not to have filed personal 
income tax returns for the years 1982, 1983 and 1984. He also denied that he 
had made illegal arrangements with the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm 
Jefferies &amp; Co. to secretly hold stock for him in his raid on Hammermill. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Judge Ward said that a statement of Bilzerian's personal 
finances, filed with the court, stated that he has a net worth of $81.4 
million.

Jerry Dlamini was whizzing along on his motorbike in this volatile black

angry black youngsters, knives and stones in their hands, surrounded him. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter?" Dlamini asked, using Xhosa, a black tribal language, and 
removing the helmet from his halo of short, kinky golden hair.

<P>
Surprised, the youths apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought you were a Boer (white Afrikaner)," one of them said. 
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, the son of black parents and the father of black children, is an 
albino. His white skin brought him insults as a child, but as a 37-year-old man 
it gives him a rare opportunity to see across apartheid's deep divide. 
</P>
<P>
Often accepted as an equal by South Africa's privileged white minority, Dlamini 
belongs, legally and culturally, to its black majority. He knows what it's like 
to be treated like a white man in South Africa, where he finds skin color is 
more important than the size of one's wallet or the size of one's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the close call with the township mob, Dlamini was pulled over by 
a white policeman with a friendly warning: "It isn't safe for whites like us to 
be driving around here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Thicker Than Water' 
</P>
<P>
"People say that blood is thicker than water," Dlamini said the other day. "But 
in South Africa, color is thicker than blood. It means everything. If you wake 
up tomorrow with a dark complexion, you will be classified African or Colored 
(mixed-race), no matter what you are." 
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, a Salvation Army commanding officer, lives with his family in a 
four-room matchbox of a house next to his army church in New Brighton, a 
township near the "white" city of Port Elizabeth. His wife and their three 
children, ages 3 to 11, are black-skinned. 
</P>
<P>
"Most whites can see I'm not of European descent, but they don't care," 
Dlamini, sitting in front of a glowing space heater in his living room, said. 
"They accept me as a human being. They invite me into their houses. They never 
say so, but it's because I look like they do." 
</P>
<P>
It is an axiom in South Africa that the fairer the skin, the greater the 
privilege. Whites control the government while Coloreds and Indians occupy 
separate and less powerful chambers in Parliament. Blacks have no vote in 
national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Leap Race Walls 
</P>
<P>
For about 40 years, the Population Registration Act, a pillar of apartheid, has 
blocked unauthorized leaps over the racial walls. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,142 people who applied for race changes last year, 90% were black 
Africans asking to become Colored or Coloreds wanting to become white. Only 13 
whites applied to become Colored and 15 Coloreds applied to become Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half the applications, after a careful study of the 
applicant's skin color, facial features and family tree, were granted. 
</P>
<P>
Dlamini is registered as black, but no one has yet asked for his identification 
card. They just see a short, white-skinned man with black-rimmed glasses, and 
they hear a precise English molded by private schools and an American 
benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, Dlamini feels the subtle deference that whites enjoy from policemen, 
store clerks and even bank tellers. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Hello, how are you? Can I help you?' " Dlamini says, imitating the friendly 
lilt of the white bank tellers who greet him. "But when my black friend Joe 
comes up to the counter, the teller is impatient. She wants Joe to come and go 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felt Blacks' Anger 
</P>
<P>
As a child in the sprawling black township of Soweto near Johannesburg, Dlamini 
also felt the heat of black anger toward whites. Children called him names, 
such as mlungu (European) and Boer. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he became a teacher in Soweto and then trained as a Salvation Army 
officer. When he was transferred here in 1985, at the height of the country's 
political unrest, his motorbike was frequently pelted with stones by black 
radicals who thought he was a Caucasian. He began taking his son along to 
protect himself against dangerous misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped they would think twice before throwing a rock at a little boy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dlamini, who speaks the languages of Xhosa, Zulu and Sotho as well as 
English and Afrikaans, eventually became known in the township through his 
church work and was accepted as a fellow black African. 
</P>
<P>
No white person has ever asked Dlamini about his race, but some, knowing that 
his Salvation Army command is in a black area, ask if he's afraid to go into 
the township. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'White People Don't Know' 
</P>
<P>
"Most white people don't know about black people," Dlamini said. "They have 
been taught from childhood that blacks are inferior and evil." 
</P>
<P>
Dlamini was distributing Salvation Army literature one evening in the 
conservative white town of Springs when he knocked at a white woman's house 
after dark. 
</P>
<P>
"Weren't you afraid to open the door for me?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I be?" she responded. "I could see that it was a white man. I 
wouldn't open for a black because most of them are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
White ignorance and fear of blacks has been preserved by 40 years of 
state-enforced racial segregation and government pronouncements that it is 
doing all it can for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Like Children' 
</P>
<P>
"Some whites think blacks are unthankful for what whites have done," Dlamini 
said. "I feel pity for them. They are just like children, accepting whatever 
the government tells them." 
</P>
<P>
He tries to explain that to other blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware, as most blacks are, that whites have more privileges and rights 
than we do," Dlamini said. "And it's not fair. It's un-Christian. But I tell my 
fellow Africans that there are good and bad elements among whites." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, being a white-skinned African has created some embarrassing 
situations. A white restaurant owner, spotting Dlamini eating outside with 
other blacks, insisted that he take a table inside, with the "other whites." 
</P>
<P>
Dlamini and a black Salvation Army officer were going door to door a few years 
ago when a white man invited them to lunch. The host instructed his black maid 
to set one extra place at the table, telling Dlamini that his colleague would 
have to eat in the maid's quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Dlamini protested, pointing out that it would be awkward because Dlamini's 
colleague, a captain, outranked him. But the man refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
"He was only happy to sit down with me, because I looked like him," Dlamini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Being mistaken for a white man is not enough to make a man white in the eyes of 
the law, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be accepted by whites," Dlamini said, "but the laws of this country 
prevent me from ever living in their neighborhood."

BOMBECK'S TALE OF YOUNG SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday was a typical Erma Bombeck day. On a hectic tour to promote her new 
book, the syndicated columnist got a flat tire while racing from a television 
interview to the New York airport. Her plane to Washington was late and then 
became "surgically attached to the jetport," so that it couldn't take off even 
when ready. The driver in Washington took her to the wrong hotel and by the 
time a reporter phoned her at 7 p.m., she was "eating lunch." 
</P>
<P>
But Bombeck wasn't fazed. Her book, about children surviving cancer, has 
changed her life, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been relaxed all day. I told myself I'll get there when I can, and even 
if I can't I will at least have had a great journey." 
</P>
<P>
And that is the essence of "I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to 
Go to Boise" (Harper &amp; Row, $16.95). It's about children with cancer 
beating the odds, having fun, telling the same goofy jokes and playing the same 
dumb tricks that children everywhere like to play. It's about "the chemo cut," 
when your hair falls out due to chemotherapy and you think up crazy answers to 
the oft-asked question "What happened to your hair?" It's about mothers who 
feel guilty that they can't "kiss it and make it better" and fathers who learn 
that children are "awarded for an indefinite length of time, over which they 
have no control." 
</P>
<P>
And it's about sisters and brothers, like those of 3-year-old Darlene, who 
swung into action when she was diagnosed with cancer. To alleviate her fears of 
the dark and of radiation, the five siblings played a sort of game with their 
little sister: They wrapped her in a white sheet, lay her on the kitchen table, 
turned on the microwave (for sound) and turned out the lights. They put the 
portable sewing machine lid over her head and thumped it with their fingers. 
The time was increased each night, starting with 30 seconds. When she finally 
went for radiation treatments, she wasn't afraid. 
</P>
<P>
The book is filled with kooky tales, like the one about the kid who removed her 
artificial leg and positioned it in the car window, so potential car thieves 
would think someone was inside. Or the notice that informed a camper's mother: 
"Your child broke his leg today. Please send a new one up on the train." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, it's by and about the kids themselves, explaining how they feel about 
life, death and what they've lived through -- and attempting to help others in 
the same boat. Bombeck says the book began as a pamphlet, requested by a summer 
camp director who asked for something to give potential campers "a little shot 
of optimism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Intend to Grow Old 
</P>
<P>
Bombeck had trepidations, she admits, but visited the camp for kids with cancer 
and found that they "had every intention of living long enough to go to 
Disneyland, drive their mothers crazy, live in bedrooms that should be 
condemned, go to the prom . . . and grow old." 
</P>
<P>
She then spent two years meeting similar survivors, listening to their sagas, 
and soliciting their written remembrances about what happened when cancer 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
The result is an optimistic, upbeat compendium of tales from the cancer 
underground, written in true Bombeckian style. The souffle lightness of it all 
makes it an easy read. But within its pages are kernels of truth, courage and 
hope that make this essential reading for anyone about to travel the road that 
these children and their families have traveled. 
</P>
<P>
Bombeck says there have been many "wonderful, poignant books about a particular 
child, from diagnosis to death. But what we needed at this point is to say that 
'It is doable.' You can win. You can stay alive. The odds get better every day 
-- from 40% to 90% of children with cancer now survive -- and you don't have to 
roll over and just give in to it any more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proceeds to Cancer Research 
</P>
<P>
The author has contributed her $1.5 million advance fee to cancer research and 
will contribute all proceeds from the book to that same cause. 
</P>
<P>
What is also needed, she said, is to "change everyone's attitude" so that 
people stop treating these kids with pity and fear. They must be treated like 
the survivors they are. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as one boy told Bombeck: "I had a teacher last year who shouted at me on 
the first day of school, 'Sit down and be quiet!' She treated me like everyone 
else. I knew it was going to be a good year."

Rep. Augustus Hawkins, 81, vividly remembers riding a bus in his home town of 
Los Angeles many years ago when a white woman sat down beside him. "She kept 
moving over to be next to me," he recalled, "and then she said, 'You know, we 
sure are getting a lot of blacks in this neighborhood. I don't like sitting 
next to them because they smell.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, both curious and offended, asked the woman if he smelled. When she 
answered no, he said, "If I were to tell you that I'm black, what would you 
say?" Her answer: "I wouldn't believe you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Assumed I Was Lying' 
</P>
<P>
"That woman's view has never changed," said Hawkins. "She probably assumed I 
was lying just to kid her." 
</P>
<P>
What was a disagreeable incident for Hawkins, who represents such areas as 
Watts, South Gate and Huntington Park, is an all-too-common occurrence for many 
very light-skinned black people: They are born between two worlds. Some choose 
to join the white world, "passing" in order to gain privileges denied to black 
people. Others prefer to live black, gaining the satisfaction of feeling true 
to themselves and their race. 
</P>
<P>
As Hawkins' experience shows, it is not a new predicament. 
</P>
<P>
But today, with interracial marriages more common -- according to the Census 
Bureau, there were 218,000 black-white marriages by last year, compared with 
51,000 in 1960 -- and racial confrontations once again grabbing headlines, the 
issue of what determines a person's race is more prevalent in our society. By 
being mistaken for white, black people often see white behavior and attitudes 
-- ranging from the humorous to the sinister -- that would otherwise be 
concealed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mistaken for White 
</P>
<P>
What follows are some of the stories of blacks who have been mistaken for 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Dancy, 34, now a lobbyist with a computer firm in Washington, received a 
welcome to Raleigh, N.C., that she will never forget. "I went there on a 
Saturday," she said, "and my boss was taking me around, introducing me to 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the people who greeted me welcomed me by saying, 'Hi, so glad to meet 
you. You're going to love North Carolina. We still lynch niggers and burn 
crosses down here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dancy, noting that the man was a customer of the firm she was starting to work 
for, said nothing to him because she did not want to sour the professional 
relationship. She said: "I didn't tell him. I don't know what my face looked 
like or how I handled it in front of him. I said, 'Yeah, I'm glad to be here,' 
or something like that, and kept on going." 
</P>
<P>
But "someone must have told him after that that I am black," she said, because 
"he could never look me in the eye for the four years we worked together. And 
he never said he was sorry. We never discussed it." Three other white people 
present, including her boss, knew she was black and "were flabbergasted," said 
Dancy. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, she was waiting a long time in line for a North Carolina 
driver's license, slogging her way through the bureaucracy and finally dashing 
out of the examination office only to find that her license said she was white. 
</P>
<P>
"The people had never asked me my race," she said, "so I had to go back and get 
the picture taken again. I don't know why they did not have me fill out 
something that told my race." 
</P>
<P>
Dancy's reaction to being mistaken for white is not uncommon, according to 
Joyce Ladner, a sociologist and professor of social work at Howard University. 
The mistake "is like calling you out of your name," she said. "You want to be 
recognized for what you are." 
</P>
<P>
Ladner asserted that attention to race continues, even though many legal 
barriers to race-mixing have fallen, largely because the Reagan Administration 
fostered "a heightened awareness of racial tensions." 
</P>
<P>
"That unleashed people's most base instincts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Amid increasing cultural and ethnic diversity in the United States, race 
remains unshakable as the ultimate identifier. One can change dress, life 
style, weight and many other characteristics, but race, as Ladner put it, 
remains "fixed and immutable." 
</P>
<P>
When Carol Tyler, 54, a Red Cross executive in Columbus, Ohio, went to a blood 
banking meeting in Toledo, she and a few white associates started a 
conversation about another acquaintance, who was black. They were "speculating 
about her age." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the banter, one of the white women said, "Don't you know you can't tell 
about those people?" 
</P>
<P>
Tyler remembered being "completely taken aback, but I didn't say anything about 
it. The next day somebody said something about my age." Recalling that moment, 
Tyler laughed and said, "Oh, that was the perfect set-up." She said she told 
the group: "You know I'm one of those people whose age you can't tell about." 
</P>
<P>
The white woman, who also was taken aback, "was so upset that she couldn't look 
at me," Tyler recalled. "I finally said, 'Hey, I didn't intend to make you feel 
bad, but you never know who you're talking to.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tyler said that when she saw the woman during annual meetings after the 
incident, "our relationship was a little strained." 
</P>
<P>
Like Tyler, many light-skinned blacks "enjoy being able to smoke out white 
people," said Charles King, who as director of the Urban Crisis Center in 
Atlanta, conducts seminars for businesses, schools and government agencies to 
help them deal with racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
But mistaken identity can lead to angry confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Henson, 35, a Los Angeles hotel executive, was in a Veterans 
Administration counseling session earlier this year with a group of white men 
in Long Beach, when a casual conversation turned ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was talking," Henson recalled, "and he said, 'You know, my daughter 
is hanging around with a whole lot of (blacks), and it's really starting to 
(irritate) me.' " 
</P>
<P>
A furious Henson told the man: "Excuse me, we're all men here. We're all 
veterans. We can talk (about sex and profanity) and all this stuff, but if you 
say that word one more time, I'm going to bust you over the head. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He was shocked. He was beet red. He followed me to my car and said, 'No 
offense.' I said there was offense." Henson said he sees the man weekly and 
"he's never brought it up again." 
</P>
<P>
Henson, who is suing a Beverly Hills hotel, charging that he lost his job as 
executive assistant manager last year when his boss found out he was black, 
said he frequently has to "pull people to the curb" to warn them of his color. 
</P>
<P>
He told the moderator of the VA class that he was shocked that he would allow 
such a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally inappropriate, even if there weren't a black person there. I 
looked at everybody in the class and I said, 'You can talk all the (black) talk 
you want, but when I walk through the door, it ceases because I don't want to 
hear it.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Henson had not spoken out, it is unlikely anyone else would have, said King. 
"Very seldom will a white person correct another white person about race. They 
feel it's impossible to get that person to change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
This cold reality conflicts with America's idealistic view of itself, King 
said. "America lives in a myth of a melting pot, teaching children that this 
country is for everyone. But the practical reality is that equality has never 
been lived out." 
</P>
<P>
Hazel McConnell, a widowed 74-year-old retired federal employee who lives in 
Wakefield, Mass., dated a man long ago in Columbus, Ohio, "and we were out for 
a ride. All of a sudden, four white men drove up beside us on the side I was 
sitting on. 
</P>
<P>
They shouted racial slurs, she recalled. "My friend reached down and said he 
had a club under the seat, just in case they stop and try to do anything. It 
was really scary. There were four of them, and I thought they might jump out 
and beat us up or something." 
</P>
<P>
Her friend was "really angry," McConnell said, "and I was scared. It was a very 
threatening situation. But afterward, I felt he just expected it as something 
that you have to deal with when you're a minority person." 
</P>
<P>
King says that, whether light- or dark-skinned, black people always expect the 
worst in race relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Being black," he said, "means you don't expect to have a good time. There's no 
shock value left in being black." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, cases of mistaken identity can lead to some remarkable responses. 
Jessica Daniel, a Boston psychologist, said that some light-skinned blacks "go 
to extra lengths to prove they're 'blacker' than somebody who is dark-skinned." 
In the 1960s and 1970s, wearing the biggest Afro and the brightest dashiki 
provided the proof. Today, joining black groups and speaking out on black 
issues show blackness, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Why does a person's race matter? 
</P>
<P>
For Anthony Browder, a Washingtonian who studies and lectures on African 
culture, the answer is simple: "We live in a racist society where people are 
judged by the color of their skin." 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring his assertion, Browder was a key organizer of the third annual 
Melanin Conference, which explored political, economic and social issues 
involving skin color. 
</P>
<P>
Browder sees the emphasis on color as part of the "divide and conquer syndrome" 
fostered historically by whites. "Many African Americans have bought into this 
idea that if you're light, you're all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Browder and others noted that light-skinned blacks used to be deemed by whites 
as more intelligent and better looking. Blacks, in turn, used various "tests" 
to determine whether a person was light enough to join certain organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, in an ironic twist, darker skinned blacks often are deemed more 
desirable by some employers who want to make sure their affirmative action 
employees are visible. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Hawkins remembers the days after the 1965 Watts uprising, when he "had to 
be careful going through" the area he still represents in Congress because 
"there was a strong hostility to whites in the neighborhoods at that time. It 
hurt me not to be able to get around the area," he said, but he was afraid 
someone "might take a shot at you" thinking he was "a white face passing 
through." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hawkins said, "I recall once in Will Rogers Park, I was walking from 
the clubhouse out to my automobile and some fellow ran down to attack me on the 
basis of 'here's whitey in our neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said friends who knew he is black rescued him. He did not report the 
incident, he said, but it taught him a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, in the areas where I have that situation," he said, "I always have a 
person obviously black along with me. You learn to adjust to some of these 
situations and reduce the risk." 
</P>
<P>
One of the ways he reduces the risk of being mistaken by whites these days is 
by removing his Masonic ring, which identifies him as a member of the secret 
fraternity whose members use secret handshakes in greeting each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had white Masons attempt to give me the (white) grip," Hawkins said. "I 
have become so embarrassed . . . I just refuse to be a Mason when I'm 
traveling." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the experiences of many people like himself, Hawkins said, "I get 
accused on both sides. Blacks think that you're passing, and whites think that 
you're the uppity type and are challenging them. So, in a sense you're an 
outcast. This has been a problem all through the years for me." 
</P>
<P>
And for many others, including Walter White, who led the NAACP through the 
1930s and 1940s until he died in 1955. In his 1948 autobiography, he wrote of 
his "insistence, day after day, year in and year out," on identifying himself 
as black, asserting that when white people discover his color they are upset by 
a "startling removal of the blackness." Then, he said, "they find it impossible 
suddenly to endow me with the skin, the odor, the dialect, the shuffle, the 
imbecile good nature traditionally attributed to" black people. 
</P>
<P>
"Instantly they are aware that these things are not part of me," White wrote. 
"They think there must be some mistake. There is no mistake. I am a Negro." 
</P>
<P>
Many light-skinned black people today are just as avowedly black and take pains 
to avoid being mistaken for white -- partly because they are proud of their 
race and partly because they want to avoid the pain of hearing other blacks 
denigrated. They, like White, say many whites are amazed that anyone would 
decline to be white. 
</P>

Whites often assume black people are white because of context -- where they 
live, shop and go for fun, say many blacks. To signal her race, Dancy said, her 
resume "has always said, NAACP, Urban League, African Methodist Episcopal 
Church -- you know, things that make people look and say, 'Oh!' " 
</P>
<P>
She and others note that black people are more likely than whites to believe 
that a person is black, regardless of how light his or her skin may be. 
</P>
<P>
Henson said: "We always know. I don't care how light you are, if you have green 
eyes or whatever, there's something about you, and when you pass each other, 
you'll get that look." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever mistakes are made, light-skinned blacks say they often get blamed for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if you've insulted people," said McConnell, "by allowing them to 
believe you're white. They think you're supposed to say, 'Don't talk to me. I'm 
black.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes are made in all kinds of ways, as Beatrice de Munick Keizer of Boston 
knows. Personnel administrator at the headquarters of the Unitarian 
Universalist Assn., she said a black woman came to her office and said, "It's 
so wonderful to see a black person in this job." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's great," replied de Munick Keizer, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the conversation, she said, "It all goes to show how meaningless 
these things (racial distinctions) are." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, yes. Eventually, maybe. But not yet. After all, until six years ago 
Louisiana had a law saying anyone was legally black if she had more than 1/32 
black blood. The law was repealed in 1983 because of a contentious court case 
involving Susie Guillory Phipps, who wanted to change the designation on her 
birth certificate from "colored" to "white." 
</P>
<P>
While the 1/32 law was repealed, Phipps is still legally black. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost," said her lawyer, Brian Begue. "The world wasn't ready for a 
race-free society." 
</P>
<P>
Race freedom is available only to whites, said King. "They never have to deal 
with any problem of who they are." He added: "One of the truisms is everyone in 
America has to adopt to another identity to succeed except a white male 
Protestant heterosexual. He is the only one who escapes the trauma of 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
For light-skinned blacks, there is no way out. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in a twilight zone," King said.

Consumer advocates and insurers who have clashed in the past joined forces to 
push for legislation such as mandated auto safety features and a return to the 
55-m.p.h. speed limit on all interstate highways. The Advocates for Highway and 
Auto Safety will pursue "a balanced and aggressive approach" to reduce highway 
deaths and injuries and the high cost of automobile accidents, said executive 
director Judith Lee Stone. Insurers hope improved auto safety will help stem 
rising auto insurance costs.

President Zine Abidine ben Ali on Wednesday fired his premier, who had 
expressed growing opposition to Ben Ali's reform moves. 
</P>
<P>
The president named Justice Minister Hamed Karoui to replace Hedi Baccouche, 
the government announced. "A new post will be found for Baccouche," said a 
statement from the president's office without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
Baccouche, a personal friend of the president, was named to lead the government 
immediately after the palace coup Nov. 7, 1987, in which Ben Ali ousted 
President Habib Bourguiba. However, the two men had grown progressively further 
apart recently as Ben Ali sought to put through his own program.

SUSPECTS IN IRVINE BURGLARY SEIZED IN TIJUANA AFTER CHASE 
</P>

<P>
Two burglary suspects in a stolen car led police on a two-county, 85-mile 
freeway chase Wednesday that started in Irvine and ended with gunfire in 
Tijuana, where Mexican police captured the two uninjured Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The wild ride, which at times hit 100 m.p.h., began about 11:30 a.m., when an 
Irvine woman saw two strange men enter her neighbor's home on Stone Pine Drive. 
Adding to her suspicion was the white 1982 Volkswagen Rabbit the two had parked 
out front. The car, which belonged to her neighbor, had been stolen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman called police. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine officers caught up with the two men on Jeffrey Road near the Santa Ana 
Freeway. Then the chase began in earnest. With police in pursuit, the men tried 
to flee north on the freeway. Five miles north, at the Costa Mesa Freeway 
interchange, the white Rabbit turned around and headed south on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, according to Irvine Police Lt. Mike White. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police, joined by an Orange County Sheriff's Department helicopter, 
chased the two suspects to San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol took over near Crown Valley Parkway. All the 
while, the men in the car, veering in and out of traffic, refused repeated 
calls from police to stop. 
</P>
<P>
When the chase reached San Diego County, a new set of CHP officers and a San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department helicopter took over at Las Pulgas Road, CHP 
Lt. Jim Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities trailed the Rabbit for more than an hour through San Diego County. 
At one point, television news crews pulled up alongside the car and filmed the 
pair as they sped down the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that the two men were heading for the border, CHP 
officials radioed ahead, warning Mexican customs officials of the approaching 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic lanes at the border crossing were heavily congested at the time, with 
several cars in line waiting to cross. But, in full view of news photographers, 
the car careened between the lanes and sped through the border crossing. 
Mexican police fired at least one shot at the car, which did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 minutes, Mexican police scoured Tijuana before finding the car, 
abandoned, in a parking lot with a flat tire. Suspects Edward Kennedy, 25, of 
Anaheim and Joseph Brett, 26, of Florida were arrested moments later, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the car, Mexican police found silverware, which they believe was stolen. At 
the Tijuana jail, one of the two men was briefly interviewed by San Diego 
television station KNSD (Channel 39). He told the reporter he and his friend 
knew nothing about the chase and claimed that they had bought the white Rabbit 
in Tijuana 10 minutes before their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and Brett later were turned over to Irvine police, according to San 
Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson. The two were being held on suspicion of 
burglary, auto theft, reckless driving and failure to yield to police. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why police let the chase continue for so long, Irvine Police Sgt. Jeffery 
Kermode said that forcing a vehicle off the road during a chase is prohibited 
because of the potential for injuries to both the officers and the people being 
pursued. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kermode said it's very dangerous for police to pull alongside a 
fleeing vehicle because the officers might get shot.

TRUCK DELIVERY HOURS LIMITED TO CURB NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved an amendment to a city ordinance that will 
prohibit commercial trucks from making deliveries while the city sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-1 vote, the council this week decided to limit the hours of truck 
deliveries to 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., with no deliveries allowed on Sundays or 
federal holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The action came in response to complaints about noise from neighbors of Cypress 
East Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Margaret M. Arnold voted against the amendment, saying it unfairly 
infringes on companies that are not part of the noise problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to identify what trucks are a nuisance and address those, 
instead of limiting companies who may not be a part of the problem," Arnold 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not affect trash trucks, which can begin pickups at 6 a.m. 
and can do earlier pickups at sites more than 600 feet away from a residential 
community, according to Larry Hurst, finance director. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will have a second reading at the next council meeting, Oct. 9.

CULTURAL ARTS COMMITTEE SET UP TO REVIEW PLANS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing the need for a separate entity to make recommendations about cultural 
events the city should sponsor, the City Council has established a Cultural 
Arts Advisory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under a resolution unanimously approved Tuesday, the panel will have five 
members and hold monthly public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will review plans for "anything like a play or a musical event 
that the city may want to sponsor," City Clerk Mary Lou Morey said Wednesday. 
"They will look at and consider activities, but the commission is advisory 
only. They will forward recommendations to the council." 
</P>
<P>
Up to this point, such recommendations have been made by the city's Community 
Services and Recreation Department, Morey said. Anyone wishing to become a 
member of the commission may contact the city clerk's office for an 
application.

HOUSE FIRE BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED IN WIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City fire officials said they do not suspect arson in a house fire that broke 
out Wednesday afternoon in an exclusive harbor front neighborhood which has 
been plagued by a string of suspicious blazes recently. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused about $25,000 in damage to a home at 1960 Port Ramsgate at 
about 1 p.m. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
It began in the attic near some of the home's major electrical circuits, 
according to Rosemary Williams, a Fire Department spokeswoman who said the 
resident reported that the electricity first went dead in the house and then 
there were loud crackling and popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Williams said, neighbors spotted smoke coming out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like it was probably electrical," Williams said. Arson "is not 
suspected in this case." 
</P>
<P>
However, until the cause is established, Williams said, the possibility of 
arson will be checked by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the area has been plagued in the last 10 months by fires 
deliberately set in houses, cars and trash cans.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT PLEADS INSANITY IN DEATH OF 
WIFE, CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man who had admitted to police that he killed his wife and their 
infant daughter in January has entered an insanity plea in Orange County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Peter Lynch, 43, in custody at the Orange County Jail, had been treated 
for depression at the time of the killings. He will now be examined by 
court-appointed psychiatrists, which could mean a delay in his Dec. 12 trial 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police found the body of 35-year-old Helen Lynch and their 
13-month-old daughter, Natalie Alexandra, at the couple's condominium in the 
700 block of West 1st Street on Jan. 17, 1989. Lynch's wife had been bludgeoned 
to death, and the daughter died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch at first blamed a neighbor for the crime, but soon admitted he was 
responsible. The officers testified that Lynch told them he had beaten his wife 
with an empty champagne bottle following an argument and that the child 
inadvertently had received blows while in her mother's arms. Two other 
daughters were asleep at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Because Lynch, who is an electrical engineer, is accused of multiple murders, 
he could receive the death penalty, or a minimum of life without parole, if 
convicted. Even if jurors acquit Lynch on grounds that he was insane, he could 
be committed to a state hospital for life.

ROCKWELL TO PAY $75,000 TO EMPLOYEE WHO CONTRACTED LEUKEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International has agreed to pay a $75,000 workers compensation 
settlement to a former employee who has leukemia and claims to have been 
routinely exposed to radioactive substances during nearly 20 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
In settling the case, Rockwell did not admit liability for the illness of Gary 
Shoop, 52, of Thousand Oaks, who worked as a lab technician at Rockwell's 
Canoga Park plant and later at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In his compensation claim, Shoop alleged he was exposed to a variety of toxic 
chemicals and radioactive substances at Rockwell, where he worked from 1961-69 
and again from 1979-88. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement agreement approved last month, attorneys for Rockwell and 
Shoop said "a bona fide and good-faith issue exists" as to the link between the 
workplace exposures and leukemia, a cancer of the blood. The settlement was 
detailed in papers filed with the state Workers Compensation Appeals Board in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop worked at the DeSoto plant from 1961-69 for Atomics International, a 
Rockwell branch that has since been absorbed by the firm's Canoga Park-based 
Rocketdyne division. Shoop said his duties included testing the nuclear fuel 
that Atomics manufactured at the DeSoto plant in the 1960s. During the same 
period, he was also assigned work with radioactive materials at the Santa 
Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth, where most of Rockwell's nuclear 
work has been done. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Rockwell for a job as a salesman, Shoop returned in 1979, working 
at the science center until the end of last year, when he was placed on medical 
leave because of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Shoop said he "definitely had an exposure to" toxic 
and radioactive materials during his years at Rockwell. But he praised the 
company for what he called its "caring attitude," saying "safety . . . is the 
mind-set" at Rockwell. "Those people tried very hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $75,000 settlement is a substantial amount for a workers compensation case. 
Rockwell previously settled five other claims of radiation-induced cancer 
involving former workers in Canoga Park or Santa Susana, company officials have 
said. Those settlements ranged from a low of $2,500 to a high of $90,000, 
according to a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Shoop settlement provided for payment of $63,750 to Shoop and $11,250 to 
his lawyer. Shoop also is to receive lifetime medical care and is to be 
continued on medical leave status until eligible for his retirement pension at 
the age of 55. Shoop also waived his family's right to seek death benefits.

FEC TO TAKE NO ACTION IN BAKER CASE

The Federal Election Commission will take no action against former Orange 
County congressional candidate C. David Baker for accepting an illegal campaign 
contribution from his aunt because Baker acted immediately to return the 
donation, an FEC spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the circumstances, the general counsel recommended and the commission 
accepted the recommendation that they take no further action and just close the 
file," spokesman Scott Moxley said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission reached the unanimous decision during a meeting on Aug. 28, 
Moxley said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was defeated in the 1988 Republican primary by C. Christopher Cox, who 
went on to win in the 40th Congressional District. The seat previously had been 
occupied by Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), who did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed on Probation 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated incident, Baker subsequently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor 
charge in connection with his forgery of a signature on a $48,000 check during 
the closing days of the campaign. He was placed on probation and ordered to 
perform 600 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Baker had told the FEC that he regarded the $11,000 payment from his aunt for 
radio air time as a loan that was not subject to the $1,000 federal limit on 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
But, Moxley said, "Anything of value is a contribution subject to the same 
limit" as cash. 
</P>
<P>
The FEC spokesman said the agency's general counsel advised against taking 
further action because Baker acted to return the money as soon as he was told 
that its acceptance would violate federal election law.

2 U.S. MARSHALS FOUND GUILTY OF TRADING THEIR INFLUENCE FOR MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two U.S. marshals from Orange County, implicated in a cash-for-influence scheme 
in the federal justice system, were convicted Wednesday of accepting thousands 
of dollars in illegal payments from a government contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt this was just a horrendous conflict of interest, and we were all 
definite on that," said juror Kerry Page of Riverside County. "There are 
certain things you don't do in a business relationship, and they crossed the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gieniec, 43, of Santa Ana, convicted on all four criminal counts against 
him, faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison and $40,000 in fines. 
Co-defendant Gordon Tornberg, 59, of Tustin, convicted on two of three illegal 
gratuity charges, could get four years in prison and $20,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Their sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 6 before U.S. District Judge J. Spencer 
Letts in the federal courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors had accused Gieniec and Tornberg of using their positions 
as federal marshals in the Southland district to help a 200-employee security 
firm in Orange County get and keep a $400,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
The firm helped seize and guard evidence in federal investigations and protect 
government witnesses in the early 1980s. Federal officials said no such private 
arrangement had been used in other districts around the country. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, prosecutors charged, the two defendants received more than $7,000 
in direct payments and other financial favors -- such as house renovation 
payments -- from Joseph Rydzewski, owner of Lyons Security International. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Rydzewski emerged as the key witness against the two marshals 
at their trial, testifying that he made repeated payments under some duress 
from Gieniec so as not to "upset . . . the apple cart." 
</P>
<P>
Rydzewski pleaded guilty to charges in the scheme and agreed to cooperate with 
federal investigators. He is to be sentenced Oct. 6, and faces a maximum of six 
years in prison and $270,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys tried to show jurors that Rydzewski was lying about his 
relationship with the men to help his case and that, in fact, the money that 
changed hands between the trio was simply a result of their friendship -- not 
of influence peddling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very disappointed in this result," said attorney James L. 
Waltz, who defended Gieniec. "Mr. Rydzewski was untruthful, and that clearly 
hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
While the defendants were guilty of exercising poor judgement in their 
financial dealings with Rydzewski, "their conduct never entered the realm of 
the criminal," the defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
He and attorney Wendy Park, who defended Tornberg, said they would appeal the 
jury's verdict if it is upheld by Judge Letts. Gieniec and Tornberg, each 
allowed to remain free on $10,000 bond, could not be reached for comment after 
the verdict.

2 INDICTED IN HORMONE-SALES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Sacramento-area bodybuilder and a Carmel man have been charged with 
distributing a genetically engineered human growth hormone, a drug increasingly 
sought by top athletes as a non-detectable substitute for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Cambra Jr., 31, of Carmichael and James V. Sorrano, 29, of Carmel 
were named in the 12-count indictment filed Wednesday in San Diego federal 
court. The indictment also included charges of conspiring to sell the synthetic 
hormone, distributing steroids and distributing counterfeit steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were the first by federal prosecutors involving the distribution of 
the synthetic hormone, an expensive drug prescribed only for children with 
growth deficiencies but in increasing demand among world-class athletes seeking 
to pass drug tests, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Phillip L. B. Halpern of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was unsealed after the arrest of Cambra Wednesday morning in 
Carmichael, a Sacramento suburb. Known nationally as a bodybuilder and owner of 
a Carmichael gym, Cambra was being held pending a bail hearing today in U.S. 
District Court in Sacramento, Halpern said. Police are searching for Sorrano. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, both face up to 38 years in prison and $3 million in fines. 
Cambra ran a national network that distributed large amounts of the synthetic 
hormone and bogus anabolic steroids, the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The hormone substitute costs between $600 and $1,200 per dose on the black 
market, Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of that it's not used by every Tom, Dick and Harry who wants to use 
steroids," he said. "Only top-level athletes, be they bodybuilders, track and 
field, etc., would want to use human growth hormone." 
</P>
<P>
The hormone is so hard to detect under the drug tests given to athletes, 
Halpern said, that "if you took it in the last Olympics, it would not have been 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
The hormone is the compound Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner 
recently was accused of taking.

PRINGLE GETS HIS YARDS, THEN SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Pringle has goals for himself, but he keeps them to himself. They are the 
sort of thing he can think about on Sundays while soaking in a tub, coaxing 
away the aches left over from Cal State Fullerton's football games on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he thinks about what he heard from a teammate at practice last week, 
and then read in the newspapers and heard on TV. Pringle was leading the nation 
in all-purpose running, the statistical category led last season by Barry 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle almost wishes he had never heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I want to stay there," he said. "Now it's in the back of my mind: Am I 
still there? Am I still there?" 
</P>
<P>
This week, he is not. He is second, behind Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon, 
formerly of La Habra High School. It still is not a bad place to be for a 
5-foot-9, 190-pound running back who once figured he must be jinxed. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Pringle has suffered a season-ending broken jaw at 
Washington State, transferred to Glendale College, transferred to Cal State 
Fullerton, missed one game and parts of two others with an ankle injury, and 
been suspended for two games by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. because 
of a transfer eligibility ruling resulting from a Fullerton error. 
</P>
<P>
But Pringle, dogged and resilient when running with the ball, is the same way 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if that persistence might have been for naught in the Titans' 
first game this season. Pringle was handed the ball 10 times, and he was 
stuffed by Northern Illinois on almost every one of them, finishing with 14 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The 14 yards didn't discourage me," Pringle said. "I know if I get the ball 
more than 15 times, I'm gonna get some yards. I'm the type of back that needs 
to get the ball a few times just to see the hole and know how to hit it, so I 
know next time how to hit it and when to hit it." 
</P>
<P>
What was easy to overlook in that game was that Pringle finished with 169 
all-purpose yards, 149 on five kickoff returns and another six on three 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
"What I set out to do each week is if I were to get shut down running, to be 
able to catch the ball and get yards receiving. Or if not receiving, on 
returns," Pringle said. "I look at it like that. If one doesn't work, I want to 
make the other work." 
</P>
<P>
Against Cal State Northridge the next week, Fullerton gave him the ball 28 
times in a studied attempt to establish a running game. Pringle responded with 
164 yards, a career-high, and the first of three consecutive 100-yard games. He 
caught a pass for four yards and returned four kickoffs for 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Against Colorado State, he had 137 yards rushing and 90 yards on returns. 
Against San Diego State, he had 158 yards rushing, 34 receiving and 110 on 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
These are the numbers that have given him a 240.3-yard all-purpose average, and 
a 118.3-yard rushing average, ninth in the country. 
</P>
<P>
There is one nagging stat: If he could throw out that first game, he would be 
leading the nation in rushing with a 153-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle returned kickoffs last season when he was available, and had good 
success. Against West Virginia, he set a Mountaineer Field record with 202 
yards in kickoff returns. But he has never returned one for a touchdown. That 
is one goal Pringle is willing to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to break one before I'm through here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last season, wary opponents shyed from kicking to Pringle. That 
hasn't happened yet this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I'm not gonna say they've been gutsy, but they have confidence in 
their kickoff coverage," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
The receiving has been an addition. The word on Pringle last year was that he 
couldn't catch the ball, and Fullerton rarely threw to him. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle claims that was just a misconception on the coaches' part. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I could always catch in games. I just had trouble catching in 
practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he is proving he can catch. Against San Diego State, he had six 
receptions, one fewer than he had all last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, much in need of a consistent offensive performer, couldn't be much 
more pleased with Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I do as a coach is point Mike Pringle in the right direction," 
said Preston Dennard, who coaches the running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Gene Murphy: "He's short and runs close to the ground. You gotta get 
up under his pads to stop him. That's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle is not particularly big nor fancy-footed, but he is fast -- he has run 
the 40 in 4.37 seconds -- and durable. Fullerton has rushed 115 times, and 
Pringle has carried 88. He seems likely to average around 25 carries a game, a 
fairly high number for a college player. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it looks like I'm getting banged up out there, but it's nothing 
serious," Pringle said. "It looks worse than it is." 
</P>
<P>
It looks pretty good to the Titans.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER;

OUT OF CLASSROOM, ONTO SOCCER FIELD;

<P>
STUDENT STEVE SHAW COACHES WOMEN'S TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Somehow, you get the feeling this would never happen to Notre Dame's football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
When the members of UC Irvine women's soccer team showed up for the first day 
of practice this season, they didn't know who their coach would be. 
</P>
<P>
And when they found out, it turned out to be a guy they sat next to in biology, 
or somebody they had danced with at a fraternity party. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? Well, not surprisingly, this is kind of a long story. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring Irvine had hired Lisa Fraser, former coach at Case Western Reserve 
University in Cleveland, and she made a positive impression on the team during 
spring workouts. But the University of Washington made a better offer during 
the summer and Fraser fled, bidding the team farewell via the mail. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, 22-year-old Irvine student Steve Shaw, former soccer 
player and Beta Theta Pi president, was coaching a youth club team on a tour of 
Europe. Shaw, who had planned to help coach the men's team as a volunteer 
assistant, had a phone message waiting for him when he arrived back in the 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We got in from London and landed in Texas and I called home," Shaw said. "My 
mom said to call Kaia (Hedlund, Irvine's associate athletic director for 
student affairs). She offered me the job, and I beat my head against the side 
of the airplane all the way home thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the job the next day and had the whole weekend to prepare for the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
It was a frantic four days and, so far, there's no fairy tale ending in sight. 
The Anteaters are 1-6-1 going into this afternoon's (3 o'clock) match at Irvine 
against Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
While certainly not a threat to win a national championship, the Anteaters may 
not be as weak as their record indicates. Three of their defeats came against 
opponents ranked in the top 10 and a fourth to a top 20 team. 
</P>
<P>
They also had to play three games with a center-forward and fullback 
alternating in goal because one goalie broke her hand and the other was on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
And, after all, the players are just getting to know their coach. Well, at 
least, just getting to know him as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Kacky Overom, who had been friends with Shaw, said all social 
relationships came to a screeching halt when he showed up on the field that 
first day with a whistle around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"From the minute he stepped on the field, he made it very clear that he was no 
longer Steve Shaw, he was Coach Shaw," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw is hardly an intimidating figure. He's not tall, or particularly muscular, 
and he smiles a lot. But he was a hard-nosed defender during his playing days 
and he spends a lot of time talking to his team about dedication and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
They seem to be listening. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've come to respect my decisions," he said. "It was actually 
easier than I expected. It was a little uncomfortable at first, but I ask only 
three things of them: Go 100% every day, work together and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I also told them that people would question us as a team, because of my age, 
and that they would have to stand behind me." 
</P>
<P>
They weren't exactly running to line up behind him at first, but Shaw's slowly 
winning them over. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all excited about having Lisa as a coach," halfback Ingrid Evans said. 
"At first, I think we all compared him to her. We were a little skeptical, but 
as time went on, we've come to respect his knowledge of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, a graduate of La Habra High School who still attends classes at Irvine, 
is 12 units shy of his degree in social ecology and talks about someday having 
a job on Wall Street. But he loves coaching and can't think of anything he 
would rather do at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Before his current assignment, Shaw's head coaching experience was limited to 
guiding a number of youth teams and high school teams. Most recently, he 
coached the junior varsity at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw inherited 18 players at Irvine, but plans on doing some serious roster 
revamping, if given the chance. He was hired on an interim basis and Irvine 
athletic administration officials will review his status after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're not producing on a Division I level," Shaw said. "We need to 
add some top-quality recruits to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he was scampering off to his next class, then he would be scouting a game 
at Orange Coast before hurrying back for practice, which he had to end in time 
to plan a fraternity function. 
</P>
<P>
You can't be too young for this job. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's water polo team, which won four consecutive games and the championship 
of the Air Force tournament, is ranked second in the country in the latest 
American Water Polo Coaches Assn. poll. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 California and Irvine both have 9-1 records. The Anteaters' lost to Cal, 
9-5, during the UCI/Toshiba tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine senior Tom Warde, from Marina High, scored his 200th career goal during 
the Air Force tournament. Warde leads the team with 29 goals this season and 
has 205 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brian McCloskey, a sophomore forward from Sunny Hills, has transferred to 
Loyola Marymount. He will be eligible to play for LMU in 1990-91. McCloskey 
averaged three points and 1.9 rebounds in 17 games as a freshman at Irvine. . . 
. Steve Clark and Mark Henry have been named assistant men's tennis coaches. 
Clark, an Irvine assistant in 1986-87, was head coach at Chapman College last 
season and led the Panthers to a No. 4 national ranking. Henry has been head 
coach at Whittier College the past two seasons. The Anteaters were 25-7 last 
season and ranked No. 4 in the nation. . . . Senior Trevor Kronemann, the No. 
10-ranked singles player in the nation, received an automatic bid to the Volvo 
Tennis Collegiate Championships, Oct. 19-22 in Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Women's soccer Coach Steve Shaw: "As a player, you'd always hear the coach say 
how busy he was and you'd think, 'Just how busy can he really be? What's he got 
to do?' Now, after a few weeks of planning workouts, taking care of everybody's 
paper work, finalizing the schedule, arranging practice time and scouting JC 
and high school games, I realize it's a lot more work than I thought." . . . 
The men's golf team opens its season on Friday in Las Cruces, N.M.

UEBERROTH GROUP LINKS AIRLINE SALE, UNION CONCESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach investment group headed by J. Thomas Talbot and former major 
league baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth said Wednesday that it will not 
buy troubled Hawaiian Airlines as planned unless it gets hefty concessions from 
the airline's unions. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ueberroth group 
said it is seeking a three-year wage freeze from the unions and changes in work 
rules that would increase productivity by 30%. The Ueberroth group told the SEC 
that it must obtain the concessions, worth an estimated $6 million over three 
to five years, by Oct. 5 to complete the Hawaiian Air transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group last month agreed to pay $22 a share, or about $22 million, 
to obtain a majority stake in HAL Inc., the airline's parent firm. However, it 
is not clear whether the group will try to acquire the entire company, which is 
20% owned by a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Ueberroth group also told the SEC that it expects to place "substantial 
additional indebtedness" on Hawaiian Air as a result of the transaction. The 
borrowed money would be used for working capital and equipment, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ueberroth group said it plans to replace the corporate 
officers of HAL Inc. and some of the airline's senior managers. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Talbot refused to discuss negotiations with 
the airline's five labor unions, saying the talks were confidential. Spokesmen 
for the Airline Pilots Assn. and the Assn. of Flight Attendants, however, said 
talks had been productive and that they were hopeful an agreement would be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the pilots and the flight attendants, the Ueberroth group is 
negotiating with the International Assn. of Machinists, which represents 
mechanics and two smaller union groups that represent dispatchers and other 
communications workers. Talbot said about 83% of the airline's 3,000 employees 
are members of unions. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are unlikely to hold up the Hawaiian Air acquisition, said 
Daniel A. Hersch, aviation industry analyst with the Los Angeles investment 
firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. If the unions do not strike a deal with 
Talbot and Ueberroth, he said, members who work for Hawaiian are likely to be 
looking for new jobs, because the airline's survival hinges on a sale or some 
other deal that will result in a sizable infusion of cash. And any deal is 
going to depend on union concessions. 
</P>
<P>
HAL has reported losses of $30.6 million in the past 2 1/2 years and in June 
had a negative net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- of $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"At least Talbot and Ueberroth aren't asking for wage cuts but for a wage 
freeze and changes in work rules to get more work for the same buck," Hersch 
said. "That is a fair request because that company needs to improve its cost 
structure" to stop its losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all they are doing is trying to force labor to come to terms," he 
said. Filing a report of stalemated talks with the SEC, Hersch said, "is just a 
negotiating tactic." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawaiian Airlines deal is the second attempt this year by Talbot and 
Ueberroth to acquire an airline. The two headed an investment consortium that 
bid on bankrupt and strike-bound Eastern airlines in April.

RALLY FOILED; DOLLAR CONTINUES TO TAKE IT ON THE CHIN

<P>
Central banks sold dollars for a third straight day Wednesday, pushing the 
currency lower after an agreement last weekend that it had risen too much in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The losses left the dollar 4% lower against the West German mark and Japanese 
yen than it was late last week, back to its levels of late July and early 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The central banks squashed a rally attempt at mid-morning in New York. Still, 
the slight rebound in the dollar signaled to some traders that the official 
bankers had won the battle against the $300-billion-a-day currency market, but 
not yet the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Do they want it to get off the mat or do they want to kick it while it's down? 
Assuming they're playing a serious game, I think you'd go for the kidneys now 
rather than later," said Charles Taylor, an international economist at 
Prudential-Bache Securities in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Sales 
</P>
<P>
A strong dollar tends to swell the U.S. trade deficit by making imports cheap 
and pushing up the price of American goods in foreign markets. At a meeting in 
Washington, finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed 
Saturday that the dollar's rise was "inconsistent with longer run economic 
fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the frequency of sales rather than their size was pushing down the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar, which 
often moves in tandem with the U.S. dollar, and the British pound, which was 
weighed down by a worse-than-expected trade deficit report. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6155 from $1.6215 late Tuesday. In New 
York, the pound fell to $1.6167 from $1.6190. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.45 Japanese yen to a closing 141.35 yen. Later, in 
London, it dropped further to 139.45 yen. It was quoted at 140.32 yen in late 
New York trading, down from 142.35 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Tuesday's rates, 
included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8918; 1.6305 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.6415; 1.1771 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1756; 6.3655 French francs, 
down from 6.4110, and 1,361.7 Italian lire, down from 1,366.9. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Tuesday's rates, included: 
1.8830 West German marks, down from 1.8885; 1.6305 Swiss francs, down from 
1.6390; 6.3485 French francs, down from 6.3990; 2.1215 Dutch guilders, down 
from 2.1480; 1,359.50 Italian lire, down from 1,377.00, and 1.1770 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.1750. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion edged higher in active European trading. In London, the metal rose 
to a late bid of $368 an ounce from $367.75 bid late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silver Falls 
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, Switzerland, gold also rose to a late bid of $368 from $367.75 bid 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at a bid of $369.92. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $367.60 from $368.50. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold 
was bid at $366.20, down from $367.30 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.28 an ounce, down from $5.31 
bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell 
to $5.245 from $5.263 on Tuesday.

TRIAL OF FORMER OWNERS NEARING CLIMAX; 
</P>
<P>
RAMONA ALWAYS A FRAUD TARGET, JURY TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first criminal trial involving owners of a failed Southern California 
thrift, the prosecution told jurors Wednesday that the former top officials of 
Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in Orange were engaged in deception and fraud "right 
from the get-go." 
</P>
<P>
"This was a federally insured savings and loan institution. We are not talking 
about some piggy bank or some toy," Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein 
said during closing arguments in the 11-week-old trial in U.S. District Court 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona collapsed in September, 1986, and subsequently required a $65.5-million 
federal bailout of depositors. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Molinaro and Donald P. Mangano Sr. each face more than 30 charges, 
including bank fraud and conspiracy, in connection with a Palm Springs real 
estate deal that prosecutors allege led to the thrift's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano's attorney, Robert S. Horwitz, began his closing arguments by 
questioning the veracity of some of the people who testified for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe a number of key government witnesses did not keep that promise to 
you (the jury) to tell the truth," Horwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out what he said were numerous inconsistencies in testimony, 
including talk about Mangano's profit from the real estate deal. Horwitz 
labeled some of the testimony "so much rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
Mangano, a real estate developer, and Molinaro, a former carpet salesman, 
bought Ramona in April, 1984, and spent about $25 million, or a quarter of the 
thrift's assets, building Cherokee Village condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which the government alleges was designed to enrich the two men 
rather than Ramona, was a failure. Only seven of Cherokee Village's 180 units 
had been sold by the summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Zipperstein said Wednesday that Molinaro and Mangano dreamed up a complicated 
scheme to sell Ramona before the thrift became insolvent and Cherokee Village 
went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
The two men set up four dummy corporations. Ramona then recorded a sale of the 
Cherokee Village resort to three of those corporations for a $30,000 paper 
profit per residential unit. Mangano then had the stock in those corporations 
transferred to him. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the sale was done to make Ramona, which recorded a 
$4-million profit on the deal, look healthier to a potential buyer and to 
forestall a takeover by regulators. Molinaro took a $2-million dividend from 
Ramona around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Once the two men found a buyer, they allegedly transferred the liability of 
Cherokee Village back to Ramona disguised as a land acquisition of 23 acres in 
Palm Springs. No mention was made of Cherokee Village. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense said the government's allegations were unfounded. Horwitz said 
the dummy corporations were set up for tax reasons and because Mangano wanted 
to protect his credit worthiness in the event Cherokee Village failed. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz said plenty of people knew about the transaction, including one of the 
thrift's attorneys and an insurance representative. He said the $30,000 profit 
that was booked per unit was done without Mangano's authorization and was an 
accounting error. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partners' Net Worth 
</P>
<P>
The defense added that each man had a net worth sufficient to cover debts 
associated with Ramona. Molinaro had a net worth of $11.8 million at the time 
of Ramona's collapse; Mangano $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Molinaro -- sole owner and operator of Ramona at the time of its 
collapse -- faces a maximum prison sentence of 165 years and $8.3 million in 
fines; Mangano could receive a 155-year setence and $7.8 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has filed a civil lawsuit seeking 
more than $65 million in damages from Molinaro and Mangano, alleging that the 
two men began pilfering from the thrift almost as soon as they bought it. The 
civil case is not expected to go to court until at least December. 
</P>
<P>
The current proceedings are scheduled to continue today with closing arguments 
by Molinaro's attorney.

Dense-Pac Microsystems Inc. reported a net loss for the second quarter ended 
Aug. 26 of $387,911, compared with net income of $110,190 for the same period 
last year. Sales for the quarter rose 20%, to $1.8 million from $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
James Turner, chairman and chief executive, said the loss was due to an 
inability to ship several large orders and lower profit margins due to supplier 
problems and the worldwide shortage of memory chips. There were also increased 
general and administrative expenses in connection with terminated merger 
discussions with another company and a settlement charge of $92,000 from a 
Chapter 11 reorganization payable from 1985.

FLUOR TO BUILD COAL POWER PLANTS; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE FIRM FORMS JOINT VENTURE WITH N. CAROLINA UTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a venture expected to generate $1 billion in sales in three to five years, 
Fluor Corp. announced Wednesday that it is joining with a North Carolina 
utility to build coal-fired power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Daniel Corp., the chief operating affiliate of the Irvine-based heavy 
engineering and construction firm, said it has formed an equal joint venture 
with Duke Power Co. of Charlotte, N.C., to design and build coal plants for 
public utilities and other customers. 
</P>
<P>
The new firm, with headquarters in Charlotte, will combine the existing coal 
generation resources of the two firms and will initially employ about 200 
people, Fluor President Leslie G. McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Duke/Fluor Daniel, the company aims to combine Duke's expertise in 
design and plant operations with the heavy engineering and marketing resources 
of Fluor Daniel. McCraw said the firms have each agreed to contribute about 
$100 million of existing contracts to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Parks Cobb, executive vice president of Duke/Fluor, said the company will bid 
on contracts for construction of new coal-fired power plants and cogeneration 
facilities, and for the upgrading of existing coal plants. He said the new 
company will initially have nine major projects contributed by the parent 
organizations, but he declined to identify all of them. 
</P>
<P>
The power industry will need significant additional capacity over the next 
several years, Cobb added. At least one-third of that new capacity is expected 
to be in the form of coal-fired plants. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture encompasses most of the resources of Duke Engineering &amp; 
Services, the 7-year-old contracting subsidiary of the Duke Power, a regulated 
electric utility. About 20% of Duke Engineering's operations -- involving 
nuclear and hydroelectric power projects -- will remain outside the joint 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most utilities, Duke Power designs and builds its own power plants. Duke 
Engineering was originally set up to market the company's expertise in that 
area, Parks said. The firm's strength lies in its knowledge of plant design, 
engineering and operations. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, which had revenues of $5.1 billion last year and is the largest public 
company in the county, will bring its heavy construction, engineering and 
marketing expertise to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw said that even though Fluor Daniel offers many of the capabilities that 
the joint venture will offer, the link with Duke will give it far more 
credibility in selling turnkey, coal-fired plants to utilities and industrial 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"As a contractor, we want to be able to offer cradle-to-grave service, 
including plant location, financing, construction, maintenance and operations," 
McCraw said. "We can now offer that with much more confidence than before." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside the Joint Venture 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Daniel's operations not involving coal power will remain outside the 
joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor and Duke have worked together on several projects, according to the two 
officials, and Fluor built the one Duke power plant that the North Carolina 
company did not build itself. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor also has extensive coal-mining interests, which produced revenues of $784 
million last year. But McCraw said the new venture simply represented a better 
way to serve the coal-burning power plant market, rather than an intensified 
commitment to coal as an energy source. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for power-generating capacity has been soft for much of the decade, 
but it is expected to pick up steam soon. Fluor's power division had an order 
backlog of $756 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of coal-fired plants are also expected to benefit from recent advances in 
so-called "clean coal" technology, which produces far less pollution than 
traditional plants. "The projects we are involved in are, and will be, designed 
to be environmentally sensitive without sacrificing reliability or efficiency," 
Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retrofitting Existing Plants 
</P>
<P>
Besides building new plants, the company will be involved in retrofitting 
existing coal-burning plants to comply with new clean-air regulations and 
building so-called cogeneration plants, which produce both steam and 
electricity for industrial facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Duke/Fluor Daniel hopes to best its competition by offering innovative 
financing packages and complete operations and maintenance services. In the 
past, both companies offered such services by joining forces with other 
companies project by project.

'SOUL MATE' FIGHTS TO FREE SUSPECT; 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSED PSYCHIC SAYS SHE'S IN LOVE WITH ALLEGED RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY DORSEY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hailey Otis loves Frederick Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
She describes the feeling as a compulsion that overtook her this summer after 
Merrill escaped from a Toronto jail. 
</P>
<P>
As his life was dramatically reconstructed for national television audiences, 
and as newspapers reported his escape, Otis came to believe that she and 
Merrill were soul mates: She, an unemployed Toronto free-lance artist; he, an 
alleged rapist. 
</P>
<P>
"I would watch the proceedings every night on television," she said. "I knew 
our destinies would meet." 
</P>
<P>
Margo Luhtanen, a friend of Otis in Toronto, remembers the day in the city's 
central park when a woman asked them if they had seen the police. Officers 
carrying assault rifles had run shoulder-to-shoulder through the park, hoping 
to flush out an escaped criminal. 
</P>
<P>
"They're looking for Fred Merrill," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooh," Luhtanen said. "Frederick Merrill." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Psychic Experiences' 
</P>
<P>
During the days when Merrill was eluding the police, Otis said, she turned to a 
map at home, advising the man she had never met about which course to take. "Go 
this way," she would say. "Go this way." 
</P>
<P>
Luhtanen, a Toronto social worker, said she wasn't particularly surprised at 
her friend's sudden interest. "She tends to have this sixth sense. She often 
has these psychic experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Otis began writing to Merrill in jail. She called his 82-year-old mother in 
Tolland, Conn., and offered to help. Otis did not believe that Gladys Merrill's 
son was guilty of any sexual assaults. Not in Toronto, where he had been 
charged with forcing a 15-year-old girl to perform oral sex, or in Connecticut, 
where he had been charged with sexually assaulting a woman in South Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Otis showed up in a Toronto courtroom where Merrill was scheduled to 
appear. When she saw him, she mouthed the words: "Please call me tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The news media began to take an interest in Otis, a platinum blonde with blue 
eyes. They photographed her and wrote about her. They interviewed her on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
The media publicized her efforts to gain entrance to the jail. And after 
talking to lawyers and jailers and encouraging Merrill by mail, Otis was able 
to visit him for the first time in Toronto July 14. He welcomed her and her 
offers of help. 
</P>
<P>
Otis then came to believe that his lawyer, David Newman, was not doing a good 
job. She told Merrill she wanted to intervene. "I said, 'Fred, game over for 
Mr. Newman,' " she recalled. Not long afterward, another lawyer in Toronto, 
Daniel Brodsky, received a call from Otis, and agreed to represent Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Persuasive' 
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual," Brodsky said. "She's very persuasive and has convinced people 
at the detention center where's he's been held that she is looking out for his 
best interests. And she has received some publicity, too. In fact, one of her 
most effective vehicles to gaining access to Merrill has been through the 
media." 
</P>
<P>
A second lawyer in Toronto, Edmund Schofield, heard from Otis, too. Now, 
Schofield is representing Merrill in extradition proceedings with authorities 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Otis flew to Connecticut to begin her own investigation to prove 
Merrill's innocence. His lawyers said they were interested in whatever she 
might find. They were not able to explain her unusual interest in the case, 
however.

Otis stayed with Merrill's mother in Tolland. She slept in his bedroom and wore 
his prison clothes, from a previous conviction, as pajamas. She gathered his 
memoirs, searched through telephone books for sources, spoke to David Gold, 
Merrill's lawyer in Hartford, Conn., scanned family photographs and conducted 
interviews with reporters who competed for her time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite a Media Event' 
</P>
<P>
Gold said he has had cases before in which women have become enamored of 
prisoners and came to the courtroom to see his clients. But he's never seen 
someone as energetic as Otis has been. "She was quite a media event," he said.

SEX REVOLUTION -- IT MAY NEVER HAVE HAPPENED

Remember the "Sexual Revolution?" 
</P>
<P>
According to the interpreters of the "latest major study" of American sexual 
habits, appetites and morality, it never took place. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. If the folks at the Kinsey Institute are correct -- yes, that 
Kinsey Institute -- the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s was all media hype. 
Americans, insist the Kinseyites, are major-league sexual conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
After getting over one's initial shock and disbelief, one is inclined to 
believe this newly released data simply because it comes from the Kinsey 
Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University, 
the keeper of the flame lighted by Alfred Kinsey, who in the late 1940s 
produced the seminal work on American sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misusing the Findings 
</P>
<P>
After all, whenever one throws around statistics regarding the number of times 
a week the "average" couple have sexual intercourse, or the percentage of 
homosexuals in the population, one is misusing Alfred Kinsey's findings. 
</P>
<P>
The name Kinsey is a creditable one, but these findings are, nonetheless, 
pretty startling. According to the researchers: 
</P>
<P>
* Of the 3,000 adults sampled, 82% disapproved of teen-age girls having 
premarital sex, while 73% disapproved of such behavior by teen-age boys. (Boys 
will be boys?). 
</P>
<P>
* If the first finding doesn't surprise you, consider this: 70% disapproved of 
adult women engaging in premarital sex, and 65% said that such behavior on the 
part of adult men was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
* Eighty-seven percent said that extramarital sex is "always wrong" or "almost 
always wrong," which certainly flies in the face of surveys that show almost 
half of all women and three-quarters of all men stray at one point or another. 
(Granted, the Kinsey surveyors asked whether the behavior was wrong, not 
whether the respondents engaged in the behavior.) 
</P>
<P>
* And when it comes to homophobia, the respondents were in rare form: 88% 
disapprove of homosexual relations between people who don't love each other, 
and 79% said homosexual sex is wrong even if the two persons involved do love 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
Where were these people during the "Summer of Love"? Weren't they at Woodstock? 
Didn't they ever go to Plato's Retreat? Didn't they ever make love instead of 
war? Who was consuming all those birth control pills, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believing the Data 
</P>
<P>
That's hard to say. If the Kinsey data is to be believed, the '60s may never 
have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a reason to disregard the data: It may have been recently released, 
but it was collected 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. This "latest" study is based on data gathered in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Associated Press, Eugene E. Levitt, a psychologist at 
the Indiana University School of Medicine and one of the survey's authors, said 
the findings show that "the number of women jumping in and out of bed at random 
is exaggerated, I think, just as the number of homosexuals in the population 
has been exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
And survey editor Hubert J. O'Gorman of Wesleyan University said in his 
introduction that "these data will be indispensable to any attempt to describe 
the effects of AIDS on American sexual morality and behavior." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1970 Information 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. What the data tells us is how 3,000 adult respondents said they 
were behaving in 1970, as they watched in horror while their college- and 
teen-age children were swept up in the Sexual Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The data doesn't tell us a thing about how to deal with AIDS because it doesn't 
tell us a thing about sexual behavior today. Nor does it even suggest that the 
Sexual Revolution never took place. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, what the data suggests is what we already knew from the work of Alfred 
Kinsey -- that the parents of the Sexual Revolutionaries were themselves sexual 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, should tell us two things: 
</P>
<P>
Like all other revolutionaries, those whose rebellions are sexual in nature 
have to have an established order to rebel against; And, what is even more 
important, consider not only the source of data, but when it was gathered as 
well.

SOME NIGHTMARES LAST LONGER THAN MOST THINGS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ERLICH, The Guardian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a kid at a Los Angeles elementary school I used to wonder why our 
frame classrooms were called temporary structures. Then I experienced my first 
earthquake and I knew. But it never dawned on me how pragmatic this really was, 
something destined to be the city's future persona. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the American election I embarked on an annual visit to my 
hometown buoyed by the knowledge of being more qualified than Dan Quayle to be 
vice president. My academic record and military exploits actually outshine his. 
Appropriately, I was greeted by a 5.1-strength earthquake, my fourth to date, 
three hours after landing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Junk Food City 
</P>
<P>
Coming back to your roots once or twice a year gives you a great perspective on 
things. In the case of L.A., one can see the first city of the junk food 
generation turning into a genuine junk food city, and junk toy city, readily 
disposable, biodegradable and totally reusable. A vast area seemingly void of 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
This is a fact which has not been overlooked by the oldest inhabitants of this 
land, who themselves had always been overlooked by the predominant middle-class 
culture -- which is as disposable and transient as most L.A. things. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the mushrooming Latino population that is taking fullest advantage of 
the changing, sprawling megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of this invasion, I cannot help thinking of Bob Dylan's words sung 
out more than 23 years ago, "The loser now is later to win." However, contrary 
to the view of history in some American school books, California, Texas and 
other parts of the Southwest were originally ripped off the Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mexicans are taking it back, and without a shot being fired by the 
declining non-Latino majority. This is partly because Latinos are shooting at 
each other so much, multiple murders are now a weekly occurrence. With a 
dramatic growth in the city's underclass, spurred by the massive influx of 
illegal immigrants, L.A. crime has soared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Always Move On 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the affluent population hopes that this carnage will cull 
the gang members sufficiently to maintain the status quo. Failing this, 
middle-class L.A. has its ultimate weapon . . . "moving" . . . to neighborhoods 
whose financial barriers, they hope, will exclude the Latinos and the now 
almost forgotten blacks. 
</P>
<P>
However, if that does not work, "rent-a-cop" comes to the rescue, via a score 
of private security firms springing up all over, offering the same thing as Al 
Capone -- protection. But this time it is legit; the famed LAPD cannot cope 
with all the ethnic crime in the city. 
</P>
<P>
They're finally earning their money in the slum areas, and avoiding the 
affluent. This absence, however, has left the people in places like Pacific 
Palisades edgy enough to hire entire armed police departments. Their brief is 
to patrol, keep order and watch for suspicious people. And one guess who those 
happen to be. If there is to be trouble the people of Reagan's old neighborhood 
are ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite Mexican restaurant is El Coyote in L.A.'s old Jewish area, Fairfax. 
I was shocked recently to see two armed guards at the entrance. "We take a lot 
of money in here," the manager said in a blase tone. The same day two people 
were gunned down at the rear of the enormous and still elegant Ambassador 
Hotel. The police said it was a gang shooting. Shortly afterwards it was 
announced that this once proud city landmark was closing. 
</P>
<P>
The two facts that have struck me in L.A. in the past few years is how fast the 
Spanish language is increasing in importance and how equally fast the city's 
rents are rising, facts that appear to be related. A decent one-bedroom flat in 
a reasonably safe neighborhood runs to about $800 per month now. 
</P>
<P>
The most depressing thing is the apparent impermanence of L.A. Once described 
as a never-ending specter of hamburger stands and gas stations, it could be 
Prince Charles' worst architectural nightmare. However, mercifully, some 
nightmares last longer than buildings in L.A. It seems that buildings are 
coming down as fast as new ones are going up. Seven years is an average life 
for some. 
</P>
<P>
And 10 years is getting into listed building territory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressed on Two Sides 
</P>
<P>
In my old San Fernando Valley stomping ground, new buildings are torn down as 
soon as a more profitable use for the land is found. That is because in a city 
with an enormous and wealthy middle class being pressed on two sides by growing 
poverty and an underclass, land and security are what matters, not buildings. 
Residents here pay anything as long as they feel safe and relieved of not 
having to see the underclass close to -- an aspect of apartment hunting not 
lost on advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
The latest target for land speculators is generally regarded as part of the 
city's cultural heritage . . . gas stations. With gas selling for about $1 a 
gallon those famous forecourts may soon be a thing of the past. That is because 
another Californian invention, the mini-shopping center, is more profitable 
than the gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
Americans tend to panic easily. The Arab terrorist threat of three years ago is 
closely related to communities hiring private police forces, even though white 
communities have yet to be attacked by Latino or black gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate manifestation of this insulation is the fully enclosed and very 
secure shopping mall, which oddly has taken root in an area of the world where 
sunshine and hot weather are the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Most of what Americans see on television, including their perception of the 
world around them, has its beginnings in a city where many people seldom take a 
walk down a street or meet anyone other than people they know. 
</P>
<P>
An expatriate Briton I met out there asked me if I ever got homesick for my 
roots? I replied, "No, I have no roots. The Los Angeles I grew up in no longer 
exists." 
</P>
<P>
The old Mexican flavor of L.A., discarded by the new Anglo majority at the turn 
of the century, is making a comeback at a time when it is doubtful whether many 
non-Latinos will notice it. Most people will be too busy watching TV, locked in 
their secure apartments, venturing out only in their cars for a trip to a 
market a few hundred yards down the road, or to the beach several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike New York, where the middle class is forced to witness a daily spectacle 
of the human condition, L.A. does not make residents see anything they do not 
wish to see.

POP MUSIC REVIEW;

<P>
FOR FORMER EAGLE DON HENLEY, THERE'S JUST NO LOOKING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a year when lots of classic rock artists are wowing crowds by doing their 
great old songs, Don Henley has a better idea. In his first tour in four years, 
the former Eagle is treating audiences to some outstanding new songs. 
</P>
<P>
Though he co-wrote some of the finest songs of the rock era during his Eagles 
period, Henley waited until nearly an hour into his set Tuesday night at the 
Universal Amphitheatre to perform any of those '70s numbers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Henley is going out of his way to snub his Eagles legacy by 
stressing the present. The singer-songwriter included only one song (the 
snarling "Dirty Laundry") from his highly regarded 1982 solo album. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on material from his last two albums cost him some early response 
from the near-capacity crowd -- a point he noted midway through the show, when 
he made a passing remark about the traditional opening-night reserve of "those 
industry audiences" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All it took, however, to draw robust cheers from the fans was the slightest 
hint that he was going to do some of the oldies. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be in a group," he said teasingly -- and the crowd erupted with 
applause at the first notes of the Grammy-winning "Hotel California." 
</P>
<P>
But Henley included only two more Eagles compositions -- the biting "Life in 
the Fast Lane" and delicate "Desperado" -- in the rest of the nearly two-hour 
show. 
</P>
<P>
If Henley sacrificed some early audience response in sticking to the new 
material, the decision fueled his show with an immediacy and drive that makes 
his tour arguably the most rewarding of the year by an American pop-rock 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Henley's strength is his complexity. He understands life's 
contradictions and he works them into his songs with an accessibility that has 
characterized his work with the Eagles and on his own. His best tunes speak of 
social and personal challenges with equal cynicism and innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm brave enough to be crazy, strong enough to be weak," he says in "I Will 
Not Go Quietly," a song (co-written by Danny Kortchmar) from his new album "The 
End of the Innocence" that seems to summarize Henley's attitude about music and 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The contradictions also surface on stage. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who once subscribed to a no-frills, anti-show-biz stance with the 
Eagles, he is certainly style-conscious now. He dresses in a self-consciously 
fashionable (baggy) suit and wears his hair fashionably long (complete with 
ponytail). His nine musicians dress smartly enough (the female bassist and 
three backup singers in minidresses, the men in suits) for them to play at a 
country-club wedding. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a tad of humor in all this -- but it might also be Henley's desire 
to express a flashier side of himself that was bottled up all those years 
behind the drums in the old band. (He now spends his time on stage up front, 
only returning to the drums for two Eagles songs.) 
</P>
<P>
Henley's talk between songs is equally outgoing. You don't know whether he's 
going into a speech or a song each time he approaches the microphone. Just as 
he can sometimes be polemical in his lyrics, he can't resist taking quick shots 
at big targets (he cited Exxon and the federal government when introducing a 
song decrying what he feels is a general lack of accountability in society 
today). 
</P>
<P>
In his music, however, Henley speaks with an artful and sophisticated edge that 
can be equally effective on biting themes ("If Dirt Were Dollars," a slap at 
both tabloid mentality and flag-waving politicians) and disarming tales of 
romance that seem uncommonly personal. His best songs bring together both the 
personal and the social. 
</P>
<P>
Why should Henley do an old Eagles song about the search for lost values when 
he comes up with new songs as moving as "The End of the Innocence"? Sample 
lyrics from the song, co-written by Bruce Hornsby: "Who knows how long this 
will last/Now, we've come so far, so fast/But somewhere back there in the 
dust/That same small town in each of us." 
</P>
<P>
The band (which combines the Eagles' old guitar emphasis with more contemporary 
synthesizer touches) plays with aggression and spark, punctuating the tender 
moments in his music as well as the blistering ones. The volume is at a 
chest-thumping level that is no concession to any desire for nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Henley's tour -- featuring the recently reviewed Edie Brickell &amp; the New 
Bohemians as the opening act -- continues Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
then Saturday at the Santa Barbara County Bowl and Sunday at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henley and Edie Brickell &amp; the New Bohemians play Sunday at 7:30 p.m. 
at the Pacific Amphitheatre, 100 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $17.50 to 
$24.50. Parking: $4. Information: (714) 634-1300.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: DEVO: A LITTLE LESS THAN IT ONCE WAS, BUT STILL SOME 
ROLLICKING GOOD FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Devo emerged in 1978, it was a rock band aspiring to be a multimedia 
performance concept, tied together by the group's jaundiced theory that the 
human race is a downhill event. 
</P>
<P>
True to its own theory of devolution, Devo has mutated into something less than 
it once was. Instead of band-as-high-concept, Devo, which has slid in 
popularity since its peak around 1980-81, is now band-as-cozy-club: snide 
Mouseketeers who roll their eyes at innocence; cynical Boy Scouts who laugh at 
the idea that anything on two feet can be honest and true. 
</P>
<P>
The Devo club has its own uniform and insignia, its own hand signs, totems and 
mottoes. Most of them were reliably displayed Tuesday night at the Coach House 
in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, co-founders Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale have tried, in 
interviews, to make some serious claims that this combination of half-baked 
theory and highly developed iconography adds up to Devo's own special brand of 
social commentary. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Devo's social commentary carries about as much weight as Mad 
Magazine's. It's hard to see what's so insightful about depicting the human 
enterprise as an exercise in idiocy. Of course mankind is a mockery of itself. 
Any species in which masses of individuals could follow a Hitler, a Stalin, a 
Pol Pot (still alive and raring to give us "The Killing Fields, Part II") is 
almost beneath contempt. 
</P>
<P>
But good satire derives its bite from the idea that mankind could and should do 
better. A strong pop satirist like Randy Newman manages to convey a moral 
vision of humanity's potential for better things, and a sorrow for its 
shortcomings, even as he savages his satiric targets. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the resources of story, character and dialogue that the likes of 
Newman, Warren Zevon and Ray Davies of the Kinks bring to their satiric songs, 
Devo never has elevated its mocking concept into a body of pop-satiric work 
that deserves to be taken seriously. But the nice thing about Devo's show at 
the Coach House was that, unlike those interviews, it didn't ask to be taken 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Devo didn't try to preach its theory, or to draw ponderous links to current 
events that bear out the march of devolution. Instead, it ran through familiar 
songs and rituals in an energetic spirit of fun that had the Devo club members 
in the full house pogoing and roaring their approval. (Unlike the gloomy 
British school of pop pessimists, Devo never lets humanity's dismal condition 
spoil a good time.) Devo also took care of a bit of new business, debuting two 
numbers from an album-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
As surely as a Shriners parade features fezzes and little scooters, a Devo show 
trots out an array of symbols and icons that define the experience. 
</P>
<P>
There was the screening of Devo videos, in homage to the band's position as an 
early exploiter of rock video. 
</P>
<P>
There were the matching technicians' uniforms worn by all five band members, an 
ironic commentary on the idea that technology will be our savior. 
</P>
<P>
There was Mothersbaugh, always a visually captivating front man, miming the 
lyrics with antic, herky-jerky movements. 
</P>
<P>
There were the absurdist slogans and catchwords, and the red flower pot hats 
worn during the encore. 
</P>
<P>
Devo was canny enough not to turn the show into a replay of its highly 
successful previous run of nine performances at the Coach House last December 
and January. The band also avoided duplicating its recent live album, "Now It 
Can Be Told," which largely reproduces the set Devo played here the last time 
through. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to faithful renditions of such favorites as "Gates of Steel," "Girl 
U Want," "Whip It" and "Satisfaction," all available on the live album, Devo 
dipped deeper into its repertoire and came up with such strong numbers as "Mr. 
DNA," "Mongoloid" and "Come Back Jonee." 
</P>
<P>
Devo also abandoned the flawed acoustic ballad reading of "Jocko Homo" that 
opens the live album. Instead, it delivered its keynote song as a metallic, 
synthesized hard-pounder. Mothersbaugh roamed the room with his wireless 
microphone, turning the song into a Devo Club bonding ritual as he screamed the 
song's question, "Are we not men?" and let fan after fan provide the 
article-of-faith answer, "We are Devo!" Devo was in hard-rocking form 
throughout, de-emphasizing the techno-dance music of its tepid 1988 studio 
album, "Total Devo," in favor of songs with heavy but catchy rock riffs. 
</P>
<P>
The new songs, paired together at mid-set, reflected a revived interest in rock 
and an unchanged conviction that humanity is absurd. "Post Post-Modern Man" 
appropriated the rhythmic spine of Wilson Pickett's "Funky Broadway" for a wry 
portrayal of a fellow trying to get by without any modern conveniences, 
apparently in a post-Armageddon world. "A Change Is Gonna Come" (not the Sam 
Cooke classic) sounded, on first hearing, like a bannering of future headlines 
from the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientists prove we were never here" sounded like the most quintessentially 
Devo of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Devo plays again at the Coach House on Monday, and at Bogart's in Long Beach on 
Tuesday. For information, call the Coach House at (714) 496-8930, or Bogart's 
at (213) 594-8975.

EX-COP HITS MARK WHEN DOING FUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS WILLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ex-Policeman Andy Summers' current music, all of it vocal-less, falls in the 
netherworld cracks somewhere between new age and jazz fusion. His latest album, 
"The Golden Wire," veers more toward the former, but his band's performance of 
the same songs Tuesday at the Strand in Redondo Beach, happy to say, had more 
of the spirit of the latter genre -- tougher, tenser, rockier, more stinging 
(no pun intended). 
</P>
<P>
The esteemed guitarist will be bringing his band to Orange County tonight with 
a headlining appearance at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
On the new record (his second instrumental release for the Private Music label 
after a brief, failed fling with a solo vocal rock career), Summers tends to 
opt for the "ambient" -- i.e., somnambulistic -- approach, just right for a 
wine-and-cheese party but not appropriate for a your-attention-please club 
showcase. 
</P>
<P>
Live, he's wisely put a lot more rock fire and kick into the erstwhile mellow 
music, partly by hiring an electronic percussionist and a very busy kit drummer 
to replace the tentative drum programming that is the album's sorriest feature. 
This was most evident on the LP's title song, which starts as an acoustic solo 
number and kicks into a syncopated band jumper; on record you hardly notice the 
shift, but in concert the dynamics came through. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, Summers' elixir suggests some kind of '90s lounge music, with 
lounge not necessarily used as a pejorative; the expansiveness and 
aggressiveness of the music seemed just right at times for the relaxed, open 
spaces of the Redondo Beach club. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist works with a wider palette now than he did with the Police, both 
in music styles (Tuesday's concert ran the gamut from Indian-influenced riffing 
to reggae) and guitar styles; he still favors those muddled, muffled riffs and 
plenty of delay and reverb but also working in some clearer, ringing tones 
along the way. His finest moments would come when, after spending minutes 
humbly and unassumedly establishing the melody, he would cut himself loose from 
it or go against its grain entirely. During one rocker he let fly some tremolo 
bar effects that seemed to be in some kind of wild aural 3-D. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the band -- expert players all -- was almost never encouraged to go with 
him on these excursions, and even Summers would quickly return from his 
dissonant flights of fancy to the basic structure of the song. Which isn't bad, 
but it makes one wonder whether Summers' talents might still not be best 
applied to fusion, the full risks of which he seems wary to take, than to good 
old vocal pop songs, in the context of which his brief off-kilter explosions 
have always sounded incendiary indeed.

FAMILY LIFE: A COUPON CLIPPER GETS LAST LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Worth has put my teeth on edge since I was a child. I could never 
understand what qualified her to be in the funny papers in the first place, she 
not being exactly in a league with the Far Side. 
</P>
<P>
I am not an avid Mary Worth reader. It's just that she has the same effect on 
me as freeway accidents: I don't want to look, but some perverse fascination 
forces me to. 
</P>
<P>
To her credit, though, she has never offended me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . . Until last week, when I caught her sneering at grocery coupon clippers, 
of which I am adamantly one. 
</P>
<P>
In the strip, Mrs. Worth is stunned and obviously appalled when a woman who 
drives a fancy car gathers up her cents-off coupons before heading to the 
market. Mary makes some pointed remarks to the woman and later about her. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, dear, these aren't food stamps, for goodness' sake. They're one of the 
few ways left for average Americans to trim their food bills. And if you don't 
want yours, send them to me. 
</P>
<P>
Let me ask you something, Mary. How often since Harry Truman left office have 
you paid 80 cents for a quart of Kraft mayonnaise or 99 cents for a pound of 
Folgers coffee? Or 60 cents for a six-pack of Coca-Cola or 2 cents for a box of 
Tide detergent? I made all of those buys within the past several weeks -- 
thanks to my local supermarket's practice of doubling the value of the coupons 
I clipped from the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Mary Worth isn't the only one who looks on me and my fellow coupon 
clippers as parsimonious pinheads. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Manufacturers Coupon Control Center in Clinton, Iowa, most 
coupons go unused -- by a wide margin. Of more than 200 billion distributed 
last year, 193 billion were discarded. But catch this: The 7 billion that were 
redeemed represented $3 billion in savings to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The potential, however, is nearly $50 billion, and that's a lot of tuition, 
cousin. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I'm not bubble-headed enough to run out and buy a product 
just because I can save a few cents on it. I'm quite selective, saving only 
those for items I normally use, particularly such staples as coffee, soft 
drinks, laundry detergent and pet food. 
</P>
<P>
Although I did hear of an altruistic woman who does buy couponed items for 
which she has no personal use. Health considerations don't allow her to eat 
certain foods, but she will buy them anyway -- to donate to a local food bank 
for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Because of coupons, the cost of doing the laundry for myself and my two boys is 
limited to what I pay for electricity and gas. Most detergent coupons say they 
are "good on any size," so I buy the small size, the one I can usually find on 
sale for about $1. Double a 50-cent coupon, Mary, and go figure. 
</P>
<P>
And when there's an especially good coupon in the paper, I'll often go out and 
buy extra copies, figuring that a 25-cent investment to save $8 is sensible 
economics. This past summer, one market had such a great deal on cases of soft 
drinks that I picked up 20 copies of the paper and 20 cases of soft drinks 
(leading one of the boys to suggest that next I'll be building a bomb shelter). 
</P>
<P>
In the same edition of the paper was a zinger of a coupon for potato chips (9 
cents, rather than the normal $1.59) and, hey, I already had 20 copies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Storage sometimes presents a problem, but not for long. My very hospitable sons 
have many friends. 
</P>
<P>
What seemed to stick in Mrs. Worth's wicker basket was the fact that her friend 
was affluent and didn't need to be penny-pinching. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's one of the odd things about the whole coupon phenomenon, according 
to a poll conducted for the Food Marketing Institute by the Lou Harris 
organization. It found that the use of coupons clearly increases as household 
income goes up. 
</P>
<P>
And a U.S. Department of Agriculture report points out that those in our 
society who most need the savings -- the poor -- don't have access to coupons 
because they don't buy the newspapers and magazines that carry them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mary Worths of the world who don't use coupons are subsidizing 
those of us who do. 
</P>
<P>
So she has earned my gratitude, I suppose . . . along with a little free 
advice: Lighten up, Mary.

TWO COMIC-STRIP ARTISTS DISCUSS THE CRAFT THEY LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Kevin Fagan's newspaper cartoon strip, "Drabble," debuted in 1979, the 
then-22-year-old former Saddleback College student was billed as the nation's 
youngest syndicated cartoonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 33, the Mission Viejo resident recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of 
his popular cartoon, which appears in 220 newspapers. The strip's hero is 
Norman Drabble -- a shy, insecure and occasionally bumbling college student who 
lives at home with his parents, a younger brother and a pet duck named Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ferd Johnson's first solo cartoon strip, "Texas Slim," debuted in the 
Chicago Tribune, he too was billed as the youngest cartoonist in America. That 
was in 1925 when Johnson, now a Newport Beach resident, was a mere 19 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is for "Moon Mullins" that Johnson is best known. He was hired as 
assistant to the strip's originator, Frank Willard, two months after the 
strip's debut in 1923 and inherited the cartoon featuring a roughneck pool hall 
regular when Willard died in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 At 83, Johnson is still at it, turning out daily "Moon Mullins" cartoons, 
which still run in about 100 papers. It is considered one of America's handful 
of classic comic strips, and Johnson is, as he says with a touch of pride, "the 
oldest guy in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they live only 25 miles apart and were familiar with each other's 
work, Johnson and Fagan had never met. When Orange County Life called to set up 
a meeting between the two cartoonists, they were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit took place late one morning in Johnson's studio on the second floor 
of an office building on Coast Highway in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson moved into the tiny studio in 1968 and, judging by the looks of it, 
hasn't cleaned house since. Every corner of the room is cluttered with piles of 
original cartoon strips, old newspapers and magazines. (Smiling wryly, Johnson 
confesses, "I don't know what's underneath the first three layers.") 
</P>
<P>
 A narrow path on the threadbare "brown and dirt" carpet leads the way to two 
side-by-side vintage drawing tables. The one on the left, once owned by Frank 
Willard, is where Johnson spends three hours a day, seven days a week, drawing 
the daily strips. The one on the right is where Johnson's son, Tom, does the 
Sunday strips and helps draw the dailies. 
</P>
<P>
 For their visit, the soft-spoken Fagan -- wearing a polo shirt, sweat pants 
and jogging shoes -- sat at Tom's drawing table. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, his trademark straw hat set at a jaunty angle, sat behind his drawing 
board in a swivel chair with a pronounced squeak. He perched his feet on the 
edge of a metal wastebasket, and for the next hour, the two cartoonists talked 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Johnson: So, you're the youngest cartoonist in the business now. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Oh, I don't know about that. I don't think that's quite true anymore. I 
think "Calvin and Hobbes" (cartoonist Bill Watterson) has got a year on me, or 
something like that. I was for a little while anyway. . . . I brought you an 
original in case you collect such things. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, accepting an autographed "Drabble" strip: I'll have to give you one. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: I'd love one. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I like your stuff. You know, it took me years to get to liking it. 
But, hell, for the past four or five years, I think it's great. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Oh, I appreciate it. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: You've got an individual style, and you should never try to improve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan, laughing: I guess after you've been around for a while it's "style," but 
when you begin it's just "strange," you know. But it turns into "style." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: You're getting so you can draw real well. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Yeah, thanks. (laugh) I use rulers now. That helped. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: What's your studio look like? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: My studio's in my home, and we just moved to a bigger house because 
we're expecting our second child in a matter of weeks. So the home we moved to 
has a three-car garage, and my brother, who's a carpenter as a hobby, came down 
from the Bay Area, where he lives, and built a studio in my garage. So it's 
brand-new. We just got the carpeting laid and put up book cases. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I used to work at home until the syndicate told me to get an office. I 
don't know why -- maybe too many distractions (at home). . . . I like to meet 
people. It's like a family around here. You chew the rag, you might get a few 
ideas that way. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Well, I've always worked at home. And it was great until I got married, 
and then it started to get a little crowded in there. There were a lot of 
distractions, and then when the first baby came along, it really got to be kind 
of a pain. So that's when we decided to move. This studio I have now is great. 
It's got a big heavy door between me and the inside of the house (laugh), so 
you can't hear a lot. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Ferd was 17 when he moved to Chicago from a village in rural 
Pennsylvania to attend art school, where he was "discovered" by cartoonist 
Frank Willard. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: The owner of the school knew Willard and got him to teach a cartoon 
class up there. He did it for two weeks and couldn't take it anymore. Meantime, 
he saw all the (student) work, and he thought I had something, and he invited 
me up to the Tribune. . . . I stood around there for hours watching him work. 
He finally turned around and said, "Ferd, if you're going to hang around here 
all this time, I'm going to put you to work." So I got a job as assistant at 15 
bucks a week. I wrote home, and I said, "Don't send me anymore money. I've got 
it made." 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: At the time, the Tribune, under the leadership of co-owner and 
editor Capt. Joseph Patterson, was a cartoonist's mecca. Did you feel as though 
you were in exalted company? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I sure as hell did. The Tribune had a bunch of cartoonists there. They 
were the best in the country at the time, so if I got into trouble, I'd ask 
them. They were great to me: Chester Gould ("Dick Tracy") was one; Harold Gray 
-- "Orphan Annie"; Sydney Smith -- "The Gumps." Frank King -- "Gasoline Alley," 
was right next to us. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: How long did you and Willard and the other cartoonists all work 
together on the same floor? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Six, seven years I guess. But the guys couldn't get any work done down 
there. There were card games, shooting craps -- so they started working at home 
and then they started spreading out over the country. . . . A cartoonist can be 
wherever there is a mail box. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Johnson was Willard's assistant for 35 years, traveling around the 
country living in hotels, apartments and farm houses in such far-flung locales 
as Florida, Maine and Los Angeles. The strip ran in 350 newspapers at its peak 
of popularity in the '40s and '50s, and when Willard died in 1958, Johnson 
officially took it over. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: They put my name on it then. I had been doing it about 10 years before 
that because Willard had heart attacks and strokes and all that stuff. The 
minute my name went on that thing and his name went off, 25 papers dropped (the 
strip). That shows you that, although I had been doing it 10 years, the name 
means a lot. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: As cartoonists whose comic strips appear seven days a week, how do 
you meet the demand of having to constantly come up with ideas? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, laughing: Well, the bills come in. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: That's enough to get the adrenaline going. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Ferd, you've been working on "Moon Mullins" 66 years, and Kevin has 
been doing "Drabble" for 10 years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: He's just a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: You know, that's true in cartooning terms. If a television show runs 10 
years, it's had a great, long run. A 10-year-old comic strip is still a baby, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I think a comic strip -- a good one -- is good for 30 years before it 
starts going down. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Do you ever hit dry spells, times when the ideas have simply dried 
up? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Oh, yeah, but that kind of comes with the territory. Every once in a 
while I don't feel very funny, but you just have to bear down. A change of 
scenery helps me a lot: to get out of the house, out of the studio, and just go 
somewhere for the day. I'll just take a drive, and sometimes that will help. 
And I find that when I'm dry, as soon as I get one cartoon going then it kind 
of opens up the way for some more -- one idea leads to another. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: That's right. I mean, I go all week without an idea and sit down and 
in two hours you've got them all. That (coming up with ideas) is the hardest 
part of the job. The rest is easy, fun. It (the drawing of the strip) is like 
handwriting: You just go ahead and do it. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: I carry around a little binder-type thing, like a school note pad. I 
just take it with me to most places I go, and I just jot down things and come 
back and try to work it into a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: The characters in "Drabble" are members of a suburban family. "Moon 
Mullins" started in the 1920s with a boardinghouse setting in a city. How do 
you define your cast of characters now? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, laughing: I'll be damned if I know. When it started, Capt. Patterson 
wanted a tough man's strip, and he heard that Willard was pretty tough. Well, 
he found that out because Willard used to submit ideas. . . . He'd turn them in 
and the comic editor would turn them down, throw them in the wastepaper basket. 
A few weeks later, they'd come out in George McManus' strip, and so Willard 
went in and poked this guy (the comics editor) -- he knocked him out. Willard 
expected to get fired, but he didn't give a damn. Well, Patterson heard about 
this and figured he was the guy for this tough strip. Moon was named after 
"moonshine," of course. That was a big thing back then. Capt. Patterson named 
all the Tribune comics. He had ideas for them all. . . . He was so interested 
in comics he'd come around two or three times a week and chew the rag with us, 
suggest things, or call us up to his office. He was really a genius that way. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: The 1930s are considered the golden age of newspaper comics. Ferd, 
how do you view the '80s in terms of comic strips? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, laughing: It's great for young guys. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: In comparing the work of cartoonists in the '20s and '30s, there is 
a great difference in drawing styles. Today's style is much simpler. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Well, in the old days you were supposed to know how to draw to get a 
strip started. Nowadays, anything goes as long as it's readable. The ideas are 
the most important thing. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: The other thing is you had more space back then, too. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Six columns (wide). 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: And today the cartoons are shrunk so small, it doesn't allow a lot of 
room. I mean I don't have the talent to do what Ferd does. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: That's why your style is great for this. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: How do you describe the drawing style of today's cartoonists? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Simpler. I think (Charles) Schulz started this (with "Peanuts"). 
Everybody put thousands of lines in -- a lot of drawing. He came along and, 
well, you know what the characters are. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: He (Schulz) was able to just capture the essence of what they were with 
just a few lines. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Being able to draw is obviously a prerequisite to doing a comic 
strip, but how important is the ability to come up with funny ideas? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Ideas, by far, are the most important. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Does the ability to come up with humorous ideas just come natural to 
both of you? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: I think so. I don't know if you can train or teach someone to look at 
life in a strange perspective. . . . I've been drawing all my life just for the 
fun of it and always drawing goofy things -- it's like it's just kind of a 
natural thing. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Is it the same way with you, Ferd? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Ever since I was a kid I sketched. Frank King ("Gasoline Alley") told 
me, "If you want to learn how to draw, get a sketchbook. Go out and sketch 
everything. Come back and try to repeat it from memory. If it doesn't work, 
keep going back and forth." Those old-time cartoonists could do that. There's a 
guy named Gaar Williams who had an office next to ours. He could draw anything. 
If I was stuck, I wouldn't have to go look up anything. I'd show it to him, and 
he'd draw it for me. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: How much time do you spend in the studio? Is being a cartoonist a 
seven-days-a-week proposition? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: It is for me because it's easier. I work two or three hours (a day). I 
get in around 9 or 9:30 and leave at noon. That's just the drawing part. The 
ideas are at home, wherever I am. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Actually, about the only time I really spend in my studio is when I'm 
ready to sit at the drawing board and ink it out. But most of the time when I'm 
writing I'm anywhere. Like I said, I go out and sit at a local restaurant for a 
few hours and get some ideas that way or just sit at the couch and things like 
that. But it is a full-time job, seven days a week. I can sit down and force 
myself to think of ideas, but I think the best ideas just come out of the blue. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Out of the air, that's true, without even thinking of them. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: What really frustrates me is when they come that way I sometimes don't 
have my note pad with me and I don't write it down immediately. It happened 
just last night. I was doing something, and I said, "Boy, that would make a 
funny cartoon, I better write that down," (but then I thought) I'll remember 
it, and not 15 minutes later I had forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: That's true. And you dream about them. (laugh) You wake up with a 
great idea and write it down and (the next morning) you can't read it. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: How old were you when you began thinking you'd like to become a 
cartoonist? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I think I was 11 years old. And then I won a newspaper cartoon drawing 
contest, and I think the prize was two or three tickets to "Peck's Bad Boy," 
and that got my dad to thinking, and he gave me a $28 correspondence course. I 
went through that and worked on the high school (year) book all the time. I did 
lots of drawings there. At 13, I sold my first cartoon, for money, to a 
railroad magazine. It paid me $10 a month for years and years. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Did you have the same kind of experience, Kevin? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Pretty much, yeah. I was 10 or 11, too. I thought, boy, it would be fun 
to be a cartoonist. But as I was growing up, I didn't really pursue it because 
I didn't know how you became a cartoonist. I had no idea how you did that for a 
living. It all happened kind of by accident at Saddleback College. A friend of 
mine knew that I doodled and drew pictures just for fun. His sister was the 
editor of the school paper. They were looking for a cartoonist, and so I was 
nominated. When I started drawing in college, that's when I really started to 
give some thought to, "Gee, I could do this," because the reaction was really 
so positive and people were saying you really ought to look into this. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Somebody told me that (the late cartoonist) Virgil Partch encouraged 
you or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: My mom worked at the Ivy House (restaurant in Laguna Beach) for many 
years, and Virgil used to come in all the time, and they were good friends. 
When I was starting out -- before my work had actually debuted, but after I had 
signed my syndicate contract -- the syndicate was saying, "You're going to have 
to do something with this artwork. This is too weird." I didn't know what to do 
with it, and my mom was talking to Virgil Partch one day, and he said, "Why 
don't you have him come down and talk to me. Maybe I can help him." So I went 
down to the restaurant, and we sat for a good part of the day, and he showed me 
a lot of his work and gave me some very useful suggestions, such as the lines 
don't all have to connect and be sure (the lettering) is all spaced properly 
and things like that. He definitely was a big help to me when I was starting 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I've never known a cartoonist yet who wouldn't help a young guy. They 
are all very liberal with their time and advice. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: You're both fortunate to have taken what are undoubtedly the right 
career paths for you. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Oh, sure. Most people retire at 65. I wouldn't think of retiring. It's 
something to do. It's fun. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Kevin, have you ever wished you had pursued another line of work? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Oh, no. I can't imagine what I could be doing that could be more fun or 
rewarding than what I do now. I mean being a cartoonist is kind of the best of 
both worlds because you have a degree of celebrity status and yet nobody knows 
you when you're walking down the street or bothers you or things like that. But 
you get fan mail. I mean, that's terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: You get a lot of money when you're hot, too. (laugh) Unfortunately, 
I'm not hot anymore. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Although the popularity of "Moon Mullins" is not what it used to be, 
is it nevertheless hard to imagine that the strip is still going after 66 
years? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: It's most unusual. . . . It's the oldest one that one person has been 
on all the time. "Gas Alley" and "Jiggs" and some of those others are older, 
but they had several guys doing it. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Ferd's characters were established when he took over the strip. You 
inherited six of them and have added maybe a dozen more over the years. Do any 
of your characters resemble you or share any of your personality quirks. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, laughing: I don't have a good-looking guy in my strip. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Norman Drabble is not Kevin Fagan, but is there a part of you in 
Norman? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Yeah. There's probably part of me in all the characters in the strip. . 
. . Norman's always been kind of on the shy side, which has been me growing up. 
As I get older, I think I start to come out of it a little bit, but when I was 
in college I was a complete mess, particularly with girls. So there's a lot of 
me in Norman. There's also a lot of me in Norman's dad. He kind of fancies 
himself maybe as being something greater than he is. He likes to come home and 
relax in front of the TV. Patrick, Norman's little brother, is a lot like me as 
well because I was the youngest of four boys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Do you find you think like your characters? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Yeah. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: I think so. Every one of my characters is the same way. I know how 
Moon thinks. It's not like Plushbottom thinks or all the other characters. It's 
like a stage play almost. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: In fact, you just think of a situation and put in the characters and 
they each act differently, and you know what each one would say. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. Life: Do you view drawing a cartoon strip like doing a stage play or TV 
situation comedy? 
</P>
<P>
Fagan: Yeah, it's very similar. The cartoonist, though, has to be the actors, 
the writers, the director, the wardrobe person, the set decorator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, laughing: I didn't know we were so good. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan, laughing: Yeah, we should all be paid a lot more.

Halecrest: Condos and Classrooms 
</P>
<P>
Constant transition and high density are the words that best characterize Costa 
Mesa's Halecrest neighborhood. But those who live and work there seem to have 
found a way to cope in this crazy quilt of residences, businesses, gymnasiums, 
condominiums and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Halecrest is named after a housing development constructed there during the 
late 1950s and early 1960s. Bordered on the north and south by the San Diego 
Freeway and Merrimac Way, respectively, nearly half the area is occupied by 
Orange Coast College. The rest is a montage of structures ranging from small 
single-family homes to large businesses like Fedco that border the area on the 
east and west along Fairview Road and Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Domabyl, president of the Australian Wine Society, opened an office in 
Halecrest two years ago in a complex bordered by lots left temporarily vacant 
by the removal of wooden barracks -- relics of the Santa Ana Army Air Base, 
which occupied a portion of the area from 1942 to 1946. But condominiums and a 
massive pink apartment complex have been shoehorned into the gaps, creating 
more traffic and parking difficulties in the already-congested area. 
</P>
<P>
"But my business is primarily mail-order, so I haven't been affected that much. 
But it is harder to get in and out of here. I've lived in Costa Mesa for 10 
years and I have seen a lot of change, even in just the past two years," says 
Domabyl. 
</P>
<P>
Such constant transition does not leave lifelong Costa Mesa resident Jim 
Carnett, director of community relations at Orange Coast College, without a 
sense of history and continuity, however. "The college is located directly 
where the air base used to be. I feel an attachment to it. My father was 
stationed there during the war and both my grandfather and mother worked on the 
base as civilians." 
</P>
<P>
The land was purchased from the federal government for $1 after the base was 
deactivated in 1947. The college administrative offices were located in the old 
air base headquarters from 1947 until a new structure was built in 1975. Church 
services and several weddings were held on campus in the old air base chapel 
until it burned down in the 1950s. Other structures, like the gymnasium, were 
utilized temporarily and then relocated or demolished. The only remaining air 
base structure was used to house prisoners of war during World War II -- its 
dull, gray exterior contrasting with the new pink apartments located nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Carnett attended Orange Coast College in the 1960s, when there were 4,000 
students and has seen it evolve into the largest single-campus community 
college in the nation, with more than 26,000 students. "In the '60s you could 
say that the college had a definite connection to Halecrest and the surrounding 
residential areas because those were the large-growth areas of that time. There 
were many college-age kids growing up nearby. We still have lots of students 
from Halecrest, but we are primarily a commuter campus and Huntington Beach is 
now our largest feeder community. That's the large-growth area of this decade. 
However, the older people still owning homes in Halecrest will eventually be 
replaced by families with children and the cycle could start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the constant change makes Carnett's job challenging and 
interesting, he sometimes regrets that the semi-rural Costa Mesa he grew up in 
is not the same for his two children, ages 11 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, we had the run of the neighborhood," he says. "I had friends 
who grew up in Halecrest, and we used to ride our bikes over to those abandoned 
barracks and climb in the windows. There were still things in them like old 
footlockers and boots. It was an adventure. We could ride our bikes to the 
movies in the evening and our parents never worried about us. It gave me a 
wonderful sense of independence. But I couldn't let my kids do that now."

The value of non-residential building permits issued in the county during the 
first six months of the year was $733.5 million, a small 3% increase over the 
comparable period of last year. The same figure for Los Angeles County was down 
10% while the three other contiguous counties made larger gains. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County permit valuations compared to 1988 were higher in two categories, 
office buildings (up 2%) and alterations/additions (25%), but declined in three 
others -- industrial buildings (down 11%), stores (26%) and hotels and motels 
(22%).

NRC HEARINGS TO EXAMINE ROCKWELL LICENSE FOR NUCLEAR WORK IN VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission will hold hearings in Van Nuys tonight 
and Friday morning on Rockwell International's request to renew its license to 
process nuclear fuel and to do related research at the firm's Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
At tonight's session, scheduled for 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., NRC administrative 
judge Peter B. Bloch will take public comments on Rockwell's request for a 
10-year license extension. At the Friday hearing, scheduled for 9:30 a.m., 
Bloch will consider requests to grant formal intervenor status to Rockwell 
opponents, including area residents and the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
a national environmental group. Both hearings will be held in Room 120 of the 
Van Nuys State Office Building at 6150 Van Nuys Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC license covers the "Hot Lab" at Santa Susana, where the company has 
done fuel decladding and a variety of nuclear experiments in support of federal 
nuclear energy and weapons programs. Fuel decladding involves tearing open 
nuclear fuel rods and removing radioactive materials for shipment to other 
government reservations. The company currently has no contracts and last 
decladded fuel in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Other nuclear work at Santa Susana for the U.S. Department of Energy is exempt 
from NRC licensing and is not at issue in the license proceeding.

<P>
A federal judge today ordered former Black Panther Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt out 
of Folsom Prison for his own safety and accused state prison officials of 
retaliatory action in moving him to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, 41, challenged his hasty transfer out of San Quentin Prison to Folsom 
Sept. 12, contending he feared for his life from Folsom guards. Pratt made it 
clear he was even willing to go back to solitary confinement at San Quentin 
rather than face possible harm at Folsom. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel ordered Pratt removed from Folsom and 
returned to San Quentin stating, "I find the transfer to Folsom was retaliatory 
and that there is sufficient basis for a preliminary injunction against his 
stay in Folsom." 
</P>
<P>
Weigel rejected a request by California prison officials to stay the order long 
enough to appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt contends his prison files contain false allegations that he was engaged 
in plots to kidnap the children of Folsom guards and that he planned to kill 
Folsom guards with poison darts in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom, crowded with Pratt supporters, erupted into applause at the 
judge's final ruling.

The chairman of the Democratic Party, describing President Bush as offering the 
nation timid leadership, called on the Republican President today to begin 
"matching his actions to his charming words." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wonderful to have an American President seize this time of change 
and begin leading the world again," Ronald H. Brown told a meeting of the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The party chairman's speech reflected his earlier statements that it is time to 
"start taking on George Bush," and it received an enthusiastic response from 
his partisan audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to go forward with a public spirit, a commitment to doing what it 
takes at every level of American society using every American political 
institution?" asked Brown. "Or are we going to continue the ethic of greed, 
humming the lemming-like melody -- don't worry, be happy?"

U.S. Defense officials said the work, to be provided by McDonnell Douglas

"This does not increase the combat capability of the planes. It doesn't upgrade

Norwegian four-star Gen. Vigleik Eide took over today as chairman of NATO's 
military committee, the alliance's highest military authority. 
</P>
<P>
Eide, 55, formerly Norway's chief of staff, replaced West Germany's Wolfgang 
Altenburg at the end of his three-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the military committee acts as a link between NATO political 
authorities and its military commanders, including Gen. John Galvin, Supreme 
Allied Commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said Eide, an infantryman by training, is relatively 
inexperienced for the post and was chosen as a compromise after the most 
popular candidate, Sir John Fieldhouse, formerly British chief of defense 
staff, was taken ill in December, 1988, and later retired.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev oversaw the firing of the last major 
Brezhnev-era holdover today as Ukrainian Communist leaders removed hard-line 
party boss Vladimir Shcherbitsky and ended his 17 years of iron rule in the 
southern republic. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Communist Party's Central Committee chose Vladimir Ivashko to 
replace Shcherbitsky as first secretary of the republic's party apparatus, Tass 
press agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky, 71, was retired from the ruling Communist Party Politburo on 
Sept. 20 in a move that cemented Gorbachev's hold on the party, and 
Shcherbitsky's removal as Ukrainian party chief had been widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Gorbachev himself, he was the last Politburo member from the days of 
now-discredited former President Leonid I. Brezhnev and was widely regarded as 
one of the most conservative forces on the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko, the No. 2 Ukrainian party leader, was pitted in a secret ballot 
against another party official, Stanislav Gurenko, Tass said. It did not say 
what the vote total was, but it said Ivashko received solid support from 
Ukrainian regional party chiefs who participated in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backer of Reforms 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Gorbachev probably has been a patron of Ivashko's for some 
time and that his writings indicate he is a firm backer of the Soviet leader's 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's decision to participate personally in the meeting showed the 
significance he attached to making the change. The party's general secretary 
would not ordinarily be present for the changing of a republic party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Gorbachev went to a Moscow city party committee meeting to fire 
maverick Boris Yeltsin, and he traveled to Leningrad in July to retire that 
city's party chief, Yuri F. Solovyev, who had been defeated when he ran 
unopposed for a seat in the new national Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian reformers blame Shcherbitsky for squelching dissent and holding back 
Gorbachev's economic reforms in the nation's breadbasket.

Poles more hardship.

Deputy Finance Minister Marek Dabrowski revealed the economic recovery plan to 
Solidarity members of Parliament in Warsaw. He said living standards would have 
to drop and it would be at least a year before the economy began to recover. 
</P>

Walesa told a news conference in the northern city of Gdansk that Poland could 
face the prospect of civil war as it undergoes capitalist-style reforms to 
dismantle the remnants of 45 years of Communist rule.

Global demand for computer chips in 1989 will increase 9% over last year, a

</P>
<P>
A Japanese official of the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics Organization 
said the organization has revised downward its projection for global chip 
demand by 5 percentage points to $49 billion. The downward revision was caused 
mainly by a slump in demand for dynamic random access memory chips, the 
official said.

Merck &amp; Co., the nation's leading drug company, and E. I du Pont de Nemours 
Co. said today that they are joining forces to develop a new class of heart 
disease medicine under a research and marketing pact. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the collaboration, Merck will turn over to Wilmington, Del.-based Du 
Pont the rights to sell two of its drugs in exchange for a percentage of the 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual arrangement, Merck said it is allowing Du Pont to market Sinemet, 
a major treatment for Parkinson's disease, and Vaseretic, a hypertension drug, 
in order to focus on marketing other products. 
</P>
<P>
Sinemet accounted for $100 million of Merck's $5.94 billion in sales last year. 
Spokesman John Doorley said Vaseretic's revenues were less, but he did not know 
the precise figure. 
</P>
<P>
The other half of the collaboration gives Du Pont, a chemical, energy and 
specialty products giant, access to Merck's highly proficient research staff 
and expertise at bringing products to market in developing a new class of heart 
disease medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The class, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, was developed by Du Pont, a 
leader in the area. Angiotensin II, or AII, is a major hormone and factor in 
high blood pressure.

The Chevrolet and GMC divisions of General Motors Corp. today expanded buyer

Oldsmobile was the only GM division to announce a new buyer program Wednesday 
on 1989 models in attempts to clear inventories of those cars before the 
1990-model year officially gets under way next week.

All GM programs, valid until further notice, will offer as an alternative to 
cash incentives low-rate financing, with interest rates between 6.9% and 10.9%, 
depending on loan length.

The government today announced a plan for expanded distribution of a drug that 
appears to be effective in stopping replication of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for wider distribution of dideoxyinosine, or ddI, marks the first time 
the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to make such an experimental drug 
so widely available so early in testing, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, ddI will be available to about 2,600 people with AIDS or 
AIDS-related complex in controlled clinical trials to test the effectiveness of 
the drug against zidovudine, known as AZT. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also will make ddI available to people with AIDS or advanced 
AIDS-related complex who cannot take AZT, the only FDA-approved drug that 
directly combats the AIDS virus, and those for whom the disease is progressing 
despite AZT and who have no other treatment options. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol-Meyers, which holds the license to manufacture ddI, has said it will 
distribute the drug at no cost.

With his wife and infant daughter by his side, Indiana Pacers center Steve 
Stipanovich announced his retirement today from the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot center spent last season on the bench with an injured left knee. The 
injury caused a "dead spot" in the bone. Doctors drilled a hole trying to 
revive it, but their efforts yielded limited success. Stipanovich said he had 
been examined by three doctors and had undergone two operations, and nothing 
seemed to have helped. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to have gotten worse," he said at a news conference at Pacers 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Stipanovich said he plans to stay off the knee for a year or two to help it 
heal, and that more surgery and perhaps an artificial knee will be needed. 
Stipanovich said that under the retirement agreement he will retain the 
insurance coverage on his contract, which expires in three years.

MOSES CALLS FOR JUDICIAL INQUIRY ON DRUGS IN SPORTS

<P>
Two-time Olympic hurdles champion Edwin Moses, in an interview published today, 
said drugs are a major problem in American sports and called for a judicial 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the West German magazine Stern, Moses was quoted as saying 
that an independent inquiry must investigate the latest doping allegations 
against U.S. track and field stars. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug problem has spread like a cancer in our sport in the past eight 
years," Moses was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Moses' comments came one week after Stern published allegations by sprinter 
Darrell Robinson that he bought growth hormones for Olympic sprinting champion 
Florence Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, in its latest edition, said Robinson had received anonymous death 
threats after his interview. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who retired from competition in February, denied Robinson's 
allegation and called him a "compulsive liar." 
</P>
<P>
But Moses, the 1976 and 1984 400-meter hurdles gold medalist who has led the 
anti-drug campaign, told Stern all recent doping allegations had to be 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation of Darrell Robinson's allegations must be conducted by an 
independent committee with judicial authority," Moses was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"All witnesses called to testify must give sworn statements," he was quoted as 
saying.

The America's Cup, yacht racing's top prize which was awarded to San Diego in

ruled. 
</P>

Joseph P. Sullivan, presiding justice of the Appellate Division of New York 
State Supreme Court, ordered that the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, 
which is storing the America's Cup in its Manhattan bank vault, hold the trophy 
for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fay of New Zealand, who is questioning the legality of the San Diego 
Yacht Club's victory over his boat in the America's Cup races last year, had 
asked that the New York Yacht Club have temporary custody of the Cup. Morgan 
Guaranty was asked to hold the Cup until the appellate court decides whether 
New Zealand has a further right to appeal.
