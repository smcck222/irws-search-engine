PETER BOMMARITO; EX-HEAD OF RUBBER WORKERS' UNION

<DATELINE>
<P>
AKRON, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Bommarito, president of the United Rubber Workers Union for 15 years, 
died of cancer Monday at Akron General Medical Center. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Bommarito, a native of Detroit and the youngest of 12 children born to Italian 
immigrants, moved to the Akron area in 1966 to become president of the 
Akron-based international union. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "The Bomber," a nickname he earned after his tour of duty in the South 
Pacific as a Marine during World War II, Bommarito was a high-energy president 
who saw the URW through a stormy four-month strike in 1976 against the major 
rubber companies. 
</P>
<P>
When Bommarito retired in 1981, the URW had 140,000 members, diminished by a 
number of plant closings from a peak of 190,500 in 1974. Dues-paying members 
now number about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bommarito, a former altar boy, enlisted in the Marine Corps in early 1942. When 
he returned to his factory job in Detroit after his tour of duty, he was 
elected to the executive board of URW Local 101. 
</P>
<P>
By 1957, Bommarito was made president of the 6,000-member local, which is now 
defunct. In 1960, Bommarito was elected an international vice president. Six 
years later, he was elected to the union's top post. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question he was a great international leader," said John Nardella, 
president of Goodyear URW Local 2 for more than 20 years until retiring in 
1983. "He was one of the greatest labor leaders this area has ever seen. He was 
a humanitarian, dedicated to helping the working man and helping his 
community."

SCHOOL LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handful of books are banned from a few isolated schools. High profile authors 
(Harlan Ellison, Amy Tan) view this with alarm and hold teas and readings to 
protest. The Times devotes headlines ("Celebrities Rally 'Round Written Word," 
Metro, Sept. 24) and reporters to tell us of the creeping "darkness" that 
threatens to take the marginal book from the grasp of the hungry reader. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on a daily basis in California, most children are denied access to all 
library books. Everywhere else in the United States, a student can walk down 
the hall to a school library filled with books, make a choice and pursue an 
interest by reading. 
</P>
<P>
Not in California. National and state reports have verified what anyone who 
cares to look can see. The vast majority of California elementary (K-8) schools 
have no library. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have to burn books in California because there are no books to burn. 
</P>
<P>
In other states a school cannot be accredited without a library. In California, 
libraries are designated "extracurricular," like golf. 
</P>
<P>
In other states the school librarian buys books to support all aspects of the 
curriculum and to appeal to the reading interests of all children. In 
California the state Department of Education suggests that additional books 
might be a useful adjunct to the required texts. And state Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig gets to use your Opinion Section to lecture President 
George Bush on national education policy ("Education Reform Can Reach High 
Payoffs With Modest New Federal Help," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 24). 
</P>
<P>
Let one parent object to a racial slur in a required novel and we have "news." 
Let schools remain empty of library books while children are denied access to 
choice and we have . . . California. 
</P>
<P>
A meager attempt to change all this, AB 2026, Assemblyman Delaine Eastin's 
(D-Union City) L.E.A.R.N. bill, made it through both houses, with bipartisan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would have provided $1 for each California child to nudge districts in 
the direction of school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
No headline, no article. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed the bill.

THE SHAMEFUL MARCOS LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ferdinand Marcos has died in opulent exile in Hawaii, more than three years 
after a popular uprising dramatically ended his 20-year rule as president and 
martial-law dictator of the Philippines. The Philippines, meanwhile, continues 
to suffer from the many economic and political afflictions that will long 
survive as the legacy of Marcos' venal tenure. 
</P>
<P>
With his unappeasably avaricious wife, Imelda, at his side, Marcos looted the 
Philippines of uncounted wealth, in so doing stealing much of the country's 
hopes for future development. When Marcos was first elected president in 1966, 
the Philippines was poor but not without some economic promise, and in his 
early years in office Marcos showed signs of being a progressive and reformist 
leader. By the time public outrage and a military revolt forced the Marcoses to 
flee Manila in 1986, however, the country had been effectively pauperized by 
the ruling family and its cronies. 
</P>
<P>
During the Marcos years, officially sanctioned theft and corruption were 
carried out on a truly grotesque scale, becoming both the ends of power and the 
means to maintain it. In the course of building up his near-absolute authority, 
Marcos ordered or sanctioned brutal violations of human rights, including the 
torture and murder of political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The military, controlled in good part by inept and dishonest Marcos loyalists, 
was allowed to rampage through the countryside, killing, stealing and otherwise 
terrorizing the population it was sworn to protect. The communist-led 
insurgency, small and ineffective when Marcos first became president, expanded 
as official abuse and criminality grew ever more flagrant. 
</P>
<P>
The public behavior of the Marcoses grew ever more ostentatious as their power 
swelled under martial law. Millions of dollars were regularly spent on glitzy 
entertainments for their circle of international acquaintances and sycophants. 
World leaders and hangers-on who accepted their hospitality and favors 
apparently never thought to inquire where the money to pay for the fun was 
coming from. No one ever seems to have asked whether the wealth squandered on 
parties, clothes, gifts and homes could not have been put to more socially 
productive uses, among them feeding Filipino children who died of hunger each 
year by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Filipino children are still dying of malnutrition, part of a tragic heritage 
whose dismal effects will be felt for many years to come. Marcos wanted very 
much to be remembered in his nation's history. He will be, if only as a name to 
be reviled by generations of Filipinos yet unborn.

STEALING FROM IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To help pay for President Bush's war on drugs and other worthy federal 
programs, the Senate recently raided a fund created to help newly legalized 
immigrants. Such shortsighted budgeting will adversely affect many California 
residents and local governments. It must be reversed by the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress passed the landmark Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986, 
one of the key provisions was a legalization program, commonly referred to as 
an amnesty, for immigrants who had been living illegally in the United States. 
Almost everyone involved in the debate over illegal immigration agreed that it 
would be inhumane to deport people who had lived in this country long enough to 
establish ties here. What did become controversial, however, was precisely who 
should pay for providing government services to these people and their families 
once they came out of hiding and began using public hospitals, schools and 
other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for cities and counties with large immigrant populations successfully 
argued that since immigration is a federal responsibility, Congress should 
reimburse them for part of the cost of serving newly legalized residents. So 
when the immigration reform bill was enacted, a little-noted section of that 
law set aside $1 billion each year, for four years, to reimburse local 
governments. These so-called State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants 
(SLIAG) are important to counties like Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego that 
have large populations of immigrants legalizing their status under the reform 
act. 
</P>
<P>
It was this year's $1-billion appropriation for immigrant aid that was raided 
by the Senate last week, with the encouragement of the Bush Administration. 
Claiming a surplus in the fund, Administration officials asked that $400 
million be redirected to drug programs, and the Senate took out another $155 
million for health research. The so-called surplus in SLIAG exists because the 
funds accumulated while the federal government has been slow in reimbursing 
local governments and not because there is no demand for the money. For 
instance, Los Angeles County, with the largest number of immigration amnesty 
applicants of any local jurisdiction in the nation, has asked for $230 million 
from the federal government in the current fiscal year and gotten only $28 
million back so far. San Diego County is seeking a more modest $2 million, but 
has received only $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
And, because of other provisions of the immigration reform act, the need for 
that money will increase in the next few months rather than diminish. In order 
to complete the amnesty process, for example, immigrants must complete study 
courses in basic English and civics by late next year. There won't be enough 
classes to meet the demand if public school districts don't get money from the 
federal government to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the negative impact the cutbacks in SLIAG will have, 
Sen. Bob Graham (R-Fla.) introduced an amendment to restore the missing $555 
million in 1991. But that will be too late to help many local governments and 
school districts. Besides, as Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles) points out, 
there is no guarantee that money will actually be available for Congress to 
hand out in 1991. So, rather than undermine the process of immigration reform, 
the House should restore the SLIAG money and tell the Senate to find its 
"surplus" funds elsewhere in the budget.

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Decades of research and reform have not altered the fundamental facts of 
teaching," writes Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder. "The task of 
universal, public, elementary education is still usually being conducted by a 
woman alone in a little room." 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental facts about teaching and education were not changed by this 
week's education summit of President Bush and the nation's governors at Thomas 
Jefferson's University of Virginia. But it was historic nonetheless, in its 
advocacy for those women and men teaching "alone in a little room," and in the 
national goals finally set for a country that spends a greater percentage of 
its gross national product on education than Japan but has less to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news about U.S. education is familiar by now: American high schools 
graduate 700,000 functional illiterates every year; more than 4 million 
students drop out each year; European and Asian students consistently outrank 
Americans in international math and science examinations. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not true, as some in Washington would have you believe, that the 29% 
increase in education spending by state and local governments (and a small 
decrease in the federal share) in the last several years has made no 
difference. The National Assessment of Educational Progress has found recent 
improvements in the reading ability of elementary school students. Since 1984 
in California, the percentage of students scoring above average on the 
Scholastic Achievement Tests has risen 28% for verbal and 32% for math; the 
overall scores for minority students have increased; and there has been a 92% 
jump in the rate of high school seniors passing the Advanced Placement exam for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
One of the goals set at the summit -- to promote early childhood development -- 
is an acknowledgement that educators already know that reaching a child early 
can make a dramatic difference. Head Start, a preschool program for low-income 
children, has proved effective in offsetting later social and learning 
problems. In spite of the Administration's nervousness about increased federal 
education spending, money spent on the programs with fine track records, such 
as Head Start, is money prudently spent. Right now, Head Start is only reaching 
one out of the five children who need it. Although the federal government 
accounts for only 9% of education funding, its role should not be undervalued: 
the federal government pays for two-thirds of the nation's remedial education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The answers do not lie with government alone. Already, the private sector has 
taken action to better prepare young people for the changing and increasingly 
technical job market. On-the-job reading and math programs help undereducated 
workers. And in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Atlanta, 
Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Houston and Miami, adopt-a-class programs for the 
low-income but high-achieving are thriving. Promoted by the National Urban 
League and supported by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., they serve as examples of 
enlightened self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
As he returns from the summit, Gov. George Deukmejian needs to send out a 
message that he is willing to champion and sign measures that will help reach 
the literacy goals agreed upon at the summit. Removing California's dubious 
distinction as having some of the nation's most overcrowded classrooms would be 
a start. Such a step would help enhance the chances that more bright, committed 
people want to enter that "little room" to teach children whose minds ideally 
are nurtured long before they first enter a classroom.

U.S. AND JAPAN STUCK IN THE MUD;

<P>
SQUABBLING OVER TRADE, THEY FAIL TO BUILD A VITAL COMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States' relations with Japan are heading toward a postwar low. 
Unless both countries act now, America's key alliance in the Pacific -- and 
this vital economic partnership -- could come unglued. Nothing less than a new 
U.S.-Japanese political compact will come to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
For many Americans, Japan is little more than a national engine of corporate 
economic growth, unwilling to understand the needs of others as it seeks global 
dominance in major industries. Yet viewed from Tokyo, this is a gross and 
dangerous caricature. Indeed, too many U.S. observers reduce relations with 
Japan to a single statistic -- the bilateral balance of trade -- and pay scant 
attention to what unites the two countries. Often ignored are Japan's 
democratic development, its Western economic system, its commitment to U.S. 
strategic objectives and its penchant, as it becomes a cosmopolitan society, 
for following the American lead, from the texture of its television to the 
design of its products and the life style of its younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
Most at issue today is a provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act that requires 
Tokyo to permit much greater access for U.S. goods by next spring. These 
demands, emanating from an angry Congress, have spawned a set of talks, the 
Structural Impediments Initiative, or SII -- an unconscious mimicking of SDI, 
the Strategic Defense Initiative. Yet, like "Star Wars," "car wars" is unlikely 
to relieve the United States of its sense of vulnerability to the outside 
world. Even if SII drags out of the Japanese government some limited benefits 
for U.S. exporters -- most difficult because of Japan's domestic political 
crisis -- the price will be paid in political relations. 
</P>
<P>
Observers in Tokyo have been particularly disquieted by a U.S. public-opinion 
poll that stipulated Japan, not the Soviet Union, to be the leading threat to 
U.S. well-being. This subordination of the world's central conflict (however 
muted) to mere economic competition (however vigorous) leads the Japanese to 
wonder about U.S. priorities and purpose. Also disquieting has been a spate of 
books by American authors whose common theme is that the United States must 
increase its economic pressure on Japan. Not to be outdone in the Battle of the 
Books, two leading Japanese -- one being the founder of Sony -- have responded 
with harsh criticism of American business methods. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, there is much validity to U.S. criticism of the slow pace at which 
Japan is liberalizing its trade practices. No doubt, the Japanese are right in 
asserting that most of America's economic difficulties are home-grown. But most 
striking is the fact that this squabble dominates almost totally each side's 
current perceptions of the other. 
</P>
<P>
Neither society has an adequate knowledge of the other, with the lack more 
apparent in the United States. In particular, the United States has largely 
left non-diplomatic relations with Japan to the academic specialists, the 
economists, the bankers and the businessmen. Essentially uneducated about 
modern Japan are the American media, the mainstream foreign policy and academic 
elites, the average citizen east of California and political leaders -- 
especially members of Congress, only a handful of whom have visited Japan 
during this critical year. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has Japan done much better. American lobbyists for Japanese companies have 
worn out their welcome on Capitol Hill, but rarely does a Japanese appear to 
plead his own case (of necessity, in English) and thus inspire confidence, and 
few Diet members know their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also is poor at gaining credit where due; it is, for example, the leading 
donor of foreign economic aid and provides most of the financial underpinning 
for Filipino democracy -- facts that should be counted in comparing 
contributions to the global good. 
</P>
<P>
Most missing is a clear and articulated sense of political common interest. 
Thus, while change in East-West relations is being celebrated, rarely mentioned 
is the continuing need for the U.S. Seventh Fleet and Japanese Maritime 
Self-Defense Force to keep watch over an undiminished Soviet Far East Fleet. 
Nor is much said about the long-range value of maintaining naval power in the 
region or of updating the U.S.-Japanese security relationship. If that were 
done, Japan would likely stop increasing its defense spending before the point 
of alarming some East Asian neighbors. Congress might accept that U.S. forces 
are in Japan primarily to promote U.S. interests, and thus stop demanding that 
Tokyo pick up the entire tab. And Japanese public opinion would better 
understand the security provided by U.S. forces and thus have fewer doubts 
about their presence. 
</P>
<P>
A new U.S.-Japanese political agreement could be the basis for encouraging 
Japan to translate its economic strength into a sense of responsibility for its 
commercial actions and for the effective functioning of the global economic 
system. There would be a bilateral framework for efforts by the two countries, 
on their own and with others, to deal with worldwide concerns that are as much 
political as economic -- from Third World debt to the environment. Japan could 
be drawn more deeply into the management of East-West relations. And the United 
States and other states would be more likely to accept greater Japanese 
political weight in institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be easy for Japan to develop a world view to complement its 
economic prowess. Nor will it be easy for Americans to accept a major Japanese 
role in the world -- even one based, happily and without precedent, on economic 
rather than military might. Nevertheless, the U.S. and Japanese governments 
must begin now, in clear view of both societies, to create a new political 
compact. Only then can they put their trade dispute in perspective and thereby 
avoid an error of historic proportions.

Law enforcement agencies must protect citizens irrespective of their sex, race 
or the area in which they live. No one can fault the police for their inability 
to prevent certain crimes of opportunity, particularly when little or no 
warning is given. But in cases of domestic violence, warnings from prospective 
victims are like flares fired from a sinking ship. When seen, they must be 
heeded by law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
The tragic death of Maria Navarro on Aug. 27 after a fruitless call to the 
Sheriff's emergency number seeking help focused debate on police 
responsibilities and service. The lawsuit filed last Wednesday against the 
county on behalf of her children has renewed that debate. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints of poor service and inattention are not new to local law 
enforcement. The Los Angeles Police Department was besieged by a coalition of 
civic organizations a year ago demanding equal service and protection. Studies 
by the department indicated that it took several minutes longer to respond to 
911 emergency calls in less affluent sections of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department has released no such study. 
</P>
<P>
A basic service that police provide is protection. It is that service that 
Navarro, a Latina who was allegedly slain by her estranged husband in a 
converted garage in East Los Angeles, was clearly denied. 
</P>
<P>
There are a variety of reasons why police resent responding to 
domestic-violence calls. Officers sometime feel uncertain about how to solve 
domestic disputes. Officers sometime view domestic complaints as one party 
attempting to manipulate them into punishing the other. A lack of physical 
signs of abuse can often diminish a victim's credibility. Officers called in to 
arrest an abusive husband are sometimes attacked by both the victim and abuser. 
And, when both parties are injured, it is sometimes difficult to determine 
which individual started the fight. They are also annoyed by the reluctance of 
victims to follow through with prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The list of mitigating circumstances is endless. Yet it does not relieve police 
from their duty to investigate these matters. 
</P>
<P>
Police agencies seem to have adopted a play-it-by-the-ear approach in dealing 
with domestic disputes. The state Justice Department mandates that all domestic 
violences detected by officers be described in a report. It is impossible to 
report the severity of a domestic dispute if no one investigates. Sheriff 
Sherman Block's position that "no response" was correct in the Navarro incident 
says that there is no danger unless the gun is at your head. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that equal protection cannot be ensured for this country's 
citizens if we fail to adopt more comprehensive policies in dealing with 
domestic violence. In addition to policy amendments, there are training and 
organizational changes that can enhance the effectiveness of officers in 
dealing with domestic violence calls. One step would be to expand training 
curriculum for domestic violence. The majority of calls police respond to don't 
involve gunplay or burglaries. In spite of this, most police training is geared 
toward combat situations that may arise only a few times in the careers of 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
A second step would be the inclusion of experts and victims from battered 
women's centers in the process. Women deserve an active role in shaping the 
training that could save their lives. Legislation should be introduced 
requiring treatment before chronic abusers can be released from custody. In 
cases of repeated life-threatening abuse or stalking of victims, the abuser 
should be required to register with the police agency in the jurisdiction in 
which the former spouse resides. 
</P>
<P>
Some departments use what is called a "premise history." A premise history is 
computer-stored information on a specific address. When officers receive a call 
to respond to a certain address, the premise history informs them of prior 
complaints or unusual incidents at the address. 
</P>
<P>
Premise-history information is available to the dispatcher, and he or she may 
consider it in making a decision on sending a patrol unit on a call. Had a 
premise history been entered in the Navarro case, information regarding Maria 
Navarro's expired restraining order, her husband's prior incidents of violence 
and any serious crimes committed at the address would have been available to 
the dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Police should also have the authority to issue a court summons in cases of 
serious conflict. The summons would require the estranged couple to make a 
formal appearance before a hearing officer dealing solely with spousal abuse 
issues. More direct long-term help could be provided in this form. 
</P>
<P>
Service to victims of spousal abuse and other crimes occurring in the inner 
city hinge on perceptions police officers have about the residents of the area. 
Reshaping attitudes of officers about the poor should result in better service 
for the disadvantaged. Information is the best weapon against the stereotypes 
and cynicism that police officers bring to work with them. 
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that police officers be educated to understand that crime 
victims have a legitimate right to service whether they live in a penthouse or 
a public-housing tract.

SOLD OFF BY A GREEDY FEW, TO OUR VAST HARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD N. GOODWIN, Richard N. Goodwin, who was an assistant special counsel 
to President John F. Kennedy and a special assistant to President Lyndon B. 
Johnson, is now a writer and commentator in Los Angeles.

<P>
The headlines proclaim Sony's agreement to purchase Columbia Pictures. But 
earlier this month a more historic moment in the continuing saga of American 
decline passed almost unnoticed by media and politicians alike: For the first 
time since the '50s, foreign investors earned more from their investments in 
the United States than our citizens derived from their enterprises abroad. And 
this gap will widen as the foreign takeover of American business continues on 
its grim, inexorable course. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the "trade deficit" will now be augmented by a "profit deficit" to swell 
the flow of American income and jobs to other countries. By the time we reach 
the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 1991, our "partners" will have achieved 
with money what our "enemies" could not do with weapons -- substantial control 
over the lives and destinies of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and Europeans are buying America. Motivated by shortsighted greed 
and a softening of the American spirit, we are willing sellers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Japanese companies bought control of one of America's leading 
business lenders and Sony's deal to purchase one of our largest media and 
entertainment conglomerates came to fruition. In the short run, a handful of 
owners and top executives make a great deal of money from their sellout of 
American enterprises. In the longer run, all of us will be losers, as the 
profits that once went to enrich the citizens of this country go instead to 
Tokyo or Bonn or London. 
</P>
<P>
These buyouts, unlike investment in manufacturing, do nothing to create wealth 
for America. We simply substitute foreign capital for American. The 
substitution does not add to our income or production. It will do the opposite 
by transferring the benefits of American enterprise to others. They will get 
richer while we become a poorer country. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the cost be measured in dollars alone. Financial institutions control 
the direction of investment, are influential in deciding what we build, the 
direction in which business expands. The so-called entertainment industry -- 
which includes television and even publishing -- helps shape American values 
and influences our attitudes toward ourselves and the world. By allowing 
foreign control over such powerful forces, we are allowing crucial decisions 
about the country's future to fall into the hands of foreign enterprises and 
the governments that encourage and often subsidize their depredations. 
</P>
<P>
This rapidly accelerating trend must not be allowed to continue. The future of 
this nation cannot be determined in the boardrooms of Tokyo and Europe; their 
occupants have no stake in America and do not share its heritage or its 
aspirations. To them we must appear a succulent plate from which the choicest 
morsels can be plucked. The American economy -- the goose that lays the golden 
egg -- is being quietly dismembered and shipped across the ocean to enrich 
other lands. 
</P>
<P>
I find it hard to contain my indignation that we are permitting the foundation 
of our prosperity to fall into the hands of those who care nothing about our 
difficulties or the fair expectations and dreams of our people. 
</P>
<P>
And it is our own fault. The Japanese and others are simply behaving as 
old-fashioned predatory capitalists are supposed to behave. They are taking 
what they can while the pickings are good. It is we, the Americans, who are 
letting this happen. A handful of directors and managers -- once regarded as 
trustees and engines of American well-being -- pocket their immense profits and 
retire to their mansions and yachts. Our political leaders watch with silent 
acquiescence, betraying their obligations to the people they serve and to the 
generations that will follow. 
</P>
<P>
There is another foreseeable, virtually inevitable consequence of this foreign 
buyout of America. Our political financing laws are an irresistible invitation 
to corruption. They have magnified the influence of the wealthy and powerful at 
every level of government. Now, using their ownership of American enterprise as 
a conduit, foreign interests will benefit from this corrupting process. By 
helping finance political campaigns they will gain increased power to protect 
themselves from adverse political action. Our representatives, even our 
President, will have a constituency located beyond our borders. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to realize that none of this is required by some law of nature 
or even Adam Smith. We have the power to protect ourselves. The question is 
whether the spiritual fabric of America has been too weakened -- by greed and 
corruption, by a widespread sense of helplessness -- to mount a resistance. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, all political activity by foreign-controlled companies and those 
who work for them should be prohibited. But we can go much further. Foreign 
control of American airlines is already prohibited and the amount of foreign 
investment seriously limited. The same kind of constraints can be applied to 
other sectors of the economy, especially those that constitute the framework of 
economic and political activity, such as financial institutions, media, 
transportation. The tax system could be revised to discourage sellouts to 
foreign interests. 
</P>
<P>
If we don't act, and soon, if we choose to stand by as if we were helpless, 
then we will be accomplices in our own defeat -- the defeat of the powerful 
dream that is America.

WITH OFFENSES INCREASINGLY IN TUNE, RON LYNN WORKS TO CREATE DISCORD WITH THE 
CHARGER DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
"IT'S ENTERTAINMENT. START THE CALLIOPE. DOOT-DOOT, DOODLE-OODLE, DOOT-DOOT, 
DOODLE-OODLE . . . " -- RON LYNN, CHARGER DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR

<P>
Sacks are down all around the National Football League. Points are up. And the 
agent for one Charger player says the team's owner, construction magnate Alex 
Spanos, is now taking game films home to study, as if they were profit 
statements, spreadsheets or the latest government figures on housing starts. 
</P>
<P>
Worse for Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn is that his immediate 
superior, first-year Coach Dan Henning, is still installing an offensive 
system. And Henning's immediate superior, Steve Ortmayer, is in the last year 
of his contract as director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
So here's the deal, Ron: 
</P>
<P>
You figure out a way to keep opponents from gaining 200 yards a game. And never 
mind all those bells and whistles attached to that calliope on the other side 
of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then Spanos won't complain publicly about the "three-man prevent" you 
tried in defeat against Houston quarterback Warren Moon two weeks ago. Maybe 
then the Chargers will finish 9-7, win the AFC West and earn Henning honors as 
coach of the year. Maybe then Ortmayer will retain his job. 
</P>
<P>
And while you're at it, Ron, we want you to do this with a depth-poor unit that 
starts four free agents and two other players acquired by trade. After that, 
we'll let you have a shot at tackling the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Chargers, Lynn doesn't look at his job that way. He's much 
more into football than politics. And he sees it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"You have diametrically opposed options right now," Lynn says. "One is to sit 
back and try to cover. One is to try to rush all the time. Either one of the 
two can get you killed." 
</P>
<P>
In Week 1, the Chargers ran into a Raider offensive line that played over its 
head. They lost by 26 points. In Week 2, the Chargers emphasized pass coverage 
at the expense of pass rush against a run-and-shoot attack, and Moon picked 
them apart. 
</P>
<P>
The defense didn't sack Moon once. Henning was not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't get the quarterback with the rush or the coverage," he said, 
"it's hard to determine which is best." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lynn unveiled a seven-man front not dissimilar to the Rams' vaunted 
"Eagle" defense. It produced three sacks and helped force five Steve DeBerg 
interceptions as the Chargers beat Kansas City, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
But the sad fact for NFL defenses everywhere is that the number of sacks has 
been dwindling since 1985, the year Chicago's defense dominated the league. 
During that season, sacks numbered 1,306. The next year, that figure dropped to 
1,198. In 1987, sacks declined again to 1,106. Even if the strike hadn't 
subtracted a game from the schedule, sacks almost certainly would have been 
down. Last year, sacks totaled 1,035. 
</P>
<P>
Through three games this year, the 196 sacks thus far project to 1,045 over the 
16-game schedule. That's a negligible increase from last year. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons for the decline. 
</P>
<P>
Offenses have finally figured out they can't block pass-rushing outside 
linebackers like Lawrence Taylor, Andre Tippett and Wilber Marshall with 
running backs. Increasingly, they have assigned that chore to offensive tackles 
who have refined the "slide" technique to force outside rushers even further 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
Most teams have also cut down on the number of steps they allow their 
quarterbacks to drop back on passing downs. Instead of seven steps, 
quarterbacks are utilizing five- and even three-step drops to give pass-rushers 
less time. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded use of the shotgun formation has turned out to be a successful way 
to protect quarterbacks in long-yardage situations. It's easier to see a blitz 
coming and check off to a safer option. The shotgun is not new. But more teams 
than ever before have installed it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, almost every team has packaged some kind of four-wide receiver 
formation. It spreads defenses out and forces them to tip their hand more 
before the snap. 
</P>
<P>
"Visually," Lynn says, "the defense has to make some declaration." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of all these factors, scoring has proliferated. The average points 
per game through three weeks stands at a whopping 48.4. At that pace, 1989 will 
the highest scoring year ever in the NFL. The previous high was 46.1 in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody referred to it as fast-break basketball on grass," Lynn says. "And 
that's not a bad description. When we get to third down, that's what it has 
turned into." 
</P>
<P>
And it's no accident. Almost all the rules changes in the past decade have 
favored offensive linemen and wide receivers while protecting quarterbacks. 
During that period, the dominant force on the NFL's Competition Committee has 
been Miami Coach Don Shula. The committee recommends rules changes to the 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
It's also no accident that Shula's quarterback, Dan Marino, hasn't been sacked 
in the Dolphins' past 15 regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
Holding, says Charger defensive Mike Charles, is the great equalizer for 
offensive linemen. Charles and Shula didn't get along when Charles played in 
Miami. And it is no wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"Shula and his rules people got together," Charles said. "Now holding is part 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
And it's all part of a trend that isn't likely to end soon. The new guard NFL 
owners are people such as Victor Kiam of New England, Patrick Bowlen of Denver, 
Ken Behring of Seattle and even Jerry Jones of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
They have mostly scoffed at tradition. And they have insisted the NFL needs to 
market itself more to the sporting public. Don't expect this group to advocate 
the kind of rules retrenching needed to restore the balance that has shifted 
away from defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn says officials could call offensive holding on every play if they wanted 
to. Henning, whose background is on offense, says the number of holding calls 
usually depends upon which officiating crew is working a game. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that I've noticed more than anything is they don't call interference 
as much anymore," Henning says. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn says that's because defensive coaches make sure their players don't bump 
receivers more than once in the first five yards. Lynn says that rule is at the 
root of most of the defense's ills right now. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a magic wand," he says, "I would go back to the way it used to be 
relative to playing wide receivers in the five-yard zone. You used to be able 
to bump 'em as many times as you wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Henning's point about the difference between officiating crews is an offshoot 
of the trend to higher scores. But it's an interesting one. It turns out many 
NFL teams scout officials as closely as they scout their next opponent. But 
it's a tricky business. 
</P>
<P>
"If you coach to the officials every week, you can't ever stop doing that," 
Henning says. "And it becomes a very tedious proposition to tell your players 
that this is what's going to happen this week, and this isn't going to happen. 
I've seen situations where we've tried to coach to the officials, and it has 
backfired. And I've seen situations where we haven't done it, and that has 
backfired, too." 
</P>
<P>
The defensive answer to today's liberated offenses lies in procuring versatile 
athletes -- defensive backs strong enough to rush the passer and fast enough to 
cover; linebackers big enough to stuff the run and quick enough to pick up a 
back; defensive ends fierce enough to hand-fight a 300-pound tackle and mobile 
enough to run with the tight end if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, first-round draft picks. The Chargers start five -- Lee 
Williams, Burt Grossman, Bill Ray Smith, Leslie O'Neal and Gill Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, Lynn is willing to sacrifice size for versatility. But, he says, 
"Our concern is always going to be, 'Are we stout enough to sit in there and 
play against the run if a team just decides to come in and run at us?' 
</P>
<P>
"Our alternative to that is to line up in different fronts, change them up and 
try to get some element of confusion in their game. Or to be able to stunt and 
dog enough on running downs to get a tackle for a loss and put them in a 
situation where now they can't control the clock and the down markers." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Chargers will line Grossman up at right end on one play and 
left end the next. Williams has rushed the passer this year from both the 
inside and the outside. O'Neal, listed on the depth chart as an outside 
linebacker, lined up as a nose tackle more than once against the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a risk when you take a guy away from his original position," 
Lynn says. "But we're trying to get the best matchup." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, this week's Charger opponent, will be an acid test. The Cardinals' 
offensive line is huge. After allowing 785 yards and 77 points in the first two 
weeks, the Charger defense played that one solid game against the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Two (bad) games are not going to take away three years of preparation," says 
free safety Vencie Glenn. "Ron Lynn is a level-headed guy. He is not going to 
panic." 
</P>
<P>
"When things go bad early, you can't start thinking everything else is going to 
go bad," Charles says. "We don't want to start being tentative. You can't be 
afraid to unload." 
</P>
<P>
Said Henning after the Houston defeat: "I think we're playing the right people 
in the right places. They just have to play better." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Buddy Ryan's Eagles damned the torpedoes and blitzed full speed ahead 
last Sunday against San Francisco. They sacked Joe Montana eight times. But 
they also allowed 428 yards passing. And they lost, 38-28, when Montana threw 
four touchdown passes in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. That music you hear in the background is a calliope. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger wide receiver Quinn Early temporarily popped his left shoulder out of 
joint during practice Thursday. But he managed to get it back in place before 
practice ended. Early said it would not affect his playing status for Sunday's 
game in Phoenix. . . . Rookie center Courtney Hall has a sore ankle but will 
also probably play. Coach Dan Henning had a one-on-one chat with Hall in the 
locker room after practice. "I think he's probably got a little bit of the 
rookie blues," Henning said.

LARSON, BIRMINGHAM STEAL THE SHOW, 28-24 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The feature show Thursday night was a 48-minute thriller starring Danny Larson, 
a poised Birmingham High quarterback who led his team back from a 10-point 
deficit in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Larson engineers the game-winning drive, calling the plays, scrambling for 
first downs on fourth-and-eight plays, and breaking a tackle for the 
game-winning score as the clock winds down. 
</P>
<P>
Sound too good to be true? Well, Larson did it all -- and more -- in 
Birmingham's 28-24 win over Canoga Park in a nonleague game at Canoga Park on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And that's putting it mildly. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham (2-0) blew a 14-0 first-quarter lead and trailed, 24-14, after David 
Erhardt scored from 47 yards on a quarterback keeper with 10:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
Two series later, on third and 10 at the Canoga Park 43, Larson found Jake 
Brescher, who caught eight passes for 126 yards and two touchdowns. The 
streaking Brescher carried the ball all the way. Larson then hit Anthony McComb 
in the left corner of the end zone for the two-point conversion as Birmingham 
pulled to within 24-22 with 3:04 left. Canoga Park (0-2) recovered an onside 
kick at Birmingham's 48, but Scott Byrd -- who rushed for 92 yards in 20 
carries -- fumbled on the next play and Birmingham recovered at its 42 with 
2:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
The fun was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park's Bobby Hines' intercepted Larson's first pass, but the play was 
nullified by a pass-interference penalty. After Brescher dropped a pass that 
would have given Birmingham a first down on a third-and-eight play, Larson's 
scrambling bootleg on fourth down netted 11 yards and a first down. 
</P>
<P>
Larson (13 of 27 passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns) then hit Brescher for 
a 21-yard gain and a first down at the nine with 1:04 left, setting the stage 
for Larson's game-winning dash.

KENNEDY WINS ON LAST PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching his team score nine points in the final 17 seconds left Kennedy High 
Coach Bob Francola in an understandably effusive mood. About the only comment 
Francola could manage was a slightly rhetorical question. 
</P>
<P>
"Was that worth the price of admission or what?" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Jason Rosen nailed a 35-yard field goal with no time left to give 
Kennedy a 39-36 win over Crenshaw in a nonconference game Thursday night at 
Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 36-30, Kennedy (1-2) took possession with 4:08 to play. Sparked by 
tailback Ontiwaun Carter -- who gained 267 yards in 40 carries and scored four 
touchdowns -- the Golden Cougars drove to the Crenshaw 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 seconds left, Kennedy quarterback Tony Vazquez lobbed a touchdown pass 
to Rosen, who beat a pair of Crenshaw defenders on the play. Rosen had lined up 
on the wrong side of the field prior to the snap and was waved over to the 
right side of the formation by Vazquez. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen's extra-point attempt, however, was blocked. Francola elected to try an 
onside kick on the ensuing kickoff rather than squib the ball downfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, yes, we used the onside kick," Francola said. "We played to win, not 
tie, this game." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Conley recovered Rosen's onside kick at the Crenshaw 48. Crenshaw Coach 
Robert Garrett was flagged for two consecutive unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalties, which moved the ball to the Crenshaw 18 and set the stage for 
Rosen's kick. Garrett argued that Crenshaw had recovered the onside kick and 
that Conley had taken it away after the whistle blew. 
</P>
<P>
Carter and Kennedy were nearly upstaged by Crenshaw running back Kevin Hicks, 
who gained 229 yards in 22 carries and scored on runs of 47 and three yards. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Hicks' lone mistake of the game that almost won it for Crenshaw 
(2-1). On a first-and-10 play at the Crenshaw 49, Hicks fumbled, but the ball 
was picked up on the dead run by fullback Charles Brown, who raced 51 yards 
down the right sideline to give Crenshaw a 36-30 lead with 4:11 left. 
Quarterback Derrick Williams fumbled the snap on Crenshaw's two-point 
conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw led, 30-22, at the end of the third quarter, but Kennedy tied the 
score with 11:16 to play on a nine-yard run up the middle by Carter and a 
two-point conversion run by Carter. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Carter looked like he was going to single-handedly put 
the game out of reach. The junior tailback gained 102 yards in 14 carries and 
scored on runs of nine and 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A power outage in the second quarter might have cost Carter the school 
single-game rushing record of 279 yards, held by Edwin Jones. Carter scored on 
a 22-yard run with 9:23 left in the first half, but the field lights went out 
after Carter broke through the line. The run was disallowed.

BEVERLY HILLS DROPS BALL 6 TIMES AND ROLLING HILLS PICKS UP A VICTORY, 21-14

<P>
Beverly Hills High converted three Rolling Hills' turnovers into touchdowns, 
and that was enough to give the Normans a 21-14 victory in a Bay League 
football opener Thursday afternoon at Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
After three impressive wins, Rolling Hills (3-1) turned the ball over six times 
as Beverly Hills (2-2) took advantage of the miscues. The Normans took the lead 
for good late in the third quarter after a botched Rolling Hills punt. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied 8-8, Rolling Hills punter Steve Archibald failed to handle 
a high snap on fourth-and-25 and was tackled for a 10-yard loss deep in Titan 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills steadily advanced the ball on the running of Greg Holmes, who 
capped the drive with a one-yard touchdown to give the Normans their first lead 
of the day. Jeff Alford's extra point made it 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly win, but it was a win," Beverly Hills Co-Coach Dick Billingsley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills rallied late in the game, but came up short. In the fourth 
quarter, Greg Schwartz returned an Alford punt 33 yards to give the Titans the 
ball on the Norman 35. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills pounded the ball inside the 5, and running back Robert Coulter 
scored from three yards out to pull the Titans within one, 15-14, with 6:05 
left in the game. Coach Gary Kimbrell elected to go for two points, but 
quarterback Bill DeMucci's pass to Schwartz could only gain one yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' final threat ended when John Song intercepted a DeMucci pass and 
retuned it 75 yards as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell said his team's "inept play" was the difference in the game, but it 
was Beverly Hills that looked inept at the outset. Quarterback Robby Welles 
fumbled the center snap on the first play from scrimmage, setting up a 30-yard 
touchdown run by Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills set up its first touchdown when Coulter, who rushed for 80 yards, 
fumbled the opening kickoff of the second half, giving the Normans the ball on 
the Titan 20. Three plays later, Welles hit Song with a 22-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team passed effectively. DeMucci was five for 22 for 61 yards and three 
interceptions, while Welles was five for 20 for 58 yards and three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills running back Dan Edwards led all rushers with 83 yards, despite 
leaving the game in the third quarter with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica 20, Torrance 15 -- Quarterback Bob Aylsworth's seven-yard run with 
3:52 remaining gave the Vikings the victory in the Bay League opener for both 
teams at Torrance. The play capped an 80-yard drive as Santa Monica overcame a 
15-point second-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars, paced by fullback Tony Da Costa's 129 yards rushing, led 15-14 at 
halftime. Da Costa's two-yard run opened the scoring for Torrance in its first 
possession. The score was set up by Da Costa's 48-yard run. The Tartars' only 
other score came off Carlos Hilliard's seven-yard touchdown in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings countered as Aylsworth threw his first of two touchdown passes, a 
two-yard toss to Robert Reese in the second quarter. Aylsworth also connected 
with his brother John in the second quarter on a 15-yard pass and two-point 
conversion to bring the Vikings within one at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
In the winning drive, Bob Aylsworth completed four of five passes for 64 yards 
and carried the ball three times for 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica improved to 3-0 for the season. Torrance is 2-2. TERRY RUNZLER

N. TORRANCE WINS NARROW VICTORY OVER MORNINGSIDE

Tailback Andy Alvillar scored on a four-yard touchdown run and two-point 
conversion with 4:05 left to play Thursday night to lift previously winless 
North Torrance to an 8-7 victory over Morningside in an Ocean League football 
opener at North. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great. This is a big one for us," said North Coach Don Bohannon, whose 
team had given up 93 points in losing its three non-league games to Palos 
Verdes, Bishop Montgomery and Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But against Morningside, considered one of the favorites for the Ocean League 
crown, the Saxons were superb defensively. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids grew up tonight," Bohannon said. "We did tremendously well on 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Bohannon cited the play of defensive linemen Anthony Castro and Dennis Stevens, 
linebacker Alvillar, defensive ends Eric Becker and Ken Petty and cornerback 
Eric Hansen for helping North upset last year's league champion. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside entered the league opener with three losses but was still 
considered a powerful team based on close losses to Hawthorne and Leuzinger, 
both ranked in the Southern Section Division II poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs (0-4) opened a 7-0 lead on a short touchdown run on the first play 
of the second quarter, but were shut out the rest of the way. Morningside was 
hurt by several penalties and had one player ejected for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
North (1-3) mounted its winning drive midway through the fourth quarter from 
about its own 30-yard line. Alvillar, who finished with 22 yards rushing on 
eight carries, found success running over the right side of the line. 
</P>
<P>
His scoring run came over the right side, and the 5-foot-11, 165-pound senior 
did the same on his winning two-point conversion run. 
</P>
<P>
The North defense, which did a good job of containing Morningside's elusive 
quarterback, Ernesto Carmicle, came up with one interception by Castro and two 
fumble recoveries, including one by Alvillar. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is just a total disaster," Bohannon said of the post-game 
celebration. "We're just so excited." 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance 35, Mira Costa 7 -- West Torrance took advantage of five Mira 
Costa turnovers to beat the Mustangs, 35-7, in the Ocean League opener for both 
teams at West High. 
</P>
<P>
West quarterback John Walsh connected on 15 of 26 passes for 196 yards and 
three touchdowns to lead the Warriors, now 3-1 on the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We self-destructed," Mira Costa Coach Larry Petrill said. His team is now 2-2. 
"We turned the ball over in their territory, they had to play on a short field 
the whole night." West's longest drive was 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs' lone score came in the third quarter when Simi Fonua blocked a 
Warrior punt, then fell on the ball in the end zone. That made the score 21-7, 
but on the Mustangs' first possession of the fourth quarter, quarterback Jeff 
Diussa fumbled while pitching on an option play. 
</P>
<P>
West recovered the ball on the Mira Costa 15-yard line. Walsh hit James Kim 
from the 15 three plays later to make the score 28-7 and put the game out of 
reach. Kim also scored on a 37-yard toss from Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody played tonight," West Co-Coach John Black said. "It was a team 
victory." GREG GONZALEZ

El Camino (2-0) will travel to Orange County on Saturday for a 7 p.m. Mission 
Conference showdown against Fullerton (1-1). The Hornets, formerly No. 1 in the 
state, fell out of the Top 20 after losing to Cerritos last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors took over No. 1 after last week's victory over Orange Coast, which 
gave them a nine-game winning streak. Now they're looking for revenge against 
Fullerton, the team that handed them their last defeat on Oct. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Southwest plays host to L.A. Valley in Saturday's 1 p.m. Western State 
Conference game. The Cougars are 2-0 and in the state's Top 20 after shutting 
out West L.A. last week. Valley is 0-2 after losses to Moorpark and Mt. San 
Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars will go with Craig Manigo at quarterback. The freshman completed 13 
of 18 attempts for 181 yards and three touchdowns against West L.A. Southwest's 
defense last week limited West L.A. to 69 yards total offense.

Unranked Harbor (1-1) is home against No. 18 Bakersfield in Saturday's 7:30

Agoura 30, Burbank 14 -- Tailback Dave Caramanis scored two touchdowns at

<P>
Agoura (3-1), a Division VII team, previously had defeated Royal and Simi

SYLMAR'S CASEY DIVERSIFIES HIS PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Going to a Sylmar High game to watch Jerome Casey run the ball? 
</P>
<P>
If he's not in the backfield, don't be disappointed. Just look to either side 
of quarterback Daniel Terry. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Jerome Casey, Sylmar receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, ranked by a national publication as one of the nation's top 10 running 
backs, is being utilized as a receiver by Coach Jeff Engilman this season in an 
attempt to take advantage of the senior's talent as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We put him in the slot," Engilman said. "We'd like to show a different 
formation to free him. He's a great receiver with great speed." 
</P>
<P>
No one can argue with results. Casey carried the ball 15 times for 78 yards and 
one touchdown last week, and he also caught three passes for 97 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about being a team player," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
And the coach? 
</P>
<P>
"Two touchdowns?" Engilman said, beaming. "I'll take that." 
</P>
<P>
Silver lining dept.: Even though San Fernando has lost its first two games, 
both to Southern Section Division I opponents, Coach Tom Hernandez is sticking 
by his we'll-play-any-team-at-any-time philosophy. In fact, he insists that the 
losses can be therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
"We could very easily be 2-0 right now," he said. "We could have played a 
couple of 3-A teams like Verdugo Hills or Van Nuys, beat the heck out of them 
and thought we were a great team. Then we would have played somebody good and 
got our butt kicked. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get better. This week we'll be better." 
</P>
<P>
Next up is a road game tonight with Southern Section Division I member St. 
Paul, a 30-14 loser to Fontana last week. San Fernando lost to Fontana, 35-9, 
in its opener two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get the idea that Hernandez excuses the losses, however. In fact, the 
loud roar heard around San Fernando High over the past few days was probably 
Hernandez warming up his vocal cords. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hernandez on Monday morning: "I've been looking forward to today's 
practice since I got up on Saturday morning. We're gonna make some changes 
today and straighten some things out." 
</P>
<P>
New discovery: After scoring 25 points in its first two games, Royal was 
looking for some offense. "We thought our offense needed a little something," 
Coach Gene Uebelhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
What he got was a big something -- in the person of sophomore Ryan Fien 
(pronounced FEEN). The transfer from Riverside Poly was promoted from the 
junior varsity to spruce up the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
Fien (6-foot-2 1/2, 170 pounds) is a pure drop-back passer who did not figure 
to make his varsity debut until next season. But, in Royal's 19-12 loss to 
Arroyo Grande, Fien completed 11 of 17 passes for 165 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a varsity football player from now on," Uebelhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Charlie Snyder, who is still better at running Royal's option offense, 
will play wide receiver and defensive back when he is not playing quarterback. 
The real decision as to who will play, Uebelhardt said, will come from opposing 
defenses, which no longer will be able to stack against the run. 
</P>
<P>
Giving offenses the heebie-DBs: Granada Hills' secondary may be young, but 
according to co-Coach Darryl Stroh, the foursome is a bunch of not-so-teeny 
boppers. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of them will hit you, that's for sure," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
And after two games, the secondary has hit quarterbacks the hardest, 
intercepting four passes -- and four that could have been caught were dropped 
by Franklin last week. 
</P>
<P>
Of starters Derrick Stewart, Leon Glasgow, Eric Moss and Robert Haywood, only 
Glasgow is a senior. The others are juniors. Haywood and Stewart started last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we get these guys into next season, they might be the best I've 
ever had," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Add changes: As if the Hart passing attack isn't confusing enough to opponents, 
it now employs two additional features. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's 14-13 win over Palmdale, quarterback Rob Westervelt took the snap 
from a shotgun formation. "It gives him a little extra time on third and long," 
Coach Mike Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
And, quite likely, keeps Westervelt on his feet longer. A week earlier, Crespi 
sacked him four times for 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt also has been given the option to call audibles at the line of 
scrimmage. He called about a dozen against Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we could get past their man coverage," Herrington said. "He (called 
audibles) a number of times but just couldn't connect. Most were correct 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed: Montclair Prep (3-0) has been stealing headlines and ravaging 
opponents, but league rival Village Christian has embarked on a mission of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
With last Saturday's 20-6 win over Murphy -- the team Coach Mike Plaisance 
thought would be his toughest foe, excluding Montclair Prep -- Village 
Christian improved to 3-0. The Crusaders' defense has not allowed more than one 
touchdown in a game. 
</P>

ABC briefly considered putting its "Chicken Soup" star Jackie Mason on its 
"PrimeTime Live" news program Thursday night to discuss his controversial 
comments regarding the mayoral race in New York, but ultimately rejected the 
idea, network officials said. Mason, whose comedy centers on Jewish themes, was 
roundly criticized by Jewish organizations and other groups after he was quoted 
in the Village Voice saying that mayoral candidate David N. Dinkins "looks like 
a black model without a job" and suggested that Jews vote for blacks out of 
guilt. ABC officials had no comment about Mason's remarks or about how it may 
affect his new sitcom. "Chicken Soup" executive producer Saul Turteltaub said 
he had no idea whether the comments would hurt the show, saying, "It's up to 
the viewers." DANIEL CERONE

The nations of Eastern Europe and Western Europe join forces Saturday for three 
days to combat an onslaught of U.S. television serials and Japanese TV 
technology. About 1,500 producers, directors and engineers from 27 nations will 
gather in Paris to find ways of boosting European programs and television 
technology. "What would remain of our cultural identity if audiovisual Europe 
consisted of European consumers sitting in front of Japanese TV sets showing 
American programs?" France's European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson said. 
Foreign ministers from the European Community and other West European nations 
plus the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia will use the meeting as a 
launch pad for joint production and distribution projects. DANIEL CERONE

Jerry Dunphy, perhaps the most well-known face on the local news scene, will 
begin anchoring Disney-owned KHJ Channel 9's 8 and 9 p.m. newscasts on Nov. 6. 
The veteran anchorman, who most recently led KABC Channel 7 to a decade at the 
top of the news ratings heap, signed a record-breaking, multimillion dollar 
contract with KHJ in July. Pat Harvey, formerly an anchor in Chicago, will 
co-anchor the broadcast with Dunphy, and the station said Thursday the two of 
them will assume the primary anchoring responsibilities when the station 
unveils its three-hour prime-time newscast in January. A station spokeswoman 
said the fate of current anchors Tom Lawrence, Lonnie Lardner and Linda Edwards 
has not been determined. DANIEL CERONE

FANTASY REIGNS IN INVENTIVE 'QUEEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some time now, American films have become less and less hospitable to 
whimsy or fantasy. Once the truffles of the film world, fantasy has come to 
mean hardware, generally so overproduced that it sinks of its own weight, while 
whimsy perished for lack of nourishment years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So it's particularly nice to see that the imported "Queen of Hearts" (Westside 
Pavilion), a thoroughly inventive and rewarding comedy-fantasy, is unafraid of 
either of these delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
Opening among the towers and spires of Gimignano, a medieval town near 
Florence, "Queen of Hearts" soon flies, like its desperate lovers, to London's 
present-day Italian quarter. That's where our 10-year-old hero, Eddie Lucca, 
and his sprawling family live, up over the Lucky Cafe, their pride as well as 
their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
But first, in Gimignano, we meet Eddie's parents, Danilo (Joseph Long) and Rosa 
(Anita Zagaria), our faithful, fateful lovers. In this prologue, Rosa's fierce 
little mama has betrothed her to Barbariccia, the town's richest bachelor, but 
Rosa, who loves Danilo, will have none of it. Hounded by the entire village, 
the two lovers make a suicidal leap after deciding they cannot live without 
each other. Somehow, magically, they -- and we -- are flying to London where, 
over the course of the film's 20 years, their family and their little cafe will 
become part of the heartbeat of the Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Tony Grisoni's screenplay is a delight: fresh, charming, not 
infrequently poignant. The Luccas are at the movie's center and director Jon 
Amiel has filled in around them with a sketchbook's worth of faces: 
grandfathers, grandmothers, aunts, uncles, cousins and might-as-well-be family 
members. Small, big-eyed, dark-haired Eddie (Ian Hawkes), youngest of the four 
Lucca children, is our omnipresent narrator and resident mischief maker. 
(Imagine an Italian Lukas Haas and you have a fair idea of Eddie's charm.) 
</P>
<P>
Eddie's best friend, red-haired Beetle (Tat Whalley), is a whiz at anything 
electric. We watch as a vast family wedding is enlivened by the boys' talents 
at generating small electric shocks, while Amiel sets up the whole event to 
look like some squirming corner of a Hieronymus Bosch canvas. (Amiel has 
already had noteworthy experience in signature scenes; his most famous previous 
credit is Dennis Potter's "The Singing Detective," one of television's finest 
and most inventively staged dramatic fantasies.) 
</P>
<P>
Years whiz by, as they have a way of doing. Danilo's visiting father, Nonno 
(Vittorio Duse), becomes as much of a fixture as Rosa's grandmother, Mama 
Sibilla (Eileen Way), who never smiles. Children grow up, break their parents' 
hearts, then break their own. Suddenly, with the force of an entrance in opera, 
the vengeful Barbariccia (Vittorio Amandola) appears back on the scene. He has 
mellowed not one small bit, and the still-beautiful Rosa has never left his 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, "Queen of Hearts," an English production of an Italian family's saga, 
complete with a magical talking pig's head and a miraculous hearing aid, is as 
long on inventiveness as it is on charm; it's almost impossible to predict 
which way the story will jump. (Not even when one of its pivotal scams is as 
familiar as one from "The Sting.") 
</P>
<P>
Although the film is beautifully photographed by Mike Southon ("Paperhouse"), a 
few of grandfather Nonno's recurring dream sequences don't completely work; not 
enough to get disturbed about. Every one of its actors works superbly; most of 
them, who come from British or Italian theater, are making their English film 
debuts. (Not Vittorio Duse: In 1942 he was the lead in Visconti's "Ossessione"; 
he's 72 now and still arresting.) They are an enchanting lot.

A DOOMED LOVE COMPELS IN 'THE GIRL IN A SWING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some films -- "Wuthering Heights," "Out of Africa" and more -- must be entered 
into utterly or not at all, and "The Girl in a Swing" (selected theaters) is 
certainly one of that number. With two impassioned performances and a soaring 
musical score that heightens its mood of doomed romanticism, "The Girl in a 
Swing" is an uncommon spellbinder. It's also an all-or-nothing movie 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Like the original novel by "Watership Down's" Richard Adams, "The Girl in a 
Swing" is a contemporary love story that darkens and deepens as it unfolds. In 
its opening, Alan Desland, a bright, repressed Englishman in his early 30s, 
becomes aware of life's erotic possibilities for the very first time. Meeting a 
beautiful, bold, enigmatic young German girl working in Copenhagen, he falls in 
love -- as wildly and completely as she does. They marry in a matter of weeks 
and begin a closely shared life in England's Berkshire, idyllic until Karin 
begins to have mounting visions of menace and dread, portents he starts to 
share. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a story that condenses without sounding predictable or absurd, and 
it's neither. Nothing about "The Girl in a Swing" is predictable, especially 
its supernatural elements. Novelist Adams' power comes from his sure mixing of 
the commonplace, the sensual and the magical in a seemingly ordinary world. His 
hints about the consequences of repression have more in common with "The Turn 
of the Screw" than with films teeming with ectoplasmic manifestation. Gordon 
Hessler, a veteran director and the film's adapter, is strongest in his casting 
and his rapport with actors; in other areas he's sometimes overcautious and 
pedantic. There's nothing cautious about his two stars' performances, however. 
You may remember Rupert Frazer from "The Shooting Party" or as the 
long-separated father in "Empire of the Sun." His Alan Desland manages to 
suggest reserve without priggishness and the deepening pleasure of a man in the 
grips of full-tilt infatuation. 
</P>
<P>
As Karin, the German-born enchantress, accent and all, the sloe-eyed Meg Tilly 
is something of a revelation, even after the surprises of her performance in 
"Masquerade." Physically, Tilly may look more like Denmark's Little Mermaid 
than the goddess-like woman of the book with her aura of almost primal 
sensuality, but Tilly's direct, provocative gaze is enticing in another way and 
her conviction is absolute. 
</P>
<P>
There's a nice, confident level of civility to the production too: matters of 
art direction and production design like Desland's upper-echelon country house, 
his antiques and porcelain shop and the crucial detailing of the porcelain 
figure of the title. Only the costume design feels timid, off-the-rack or, at 
worst, designed with no discernible flair. (You might question the strange, 
overheavy cuts to the pianist at the recital the lovers go to, but who knows 
what promises are made in exchange for an appearance in a film.) 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the film's sumptuous Carl Davis music. An American who has 
lived in England for years, Davis has written music for "The French 
Lieutenant's Woman," "The Rainbow" and "Scandal," as well as the bittersweet 
themes for Thames television's "The Unknown Chaplin" and its series on Buster 
Keaton. All of it is lovely stuff, yet this score seems his finest yet. His 
work unifies the film, carries it as powerfully as Bernard Herrmann's scores 
carried Alfred Hitchcock's or Brian DePalma's thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
The care and taste of the production can be laid at the door of Just Betzer, 
who also produced "Babette's Feast." The book's fans will be relieved to know 
that Betzer and company have steered away from every lurking pitfall in matters 
of taste and judgment. Since Adams' story is about the deep-reaching power of 
unfettered, almost pagan love, with a heroine who drops her clothing as 
naturally as other women drop their inhibitions, those pitfalls may have been 
considerable. (The film is Times-rated Mature for its love scenes, frank 
language and occasional, decorous nudity.) 
</P>
<P>
Yet if the film has a flaw, it may be this very civility. Its restraint is 
admirable, but in dealing with so much modulation it necessarily loses 
ferocity. Possibly, this is a story whose telling needs to rip out all the 
stops -- something this production isn't prepared to do. It may be that film 
itself can't do what's needed here, that these are visions and demons better 
left to the printed page and the unbounded imagination. Maybe there's really no 
technique that could take this story to new levels of expressiveness. It's just 
that "The Girl in the Swing" is good enough that it makes you wish it could.

'WAR PARTY' REVIVES A TRAGIC AMERICAN GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time-honored game of cowboys 'n' Indians is revived with self-consciously 
tragic results in "War Party" (citywide), which, for all its appealing players, 
tense action and intriguing plot devices, is not the feel-good hit of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The setup is unique but strangely familiar: In modern-day Wyoming, a small band 
of youthful Blackfeet is being methodically hunted down in the wilderness for 
an ill-perceived crime against white men. Those lawmen brave or silly enough to 
come after them meet extremely violent resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma facing the befuddled Indian heroes toward the morally ambiguous 
climax is whether to surrender or to fight to the finish, either way 
perpetuating centuries of historically gory injustice. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is just what it sounds like: "First Blood" meets "Do the Right 
Thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Sly-versus-Spike clash of sensibilities is an irresistibly bizarre one, but 
both those predecessors had queasy resolutions that were felt by many viewers 
to be troublesome. And terrific as much of the buildup in "War Party" is, you 
just know there's no conceivable way the film makers will have come up with a 
climax worthy of its crescendo. And you're right. 
</P>
<P>
For its first half or so, though, "War Party" shapes up to be one of the 
shrewdest, uncanniest, nerviest action pictures of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Director Franc Roddam has worked with small youth ensembles before 
("Quadrophenia," "Lords of Discipline"), and there is telling detail in the way 
he and writer Spencer Eastman show an Indian community through the eyes of its 
youth, who sense that their parents have sold their souls to blend in with the 
white municipality but aren't quite aware just how much heritage has been shed. 
</P>
<P>
These kids aren't particularly bright, or brave; like their 
soon-to-be-mortal-enemy Anglo counterparts in the town, they like to drink and 
smoke dope and indulge in casual foreplay on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
A prologue portraying the systematic slaughter of an Indian tribe 100 years 
earlier segues into the arrival of long-haired lead player Sonny Crowkiller 
(Billy Wirth) in a pickup truck, listening to a rock tape that any young white 
stoner might have on -- a quintessential '70s party anthem with Free's Paul 
Rodgers singing "Baby, it's all right now . . . we're so happy together!" 
</P>
<P>
The irony in that nice touch is subtle but clear, and it's established early on 
that, for all the surface assimilation, there's trouble brewing between the two 
races that will explode in violence. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion comes when a 100-year-old battle between Indians and settlers is 
re-enacted to lure tourists during a centennial celebration. (The ease with 
which the Blackfeet agree to re-create a battle in which their forefathers were 
wiped out is implausible, but no matter.) 
</P>
<P>
One malcontent drunk decides to shoot-'em-up for real, and before anyone can 
figure out what happened, violence is begetting violence and history is 
skipping on its groove, as Wirth and Kevin Dillon and two other Indian males 
retreat on horseback to the woods, planeloads and truckloads of vigilante 
locals close behind. 
</P>
<P>
The cross-cutting between hunters and prey is initially nerve-wracking, then 
drags. The appearance late in the game of a bounty hunter played by M. Emmet 
Walsh -- a character actor who has saved many a movie -- promises a pick-me-up, 
but he actually slows this one down, since his character has so little to do 
with the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Offering even less of an assist is an alcoholic medicine man who plays much the 
same Greek-chorus function as the town drunk in Spike Lee's movie, only far 
less successfully. And in this case, the final act of doing the right thing 
seems far more senseless than anything Lee could have concocted on a 
mind-bendingly hot day. 
</P>
<P>
Roddam and Eastman deserve credit for having the courage of their convictions 
in not trying to paste a sunny resolution onto their bleak (and justifiably 
R-rated) story. But while their "War" goes out with a literal bang, it wraps up 
with a symbolic whimper, one that finally seems to exploit a situation begging 
to be treated without war-whooping cliches or fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
It's their "Party," and they'll cry if they want to; real-life Indians may be 
excused for failing to RSVP.

NORMAN OPENS SEASON, GRANDLY, UNEVENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jessye Norman, who opened the concert season at Ambassador Auditorium on 
Wednesday with a little help from some friends, doesn't have to think small. 
She is a grandiose woman with a grandiose talent. 
</P>
<P>
She exults in the simple joy of divahood. She basks in automatic, delirious 
adulation before she can utter a tone. She turns easy essays into complex 
dramas. She strikes lofty poses and sculpts pretty phrases in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she offers revelations. Sometimes she resorts to distortions. Either 
way, she is interesting. 
</P>
<P>
In a day when so many singers are content to be bland technicians, and not 
necessarily deft technicians at that, she remains an undoubted presence. She 
exhibits character, and she has ideas. 
</P>
<P>
She commands the stage instantly. She seizes the music, dares the listener not 
to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that she turns everything she attempts into sonic 
gold. On this occasion, she seemed tired and out of sorts during the first half 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever possible, she opted for low keys and slow tempos. Her tone emerged a 
bit raspy. High climaxes were tentative. Pitch became precarious, breath 
insecure. 
</P>
<P>
Cleopatra's "Piangero" served as a ponderous Handelian prelude for four Strauss 
Lieder submerged in lugubrious Sprechgesang. The intimate sensuality of four 
Duparc songs proved more congenial, but even here one could have hoped for more 
shimmer and better legato. 
</P>
<P>
Vocal matters improved after intermission. In Ravel's "Sheherazade," Norman's 
soprano -- or is it really an extended mezzo-soprano? -- sounded lush, the 
expressive allure natural. Linda Chesis added exotic flute colors in the 
composer's own chamber-music transcription. Here, as elsewhere, Dan Saunders 
provided robust yet sensitive piano accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Falla's "Siete canciones populares espanolas" closed the official portion of 
the program. Pepe Romero had arranged the original piano part for guitar, a 
virtuosic feat. He performed with authentic elan. 
</P>
<P>
The necessary reduction in tone and scope tended, alas, to trivialize the basic 
passions. Under the circumstances, Norman had two unsatisfactory choices: She 
could either scale down her solos or overpower the guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the cycle, she held back. She sang beautifully, flirted both with 
the line and with her gallant collaborator, pointed the rhetoric with telling 
nuances, but muted the flamboyant impact. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the final "Polo," she let rip with chesty snarls and marvelous growls. 
In the process, she brought down the house, and all but blasted Romero off the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
The three encores included two habaneras: Ravel's sinuous "Vocalise," 
exquisitely performed, and Carmen's inevitable cliche, unintentionally 
caricatured. Norman -- whose controversial recording of Bizet's greatest hit 
has just been released -- indulged in slides, sighs, whispers, yelps, lyrical 
evasions and other snail's pace mannerisms that bordered on the grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be seduction number was followed by the inevitable benediction, "He's 
Got The Whole World in His Hands." Standing ovations and floral tributes were 
forgone conclusions.

Robert Rauschenberg spun off some great graphic riffs at Gemini G.E.L. between 
1967 and 1988. A two-gallery exhibition chronicles the artist's varying 
approaches and the clarity or obscurity of his visual and mental games. 
</P>
<P>
John Cage once likened Rauschenberg's work to many TV sets all playing 
different stations at once, and lithographs from the '60s are all raffish 
reportage. In "Test Stone No. 2," grainy black images of Charles Lindbergh, a 
military funeral and a vintage truck are overlaid with painterly marks and a 
footprint. 
</P>
<P>
Forms of technology enter into works from the '70s like "Publicon Station V," a 
box lit inside by a red light bulb. With wedges of red, white and blue metal, a 
bicycle wheel and snappy swatches of fabric, the piece has an brash, outgoing 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Work generally gets larger and more vivid in the '80s, with a new fixation on 
fabrics in the "Samarkand" series and the subtle layering of illuminated 
translucent surfaces in the "Sling Shots Lit" series. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then, Rauschenberg chased down a wrong corridor. For a while, he 
seemed to fancy himself as a sort of second-rate Robert Motherwell, fashioning 
vacantly elegant arrangements of handmade paper. Very occasionally his methods 
seem too guileless, as in "Tibetan Locks," a multiple wall relief from 1987 
that contains only the big cadences of large color photographs. 
</P>
<P>
But the sweep and extraordinary brilliance of this body of work cannot be 
denied. A generation of artists is indebted to Rauschenberg. (Manny Silverman 
Gallery, 800 N. La Cienega Blvd., and Fred Hoffman Gallery, 912 Colorado Ave., 
both to Oct. 14.) CATHY CURTIS

The redoubtably named Luhring Augustine Hetzler gallery -- a partnership of New 
York-based Luhring Augustine and Cologne-based Max Hetzler -- has opened in 
Santa Monica with recent work by Los Angeles artist Stephen Prina. Suitably 
enough, one of his pieces is "Inaugural Mailing List," a boxed set of 
invitations to the show stuffed in postmarked envelopes and addressed from 
merged mailing lists. The notion of treating a basic component of art gallery 
business as a study in ordering and classification is particularly Prina-esque. 
</P>
<P>
A series of 24 identically-sized, computer-created prints gradually spell out a 
slogan reeking of corporate paternalism: "It's in your own best interests." 
Each piece, made of closely aligned horizontal strokes of blue or black graphic 
marker dye, contains either a graphic design (portions of the letters in the 
message) or a "blank" field of dye. The diskette that gave birth to the series 
is on view too, a mute, inanimate Maker in its own plexiglass display case. 
</P>
<P>
The show also contains seven works from Prina's "Exquisite Corpse: The Complete 
Paintings of Manet." Each framed piece of paper swizzled with ink wash is the 
same size as a particular Manet. The viewer's devilishly taxing project is to 
re-imagine these paintings in their museum setting. (Luhring Augustine Hetzler, 
1330 4th St., to Oct. 25.) CATHY CURTIS

Negotiators for the telephone company NYNEX turned down offers by their 
striking unions to make contract concessions on wages to offset the telephone 
company's demand that workers share the rising costs of health insurance. The 
development came as the two sides met for the first time in almost two weeks. 
The bitter telephone strike in New York state and New England was winding up 
its eighth week with no new rounds of talks scheduled. "The unions made an 
offer which we unfortunately have had to turn down," said NYNEX spokesman 
Robert O'Brien in New York.

More than 600 abandoned children were murdered in 19 months of urban violence 
in Brazil, according to report presented at a conference in Brasilia, the 
capital. About 12 million children live on the streets of Brazil. Hundreds of 
street children from seven Latin American nations gathered at the 
U.N.-sponsored conference to discuss their plight. In its report, the National 
Movement of Street Boys and Girls gave details of a study that showed 624 
children under the age of 17 were murdered on the streets of Brazil between 
January, 1988, and July, 1989. It said 24% of the murders were committed by 
death squads.

Arturo Durazo, the former Mexico City police chief who was said to have made 
millions of dollars from extortion, smuggling and drug dealing, was sentenced 
to six years in prison on arms possession charges. Durazo, the police chief 
from 1976 to 1982, has already served five years but still faces sentencing on 
charges of fraud, smuggling and extortion. Durazo said he will appeal the 
ruling by Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco. The former chief was charged with 
illegally possessing 52 pistols. However, he said that as police chief he had a 
right to keep weapons. Durazo fled Mexico after his friend, President Jose 
Lopez Portillo, left office. FBI agents arrested him in 1984, and in 1986 he 
was extradited from Los Angeles.

Vice President Dan Quayle called for all-out support for non-Communist 
resistance factions in Cambodia to help prevent a comeback by the Khmer Rouge. 
Speaking in Malaysia at the end of a four-nation Asian tour, Quayle declined to 
say whether his comments mean the United States has been sending military 
assistance to those factions. He told reporters that "I want to reaffirm our 
strong support for the non-Communist resistance. We need to make sure that they 
have credibility, that they have resources, that they can participate 
efficiently in a resolution in Cambodia." The Khmer Rouge was blamed for 1 
million deaths during its 1975-78 rule.

Israel formally outlawed the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement Hamas, 
clearing the way for prosecution of its jailed founders and tougher action 
against Muslim fundamentalists. An Israeli Defense Ministry statement said: 
"The Hamas movement, the Muslim Brotherhood's violent arm, which has been 
operating under different names in the (occupied) territories, was today 
declared illegal in Judea-Samaria (the West Bank), the Gaza district and 
Israel." The order makes membership in Hamas and helping the group a criminal 
offense.

BAKKER TO TAKE STAND IN HIS TRIAL TODAY

Jim Bakker will take the stand today to defend himself against fraud and 
conspiracy charges, his lawyers said after presenting about 50 character 
witnesses on behalf of the PTL founder. Bakker is expected to be the last 
defense witness. "It could have been today (Thursday), we're going tomorrow," 
defense attorney George T. Davis said when asked by reporters if Bakker would 
take the stand. Meanwhile, the federal judge in the trial in Charlotte, N.C., 
refused to allow the jury to tour the Heritage USA retreat built by the 
disgraced television evangelist. "It would be a waste of time and serve no 
purpose for the 18 people on the jury to go see it," U.S. District Court Judge 
Robert Potter said.

U.S. VISAS TO PLO PROTESTED

U.S. Jewish organizations protested the granting of U.S. visas to three 
Palestine Liberation Organization leaders to attend the U.N. General Assembly 
this year. "The three PLO representatives who have received visas are among the 
most radical members of the PLO leadership," said a statement from the 
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. "Their record 
of terrorist activity and rejectionist statements makes clear that they come 
not in the cause of peace, but of propaganda," the statement said. Seymour D. 
Reich, chairman of the conference, said: "These are not the words or deeds of 
peacemakers, but rather of violent men. . . ."

A Christian group announced plans for scores of anti-abortion protests in the 
United States and Canada this weekend, and said its targets for the first time 
would include Planned Parenthood offices. The Christian Action Council -- whose 
founders in 1975 included C. Everett Koop, who later served as surgeon general 
-- said unlike recent protests by Operation Rescue that have led to hundreds of 
arrests, its fifth annual Pastors' Protest Against Abortion would not include 
civil disobedience. "These are lawful and peaceful protests," said Thomas 
Glessner, executive director of the Protestant group based in Fairfax, Va. "We 
support the goals of Operation Rescue to end abortion in America. We differ on 
strategy."

Contending that a seldom-used, 200-year-old law violates their rights to equal 
protection of the law, some Vietnamese fisherman filed suit in San Francisco to 
stop the Coast Guard from enforcing the Jones Act, a measure forbidding 
non-citizens from piloting commercial fishing boats. The lawsuit names six 
former Vietnamese citizens who have been fishing in California since their 
arrival in the early 1980s. Attorney Dennis Hayashi of the Asian Law Caucus 
said the act was originally approved by Congress so the government could 
commandeer fishing boats in wartime and had not been enforced in decades, until 
the Coast Guard recently began ordering vessels back to port. Coast Guard 
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. John Jaskot denied that the Vietnamese have been singled 
out and insisted that the agency is simply carrying out its obligation to 
enforce existing laws without passing judgment.

A right-wing terrorist group called the White Hand has resurfaced in Guatemala 
and sent death threats to at least 100 people, the Guatemala Flash radio 
reported. It said the White Hand sent statements to various local newspapers 
and radio stations, threatening to strike soon against members of the National 
Assembly, other public officials and private sector leaders. The group 
originally surfaced in 1960, and authorities have blamed it for kidnapings and 
killings of several liberal political leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education is expected to vote Monday on a proposal 
from district students that is designed to increase participation in senior 
proms and reduce their cost. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of students this week presented the board with a series of 
recommendations, including a proposal that students sign a code of conduct 
promising to stay off drugs and alcohol on prom night. 
</P>
<P>
The board will vote on the guidelines, which were drafted at the urging of 
board member Roberta Weintraub, at Monday's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Included are suggestions encouraging students to open interest-bearing savings 
accounts to save the money for prom-related expenses which, according to an 
informal district survey, averaged $900 per couple last year. Another proposal 
asked the board to revise rules to allow senior classes to apply up to 50% of 
the profits from class fund-raisers to defray prom costs.

NRA, ABORTION FOES PLAN LAST-DITCH SMEAR OPERATION, SAYS HUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Republican nominee in next week's 76th Assembly District election charged 
Thursday that she was being targeted by a last-minute smear campaign funded by 
the National Right to Life Committee and the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Tricia Hunter said her office anonymously received a schedule of planned 
last-minute hit pieces indicating the two national groups are spending a 
combined total of $163,000 to send out 11 campaign pieces that would benefit 
write-in candidate Dick Lyles, a more conservative Republican who placed second 
to Hunter in October's primary. The election is Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The purported schedule -- which listed the dates, nature and costs of the 
mailings -- was typed beneath the letterhead of the National Right to Life 
Committee. It listed 11 mailings scheduled to arrive in mailboxes in the 
district beginning Wednesday and running through Monday. Beside a brief 
description of the material was, in parentheses, the notation of either "NRA" 
or "NRTL." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heston Telegram Listed 
</P>
<P>
Among the listings were a "(Charlton) Heston Telegram -- (NRTL)" scheduled to 
be mailed today for delivery on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's campaign staff said the first possible such piece arrived Thursday -- 
a letter from Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado). The purported schedule called 
for a "Duncan Hunter Letter -- (NRA)." But there was no indication in the 
letter that it came from, or was financed by, the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
The letter chastised Republicans for nominating a "liberal" to represent the 
party in the runoff. But it did not appear to be a political hit piece. Its 
most stinging line, for instance, read: "By electing liberal candidates in 
solidly conservative Republican districts, we are sending Republicans to the 
Assembly who will side with groups like NOW (National Organization for Women) 
and ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) in supporting predominantly Democrat 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' campaign staff said it had no knowledge of that letter, which apparently 
was addressed to (Republican) "Central Committee member." Duncan Hunter's 
office could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles, unlike Tricia Hunter, opposes abortion and gun control and already has 
received some assistance from the two organizations. But Lyles said Thursday he 
knows of no last-minute campaigning by the NRA and the National Right to Life 
Committee on his behalf, and said he would be stunned if it materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"This campaign has gotten its source of energy from people's prayers," Lyles 
said. "If $163,000 were to be spent for me on the last weekend, I'd be the 
first to proclaim that a miracle occurred. I can't imagine that it would 
happen, but, if it does, we'll start planning the victory party right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Groups Deny Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Political action advisers for both organizations, however, vehemently denied 
any such last-minute campaign activity. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gardner, director of state and local affairs for the NRA in Washington, 
said the powerful lobbying group, although already having contributed $10,000 
to Lyles' candidacy, "absolutely is not involved" in any last-minute 
campaigning on behalf of Lyles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sent letters to our members in the district endorsing Lyles, and 
that's all we've done," Gardner said of a previous effort. "We have engaged in 
no independent expenditure campaign and don't intend to and will not do so. We 
have not, and will not -- and any decision would have been made by me and no 
one else." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the National Right to Life Committee said the organization 
already spent $5,000 for a mailing that was sent out earlier this week to 
selected voters, but planned no other action other than to ask supporters to 
volunteer on Lyles' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a joke to me," said Janet Carroll, associate Western director 
of the organization, after seeing the schedule. "It's our letterhead, all 
right, but we'd never do anything in conjunction with another group, unless it 
was another right-to-life organization. Someone has taken our letterhead and 
put these mailings on it. 
</P>
<P>
"If whoever put this out is claiming it came out of our office, that is the 
smear. We'll send this to our attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Mattes, assistant for political action for the organization, added: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the kind of money to make those kinds of expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter campaign aide Rob Lapsley said Thursday that his staff members first 
"got a whiff" of the expected mailings Tuesday and confirmed it to their 
satisfaction Wednesday when they received the purported schedule of the 
mailings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoping Groups Will 'Back Off' 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that now that we know about it, they'll back off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why opponents would deny -- or cancel -- a campaign mailing just because 
the target of it learned of it beforehand, Lapsley said: "We don't know. We're 
watching the mail very closely, though. The answer will be in the mail. But, if 
you were doing a smear campaign, won't you deny it first and deal with it after 
the election, rather than admit it beforehand?" 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, citing the purported schedule, said, "It is obvious that these two 
extremist groups are setting up a very expensive last-minute smear campaign 
based entirely on personal attacks against me . . . not allowing me enough time 
to provide the voters with a fair response." 
</P>
<P>
October's primary election attracted national interest because it pitted 
competing Republicans who were on different sides of the fence on the abortion 
issue -- a critical matter, given the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that 
gave states new powers to regulate abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In that primary, Hunter defeated Lyles by a scant 197-vote margin, putting her 
on the runoff ballot against Democrat Jeannine Correia, who, like Hunter, holds 
a pro-choice stance on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles, stung by the defeat when he had openly predicted victory, has since 
mounted his write-in campaign to the consternation of Republicans who fear he 
will take some of the Republican votes from Hunter and allow a Democrat to win 
in the heavily Republican district, which runs from the South Bay into the 
desert communities of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The election will fill the vacancy created by the death of Assemblyman Bill 
Bradley (R-Escondido) last June.

CRITICISM OF SDSU IMPERIAL VALLEY CAMPUS MAY BRING CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A critical outside review of academic offerings and the physical plant at the 
Imperial Valley campus of San Diego State University will result in a 
reappraisal of the direction the Calexico facility should take and what 
additional state funding might be required. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU educators agreed this week with the sharp criticisms made last spring by 
the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges that said the satellite campus offers 
too many courses with too few professors, has dilapidated buildings with 
peeling paint and poor acoustics, and an inadequate library to support its 
class offerings. The university commented publicly on the WASC findings for the 
first time this week. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Johnson, SDSU vice president for academic affairs, said many of the 
shortcomings were cited in an internal May, 1988, report by San Diego State 
educators trying to get a handle on problems in the Imperial Valley, which he 
called a "one of a kind" arrangement in the state. San Diego State is the only 
Cal State university with satellite campuses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Established in 1960 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said a special committee of San Diego State and California State 
University officials will look at short- and long-range ideas to improve the 
campus, which was established in 1960 to offer upper-division undergraduate 
courses and graduate courses in teacher education. Those recommendations could 
include closer ties with Imperial Community College, the region's only other 
post-secondary institution, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The dean of the Imperial Valley campus, David Ballesteros, said, "What needs to 
be emphasized is that we are part of the state of California, even though we 
happen to be along the border and have a large Hispanic population, and 
therefore we deserve the best in education just like everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The campus today offers nine undergraduate majors and a graduate degree in 
educational administration, with 21 full-time professors for 420 students, 
about 60% undergraduate, 73% women and 53% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the campus' small size -- San Diego State's main campus has 35,000 
students and its upper-division North County center 2,000 students -- it has 
found itself with several academic departments having only one full-time 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland-based WASC, which accredits universities in the West, said the tiny 
departments mean that students cannot receive the necessary depth in a 
particular field. In response, the university is attempting to merge department 
offerings into several interdisciplinary majors such as social studies or 
general humanities. In that manner, the school can offer thematic courses that 
draw upon a historian, a sociologist, a political scientist or an economist -- 
in contrast to a specific major such as economics, which would require several 
professors in the field to cover the courses necessary for the specialized 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stronger Curriculum 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a realistic restructuring" to meet some of the concerns of the 
WASC, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Weiner, WASC executive director for university accrediting, agreed that a 
broader interdisciplinary offerings could result in a stronger curriculum 
without having to add substantially to the faculty. The WASC will review 
progress in three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Ballesteros cautioned that too few majors may cause problems with state 
requirements that teachers planning to work in secondary schools have academic 
majors in specific fields rather than across disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
And he said the larger issue is how to make the campus attractive to more 
students -- many of whom do not want to leave the valley -- by offering more 
majors and graduate degrees in subjects related to the growing binational ties 
between Mexicali and the Imperial Valley. Ballesteros suggested criminal 
justice, business, public administration and health as potential new 
disciplines that could meet valley needs. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are probably the four areas that are saleable in the valley," he said. 
"I don't think we're going to be able to propose a general (four-year) liberal 
arts/science curriculum" in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros said "all of this comes down to money, staffing commitment and good 
will -- which goes beyond just San Diego State. . . . We have to interpret our 
needs" better to the CSU chancellor's office and to state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that historically, there has been little or no pressure from the 
valley community for a greater share of resources, with the result that the 
number of high school students who attend either a Cal State or University of 
California campus is less than half the lowest figures in counties elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 4,000 students attend Imperial Valley Community College, but most take 
vocational courses and do not transfer to four-year institutions, Johnson said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two separate San Diego apartment fires Thursday were blamed on children playing 
with cigarette lighters, a spokeswoman for the Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4000 block of 34th Street, firefighters contained a fire about 9 a.m. in 
the bedroom of a first-floor apartment, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
A 4-year-old boy ignited bedding material while playing with a lighter, she 
said, adding that the boy, his 5-year-old sister and his mother escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the structure and contents was estimated at $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar incident, two brothers, 2 and 3 years old, reportedly started a 
fire with a lighter in the back bedroom of a second-story apartment, officials 
said. The two boys alerted their mother, and all three escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responded to the fire in the 200 block of 50th Street at 10:20 
a.m., the spokeswoman said. The apartment where the fire started was damaged 
mostly by smoke, and the lower apartment was damaged by water, she said. Total 
damage was estimated at $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross was called upon to help relocate residents of both apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Children playing with matches or lighters have been responsible for four fires 
this week, fire officials said.

ATTORNEY ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
3 CLIENTS CONTEND THEY WERE SWINDLED OUT OF $51,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Chatsworth personal injury lawyer, accused by the State Bar of embezzling at 
least $125,000 from dozens of clients, pressed an accident victim to sign a 
retainer agreement as the victim lay disabled with a brain concussion in a 
hospital bed, the former client testified in Van Nuys Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick in the hospital; I didn't know what I was doing," Patrick Boyd said 
at a preliminary hearing that concluded Thursday. "This gentleman came to see 
me and I signed some papers. I did not know what I was signing. I did not read 
it. I had a concussion." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Aviva K. Bobb ordered attorney Richard F. Murkey to stand trial on three 
felony counts of grand theft embezzlement and two felony counts of forgery for 
allegedly swindling Boyd and two other clients out of $51,000 in insurance 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey was also ordered to stand trial on two felony counts of practicing law 
after his temporary suspension from the State Bar of California in August. The 
State Bar is seeking Murkey's permanent disbarment on grounds that he kept at 
least $125,000 in insurance money belonging to more than 29 clients and their 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Both Boyd and former client Louis Patrick testified that insurance companies 
sent Boyd and Patrick's money to Murkey, who kept it. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey settled Patrick's case for $20,000 for injuries sustained when Patrick 
fell at a Venice shop. Patrick, who had $170,000 in medical bills, said he 
never agreed to settle for less than his medical expenses and received no 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said Murkey settled his case for $12,000, but "he never personally 
informed me that my case was settled. I never received a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Bank records indicate that Murkey, who filed for ankruptcy earlier this month, 
used the money for real estate investments, said Los Angeles Police Detective 
Richard Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey forged his clients' signatures to deposit the checks, prosecutors said. 
But defense attorney Sherwin C. Edelberg contended that both Boyd and Patrick 
signed retainer agreements authorizing Murkey to sign any checks they received. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, State Bar officials declared that Murkey's retainer 
agreement was unethical. 
</P>
<P>
"If a client were to legitimately empower his attorney to have the power of 
signature to endorse drafts and checks, then this should be clearly brought 
home to the client," State Bar referee Diane L. Karpman wrote. Murkey is "not a 
merchant engaging in cutthroat practices in the marketplace. He is an attorney 
and therefore owes a duty of explanation, protection and safekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Bobb reduced Murkey's bail from $500,000 to $150,000. 
Murkey, who has been in County Jail, will be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior 
Court on Oct. 12.

EX-WHITE HOUSE STAFFER; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN CHOSEN AS CURATOR OF RONALD REAGAN LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 29-year-old niece of a prominent Orange County businessman has been named 
curator of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, officials of the foundation 
building the facility said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Stefanie Salata was appointed curator within the last six weeks, Charles 
Jelloian, director of operations for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, 
said during a presentation at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Salata said during a telephone interview that she graduated from USC in 1982 
with a major in fine arts. She said she had held "various positions" for five 
years in the Reagan Administration, including working in the White House 
advance office, which makes travel and press arrangements for presidential 
trips. Salata said that she was from Covina and that she had worked on Reagan's 
1984 reelection campaign in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Salata declined to describe her White House jobs in detail and said initially 
that she did not want any information to appear in a newspaper article. "I'm 
not a public official," she said. "I don't owe anybody anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature of Job Unresolved 
</P>
<P>
When pressed repeatedly, Salata disclosed basic biographical information and 
said the nature of her responsibilities as library curator and the size of her 
staff still have to be worked out. She said she did not know if she would keep 
the position once the library is completed and turned over to the federal 
government for maintenance and operation. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that she is the niece of Paul Salata, a Newport Beach 
businessman and former star athlete at USC who played professional football for 
the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Colts. He owns Hillcrest Development 
and El Toro Material Co. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Salata and the sports foundation he organized -- Orange County 
Sports Celebrities Foundation -- came under fire for excluding women from its 
annual Sportsman of the Year banquet. Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine, and 
Orange Coast and Golden West colleges withdrew from participating in the 
popular fund-raising event because state laws prohibit the use of public funds 
for programs that discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the foundation was stripped of its tax-exempt status by state and 
federal officials after failing to file financial disclosure statements for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed library is scheduled to open Feb. 6, 1991, on Reagan's 80th 
birthday. The 153,000-square-foot facility would be the largest presidential 
library to date -- and the only one in the western part of the country -- and 
is expected to house the largest collection of Cabinet documents of any such 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential speeches, memoranda, videotapes and a host of memorabilia from the 
Reagan years in the White House are also to be stored and exhibited at the 
library, which will include a replica of the Oval Office as well as offices 
designed for daily use by the former President and his wife, Nancy, Jelloian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the library collection is already large enough that it is being held in 
two warehouses, one for archival material and one for items to be exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
Jelloian said workers have been grading the 100-acre site -- on unincorporated 
Ventura County land between the cities of Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley -- and 
recently began pouring the foundation for the basement that will serve as the 
library's archives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funded Privately 
</P>
<P>
The four-story, Spanish colonial-style structure is expected to cost between 
$40 million and $70 million, Jelloian said. About two-thirds of the 
construction cost, to be funded by private donations, has been raised so far, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A mile-long, 60-foot-wide road to be named Presidential Drive will lead from 
Madera Road to the library, which will offer panoramic views of the Santa 
Susana Mountains and, on clear days, the Pacific Ocean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 250,000 to 300,000 people are expected to visit the library each 
year -- possibly more because of Reagan's popularity, Jelloian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Foundation plans to appoint a citizens advisory committee to the 
library, which would meet to discuss issues of concern such as traffic and 
public events, according to Jelloian. He said Ventura County officials are 
being consulted on the choice of committee members. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 people attended the 30-minute slide show and presentation on the 
library in the Applied Arts Building at Moorpark College.

STRAW TRUCK HITS MOTOR HOME; 6 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A truck carrying a load of straw collided with a motor home Thursday in a 
spectacular accident near Palmdale that injured six people, three critically, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 1:50 p.m. at the intersection of Avenue T, Fort 
Tejon Road and Pearblossom Highway in Fourpoints, said Capt. Mark Hanson of the 
Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The three critically injured victims were thrown from the motor home onto the 
pavement through a hole torn in the front of the vehicle, said California 
Highway Patrol Officer Steve Plahn. 
</P>
<P>
The motor home, heading west on Avenue T, ran a red light and was in the 
intersection when struck by the truck, which was northbound on Pearblossom, 
Plahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident scene southeast of Palmdale was littered with straw bales that 
were thrown from the truck, virtually burying a car on Fort Tejon Road, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mess," Plahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The motor home's five occupants were visiting California from Putnam, Okla., 
and were en route to see relatives in Yucaipa in San Bernardino County, Plahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Wanda Leak, 68, was in critical condition at Antelope Valley Hospital 
Medical Center, said Frankie Richards, hospital spokeswoman. Also in critical 
condition at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center were the motor home driver, 
Edward Leak, 70, and passenger Gladys Cline, 74, Plahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Davis, 72, Wanda Leak's sister, and Robert Cline, 79, were treated for 
minor injuries, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck's driver, Don Lile, 46, of Lancaster, was treated at the Palmdale 
hospital for back pain, Plahn said. 
</P>
<P>
After striking the motor home, the truck swerved and spilled the straw bales, 
knocked down a light post and a traffic signal and headed into a gas station, 
stopping just short of the gasoline pumps, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost control, went through the center divider and took out a couple of 
traffic lights," said Lile, who was returning to Lancaster after picking up the 
straw in the Imperial Valley. "Everything worked out just right. It just kind 
of spun the truck around." 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car covered by the straw, George Karnazes, 48, of 
Pearblossom, was not injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A second car sustained minor damage when it drove over several bales of straw, 
and a car that was parked at the gas station was struck by debris from the 
light post hit by the truck, Plahn said.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: PASSABLE PASTAS DOMINATE AS SUBSTANCE LOSES OUT TO 
STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The menu at La Jolla's new Cafe Roma offers a short course in Italian phrases 
and eating habits, and offers such gems of information as the statement "cheese 
and seafood do not mix," which is absolutely correct in Italian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
What is incorrect in Italian terms is a menu that avoids seafood, which this 
one does con gusto. Fish may or may not be available as a daily special, but it 
appears nowhere on the standing menu. Except in the form of occasional 
specials, in fact, formal entrees of any sort are lacking on this list, which 
basically embroiders the no-frills pizza-or-pasta lineups offered by San 
Diego's oldest Italian houses. 
</P>
<P>
Proprietor Rosina Gangale first operated Leucadia's ever-popular When in Rome 
after her brother, When in Rome founder Salvatore Gangale, moved to the 
Meridian tower in downtown San Diego to open the elegant Salvatore's. 
</P>
<P>
At Cafe Roma, Rosina Gangale perpetuates the When in Rome menu of pastas 
prepared more in the style currently in favor in Rome than in the 
tomato-drenched fashion traditional in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The menu persists, but the quality of cooking at the new place seems to have 
taken a back seat to the issue of ambiance. At its best, a selection of pastas 
sampled over the course of two visits provoked the comment "it's OK" from those 
who ordered pasta; in the worst case, a serving of cannelloni, which the menu 
described as "crepes stuffed with veal and chicken," seemed like nothing so 
much as a second-rate chicken enchilada given a vague Italian accent. The 
stuffing virtuously avoided the advertised veal in favor of large chunks of 
dried-out, stringy fowl, even though cannelloni filling must be finely minced 
to be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Style has triumphed over substance here because Cafe Roma certainly seems on 
the cutting edge of trendiness. The downstairs bar seems a magnet for the 
younger set, while the upstairs dining room generally is filled with diners in 
casual finery. The management has assured that the staff will mirror the 
black-and-white decor by dressing it in black jeans and white T-shirts, which 
gives diners the impression that they are eating on a high school campus. A 
little formality would not hurt Cafe Roma. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas lack personality, but the restaurant turns in a better performance 
with the pizzas, which it bakes to a nice crispness on the brick floor of an 
oak-fired oven. The pizza list starts with the traditional Margherita, 
supposedly named in the 1870s for the first queen of the newly unified Italy 
because it copied the colors of the kingdom's flag with its red tomatoes, white 
mozzarella cheese and green basil leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The list progresses appetizingly from that standard with versions that include 
tomatoes, onions and peppers; a four-cheese pizza made zesty with Gorgonzola 
and goat cheeses; a trendy number decorated with sun-dried tomatoes, onions and 
herbs, and a rather daring (for these parts) pie topped with eggplant, roasted 
peppers and feta cheese. The puttanesca pizza is a good choice for anyone who 
has a taste for something sharp, because it gives high flavor to the basic 
topping of cheese and tomato by adding marinated artichoke hearts, rich black 
olives and pucker-inducing capers. 
</P>
<P>
Before it reaches the pastas, the menu offers a few surprises among first 
courses by listing an antipasto of marinated eggplant and meaty grilled 
peppers, and a selection of bruschetta, or slices of grilled bread finished in 
a variety of ways. The simplest is dressed only with olive oil and garlic, and 
is a little greasy; the bread topped with mozzarella, tomatoes and capers 
echoes the puttanesca pizza but has the advantage of serving just one person. 
The best style adds bitter, pungent, delicious arugula, the happiest of salad 
greens, to the mozzarella base. Other first courses include a respectable house 
salad, a passable Caesar salad and a rather nice pasta e fagiole, or bean, 
vegetable and pasta soup. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas are sophisticated in their selection, if not always in the way the 
kitchen presents them. The list begins with tris della casa, a sampler plate 
that includes three offerings and varies from day to day; it recently included 
good fusilli alla vodka (corkscrew-shaped pasta with vodka, tomato, cream and a 
little hot pepper), lackluster lasagna and a rigatoni alla matriciana that had 
no more bite than a toothless poodle. The kitchen did add plenty of crushed red 
pepper to the penne all'arrabiata, but the sauce otherwise seemed composed of 
dribs and drabs of tomato and seasonings with no definite end in mind. 
Unsampled choices include the creamy rosetta, or noodles tossed with 
prosciutto, white sauce and Fontina cheese, and the ravioli in cream sauce 
flavored with sage. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen makes limited use of its grill, but did offer grilled lamb chops as 
the sole special one evening. These, like the pastas, were acceptable, but 
nothing more -- a sprinkling of rosemary and perhaps a hint of crushed garlic 
would have made quite a difference because the meat itself was tender and 
well-cooked. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meal, the server proffers a tray of pastries from a baker 
that supplies many La Jolla restaurants, and, although they are good, none are 
out of the ordinary. Cannoli made on the premises apparently appear from time 
to time, but were not available on either visit. What does end the meal on a 
reliably satisfactory note is a cup of the house cappuccino, which, unlike some 
things at Cafe Roma, is as fully flavored as can be.

HUNTER LOSES BID TO REFUTE DOMINELLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial ruled Thursday that evidence 
contradicting a claim by J. David (Jerry) Dominelli that he was a Vietnam 
veteran is not admissible because it "is going too far afield." 
</P>
<P>
During a passionate appeal to U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam during a 
hearing held after the jury was sent home for the day, defense attorney Robert 
Brewer Jr. argued that the evidence is crucial to defend Hunter because it is a 
prime example of how Dominelli lied to her in their personal relationship, as 
well as in their professional relationship. 
</P>
<P>
A central defense contention is that Hunter could not see through the lies 
being fed to her by Dominelli because she was so in love with the man who 
masterminded the giant J. David &amp; Co. fraud operation. 
</P>
<P>
This defense tactic is countered by prosecutors, who say that being in love is 
not a legal defense against the 197 crimes Hunter is accused of committing. 
</P>
<P>
Love "doesn't destroy the ability to tell right from wrong," said Assistant U. 
S. Atty. Stephen Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and the lead prosecutor, Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo, charge that 
Hunter was a knowing and willing participant in the J. David Ponzi scheme, 
which caused about 1,200 people to lose nearly $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer conceded that this defense might be considered "laughable," but he urged 
Gilliam to consider that Hunter is a "sympathetic and emotional person" and 
that Dominelli told her war stories "in graphic details."

PROBATION OFFICER HELD ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Los Angeles County probation officer and his two roommates were in 
jail Thursday after being arrested in Lancaster on suspicion of narcotics 
possession, the Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Linn, 43, who has worked for the county Probation Department for 14 years 
but has been on a stress-related leave from the Van Nuys office since Aug. 1, 
was arrested Wednesday morning by sheriff's narcotics detectives at his 
residence in the 1000 block of West Avenue J-8, Sgt. Ernie Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested at the house were Linn's roommates Kathleen Topper, 33, and 
Marsha Gutshall, 39. Linn was being held at the sheriff's Antelope Valley 
station jail in lieu of $1,500 bail, and the women were being held there in 
lieu of $1,000 bail each, Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth roommate, a 39-year-old man, was not arrested because he was suffering 
from heart problems and was under medication, but deputies will ask the 
district attorney's office to charge him too, Sgt. Ron Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Searched the House 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said detectives searched the house and confiscated seven grams of 
methamphetamines, worth about $500, along with scales, plastic bags and 
business records that indicate the drugs were being sold. A computer that had 
been reported stolen was also found in the house, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Shreves said the investigation began a month ago when deputies received 
information in a call on the station's anonymous "We Tip" phone line that drugs 
were being sold from the suspects' house. He said an investigation is 
continuing to determine the amount of drugs sold. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Haesche, director of the Probation Department's Van Nuys office, which 
covers northern Los Angeles County, said Linn will also be investigated by his 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an internal affairs department that will certainly investigate the 
matter," Haesche said. 
</P>
<P>
Linn could be fired by the department if the drug charges are substantiated, 
Haesche said. Before Linn went on leave, he was assigned to a unit that 
supervises low-risk individuals placed on probation for minor crimes, Haesche 
said.

WOMAN DIES, HUSBAND SERIOUSLY HURT IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-car collision in Canyon Country on Thursday left a woman dead and her 
husband in serious condition, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Rawlings, 71, of Canyon Country was pronounced dead at the scene of the 
crash on Soledad Canyon Road at Reuther Avenue, Lt. Dennis Burns said. Lee 
Rawlings, 74, driver of one car, was in fair condition at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as Rawlings made a U-turn from the westbound lane of 
Soledad. Their car was struck by an auto heading east on Soledad, Deputy Bruce 
Sonnenblick said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the second car, Matt Hayes, 27, of Canyon Country, was not 
injured.

S. J. DIAMOND: CAR SATISFACTION RATINGS -- HOW DO THEY RATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes it's announced in a news story, sometimes in an auto advertisement. 
But wherever one reads of a car rated No. 1 "according to a survey by J. D. 
Power &amp; Associates," it has the ring of authority and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of other car ratings, from car magazine car-of-the-year awards 
to insurance company rankings of cars for collision repair costs. Best-known 
and most comprehensive are the regular auto reviews in Consumer Reports, 
particularly its annual auto issue, which is designed to help the average 
consumer figure out his own best buy. But J. D. Power surveys are much-cited, 
often headlined and heavily promoted by manufacturers and have become, in their 
way, equally influential. 
</P>
<P>
However they benefit consumers, they certainly benefit manufacturers. In a 
survey released last June of new car owners three months after purchase, the 
Buick LeSabre came in second to the Nissan Maxima for "fewest problems per 100 
cars." The LeSabre was then advertised as "the most trouble-free car built in 
America," according to J. D. Power. Sales took off: May sales were only 5.1% 
higher than the previous year, but sales in July and August were, respectively, 
91% and 124% more than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 25,000 per Survey 
</P>
<P>
The surveys also advertise J .D. Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills market 
research firm serving the auto industry. Founded in 1968 and still headed by J. 
David Power III, it produces regular reports and "forecasting publications" for 
manufacturers, suppliers and dealers, consults with them and helps train their 
salespeople. The "syndicated" surveys offered to subscribers, and briefly 
excerpted for public consumption, are only the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely "unbiased and balanced," these surveys only tally consumer opinions 
-- up to 25,000 per survey, says Power spokeswoman Patty Patano. "Our ultimate 
goal," she says, "is to help the consumer clearly draw a distinction." 
</P>
<P>
But Power surveys aren't really addressed to the consumer and the selected 
information that gets to him can be downright confusing. For starters, there 
are several Power surveys, bunched together at midyear and not always distinct. 
There's the customer satisfaction index, polling car owners on product quality 
and dealer service after 12 months of ownership. There's the initial quality 
survey, polling new owners about their first three months' experience, 
particularly with any problems that surfaced. And there's a sales satisfaction 
index, polling them on the purchase and delivery of their new car. 
</P>
<P>
Each survey is divided further, with much overlapping, rating vehicles among 
brands, among models, among cars of like size or type or country of origin. 
Nissan can therefore advertise in one place that in Power's initial quality 
survey it was No. 1 (among Asian imports) and boast elsewhere that it was 
"trailing only" Mercedes and Porsche among manufacturers, or that its Nissan 
Maxima ranked highest among models. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Sub-Categories 
</P>
<P>
The rankings also permit some skew. Cadillac was indeed the highest-ranked 
domestic brand in the customer satisfaction index -- in its position as fifth 
after Acura, Mercedes, Honda and Toyota. Buick was the most trouble-free 
domestic brand on the initial quality survey but only behind six foreign 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
Car makers could even make something of less, and have, boasting of their 
ranking in a survey's small sub-category. They could have high marks for the 
customer's waiting time at a dealership (part of the customer service survey), 
or a high ranking on "problem repairability" (part of the initial quality 
survey). 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the difficulty in keeping track of who's really No. 1 and why, what 
of it all? Who among laymen even knows what "problem repairability" is? Doesn't 
anyone want to know what exact problems surfaced in a car averaging only 133 
problems per 100 cars -- transmission leaks or loose ashtrays? 
</P>
<P>
The public gets just an impression and only of goodness: J. D. Power doesn't 
publicly release what it calls "the lower half of the study," the below-average 
rankings in surveyed categories. Indeed, the company's policy, declares David 
Whiteside, director of publications, is to "accentuate the positive and allow 
credit to be taken where credit is due." 
</P>
<P>
Most helpful to car companies, it's only half helpful to consumers, who might 
find it equally helpful to know what cars came in at the bottom of the rankings 
-- information leaked this year by Automotive News, which got the full initial 
quality survey from a J. D. Power client. The next issue carried a letter from 
Power himself, criticizing the publication of a "partial story" which, given 
the "sophisticated data interpretation issues involved," was "incomplete and in 
some cases misleading." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stimulating the Industry' 
</P>
<P>
Finally recognizing perhaps that a client's exploitation of the rankings can 
also be misleading, J. D. Power &amp; Associates -- whose copyrighted material 
can't be quoted without permission -- is working on some clearer guidelines and 
better control over what can and can't be said. But that doesn't solve the 
other problem, which is that the survey information released to the public is 
just not very informative, a summary of consumer opinion without data, detail 
or explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, informing the public is not J. D. Power's goal. Power wants to help 
consumers only indirectly by, as Whiteside writes, "stimulating the industry to 
do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
For information, there's always Consumer Reports, published by Consumers Union, 
which permits no advertisement of its judgments. The CR survey gives consumers 
actual data on 150 cars -- their size, comfort, ride, fuel use and price. In 
each class, CR recommends (but doesn't rank) some cars as better than average 
in performance and reliability. It also provides a repair history for up to six 
years on each model, with specific details provided by consumer responses 
covering 562,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Most surveys are very short term," says Robert Knoll, head of Consumers 
Union's auto test division, although new car buyers are increasingly interested 
in repair information, and used car buyers even more so. Consumer Reports, he 
says, "is the only place you can get it."

BOESKY SECRETLY TAPED MILKEN TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCUSSIONS HELD BEFORE SPECULATOR WAS NAMED AS INFORMANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky secretly tape-recorded three conversations with 
indicted junk bond financier Michael Milken in 1986 shortly before Boesky was 
publicly named as a government informant, court documents reveal. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the discussions was not disclosed, and prosecutors and defense 
lawyers on Thursday declined to discuss their content. But the tapes could 
emerge as critical evidence in Milken's scheduled March, 1990, trial on fraud 
and racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
The tape recordings, made on Oct. 1, Oct. 9 and Nov. 6, 1986, were mentioned in 
a letter from the government to lawyers representing Milken. The letter was 
attached to a recent filing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The final recorded conversation occurred just eight days before the revelation 
that Boesky made a deal to cooperate with prosecutors in their probe of Wall 
Street corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, the former head of junk bond operations for Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc., was indicted in March on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering for an 
alleged series of schemes with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implicated by Levine 
</P>
<P>
Boesky in November, 1986, agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count of 
filing false information with the government and is serving a three-year jail 
term. 
</P>
<P>
His stock dealings with Milken formed the basis of much of Milken's indictment, 
principally a $5.3-million payment from Boesky to Drexel to settle the balance 
in what the government calls a secret arrangement involving insider trading, 
tax fraud, rigged corporate takeovers and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
It was known that Boesky secretly tape-recorded conversations after he was 
recruited as an informant but the identities of those he tape-recorded had not 
been previously disclosed. Boesky was first implicated in the spring of 1986 by 
investment banker Dennis B. Levine and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
sometime that summer. 
</P>
<P>
If the tapes contain damaging details about Milken, they could aid the 
government's case. But if Milken said nothing incriminating despite attempts by 
Boesky to trap him, it could help the defense.

Pickens Responds to Criticism: T. Boone Pickens Jr. dismissed a letter from 
Koito Manufacturing Co. as a "joke." In the letter, Koito accused the Texas 
oilman of attempting to greenmail the Japanese company and demanded that he 
"clarify" his relationship with Kitaro Watanable, who sold Pickens his 26% 
stake in Koito. The letter came a week after Pickens asked Koito to raise the 
company's dividend. After Sept. 30, the end of a six-month waiting period 
required by Japanese law, Pickens can request a special shareholders meeting to 
renew his previous request for representation on Koito's board.

Money Supply Measures Diverge: One of the broadest measures of the nation's 
money supply rose and another fell in the week ended Sept. 18, the Federal 
Reserve Board reported. The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a 
seasonally adjusted $3,158.2 billion from an adjusted $3,154.3 billion the 
previous week; an even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted 
$4,017.8 billion from $4,018.3 billion.

Home Savings Plans Layoffs: Los Angeles-based Home Savings of America, the 
nation's biggest thrift, said it will lay off some managers and support staff 
as a belt-tightening measure. The move is in response to the federal bailout 
plan, which requires thrifts to pay higher deposit insurance premiums. 
Spokeswoman Mary Trigg would not disclose how many of the company's 12,000 
workers would be cut. But she said no employees at Home Savings' 365 branches 
and 106 mortgage lending offices would be affected.

Newspaper Ownership to Change: The Sacramento Union will change owners on Nov. 
30 when its publishing company dissolves and a new firm headed by two local 
developers assumes control. A spokesman said 300 employees will be laid off, 
and it will be up to the new publisher to decide whether to rehire them. The 
paper, which now is owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir of the wealthy 
Mellon banking family in Pennsylvania, will continue to be published during the 
ownership transfer.

BRANIFF CUTS FLIGHTS, TRIMS WORK FORCE BY 2,700

Braniff sharply cut its schedule to two only flights Thursday, just hours after 
filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The Orlando-based airline said it expected to resume service to Los Angeles 
Friday, as it expands its schedule to seven flights today and eight flights 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The airline sharply reduced its work force to 2,000 from 4,700 and slashed 
flight destinations to five from 40. It normally had about 250 flights daily. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff Chairman William G. McGee blamed competition from stronger airlines for 
Braniff's woes. "Major airlines enjoy a distinct advantage over small carriers 
in their use of computer reservation systems, frequent flier packages," and 
their control of landing rights at airports in New York, Washington and 
Chicago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsecured Debts 
</P>
<P>
McGee said that Braniff ran low on cash during the last few months and was 
unable to arrange a $75-million cash infusion. The airline's finances were also 
strained by its move from Dallas to Orlando and its $3.5-billion order for 50 
Airbus A320 aircraft and options to buy another 50, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff's quarterly statement showed it had only $3 million in cash at the end 
of July, while it had current debts of $169.9 million. 
</P>

In its bankruptcy filing Thursday, Braniff said it had assets totaling $326 
million and liabilities of $347.3 million, about $297 million of that 
unsecured. Among its biggest unsecured creditors are American Airlines, Dalfort 
Corp., a Dallas firm that formerly owned Braniff and is controlled by Jay A. 
Pritzker, and the New York investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Dalfort said it was owed $15 million for aircraft maintenance work, and a 
Drexel spokesman said the firm held $15 million in privately placed Braniff 
debt. American is owed $21.3 million that it loaned to Braniff as part of a 
deal to lease aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the airline's fragile cash position, Leon Foreman, one of Braniff's 
bankruptpcy lawyers, said the airline had enough money to meet its 
pre-bankruptcy payroll. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Was a Surprise 
</P>
<P>
For many Braniff employees, this was the second time they had been through the 
turmoil of a bankruptcy with the company. After an overly ambitious expansion, 
the airline filed for bankruptcy in May, 1982. It emerged two years later owned 
by hotel magnate Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Corp. Pritzker sold all but 10% of 
his stake to a group led by Philadelphia financier Jeffrey R. Chodorow, whose 
investments also include a doll manufacturer, and New York real estate investor 
Arthur G. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Yeast, a spokeswoman for the Assn. of Flight Attendants, said two-thirds 
of Braniff's 900 flight attendants had been through the first bankruptcy seven 
years ago. Though Braniff's poor financial condition came as no surprise, she 
said, "no one expected them to act so quickly and so drastically." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for the employees who had to go through this twice," said Howard 
Putnam, chairman of Braniff during the first bankruptcy. He said employees had 
taken hefty concessions to get the carrier back on its feet under a five-year 
agreement that ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
Putnam said he wasn't surprised by Braniff's second bankruptcy. "They changed 
their strategy," he said. "They moved into Kansas City and Orlando and they 
became a higher fare carrier. They drove away their passengers or they ran 
themselves out of cash." 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said that Braniff's new management probably tried to 
expand too quickly. Analysts said the move to Orlando was costly and could have 
been put off until the company was more financially secure. In addition, 
analysts said that while Braniff needed to replenish its aging fleet, the new 
aircraft added a huge cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customers Calm 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is they tried to do too much too fast," said Paul Turk, an 
analyst with Avmark, a Washington aviation consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents said Thursday that Braniff customers took the flight 
cancellations in stride. "I expected a lot of upset people, but most customers 
were pretty calm," said Kimberly Denning, an agent with Ask Mr. Foster agency 
in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Denning said her employer protected customers by issuing them new tickets on 
other airlines. A number of airlines, including Continental, American and 
America West, were honoring Braniff tickets on a stand-by basis.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: CONSULTANTS NEED TO CREATE A STRONG FIRST 
IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The October, 1987, stock market crash was a disaster for many New Yorkers, but 
for two entrepreneurs, Black Monday spawned an unusual small business. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Roslyn Brandt was overseeing the design of a new corporate 
headquarters building for the Salomon Bros. investment banking firm. When the 
market collapsed, so did Brandt's massive project. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of bemoaning her fate, Brandt met with Diane Barnes, director of 
marketing for a prestigious New York architecture firm, and they decided to 
form Barnes &amp; Brandt Inc. 
</P>
<P>
By capitalizing on their professional contacts, the pair provide advice to the 
design and architectural community. In recent months they have recruited 10 
architects for a Sydney, Australia, skyscraper project and coordinated a 
management retreat for a troubled architectural firm. They are also under 
contract to advise England's largest commercial furniture company on how to 
please American tastes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Brandt said, they worried that "if a company like ours didn't exist, 
there had to be a reason." 
</P>
<P>
But, as soon as they decided to take the risk, the response was, "Why hasn't 
someone done this before?" 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said many consultants who set themselves up in business fail because 
they don't make a strong first impression. Because consultants deal directly 
with top decision makers, it is critical to have a professional-looking 
brochure, a snappy logo and a passion for selling your services. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that is particularly crucial for a small business is to establish 
your own identity," said Barnes, who hired several graphic artists before 
settling on a logo that she liked. Once you find the right logo she suggests 
carrying the concept through by putting it on everything from letterheads to 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
She also advises small-business owners that they have to spend money to make 
money, especially in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"People are hesitant to take a $300 plane trip that could bring in a contract 
for $30,000," Barnes said. "If your business doesn't get a good strong start, 
it will always be coming from behind." 
</P>
<P>
A perfect example of this was when a potential client and his partner flew to 
New York to meet with Barnes and Brandt. The women had just started their 
business, and money was very tight. 
</P>
<P>
"Dinner for four cost $300 in a top restaurant in New York," recalled Barnes. 
"I signed the check and I thought, 'Oh my God, how will we pay for this?' But 
ultimately those two became some of our best clients." 
</P>
<P>
Another way to impress clients is to find out what charities your clients 
support or what sports they enjoy. "A lot of people support people who support 
them," said Barnes. "Why not help a client with their favorite charity or 
jointly sponsor a sports event?" 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders said no one is serving the design community in quite the same 
way as Barnes and Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
"They are uniquely positioned with a high level of contact," said Martin 
Yardley, a principal in STUDIOS, a San Francisco architecture firm and a 
client. "They are equally valuable to the six or seven people involved in a 
major construction project." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consultants Need Some Advice, Too 
</P>
<P>
Most people think that consultants are too busy helping others to need help 
themselves, but Howard Shenson has built a small business around counseling 
consultants since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Through books, seminars and lectures, Shenson of Woodland Hills helps 
consultants build their practices while coping with the changing business 
climate. Here are a few of his "101 Proven Strategies for Building a Successful 
Practice." The copyrighted booklet is available by mail for $3 plus tax by 
writing to Shenson at 20750 Ventura Blvd., Suite 206, Woodland Hills, CA. 
91364. Information on his Nov. 1 seminar is also available by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Write a separate brochure for each target market you serve. Concentrate on the 
benefits that you provide to each type of client. 
</P>
<P>
Never use a resume to promote your services. You may have to develop a resume 
to satisfy the files of an existing client, but it is a disastrous first 
marketing piece. 
</P>
<P>
Do not promote your services to the personnel department. Always promote your 
services to the executive or manager. 
</P>
<P>
Devote about 15% to 25% of your working hours -- each and every week -- to 
marketing and selling. The time to market is not when you have run out of 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bad mouth your competition. Explain why your services are better and the 
unique advantages you offer. If you are really better than the competition, it 
will be obvious to your clients and prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Dress the way your client or prospect dresses, within reason. Don't be overly 
formal or informal. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look upon having to write a proposal as unnecessary drudgery for getting 
the business. Research clearly shows that those who write proposals (even when 
they don't have to) wind up getting bigger and better assignments. 
</P>
<P>
When writing letters, increase impact with a handwritten P.S. It will result in 
your letter being read first and it will instantly grab the reader's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Be listed in all trade and professional directories that reach your target 
market. More than half of all directories will allow you to be listed free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Charge for travel expenses on a per-diem basis rather than a direct 
reimbursement basis. Most clients prefer the simplicity of per diems, and it 
avoids any criticism of how you spend expense dollars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot Line for Women Business Owners 
</P>
<P>
The American Women's Economic Development Corp. and Citibank are sponsoring a 
telephone hot line for the nation's 4.1 million women business owners. Business 
owners can receive up to 10 minutes of help from a professional consultant for 
$10. Sessions lasting up to 90 minutes can also be scheduled in advance for 
$35. Both services, which can be charged to a major credit card, are available 
by calling (800) 222-AWED. Callers in Alaska and Hawaii can reach the 
counselors at (212) 692-9100. Citibank/Citicorp pledged $120,000 to underwrite 
the counseling program for two years, according to a bank spokeswoman.

Unity Retreat for Small Businesses 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners and others interested in establishing a national agenda 
for small-business interests are invited to attend a National Small Business 
United leadership and federal issues retreat in February. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues retreat is a very unique and special event that each year draws 
together small-business leaders from all over the country to learn about 
economic projections, political developments and legislative proposals which 
affect the survival and success of small companies," said Betty Jo Toccoli, 
president of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The retreat is scheduled Feb. 2-4 at the Radisson Palm Springs Resort in Palm 
Springs. For information contact Rosa Wright at (202) 293-8830.

PRIVATE COMMERCIAL ROCKET LAUNCH CANCELED BY WEATHER

American Rocket Co. of Camarillo hoped to take a giant leap into the commercial 
race to space Thursday. Instead, it took a small step backward when bad weather 
and a mechanical problem scrubbed the company's first rocket launch. 
</P>
<P>
The rocket was to have carried two payloads on a 15-minute unmanned suborbital 
flight. One was a Defense Department chemical experiment and the other was a 
capsule designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
But about 20 minutes before the 1:13 p.m. scheduled liftoff, there was 
lightning offshore, and the Air Force, which was supervising the launch, called 
it off. There was also a mechanical problem with the rocket's roll thrusters, 
devices that help guide the rocket. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a critical (mechanical) failure," said George Whittinghill, American 
Rocket's director of marketing. "The rocket could have flown without" the 
thrusters, he said. "The key problem was the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to launch the rocket soon, possibly on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
American Rocket is one of about half a dozen fledgling companies trying to make 
a go of it in the space industry. The companies eventually hope to launch 
low-cost payloads into Earth orbit, including medical and scientific 
experiments.

Ten years after it was introduced, Canada's 24-karat Maple Leaf glitters 
brightest as the world's most popular gold coin, surpassing Britain's 
Britannia, Australia's Nugget and the United States' Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Maple Leaf is in great shape," said Michael Brown of the Gold Institute in 
Washington. "It will remain the premier gold coin, with the Eagle and the 
Nugget fighting for second spot." 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leaf's birthday this month is marked by climbing sales and a 54% 
market share regained since its main competitors slashed it to 44% after they 
emerged in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leaf, featuring Canada's national symbol and Queen Elizabeth on the 
flip side, was introduced in September, 1979.

DOW RISES 21.85 IN BIGGEST GAIN SINCE AUGUST 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market chalked up its best gain in five weeks Thursday in an advance 
led by environmental, pharmaceutical and other "growth" issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 21.85 to close at 2,694.91, its 
best showing since Aug. 24 when it jumped 56.53 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 918 up, 536 down and 503 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.24 million shares, against 
158.40 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 196.73 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The advance was "very selective," said Larry Wachtel, analyst at 
Prudential-Bache Securities. "The theme for the day was 'out of earnings 
uncertainty and into earnings certainty.' " 
</P>
<P>
That meant, he said, a flow of money from technology stocks and other sectors 
that have lately produced earnings disappointments, to groups like the drug and 
pollution-control stocks regarded as holding out the promise of steady growth. 
</P>
<P>
IBM shares, down 6 on Wednesday, dropped another 2 1/2 to 109 as the most 
active Big Board issue. Digital Equipment lost 1 3/4 to 91 7/8 and 
Hewlett-Packard was down 7/8 at 50 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
In the pollution-control sector, by contrast, three firms hit new highs: Waste 
Management, up 2 5/8 at 65 3/4; Wheelabrator Technologies, up 2 1/2 at 41 3/8, 
and Browning-Ferris, up 1 3/8 at 41 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the pharmaceuticals included Abbott Laboratories, up 1 7/8 at 64, 
and Pfizer, up 1 at 68 3/8. Investors also bid up consumer growth issues such 
as Philip Morris, up 4 1/2 at 165, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 3 1/2 at 120 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
AMR Corp. rose 4 3/4 to 83 3/4. Besides rumors of domestic investors eyeing 
AMR, some market watchers speculated that a deal with Lufthansa Airlines is in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks surged to a record close. The key 225-share Nikkei index 
climbed 319.41 points, or 0.90%, to 35,689.98. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices fell sharply in thin trading. The Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100-share index fell 39.5 points, or 1.7%, to 2,291.7. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dipped slightly in slow trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 3/32 point, or slightly less 
than $1 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price 
falls, inched up to 8.25% from 8.24% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds were hurt after a savings and loan dumped a rumored $800 million worth of 
mortgage-backed securities on the market and buyers of them hedged by selling 
bond futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was helped by a Dow Jones News Service 
report, citing unidentified officials, that said the Resolution Funding Corp. 
might not begin issuing bonds to bail out the savings and loan industry until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The long bond has been weighed down by prospects that $5 billion of the Refcorp 
bonds could flood the market in early October. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term, 
intermediate-term and long-term government issues fell about 1/8 point, 
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.14% as the discount added 6 
basis points to 7.88%. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 8.26% as the 
discount remained at 7.83%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.43% as the 
discount advanced 6 basis points to 7.83%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.25%, up from 9% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved mostly higher although central banks again put pressure on the

unpleasant economic consequences.

Gold bullion prices finished with minor changes in the United States after 
moving lower overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of 
$366.90 for an ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, up 70 cents from Wednesday's late 
bid.

<P>
John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at the New York office of the Amsterdam 
Rotterdam Bank, said trading volume was moderate and punctuated by rounds of 
central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Activity has slackened in recent days with dealers unwinding positions as the 
month ends. Trading maneuvers tied to the close of Japan's fiscal year on Sept. 
30 also has reduced liquidity in the currency markets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The central banks intervened three or four times," said McCarthy. "It did have 
the desired effect -- the dollar is closing lower than where it opened in New 
York" but above Wednesday's late levels. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier European trading, the dollar rose against most major currencies 
despite persistent dollar selling by the monetary authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in London said they received buy orders from traders who expressed 
confidence in the dollar's underlying strength. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar closed at 140.85 Japanese yen, down from 
141.35. In London late Thursday, the dollar traded lower at 140.45 yen. It was 
quoted at 140.50 yen in late New York trading, up from 140.32 yen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6085 late Thursday, cheaper for buyers 
than Wednesday's late $1.6155. In New York, a pound fetched $1.61065, down from 
$1.6167 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion prices were mixed in the United States after declining in light 
trading overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for October delivery rose 
to $368.10 an ounce, up 20 cents from Wednesday's settlement. The September 
contract closed at $367.60 on Wednesday, its final trading day. 
</P>

Viacom International Inc. said Thursday that it has reached a watershed in its 
financial health with a debt restructuring that gives it more money, lower 
interest costs and fewer restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom International owns MTV, Showtime, the Movie Channel and distribution 
rights to "The Cosby Show," "Roseanne" and "A Different World" as well as 14 
cable-TV systems, five television stations and eight radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom is 83% owned by National Amusements Inc., a movie theater owner that 
bought its stake for $460 million in cash and $2.8 billion in new and old debt 
in a leveraged buyout in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the refinancing was made possible by an increase in the value 
of its assets and the flow of cash from its operations, marking the success of 
the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year agreement with Viacom's bank lenders, led by Citibank with Bank of 
New York as co-agent, gives it up to $1.5 billion in unsecured bank loans and 
revolving credit. It does not have to pay any principal for three years. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement permits the company to borrow an additional $500 million by 
issuing commercial paper backed up by a portion of the bank lending. Viacom 
will use part of the proceeds to retire $200 million of its $1.3 billion in 
outstanding junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"The closing of this credit agreement is a watershed event for our company," 
Sumner M. Redstone, chairman, and Frank J. Biondi Jr., president and chief 
executive, said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
"By terminating our old credit agreement we have left behind the 
restrictiveness of the LBO (leveraged buyout) structure and have put in place a 
more flexible capitalization," they said. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement frees Viacom to issue more debt, which could be used for 
acquisitions. Spokesman Thomas Dooley said the company has not announced any 
plans, but added: "We do remain opportunistic."

Panama called on its international creditors Thursday to give it special help 
because of economic sanctions by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Minister Gustavo Gonzalez reported to the annual meeting of the 
International Monetary Fund a sharp drop in his country's economic output 
because of U.S. sanctions and a plunge in government revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanctions Imposed 
</P>
<P>
He said Panama's output of goods and services fell 16% last year, government 
revenue fell 44.3%, exports dropped 11% and imports fell 35.5%. But Gonzalez 
said he expects the economy to stabilize before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions were imposed last year as part of a campaign by the 
United States to oust military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, under 
indictment in the United States on drug trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discuss Debt 
</P>
<P>
"The plans of Panama are to continue restructuring its economy under the 
jeopardy of wanton, unjustifiable and groundless economic coercive measures," 
Gonzalez said in a speech to the IMF. He said an IMF mission is scheduled to 
visit Panama in October to discuss economic policies. Panama also wants to 
discuss a restructuring of its commercial bank debt.

'DRY WHITE SEASON' JOLTS SOUTH AFRICAN AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"A Dry White Season," originally banned in South Africa as a biased and highly 
emotional threat to public order, opened uncut to a packed film festival house 
Thursday night, leaving many in its mostly white liberal audience troubled by 
the stark vision of police brutality and injustice in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The film, directed by Martinique-born Euzhan Palcy, was exempted from its 
"undesirable" label by South Africa's censorship appeals board for only four 
screenings at the Weekly Mail Film Festival, where the censors said "discerning 
adult viewers would be able to judge the film within its South African 
context." 
</P>
<P>
Adapted from South African author Andre Brink's novel, the film, which opened 
in theaters in the United States last week, concerns a naive white Afrikaner 
schoolteacher, played by Donald Sutherland, who tries to learn the truth about 
his black gardener's death in police custody following the bloody 1976 Soweto 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
So convincing was the portrayal of white South Africans' blindness to their 
exploding black townships that some viewers here, like secretary Karen Key, 
left the theater feeling troubled and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us as South Africans like to think (police brutality) is not happening 
even when we know it is," said Key, 31, who works in a union office in 
Johannesburg. "Putting it in front of us on the screen . . . is very 
disturbing. What can an individual do to change things in this country?" 
</P>
<P>
Permission for the screenings, two on Thursday in Johannesburg and two Saturday 
in Cape Town, ended a weeks-long battle between festival organizers and censors 
over a half-dozen films, including "A Dry White Season" and five locally 
produced documentaries and feature films. Each of those movies was initially 
banned but approved on appeal for the limited arts festival screenings. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals board, and its chairman, Kobus van Rooyen, have since 1979 
overturned many bannings by lower-level bureaucrats. Veteran civil-rights 
lawyer John Dugard says Van Rooyen "has done more to advance the cause of 
freedom of expression in South Africa than any other person." 
</P>
<P>
Under Van Rooyen's direction, the government's chief censors have routinely 
taken into account the expected audience for a particular film or book, and 
they have approved many controversial films for showing in arts festivals. 
</P>
<P>
"A World Apart" was approved for three showings at an arts festival here 
earlier this year. That acclaimed film, written by Shawn Slovo, was an 
autobiographical account about her and her mother, Ruth First, a white 
anti-apartheid activist killed by a parcel bomb seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Cry Freedom," the Richard Attenborough-directed story of a white newspaper 
editor's friendship with black consciousness leader Steve Biko, was approved 
for general distribution by Van Rooyen and opened in 40 theaters nationwide. 
But, after the first morning showing in those theaters, it was summarily yanked 
from projection rooms on the orders of the justice minister. Van Rooyen later 
received several death threats from right-wing groups. 
</P>
<P>
"A Dry White Season" is one of the most powerful anti-apartheid films ever 
approved for even a limited engagement in South Africa. The Directorate of 
Publications, the censors who originally denied the festival's application to 
show the film, argued before Van Rooyen's appeals board hearing Monday that the 
picture could destroy President Frederik W. de Klerk's new promises of 
apartheid reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot see the relevance of the Soweto uprising -- probably the worst 
racial incident in 1976, blowing it up like a balloon and at the end suggesting 
that the situation here is still the same," argued Marius Coertze, a state's 
attorney representing the censors. "This will definitely not do anyone any 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Coertze said the censors also had been concerned that the police force was 
"portrayed as some sort of Nazi regime," rioting blacks were shown as 
"innocent, wide-eyed people" rather than lawbreakers, and the South African 
judiciary, "recognized throughout the world for its standards and 
professionalism," appeared as racist. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Thursday for his personal opinion of "A Dry White Season," Coertze said: 
"It shocked me. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some elements of truth in there, but there were also some blatantly 
biased and untruthful portrayals. I think most South Africans realize there's 
something wrong with this system and with police actions in certain 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Coertze said, though, that he agreed with the appeals board's decision. 
"Perhaps it's only a story, anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lauren Jacobson, attorney for the festival organizers, made a successful case 
for the film by arguing that "if there is a spirit of reform in the country 
today, then surely it fits in with such a spirit that this film be shown." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson said later that she personally thought the movie was "a very 
hero-villain, good-bad film -- slightly crude in that sense." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's an absolutely fair depiction of how a large number of people in this 
country viewed the events of 1976," she said. "And very few films about South 
Africa have accomplished that." 
</P>
<P>
Van Rooyen didn't say whether he liked the film, only that it wouldn't cause 
any harm if seen by a film festival audience. (It was given a 19-year age 
restriction, slightly harsher than its R-rating in the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
"The truths in the film should be allowed to speak for themselves, as also 
should the cliches, the striving for emotional effect, and the biases, of which 
there are some obvious ones," he said, singling out the depiction of a South 
African judge as racially biased. 
</P>
<P>
Palcy said in Toronto this week that she wanted the film, shot mostly in South 
Africa's neighboring Zimbabwe to prompt audiences "to feel the same rage I 
felt" when conducting research for the movie in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the audiences cheered a scene, added to Brink's plot by Palcy 
and co-writer Colin Welland, in which a villainous white policeman is 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting used to watching ourselves on screen as weirdos with weirdo 
accents," said Matthew Krouse, a 27-year-old Johannesburg actor who saw the 
film. "It was quite a relief to see the South African subject executed with 
such panache and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
"But no film can reproduce the horrific reality," Krouse said. "It's much worse 
than the narrative can bear. In our lives, there are a lot of loose ends that 
are not wrapped up." 
</P>
<P>
The concern that some South African viewers' feel over the film's effect, and 
the effect of other films like it, on their country's image overseas was 
reflected by Van Rooyen, who said he regretted "that overseas viewers, who are 
not cognizant of the present drive for reform, would lack the perspective" of 
South African audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The film's local distributors, still smarting from the government seizure of 
"Cry Freedom" last year, have not applied for permission to formally release "A 
Dry White Season." But lawyers say it is highly unlikely that the film would be 
approved for release to general audiences in South Africa.

SONY TO CASH IN ON COLUMBIA'S CACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The library that Japanese electronics giant Sony will get with its pending 
takeover of Columbia Pictures includes the greatest film ever made about its 
country's bombing of Pearl Harbor -- Fred Zinnemann's 1953 Oscar-winner "From 
Here to Eternity." 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will also become part of 
Sony's collection: "Hellcats of the Navy," their 1957 film about the exploits 
of a World War II submarine, now sits in the Columbia library. 
</P>
<P>
While not considered one of Hollywood's best, Columbia's library includes 12 
best picture Academy Award winners, such recent hits as "Ghostbusters II," 
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Tootsie," and such popular American 
TV sitcoms as "I Dream of Jeannie," "Bewitched," "Gidget," "The Monkees" and 
"Dennis the Menace." 
</P>
<P>
These titles are among the 2,700 feature films and 2,300 episodes of 260 TV 
series that Columbia holds in its library. Lisbeth Barron, an entertainment 
analyst with McKinley, Allsopp Inc. in New York, estimates that the Columbia 
library alone is worth $1.05 billion, and that it generates about $75 million a 
year in cash flow for the studio. (In contrast, Turner's 3,700-title MGM 
library, which he bought three years ago for $1.3 billion, generates about $175 
million a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Sony is anxious to get its hands on these films and TV shows -- called 
"software" in corporate parlance -- to service the high-tech hardware it 
manufactures. The company already produces laser-disc video players and has a 
push on to get consumers to buy its 8-millimeter cassette player. Sony also is 
developing technology for high-definition TV. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have the library, they can force you to buy their kind of hardware," 
explained Naofumi Okamoto, president of a Japanese-owned film studio here, 
Apricot Entertainment. Sony, he said, learned a hard lesson six years ago when 
the company's Betamax videocassette technology lost the battle for consumer 
loyalty to the rival VHS format. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Columbia's feature film library is not as highly regarded as some 
of the others, Sony will certainly be getting plenty of big-name pictures for 
its money. Columbia is tied with United Artists for the most best picture 
winners, an even dozen that began with the classic 1934 "It Happened One Night" 
and includes two from the current decade: "Gandhi" from 1982 and "The Last 
Emperor" of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades during Hollywood's Golden Era, from 1932 to 1958, 
Columbia president Harry Cohn ran his studio on a shoestring. The studio was 
late in introducing color because it was expensive, and Cohn kept few big stars 
under contract, said Jere Henshaw, who served as casting director for the 
studio during the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia was always behind," said Henshaw, now an independent producer at 
Apollo Pictures. "They didn't have much of a library. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a plethora of B-films from that period, titles like "Snow White 
Meets the Three Stooges," "Jungle Moon Men," "Screaming Mimi," "The Tingler" 
(in which theaters put "tinglers" in their seats to tickle customers), "The 
Legend of Tom Dooley" (based on the song) and "Have Rocket Will Travel" 
(starring the Three Stooges in outer space). 
</P>
<P>
But Cohn did manage to attract some key film-making talents, like directors 
Frank Capra, Robert Rossen, David Lean, Elia Kazan and Fred Zinnemann. Capra 
directed "It Happened One Night," as well as the classics "Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington" and "You Can't Take It With You," the 1938 Oscar winner. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cohn, Columbia subsequently won best picture Oscars for Rossen's "All the 
King's Men," Zinnemann's "From Here to Eternity," Kazan's "On the Waterfront" 
and Lean's "The Bridge on the River Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn died in 1958, but the studio continued to do well at Oscar time, winning 
three Academy Awards for best picture during the 1960s -- for Lean's "Lawrence 
of Arabia," Zinnemann's "A Man for All Seasons" and Carol Reed's "Oliver!" 
</P>
<P>
Robert Benton's "Kramer vs. Kramer" won the best picture award for the studio 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Other popular Columbia titles include "Shampoo," "The Way We Were," "Funny 
Girl," "The Last Picture Show," "The Big Chill" and "Tootsie." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, Columbia has 100, even 200, great titles," said Henshaw. But, he added, 
libraries like those at MGM, Fox and Paramount boast many hundreds of films 
that have proved popular over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia's library has neither the value nor the quality of other studio 
libraries," added a high-ranking executive at another company who is familiar 
with all the libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia library, said Barron, "is much more extensive on the TV side. It's 
a bit weaker on the feature side." 
</P>
<P>
Among Columbia's TV shows are dozens of sitcoms that will generate millions of 
dollars in the rerun market. Current hits include "Who's the Boss?" "227," 
"Designing Women," "My Two Dads" and "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's array of sitcoms will give Sony a leg-up over a key competitor, 
MCA-Universal, whose library is dominated by hourlong series. Although one-hour 
action adventure shows do much better than sitcoms overseas, reruns of sitcoms 
are most popular here. 
</P>
<P>
"The big money is coming in from half-hour shows," said Barron. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia also owns the rights to the game shows created by Merv Griffin: "Wheel 
of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" 
</P>
<P>
Barron believes that Sony substantially overpaid for all of Columbia Pictures' 
operations. She values the company at $21.20 a share. Sony has offered $27 a 
share.

CORCORAN GALLERY OF ART STRUGGLES TO PICK UP THE PIECES; 
</P>
<P>
FIGHT OVER SHOW CLOSURE MAY SHIFT EQUATION IN MUSEUMS' RELATIONSHIPS WITH

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1869, philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran founded an art museum here to 
"promote the American genius." 
</P>
<P>
In time, the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Corcoran School of Art, which 
today has more than 900 students, grew to become one of the most significant 
artistic forces on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Corcoran's white marble beaux-arts building, built in 1897 by the architect 
Ernest Flagg, is a stone's throw from the White House and has historically been 
not much farther removed than that from the exercise of political power in the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
But -- temporarily, at least -- all of that has blown sky high. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared to happen suddenly, at the beginning of the summer. At a board 
meeting whose agenda was left vague -- deliberately, critics have charged -- 
Christina Orr-Cahall, the Corcoran's director and one of eight people to head 
it in the last 20 years, engineered a board decision canceling a retrospective 
show of work by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
That move, in turn, transformed a political bombshell that had initially blown 
up over two grants -- including one to support the Mapplethorpe show -- by the 
National Endowment for the Arts into a political nuclear device in the 
high-megaton range. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Corcoran finds itself boycotted by artists whose work it 
wanted to display in exhibits that have now been canceled, reviled by arts 
observers and art patrons across the country and hamstrung by rebellion from 
its 6,500 members, 9% of whom have dropped out in the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the defections occurred because membership peaked last summer, anyway, 
when the Corcoran hung a blockbuster, "Odyssey: The Art of Photography at 
National Geographic." But Corcoran officials say half of the falloff has come 
since July 1, apparently a direct result of the Mapplethorpe episode. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Corcoran's situation remains emotionally charged; initial signs have 
emerged that the upheaval may have a different, completely unforeseen element. 
The Corcoran's devastating mistake, say artists and arts observers, may have 
started to alter the equation that governs power among artists, museums, 
collectors and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
That this unintended development had occurred became apparent when artists 
pulled out of two scheduled Corcoran shows, forcing their cancellation, and 
threatened to torpedo a third. Then artist Lowell Nesbitt cut the Corcoran -- 
to which he had said he would leave $1.5 million worth of his estate -- out of 
his will. 
</P>
<P>
The chief curator quit. The public relations staff gave notice. The art 
school's students marched on the Capitol to protest what was going on in the 
Senate and, when Orr-Cahall said she wanted to go along, the students told her 
to stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
The artists' sense of rage increased last week, artists here say, when the 
Corcoran issued a statement saying the trustees "deeply regret" that the 
attempt to defuse the controversy didn't work. But the statement didn't concede 
the decision was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The Corcoran has been unable even to decide whether to fire Orr-Cahall, 42, who 
came from the Oakland Museum. Monday, the board voted to appoint a committee to 
make recommendations on defusing the crisis, and board insiders say the 
committee has been directed to make its recommendations within the next week to 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Orr-Cahall declined to be interviewed for this article. However, in a telephone 
interview last week -- before appointment of the board committee but after she 
rebuffed a request from the Corcoran staff that she resign -- she conceded the 
Mapplethorpe decision was a blunder. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Corcoran did was a tactic," she said. "We thought it would work, but 
our tactic failed. We regret we tried it. We should have damned the torpedoes 
and gone full-speed ahead, but that is the beauty of hindsight. I'm not going 
to defend it. 
</P>
<P>
By successfully refusing to permit their work to be included in Corcoran 
exhibitions, artists may have taught it, other museums and themselves a crucial 
political lesson. "It's a tragic situation that has positive consequences and 
this is one of them," said Ned Rifkin, chief curator for exhibitions at 
Washington's Hirshhorn Museum and former curator of contemporary art at the 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense among artists that, without them, there is no art. There is no 
product to sell. There is nothing to package and own and, ultimately, to 
institutionalize." 
</P>
<P>
"We have always been victims of the curators," said Georgia Deal, a local 
artist and former chair of the Corcoran art school's print-making department, 
on whose faculty she still serves. "It was like, grovel, grovel. What might 
they do for us? Artists have become aware of their own power and that the 
museums don't exist -- can't exist -- without them." 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been the artist as a beggar coming to the major institutions," 
said Judy Baca, director of the Social Public Art Resource Center in Venice. 
"Artists would say, 'Would you please let me show? I need to say I was in your 
exhibition.' It's a fairly new concept to think of it in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
To Tony Jones, president of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, this 
empowerment could carry with it considerable contagion. "These are people who 
are at the cutting edge of actually making the work," he said. "They can say, 
'Where is my work going to go?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's very damaging (to an institution) to see artists declining to show work. 
This begins to raise questions of all sorts, (of) whether one wants to be 
associated with such an institution." 
</P>
<P>
The situation has already emerged as a non-agenda item for the board of the Los 
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, which is reliably said to have engaged in 
an impromptu analysis last week of implications of change in the division of 
power between artists and museums. "There was," said someone familiar with the 
discussion, "just a tad bit of fear." 
</P>
<P>
But not all artists agree. Some fear the heady talk is just bravado and that 
museums, galleries and artists will find that provocative work with political, 
sexual or controversial overtones is simply not considered to be shown or not 
created. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Harlan, a Corcoran faculty member, said she expects such a chill: "There 
are going to be repercussions in choices of shows. I think there is a trend for 
conservatism. Museums will think about what happened. People will remember this 
for a long time. I'm afraid of that." 
</P>
<P>
The Corcoran decision that touched all this off came as the Mapplethorpe work 
emerged as a key provocation for a political crisis enveloping the National 
Endowment for the Arts. The decision to kill the Mapplethorpe show was intended 
to contain the political explosion detonated by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
</P>
<P>
The appeasement tactic's immediate and lingering effect, however, was 
completely the opposite -- precipitating such unremitting condemnation that, 
aside from the Corcoran's own defensive statements, only Helms has publicly 
sided with the museum. 
</P>
<P>
And adding to the futility of the decision, the Washington Project for the 
Arts, which has artists on its board -- the Corcoran has none -- and a 
progressive reputation, took the show, which was attended by nearly 50,000 
people in a run of less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
The Corcoran's board, a cumbersome, 54-member body dominated by wealthy art 
patrons and local philanthropists, has appeared paralyzed as it struggled -- as 
recently as Monday -- to cope. It has been hamstrung by divisions between 20 
old-line trustees appointed to life terms and the rest, who include a younger, 
more progressive wing. The gallery and school have a combined operating budget 
of $7.6 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Corcoran has suffered considerable damage," said one board member, who 
spoke on the condition he would not be named. "Some people are saying that, in 
four years, it will all be history. That's a joke. In four years, there may not 
be any contemporary art in the Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
"If the artists can boycott the Corcoran, they can boycott any museum. They've 
shown their strength. It's a surprising strength" 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lose-lose situation," for the Corcoran, said Jack Duncan, a Washington 
lobbyist whose clients include the American Council for the Arts and other 
major arts organizations. The Corcoran loses if Orr-Cahall stays, said Duncan 
and other observers, because artists may continue to withhold work from the 
Corcoran, its 20th-Century art program could collapse and the museum could be 
forced to retrench. 
</P>
<P>
But, Duncan, members of the Corcoran School of Art faculty and other arts 
observers said that if Orr-Cahall is removed -- a step many observers expect 
despite public declarations she will tough it out -- the Corcoran may be unable 
to attract a new head politically strong and artistically well known enough to 
salvage things. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the situation worse is that the Corcoran's recent leadership history 
has been especially checkered. Orr-Cahall took over in late 1987 after the 
Corcoran had been without a permanent head for nearly a year in the wake of the 
forced resignation of her predecessor, Michael Botwinick. Botwinick's departure 
came as a result of a wave of staff and faculty discontent that reportedly left 
morale at the Corcoran at a low ebb. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Nygren, the acting director who took over after Botwinick departed, 
pulled out of consideration for the permanent position. "I decided I didn't 
wish to be the director of a museum such as the Corcoran," said Nygren, 
director of the Smith College Museum of Art in Massachusetts, earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In Orr-Cahall, the Corcoran found a young and comparatively inexperienced 
director, but one with apparently excellent credentials whose early reviews 
were positive. "Every time a new personality comes along, there's a feeling of 
optimism," said Tom Green, a Corcoran faculty member for 20 years and member of 
the board of the Washington Project for the Arts. "When Orr-Cahall came along, 
I was really excited." 
</P>
<P>
But Deal and Green said things quickly started to deteriorate and that 
Orr-Cahall depicted herself as a functionary of the board whose performance 
soured her relationships with staff and faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
With the Mapplethorpe episode a climactic failure, few museum experts believe 
Orr-Cahall has the capacity to be an effective leader. "When a professional 
makes a mistake, that person should be disciplined and the incident should be 
corrected," said Thomas N. Armstrong III, director of the Whitney Museum of 
American Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Whitney's trustees took out full-page ads in the New York Times and 
Washington Post protesting the amendment to an endowment funding bill offered 
by Helms that would prohibit federal grants for obscene, indecent, sacrilegious 
or offensive artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think the whole relationship of artists to institutions should be 
jeopardized by this," Armstrong said. "The Corcoran is going to have to prove 
that it's a professionally run institution that understands its role with 
artists." 
</P>
<P>
Political and arts observers here and elsewhere agreed that what really 
happened to the Corcoran may have been that the company-town climate of 
Washington, in which politics is the key industry and controls the social 
ecology, may have facilitated Orr-Cahall's and the board's misstep. It may have 
happened, said lobbyist Duncan and other arts observers, because the inherently 
political climate here led the Corcoran to believe that a political decision 
was permissible -- when only an artistic judgment was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Among Washington artists, not only has the episode birthed a heady new sense of 
empowerment, but it has taught political lessons, artists say. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists either have to say Helms is right or they have to be prepared to take 
sides," said Genna Watson, a local artist and 1983-84 winner in the 
prestigious, endowment-funded Awards in the Visual Arts program. "They have to 
say Helms is right or he is very wrong and it's very destructive and very 
frightening what he is starting. 
</P>
<P>
"Orr-Cahall and her board members put themselves on the other side of the 
fence. They were trying to be a neutral country, like Switzerland. But you 
can't be a neutral country in this. It's like Germany caving into Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
"Orr-Cahall says she didn't want to come into a political battle between the 
NEA and Congress. We said, 'What better a place to have been?' " said John 
Dixon, the Corcoran school's chairman of fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians have not looked at artists as messengers," he said. "Artists are 
generally perceived as being disconnected -- some extremity out there that's 
interesting. Artists are sensitive to the environment they are in. They are 
signaling things in the society that are either right or wrong."

Jerald Silva's masterfully painted watercolor nudes are caught somewhere 
between Ingres' psychological portraits and strictly formal figure studies 
toying with light, form and technique. Confusion arises because the female 
figures are so often bland individuals at the mercy of the artist's technical 
display. Yet occasionally they survive the assault with dogged inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
This intensity enlivens the somewhat languid action in paintings like "Woman 
Rising," where a seated nude, gazing determinedly straight ahead, is pictured 
about to push off from a red chair directly at the viewer. Behind her on a 
steam-fogged picture window are wet, drippy finger marks that catch her 
willpower and radiate like an expressionistic halo. 
</P>
<P>
Silva's dexterity with the figure and his ability to make watercolor steam drip 
is wonderful. Loose, but accurate he can make color imitate just about any 
light effect. Yet it's only when he stops fiddling with all the gee-whiz 
effects and settles in to say something that the paintings really come to life. 
His steamy "Olympia" is a wonderful visual pun on sexuality. Most moving is a 
cunning and unsympathetic self-portrait. (Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, 
to Oct. 21.) SUVAN GEER

Don Suggs' new series of landscapes and portraits talk about mental roadblocks; 
signs and symbols that substitute for reality then become confused with 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Portraits are tightly cropped heads of famous political personalities, but 
faces are hidden behind their national flags. Strictly from hair styles and the 
country's emblem we know who is being represented. Yet we are confronted by the 
awareness that we cannot see that individual, only the symbol of who or what 
they are -- their country, their politics and, to some extent, the way they 
appear physically. Titles like "Big Capitalists" and "Big Communists" drive 
home the pigeonhole effect of classifications by which we codify ideas and 
people. 
</P>
<P>
What is immediately clear from the portraits takes longer in Suggs' landscapes. 
We are so accustomed to viewing painted nature as symbolic that we are less 
inclined to mix up the representation with the thing itself. In these pieces, 
the obstinacy of the abstract sign, blocking entry into the picture, serves to 
remind us that art itself is busy creating abstract realities that impede 
direct experience. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are stark black-and-orange etchings and woodcuts by German 
Expressionist Georg Baselitz. Covering 23 years of image-making, the work 
courts abstraction with various technically unsophisticated means until 
eventually settling comfortably into upside down figuration. Baselitz images 
are bold and graphic, stimulating as much for their use of dynamic line as the 
way their inverted subjects quickly cease to be an issue. (L.A. Louver, 77 
Market St. and 55 N. Venice Blvd., to Oct. 21.) SUVAN GEER

Neutrality is the watchword of Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff and Thomas Struth, 
three young German photographers who dispassionately take in the passing scene. 
Ruff and Struth's subject is architecture; Ruff's images are of people in 
public spaces. His photographs are large, crisply executed, open-ended, 
non-judgmental catalogues of subjects and situations that can be found in 
contemporary urban society. 
</P>
<P>
This enterprise is indebted to Bernd and Hilla Becher's massive 
photo-documentation of German industrial buildings. The younger generation 
seemingly has challenged itself to create equally sober, impersonal, 
uninflected documents using large formats and -- on occasion -- color film. 
</P>
<P>
In Struth's black-and-white images of apartments, banks and other buildings in 
European cities, skies are bleached white and there is no visible human 
presence. The fanatic clarity and Sunday-morning stillness of these views allow 
you to ponder such details as the disposition of the blinds in apartment 
windows or the patterns in which people have parked their cars. Not glorified 
in any way, these buildings are oddly idealized by virtue of their seeming 
removal from the bustle of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
A trio of Ruff's very large exterior views of houses is oriented in a squarely 
frontal manner. Shot in Cibachrome, each view nevertheless contains only the 
most severely limited palette: gray skies, green grass, white curtains. The 
very clarity of these views -- utterly devoid of people, with only rudimentary 
signs of residential life -- gives them a curious transparency. They are as 
plain, and invisible, as the nose on your face. 
</P>
<P>
Gursky, who also works in Cibachrome, looks at the way people (and animals) 
arrange themselves in open settings -- whether they be students lounging on a 
university terrace, people at a tennis court in Paris or hens in a field. These 
are social groups seen as dispassionately as bacteria on laboratory slides or 
the bits of constantly reconfiguring glass in a kaleidoscope. (Margo Leavin

Theophilus Brown, a Bay Area figurative painter who emerged in the 1950s, has 
not been shown in Los Angeles since 1968. In recent untitled paintings his 
subjects are idealized industrial scenes and figures in interiors. 
</P>
<P>
In "Untitled (Elevated Freeway)," a startled dog pauses precisely in the middle 
of the lower edge of the painting. Behind it is a lavender street with a yellow 
divider, the reassuring, salmon-colored bulk of a dumpster and buildings whose 
sides are punctuated by the rhythmic repetition of window frames. The title 
object in "Untitled (Yellow Boxcar)" is just a small swatch of bright paint in 
the middle distance, a place for the eye to travel after hooking up with the 
green tanks and buildings casting colored shadows and the pink and turquoise 
cement laid out so cleanly in the brilliant, even light. 
</P>
<P>
The small figurative paintings on panel are of studio situations: "Model 
Holding Coffee Cup," "Beth Drawing Model." The figures themselves remain 
ciphers, forms carefully positioned to stabilize other elements in the 
composition, to interrupt the transit of rays of light. The compositions exude 
a certain dryness and cautiousness, as if a casual sketch of friends at work 
was reworked too many times. An academic pall also hangs over acrylic-on-paper 
images of seated figures and charcoal drawings of male and female nudes whose 
tight, heavy outlines betray an unmistakable tension. (Koplin Gallery, 8225

BARYSHNIKOV, ABT BREAK ALL TIES IN BITTER DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov, who planned to retire from the American Ballet Theatre 
next year, this week unexpectedly broke all ties with the New York dance 
company. He has demanded that ABT remove his name from all its documents and 
stationery and has threatened to withdraw two full-length ballets from the ABT 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The dancer-choreographer's moves climaxed an unusual and apparently bitter 
power struggle within ABT that became public Thursday. Company officials 
released to The Times the texts of two "Dear Misha" letters outlining an angry 
dispute over the employment status of Baryshnikov's assistant, his sudden 
decision to leave at all and even his level of personal commitment to the 
company during his nine-year reign as its artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
The board was especially critical of Baryshnikov's efforts -- or lack of them 
-- to raise money for the company. 
</P>
<P>
"It must not go unmentioned," the ABT board said in one of the letters, "that 
your reluctance to participate in fund raising on behalf of your own company 
did not make achieving our goals any easier." 
</P>
<P>
The letter -- signed by top ABT board members, including ABT Chairman Melville 
Straus and President Leo M. Walsh Jr. -- chided Baryshnikov for never taking a 
full salary and insisting on only his well-known $1-a-year token earnings 
because it contributed to the appearance that he was not fully committed to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly you felt that a commitment of this nature would have compromised your 
other pursuits," the board members said. 
</P>
<P>
The board accepted "with regret" Baryshnikov's "decision to leave the Company 
in the middle of the 50th anniversary season." 
</P>
<P>
In June, Baryshnikov announced he would step down from his ABT post in the 
summer of 1990. At that time, he said he wanted "to pursue other professional 
options," which have included a budding stage and film career. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication at the time of bad feelings between the 
dancer-choreographer and ABT officials. 
</P>
<P>
Only weeks before his announcement, he persuaded ABT to hire Jane Hermann as 
executive director. According to one of the letters, he told her then that he 
would be staying with ABT for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
But the ABT-Baryshnikov dispute heated up on Monday, when the 
dancer-choreographer's agent, Edgar Vincent, wrote Hermann demanding that 
Baryshnikov's name "be removed from all official documents of ABT, i.e. 
letterheads, programs, brochures etc." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent also disputed the board's claims about Baryshnikov's commitment to the 
financial health of ABT, insisting that he had "contributed large sums from his 
own pocket to help out the board" and that he often asked "close personal 
friends" to contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
What prompted the letter exchange -- and Baryshnikov's decision to leave the 
company -- appears to be the employment status of Assistant Artistic Director 
Charles France. The letters without citing specifics suggest a number of 
sticking points -- personal and professional -- regarding France's employment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Baryshnikov, the company has severed relations with France. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to executive director Hermann, France has taken a year's leave 
of absence. 
</P>
<P>
France pursued "business on behalf of the company which was inconsistent with 
the artistic and financial planning which I was attempting to implement. This 
caused us to work at cross purposes," Hermann said in a letter to Baryshnikov. 
"When it finally became apparent that the situation with Charles would remain 
unchanged on every level, he was requested to complete his contract by taking a 
year's leave of absence with full salary and benefits." 
</P>
<P>
According to ABT spokesman Robert Pontarelli: "The board on Wednesday night 
agreed to stand by Jane in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach France and Baryshnikov were unsuccessful Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov, 41, is dancing Tuesday night with the Martha Graham Dance Company 
in New York in the world premiere of "American Document." He leaves for 
Brussels next week for a two-month stay that will include dance appearances in 
a new work by the American choreographer Mark Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best known dancer today, Baryshnikov defected to the West in 1974 
after a distinguished career with the Soviet Union's famed Kirov Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Riga, Latvia, he went to Leningrad at the age of 15 and applied for 
entrance to the Vaganova School, where he studed for three years with the 
legendary ballet teacher Alexander Pushkin. At 18, he joined the Kirov. 
</P>
<P>
After his defection, he danced with the ABT and the New York City Ballet before 
taking over the top artistic post at the ABT in 1980.

AT AKBAR, DINING'S ON THE MILD SIDE

<P>
The long, narrow light-pink and mauve space at Akbar Encino Cuisine of India 
looks like a trendy Indian restaurant in London. 
</P>
<P>
The decor is pale and refined, as is the cooking. Spices and spiciness are 
toned down, which works well in a few dishes, but not as well in others. 
</P>
<P>
On the successfully refined side is Kashmiri Kebab, yogurt-marinated chicken 
skewer-cooked to a beautiful hazelnut brown. The dish retains a creamy, 
delicate texture but is not bland. The tandoori meats, available in a mixed 
grill appetizer or entree, reveal a talent for marinating that gives the meat a 
deep through-and-through flavor, not merely a wash on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Gentility, however, seems to be the downfall of two appetizers. 
Kashk-e-badamjan, sauteed sliced eggplant in a seasoned garlic-yogurt sauce, 
has none of the vitality this usually zippy dish needs. And papadum are 
unreliable at Akbar: one time crisp and fresh, one time dish-cloth tired. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of the dishes at Akbar are delightfully unexpected. Bhen masala is 
lotus root in a creamy sauce. The root itself, which looks like brownish 
oversized okra, has a pleasing-to-the-bite resilience and absorbs flavors well. 
The dish would have been more satisfying if the sauce had more flavor. Bihari 
chicken, on the other hand, is a fully realized dish -- I didn't want to share 
it. Pieces of chicken are marinated in mint chutney, then charred on a spit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Keema mattar, minced lamb with peas and potatoes, was adequately 
seasoned, a number of other dishes weren't. Lamb korma, chunks of lamb in a 
cream sauce, was simply bland. The same was true of malai kofta, vegetable 
croquettes in tomato and onion sauce. Eggplant bhartha, a sort of homogenous 
vegetable stew, had some of the smokiness of roasted eggplant but lacked the 
depth of seasoning that usually makes this dish distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
The sometimes too-exotic nature of Eastern desserts is not a problem at Akbar. 
Even though they are less sweet than we are used to desserts being, kheer khas, 
rice pudding, and kulfi, pistachio ice cream, were very much to my taste. The 
rice pudding was granular and runny, like tapioca, and the ice cream had the 
texture of frozen milk, with pieces of pistachios and almonds scattered about. 
"Mango with ice cream" didn't taste enough of mango to make it worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Since I am familiar with Akbar in Marina del Rey, it was surprising that the 
cooking at Akbar Encino was so under-flavored. I don't know if this is due to a 
preconception about Valley taste or in reaction to actual complaints about 
over-spicy food. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: Kashmiri kebab, $8.95; Bihari kebab, $9.95; kheer khas, 
$3.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Akbar Encino Cuisine of India, 17049 Ventura Blvd., (818) 905-5129. Open for 
lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Sunday through Friday, dinner 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. 
Full bar. Monday through Saturday. Major credit cards accepted. Street parking. 
Dinner for two, food only, $35 to $45.

Revivals are part of every theatrical community, and the San Fernando Valley is 
no exception. But in recent years, Valley theaters have also played host to a 
number of ambitious and affecting world of West Coast premieres. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those highlights include such recent works as Murphy Guyer's "American 
Satire" (Theatre West, 1986), John Ford Noonan's "Talking Things Over With 
Chekhov" (Victory, 1987), Rafael Lima's "El Salvador" (Gnu Theater, 1988), Will 
Holt's "A Walk on the Wild Side" (Back Alley, 1988), Leslie Caveny's "Love of a 
Pig" (Theatre West, 1989) and Doug Haverty and Adryan Russ' "Roleplay" (Group 
Repertory, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming fall season promises an equally diverse -- and potentially 
energetic passel of openings. 
</P>
<P>
At Sherman Oaks' Actors Alley, Anthony Webster's dark comedy, "The Greatest Man 
Alive," opens Oct. 6. Directed by John Crawford, the story concerns a 
72-year-old man who attempts to hang himself as a last bid at attaining fame. 
Opening Oct. 18, and playing alternate nights, is Peter Lefcourt's 
comedy-drama, "Only the Dead Know Burbank," about a contemporary television 
writer whose co-worker claims to be William Faulkner. Donna Hardy directs. 
</P>
<P>
At the Back Alley Theatre in Van Nuys, Matthew Witten's "The Deal," an 
absorbing drama about an FBI sting gone awry, plays through Oct. 29. Back Alley 
co-producing director Allan Miller directs Michael Cavanaugh, John M. Jackson, 
Will Nye and Charles Siebert. Also at the theater: Will Holt and Dion Alden 
Holt's popular children's show, "Max and Zoey, Zoey and Max" returns for an 
Oct. 7-29 run. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank's Alliance Theatre continues its one-act festival until Oct. 15 with 
Craig Pettigrew's "Brutal Mandate," Stan Jones' "Blue in the Face," Michael 
Slade's "Thanksgiving," and Deb Lacusta and Dan Castellaneta's "Pieces of 
Eight: A Collection of Urban Oddities." 
</P>
<P>
At the Richard Basehart Theatre in Woodland Hills, Agatha Christie's whodunit 
"Mousetrap" continues to catch audiences; the run is scheduled to go through 
the end of October but may extend through December. 
</P>
<P>
Running through Nov. 19 at the Gnu Theatre in Toluca Lake, Gnu artistic 
director Jeff Seymour directs Gary Frank and Bruce Kirby in "A Life in the 
Theatre," David Mamet's serio-comic study of generation-gap actors sharing a 
summer stock dressing room. Up next: the Dec. 21 premiere of Daniel Faraldo's 
"How Does it Feel?," a "heavy-heavy" drama about two sisters confronting their 
past. 
</P>
<P>
At Group Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood, Patricia Lee Willson's staging 
of Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing" plays until Oct. 14. It is followed 
in early November with the premiere of Craig Alpaugh's "Neighborhood Crime 
Watch." Dom Salinaro directs this "ironic comedy" about a group of people who 
band together to organize a neighborhood watch -- and promptly get robbed. 
</P>
<P>
At the Donald O'Connor Family Theatre in Studio City, managing director Alicia 
O'Connor continues her program of readings and discussions of world premieres, 
offering theatergoers a chance to see plays for free -- and play critic 
afterward. The as-yet-unscheduled readings usually take place twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
At Studio City's Theatre West, Thomas Strelich's desert-locked "Neon Psalms" 
continues to Oct. 22, alternating with Leslie Caveny's clever comedy "Love of a 
Pig" (to Oct. 8). Terry Dodd's "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset" is next up on Nov. 
3; Michelle Trufo directs the modern-day drama, set in New Mexico, about a 
working-class family coming apart at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
At the Third Stage in Burbank, the 10-person comedy-improvisation troupe Live 
Humans on Stage continues its current program on Oct. 26 and Nov. 30 -- with an 
all-new show planned for January. 
</P>
<P>
At Burbank's Victory Theatre, Bruce Graham's bomb-scare comedy, "Early One 
Evening at the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grille" continues to Oct. 15 -- at least.

LAUNDRY OF QUAKE-DAMAGED HOSPITAL IN SYLMAR REBORN AS A SHOWPLACE FOR ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, Schlosberg is a Sherman Oaks free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the 1971 earthquake shook the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sylmar, 
47 people were killed and most of the buildings were damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital closed, but the laundry building survived. And in 1977, when the 
90-acre site reopened as Veterans Memorial Park, the laundry building was 
transformed into a public art gallery. Atop a hill amid eucalyptus and palm 
trees, the Century Gallery overlooks the San Fernando Valley, with a view on a 
clear day as far as Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Local people in Sylmar still don't know it's here," said Priscilla Neilsen, 
who has worked for two years as the gallery's curator and only paid employee. 
</P>
<P>
Neilsen says the gallery's mission is to aid emerging artists and make art 
available to the public free of charge. The gallery, which closes during the 
summer, has opened its season with an exhibit of works by local Latino artists. 
</P>
<P>
Neilsen is paid for 12 hours a week by the Los Angeles County Department of 
Parks and Recreation, which operates the park. The Century Gallery is the only 
gallery in the county's parks and recreation system, and it is kept open mainly 
by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The county pays for the building's maintenance and the invitations to each 
exhibition opening, but not much else. Artists are asked to pay $40 to help 
with printing and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's catch as catch can as far as a budget goes, and it gets worse every 
year," Neilsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery's 12 volunteers are called the Docent's Council, and most are 
members of the Sylmar Women's Club, a philanthropic group that donates about 
$600 a year to the gallery. The docents provide the food for the art show 
openings. 
</P>
<P>
"They bake their own cookies," Neilsen said. "It is very much a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the small budget, Neilsen says, the gallery has professional standards. 
"Everything is screened, and we look for high-caliber work. We don't show 
back-yard artists.' 
</P>
<P>
The works range from $100 to $3,000, and the gallery takes a 25% commission 
from sales. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery runs five exhibits a year, at least one showcasing the works of 
local artists. The current show, "Para Nuestro Exhibicion Latino," features 
more than 50 works of eight Latino artists from Sylmar and Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's giving some new artists exposure that they couldn't get elsewhere because 
they don't have the experience," said Andro Avendano, an artist who proposed 
the show. Avendano hung the show himself, mixing his work and that of seven 
other artists throughout the 5,000-square-foot gallery. The exhibit includes 
oil paintings, colored-pencil drawings, bronze sculptures, watercolors and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Neilsen says the show is unusual for the gallery. "We've had a lot of 
avant-garde, conceptual, Southern California art, but it doesn't necessarily 
appeal to the San Fernando Valley. This is more pictorial, more figurative. 
There's nothing here that you don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery's next show, which opens Nov. 5, will feature paintings, prints and 
photographs of the San Fernando Mission by two local artists. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Dahlsten, president of the Docent's Council, says the volunteers give 
tours to elementary school students from the inner city, sometimes as often as 
twice a week. "It's usually their first gallery," Dahlsten said. "Whether they 
get anything out of the art show or not, it's a beautiful park." 
</P>
<P>
Business people who come to the park occasionally visit the gallery during 
lunch breaks, Dahlsten says, but the gallery doesn't get many other visitors. 
She says she and other volunteers used to advertise art shows by putting flyers 
on neighbors' doorsteps, but they stopped because of the poor response. 
</P>
<P>
"People around here probably go to Los Angeles to see something when it's just 
as good here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is it difficult to attract visitors, Dahlsten says, but it's becoming 
increasingly difficult to attract volunteers, which they have tried to find 
through women's clubs and running ads. "I'm 72," she said. "And I'm about the 
youngest one we've got." 
</P>
<P>
"Para Nuestro Exhibicion Latino" can be viewed at the Century Gallery, 13000 
Sayre St., Sylmar, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. For 
information, call (818) 362-3220.

NEW COLUMN OFFERS THE VIEWS OF VETERAN POLITICAL WRITER BOYARSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' newest columnist, veteran political reporter Bill Boyarsky, 
concludes that one reason the Los Angeles County government is virtually 
paralyzed on many issues is that the five supervisors can't stand each other. 
</P>
<P>
Boyarsky today begins a regular column on government, politics and urban 
affairs in Los Angeles County. Boyarsky for the past 11 years has been chief of 
The Times' city-county bureau. He also has reported from Sacramento and 
Washington and is the author of the books "Ronald Reagan: His Life and Rise to 
the Presidency" and, with Nancy Boyarsky, "Backroom Politics." 
</P>
<P>
Boyarsky's column will appear Fridays on Page 2 of the Metro section.

MORE THAN 1,600 ARTWORKS SEIZED; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPECTED FAKES CONFISCATED IN RAIDS ON GALLERIES, HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It is believed to be one of the largest confiscations ever of suspected 
fraudulent art, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Thursday after 
detectives seized more than 1,600 art prints and other works in a series of 
raids touched off by the arrest of an art dealer trying to peddle a phony 
Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
Officers, with help from the district attorney's office and the FBI, searched 
eight outlets of the Upstairs Gallery art store chain in West Los Angeles, the 
San Fernando Valley, Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa. The vast bulk of the seized 
works came from the firm's warehouse in Huntington Beach, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The raids began Wednesday night with the arrest of a Manhattan Beach art dealer 
who allegedly tried to sell a fake Renoir for $3.2 million to an undercover 
police officer posing as a Japanese businessman during a meeting in the Little 
Toyko section of downtown Los Angeles. The dealer, a French national named 
Frank De Marigny, 38, was arrested and booked for investigation of grand theft. 
He was held at the Parker Center jail in lieu of $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nightlong Operations 
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, officers fanned out to the galleries. The search and seizure 
operations lasted through daybreak Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 search locations included De Marigny's beachfront home, where officers 
recovered several paintings and an assault rifle, and the Marina del Rey 
residence of another person, who was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The massive haul turned a property storage room at police headquarters into a 
virtual art gallery, with lithographs stacked to the rafters. Other suspected 
phony works attributed to such prominent artists as Marc Chagall, Joan Miro and 
Rufino Tamayo were displayed to the media as Gates hailed the work of the 
search teams. 
</P>
<P>
"These intrepid enforcers of the law saved people who are art lovers a great 
deal of money" by making the confiscations, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, officers seized 1,687 lithographs believed to be fraudulent, with 
about 1,200 of them taken from the Huntington Beach warehouse, said Detective 
Bill Martin, the department's art sleuth. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the alleged fakes retailed in art galleries at upwards of $50,000 each, 
with a total value of about $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he believes that the overnight raids may have netted the most 
suspected fraudulent lithographs ever seized. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gates nor Martin could estimate how many unsuspecting art buyers may 
have already purchased phony prints, saying only that rising demand for art in 
general has led to millions of dollars of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Explain Relationship 
</P>
<P>
Also, they said they could not explain the relationship of independent dealer 
De Marigny to the Upstairs Gallery chain without jeopardizing the continuing 
investigation. Gates said detectives were still checking to see whether anyone 
in the firm's management is linked to the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Upstairs Gallery said an internal investigation was under 
way to determine whether the firm was duped into buying fake art. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as this company is aware, all of the prints which the company purchased 
from its sources are believed to be authentic," said Patricia White, the firm's 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the case began when detectives found out that De Marigny was 
offering the painting "Young Girl With Daisies" by French impressionist Pierre 
Auguste Renoir for sale. Investigators immediately were aware that the painting 
was a fake because the real one hangs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
De Marigny also uses an alias of Frank Orval, and has a clean criminal record, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
De Marigny lives in a posh house on The Strand in Manhattan Beach, drives a 
Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari and is known by art insiders as "Prince Frank," said 
Dale Sekovich, an investigator for the Federal Trade Commission who has 
monitored the case. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FTC was not conducting its own investigation into the Upstairs 
Gallery confiscations, Sekovich said the commission has the power to initiate a 
civil lawsuit to try to gain restitution for victims of art fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said some of the allegedly phony artwork seized in the raids appears 
linked to a Claremont man, criminally charged in August, who was deemed by a 
district attorney's office spokeswoman to be "one of the largest art forgers on 
the West Coast, if not the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged forger, Anthony Gene Tetro, 39, faces 45 felony counts for 
allegedly fabricating and distributing lithographs of the works of well-known 
painters. Martin said he was free on bail awaiting court proceedings in his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Police initiated their investigation of Tetro's activities after Japanese 
artist Hiro Yamagata recognized a miniature watercolor being sold under his 
name as a fake on a stroll through a Beverly Hills gallery.

BILL BOYARSKY: GOVERNMENT BY FIVE SOLOISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One reason the Los Angeles County supervisors aren't accomplishing much these 
days is that they can't stand each other. 
</P>
<P>
You sense the unfriendly atmosphere even before you enter the supervisorial 
meeting room on the third floor of the Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the metal detector visitors must pass through. Nor is it the 
glass barrier and locked door recently added to the waist-high wooden barrier 
separating the public from the supervisors. These are perilous times and only 
the irresponsible would criticize a public official for taking precautions. 
</P>
<P>
The sour atmosphere emanates from the supervisors themselves. As soon as the 
meeting starts, it's clear these five are not friends. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, seated on a raised dais, seldom talk to each other. They give 
speeches to the audience, which is usually small. Bureaucrats sit on the right 
side of the room, lobbyists on the left. Both groups have heard the speeches 
many times before. The vast center section is empty, unless people have come 
for an organized protest. 
</P>
<P>
Up on the dais, the atmosphere is tense. Although the public may imagine some 
kind of ideological unity, the three conservative members of the board -- Mike 
Antonovich, Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum -- have not formed any kind of a 
permanent bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum does not like Antonovich. When Antonovich is making one of his 
speeches to the empty chamber on a pet cause -- health foods and the government 
of Taiwan are among his favorites -- Schabarum visibly cringes. Once, during an 
Antonovich speech, he eased over to a reporter and made a slighting remark 
about Antonovich's intelligence. But Antonovich is so single-minded about his 
notions that he is insensitive to Schabarum's anger. Antonovich's insensitivity 
makes Schabarum even madder. 
</P>
<P>
Few are fond of Schabarum. That is because he visibly and regularly sneers at 
his colleagues and county department heads during the meetings. Schabarum and 
Antonovich act as if they don't respect Dana, as if he were some sort of wimp 
or a closet moderate because he occasionally tries to compromise with county 
bureaucrats. Dana, whose first impulse is to get along with everybody, now 
frequently disagrees with Antonovich and Schabarum on public health issues. 
</P>
<P>
All three act contemptuous of the two liberals, Kenny Hahn and Ed Edelman, 
rolling their eyes upward or making condescending remarks at their speeches. 
Hahn, an old FDR man, hates the conservatives as much as Roosevelt hated Dewey. 
The conservatives return the feeling, always refusing to elect him chairman, an 
honor that is supposed to be rotated yearly. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman is the liberal Dana, wanting to be a friend to the world. That has not 
worked. For several years, Schabarum and Edelman maintained a thin bond of 
civility by playing tennis, but Edelman said they rarely play now. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn and Edelman have never talked much, even before Hahn was disabled by a 
stroke. Hahn has a brilliant ability to get his name in the papers or on the 
news. He listens to KNX or KFWB on his way to work, alert to a news event that 
will provide an opportunity for a Hahn press release. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, who complains he is ignored by the press, is jealous of this Hahn 
talent. Hahn, meanwhile, thinks Edelman is too cautious, too reluctant to join 
him in fights for lost liberal causes. 
</P>
<P>
What is the harm in all this? Actors and actresses have played great romantic 
scenes while hating each other. You may dislike the person at the next desk or 
in the adjoining office, but you all pull together for the old company. 
</P>
<P>
It's no different in government, especially local government where reductions 
in tax revenue, beginning with Proposition 13 in 1978, have forced elected 
officials to be creative. To do that, people must work together, exchange ideas 
and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
That's especially true of the supervisors, who pass laws and control 
departments. But these supervisors don't supervise because they are isolated 
from each other and wrapped up in their own rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS policy is an illustration. The supervisors are ambivalent about the 
disease. Fundamentalist Christian Hahn and political conservatives Schabarum 
and Antonovich tend to cast the disease in moral terms and see AIDS as rough 
justice. Dana is pragmatic. Edelman is the biggest supporter of AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the supervisors disagree on the issue, normal legislative debate 
might produce compromise solutions. But their AIDS deliberations have been 
marked more by speeches than an exchange of ideas. Meanwhile, tax-supported 
AIDS hospitalization costs are twice as high in Los Angeles County as in San 
Francisco because of supervisorial failure to set up enough outpatient clinics 
and hospices. San Francisco has had such facilities for years. 
</P>
<P>
Someone ought to tell the supervisors they weren't engaged as soloists. They're 
supposed to be playing in an ensemble.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UPBEAT ZSA ZSA RETURNS TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An upbeat Zsa Zsa Gabor breezed into Beverly Hills Municipal Court Thursday, 
saying she was feeling "confident and happy," a marked change from the day 
before, when she bolted out in anger, vowing never to return to her 
cop-slapping trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor had burst out of the courtroom several minutes after she took exception 
with closing statements by Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night I was furious," the former glamour queen declared. "I'm not angry 
any more. I'm here to be here." 
</P>
<P>
The jury Thursday ended its first full day of deliberations in the misdemeanor 
trial and will resume discussions this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she thought the outcome of her trial would be, the former Miss 
Hungary, dressed in a red suit and diamond earrings, replied: "How do I know? 
I'm feeling confident and happy. I came here to show you guys (reporters) I'm 
not afraid to wear my diamonds. I earned it all legally." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, apparently following her lawyer's advice, left the courthouse at 
lunchtime, and after a shopping trip went home to await word on the verdict.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KNIFE-WIELDING MAN KILLED BY OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Los Angeles police officers shot and killed a knife-wielding man Thursday 
morning at the man's Hollywood apartment building after the man stabbed an 
owner of the building, apparently in a dispute over rent, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not released, was shot at the Amor Arms on Orchid 
Avenue about 11:15 a.m., moments after he stabbed 57-year-old Howard Klausener 
once with what Lt. William Hall described as a 15-inch knife. 
</P>
<P>
Klausener, part-owner of the four-story building, was in serious condition at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with a stab wound to his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Klausener had gone to collect the man's back rent when he was 
attacked by the tenant. Klausener escaped and summoned police and paramedics, 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
After police arrived, they found the man in his apartment with the knife and an 
identical weapon in a sheath strapped to his belt. 
</P>
<P>
The officers ordered him to drop the weapons but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
When the man charged out into the hallway at police, they fired nine or 10 
rounds at him with their 9mm pistols, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The man died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
None of the officers were hurt.

FORMER KING HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR CALLS HIS REMOVAL UNFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Delgardo, who was replaced as administrator of Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center, said Thursday that the action by county supervisors 
was unfair and blamed health care problems at the hospital on inadequate 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked a question of did I think it's fair?" Delgardo told reporters 
after giving the county a status report on the Watts hospital. "Certainly, I 
don't think it's fair." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital Authority, which issues 
bonds to finance construction at the hospital but is not empowered to act as an 
advisory board, expressed support for Delgardo, who was transferred by the 
supervisors Tuesday to an administrative position at the Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd all like to see Mr. Delgardo running the hospital, but what can we do?" 
asked Terence Lee, the panel's president. 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo told the panel that the county hospital, which shoulders an enormous 
patient load, including about 1,200 emergency ambulance runs a month, lacks 
sufficient funding and staffing to handle its heavy caseload. 
</P>
<P>
He said the health care problem cited in a series of state and federal reports 
exists at other county hospitals, and he charged that King had been unfairly 
singled out. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Commissioner Jerry Godell whether he believed that the charges were 
racially motivated -- as South Los Angeles community activists have alleged -- 
Delgardo said, "You'll have to draw your own conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to replace Delgardo with Ed Renford, former chief of staff for 
administration for the Health Department's hospital division, was made by 
supervisors at the urging of Health Department Director Robert Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn called for a county investigation 
of "serious charges of substandard health care" based on a series of articles 
in The Times. The articles, he said, pointed out "poor administration, a lack 
of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of space, staff and 
funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing load." 
</P>
<P>
The move came a day after federal officials notified hospital officials of 
plans to cut off $60 million in public health care funds to King on Dec. 21, 
effectively closing the hospital unless the health care deficiencies are 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Two reports prepared by state health officials earlier this month cited the 
hospital for massive, wide-ranging deficiencies in administrative leadership, 
quality assurance, infection controls, nursing, dietary services and physical 
environment.

LAPD WILL REQUIRE DESK OFFICERS TO WALK THE BEAT TWICE A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the mayor's refusal to provide money for police foot patrols, 
Chief Daryl F. Gates has approved a plan to mobilize desk-bound officers to 
walk the beats twice a month, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to mobilize administrators, tentatively scheduled to begin in late 
October, would allow police to deploy the popular foot beats without dipping 
into budgetary reserves, Cmdr. William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a reasonable and feasible way within our current budget to meet 
the needs the community has voiced," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has approved the plan and implementation details are being pulled 
together by the department's Office of Operations using reports compiled by 
supervisors on the numbers of officers available. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans called for plainclothes officers through the rank of sergeant 
working administrative or desk jobs to don uniforms and walk beats two days 
during each 28-day deployment period. Case-carrying detectives probably would 
not be included. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we're asking does a person have to be on a desk job five days a week 
or is four enough," said one administrative officer working on the plan. "We're 
looking at who we can squeeze loose." 
</P>
<P>
Booth and other administrators denied that the plan is a response to Mayor Tom 
Bradley's veto of a City Council plan to fund foot patrols in 18 of the city's 
crime hot spots with an allocation of $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor recommended that the council approve a $750,000 expenditure for a 
three-month pilot foot-patrol program, with the bill being paid by a surplus in 
the department's salary account due to unfilled positions. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's suggestion, expected to be implemented by the council, drew a 
warning earlier this week from Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who said 
using salary savings and other cost-cutting methods to fund the foot beats 
could jeopardize other police efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Council committee meetings to discuss the mayor's recommendation have been 
marked by appeals from residents of crime-ridden communities who asked for an 
override of the veto and sought the city's commitment to help rid their 
neighborhoods of gangs and drug dealers.

SOUTH BAY CHILD KIDNAP ATTEMPTS INCREASING, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police believe that a man who has been trying for more than two weeks to lure 
South Bay schoolchildren into a blue vehicle may be striking with increasing 
frequency over a wider area, raising fears among school officials and parents. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday afternoon, police in Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and 
Hawthorne reported seven separate attempts -- all of them unsuccessful -- to 
abduct a total of nine children, ages 7 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they're coming more rapidly, and he's moving into other cities," said Sgt. 
Jack Zea of Manhattan Beach, where the first incident took place Sept. 13. 
"It's almost like this guy just came out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reached Out 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident occurred Wednesday evening in Redondo Beach, where for 
the first time, the man was reported trying to use force. Police said he 
reached out to grab a 7-year-old girl after she refused to get in his blue 
pickup truck, but the girl got away. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the man used the same approach each time: He told children that 
their parents have been injured and he would take them home or to school. In 
each case, the children did as they had been taught: They ran away. 
</P>
<P>
The latest attempt caused some police officers to worry that the suspect is 
becoming more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very big concern," Hawthorne Detective Richard McCarroll said. "We 
don't care (which police department) gets him, as long as somebody gets him 
before it gets to that point." 
</P>
<P>
In one typical attempt, the man pulled alongside a pair of Hawthorne children 
and, according to McCarroll, said, "Your parents were in an auto accident, and 
you are to go with me to the counselor's office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patrols Increased 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the attempted abductions, police in Hawthorne, Redondo Beach, 
Manhattan Beach and Torrance -- where a similar but unrelated incident took 
place Monday -- have increased their patrols around schools. 
</P>
<P>
Parents say they are now driving their youngsters to school or walking with 
them, rather than letting them go alone or with other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever parents are gathered, the subject does come up," said Linda Mack, 
president of the Parent Teachers Assn. at Manhattan Beach Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in several South Bay school districts reported that they have sent 
flyers home to parents or have circulated information about the suspect to 
teachers, who have been asked to reinforce the safety lessons their pupils have 
already been taught. 
</P>
<P>
"We've put every teacher on notice," Sharon Andrade, assistant principal of 
Hawthorne's York Elementary School, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, children involved in five of the seven incidents reported 
that the man who approached them drove a blue pickup truck with a white camper 
shell. In the other two incidents, the children reported that the man drove a 
blue vehicle -- in one case a Pontiac, in the other case a station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said these discrepancies do not change their theory that the incidents 
are related. In each case, the description of the suspect was the same: a man 
in his 30s, white or Latino, with a dark complexion, dark hair and a dark 
mustache, sometimes wearing sunglasses.

DENY RENEWAL OF ROCKWELL NUCLEAR LICENSE, FOES PLEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of nuclear projects at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory on Thursday night implored federal officials to deny the aerospace 
firm's request for renewal of its radioactive materials license and called on 
Rockwell "to clean up and clear out" the nuclear part of its business. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing at the State Office Building in Van Nuys attended by 150 
people, speaker after speaker attacked Rockwell's credibility, and argued that 
nuclear work should not be done in a densly populated area. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wallace, a Calabasas resident and spokesman for the Rocketdyne Cleanup 
Coalition, told federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission Administrative Judge 
Peter B. Block that the group opposes the relicensing "because we think that 
our property values, our physical, emotional and psychological health are more 
important than the equity of Rockwell stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne is the division of Rockwell that operates the lab on a rugged 
plateau in the Simi Hills three miles west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Johnson, president of the Susana Knolls Homeowners Assn., whose members 
live close to the research site, said local residents, until recently, were 
generally unaware of Santa Susana's nuclear mission. They knew it "simply as 
'the place that tested rockets and made all those roaring noises," she said. 
"Now we fear the silent threat of contamination from radioactive and toxic 
materials. What we don't know frightens and concerns us." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the first dozen speakers assailed Rockwell's relicensing request, 
except for a company official who drew a smattering of applause when he told of 
moving his family to the area several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Mills said he would not have moved "into this area if I didn't 
believe it was totally safe." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who will rule on Rockwell's license request, said the hearing was 
informal and will not be part of the record on which his decision is based. At 
a second Van Nuys hearing, scheduled to begin in the State Office Building at 
9:30 a.m. today, the judge will consider whether to grant opponents intervenor 
status, which would allow them to present evidence and file rebuttals to the 
company's case. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has used the lab to "declad," or dismantle, nuclear fuel for the 
Energy Department's weapons program. The firm, seeking a 10-year license 
extension, maintains the lab poses no hazard.

INGLEWOOD RIVALS STRUGGLE WITH VOTER APATHY IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Terry Coleman went door-to-door one evening this month urging Inglewood 
residents to vote for Garland Hardeman in next Tuesday's City Council election, 
he wore a bullet-proof vest and strapped a .357 Magnum to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
In a drug-infested area on 102nd Street, Coleman said he found little concern 
for next week's court-ordered special election in District 4 between Hardeman 
and Ervin (Tony) Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people had no idea there was an election and probably didn't 
care," said Coleman, a community activist who is on disability as a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affluent Forum 
</P>
<P>
The campaign scene was a little different Tuesday night in Inglewood's gated 
Carlton Square development, where the two candidates fielded questions from a 
plush clubhouse surrounded by palm trees, a sauna and swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates spoke before about 40 residents on airplane noise, faltering 
businesses and the troubled lives of prostitutes on Imperial Highway. But some 
of those at the meeting were disappointed that more of the about 600 registered 
voters in the development did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
After fighting their battle through the legal system on and off for two years, 
Hardeman and Thomas have returned to the campaign trail. Both face a common 
obstacle as they hand out campaign literature at front doors, attend block 
parties and picnics, and decorate the community with signs: attracting voter 
interest in an election that has dragged on for years. Tuesday's election 
originated 836 days ago today on June 16, 1987, when Hardeman had a 544-233 
edge over Thomas at the polls. But absentee ballots gave Thomas a last-minute 
626-610 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman demanded a recount and then filed a lawsuit alleging that Thomas' 
campaign workers intimidated voters and violated their right to ballot secrecy 
during a house-to-house absentee ballot campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas remained in office two years as the case was appealed up to the state 
Supreme Court, which upheld a lower court's decision that overturned Thomas' 
win. Thomas was forced to leave office this summer pending a new election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tiring' Dispute 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very tiring," Thomas said. "Every time I turned around there was 
another subpoena." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman went back to Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday, claiming Thomas 
had distributed campaign literature that allegedly violated an injunction 
barring his portrayal as an incumbent. Judge Dzintra I. Janavs ordered Thomas 
to return to court at the end of this month to defend his latest campaign 
literature, which shows him sitting in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
With the main legal battle over, the campaign between Thomas, 47, and Hardeman, 
32, has returned to what it was originally: a race for a seat that represents a 
district with about 24,000 residents and 7,581 registered voters, about 17% of 
whom voted in the June, 1987, election. 
</P>
<P>
With such a small target group, officials with both campaigns say voter turnout 
is the key as they work aggressively to firm commitments before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
As in past Inglewood elections, a sign war has developed. Workers for the two 
campaigns said Thomas is concentrating on large campaign signs on corners, 
while Hardeman has smaller signs in individual yards. Both campaigns contend 
that their signs have been removed by their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
While on the campaign trail, Hardeman, an 11-year veteran officer with the Los 
Angeles Police Department, carries voter canvass forms he purchased from a data 
processing company. The computer sheets provide a block-by-block breakdown of 
registered voters and how often they voted in the last four elections. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman has launched an absentee ballot campaign, sending out hundreds of 
campaign brochures earlier this month that included absentee ballot request 
forms to send to the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"As we get closer, we'll be targeting all the people we identified as Hardeman 
supporters," Hardeman said in an interview. "We'll be checking in with them and 
making sure they get to the polls. It's a real basic sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman, who is using the campaign slogan "Do the Right Thing," said he plans 
to win back the more than 600 people who supported him in 1987 and add about 
200 others who either supported Thomas or did not vote. "With 800 votes, I feel 
very comfortable," Hardeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a manager with the 7-Up Bottling Corp., says he has not been stressing 
absentee ballots, because he says he has name recognition from serving on the 
council for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' treasurer, Ollie Salone, says Thomas has been seeking support by 
walking the district, while campaign workers work the phones. "We're after the 
people who have lived here in Inglewood and know what kind of person Tony is," 
Salone said. "Many people are tired of the whole legal deal." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has distributed two sets of campaign literature, one that emphasizes the 
experience he gained on the council and another that attacks Hardeman for 
exaggerating his accomplishments in helping the community and for stirring up 
trouble where none exists. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman calls the attacks "a petty cheap shot by a desperate campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has downplayed his past support from Mayor Edward Vincent, one of those 
accused by Hardeman of intimidating voters in the 1987 election, although 
Hardeman maintains that Thomas' campaign is still controlled by the mayor. 
Vincent says he supports Thomas but is not playing an active role in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At a Vincent fund-raiser last month, the mayor introduced Thomas as one of the 
government officials who helped the city win the National Civic League's 
All-America City Award this year. The mayor introduced Thomas again at a 
community dinner celebrating the award last Sunday before nearly 3,000 
Inglewood residents in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
W. R. (Tony) Draper, a District 4 resident who voted for Hardeman in 1987 but 
is remaining neutral this time, said the much publicized election will be 
anticlimactic no matter who wins. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so disenchanted with how long this has been going (on)," Draper 
said. "There are people who want to go down to the polls, drop their ballot in 
the box and punch nothing."

AGREEMENT TO PUT SUSPENDED ART TEACHER BACK AT DRAWING BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A popular Palos Verdes High School art teacher, suspended in March from her job 
because of a nagging work-related injury she sustained six years ago, has won 
her battle to return to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Chizuko de Queiroz said Thursday that under an agreement reached with Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Unified School District officials, she will resume teaching at 
the high school Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz, 57, also said she will retain her position as head of the school's 
art department, a job she has held from 1980 until her suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really grateful for all the support" from the community, teachers and 
students, said De Queiroz, who was joined in her effort for reinstatement by 
hundreds of students who signed a petition on her behalf last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Davis, the district's assistant superintendent for personnel, declined to 
comment on any aspect of the matter until school board members are briefed 
Monday night at their regularly scheduled meeting. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether De Queiroz agreed to enter a rehabilitation program as 
part of her settlement with the district. The district had insisted in May that 
she enter such a program before she was allowed to return to work, either as a 
teacher or at some other job. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz has maintained that she does not require rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Neither De Queiroz nor her attorney, Henry Willis, would comment on specifics 
of the agreement, which they said contains a confidentiality clause.

"All I can tell you is we settled the matter," Willis said. " . . . She is 
going back. Everybody is satisfied. It is an amicable settlement." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jeffrey Younggren said Thursday that he was unaware of the 
outcome of the settlement meeting, which was held Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz, who has taught in the district for 27 years, was told by district 
officials in March that she could no longer hold her $43,000-a-year teaching 
job because of her on-the-job injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, more than 200 students signed a petition asking that De Queiroz 
be given her job back, and about 70 faculty members signed a separate petition 
protesting "the callous way Mrs. De Queiroz was removed from the classroom." 
The teachers also praised De Queiroz's "outstanding" achievements as an 
educator. 
</P>
<P>
During her suspension, she was paid her accumulated sick leave, district 
officials had said. De Queiroz initially injured her back, neck, shoulders and 
upper arms in 1983 while lifting 50-pound bags of sculpting material, and has 
aggravated that injury six times in the last five years. She has filed eight 
claims with the district for physical and emotional injury. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Jack Price said in May that the district removed her from the classroom 
on the advice of the self-insurance pool that covers the district in workers' 
compensation matters. In a statement read to school board members, the district 
and its carrier said "it is clear from the record" that De Queiroz "is 
vulnerable to significant reinjury in her employment." 
</P>
<P>
Price, in an interview several days later, explained that if the district had 
ignored the insurers' advice, the district, instead of the insurance pool, 
would become liable for workers' compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accommodate Injuries 
</P>
<P>
Price could not be reached Thursday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The district argued that De Queiroz should be barred from returning to work 
unless she retrained for another position, or, if possible, her present job was 
modified to accommodate her injuries. The rehabilitation would be conducted by 
a trained counselor through the workers' compensation board, the district said. 
</P>
<P>
De Queiroz said, however, that she did not require rehabilitation. She said she 
had already made modifications in her work practices, including using student 
assistants, so she would not have to do such tasks as lifting. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides produced doctors' reports and physicals to justify their positions.

HOUSE VOTES CUT IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX; 
</P>
<P>
MAJOR VICTORY FOR BUSH; DEMOCRATS' ALTERNATIVE IRA PROPOSAL IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush won a major victory on one of his key campaign issues Thursday 
as the House voted by a surprisingly wide margin of 239 to 190 to cut the 
capital gains tax rate sharply. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic showdown that had been expected to produce a close vote, the 
House defeated a Democratic alternative that would have raised taxes on the 
wealthy and expanded the availability of deductions for individual retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The capital gains measure would reduce the tax on profits from investments in 
stocks, real estate and most other assets to a maximum of 19.6% through 1991, 
from a top rate of 33% under current law, with an effective date of Sept. 16. 
Under the plan, the capital gains rate would increase to 28% starting in 1992, 
but profits that resulted from future inflation would not be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Stimulant to Growth 
</P>
<P>
Republicans hailed the capital gains tax cut as a victory for those who believe 
that it will stimulate economic growth by providing an incentive for 
individuals to create new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic leadership believes in redistributing the wealth. The 
bipartisan coalition believes in creating wealth," said House Minority Leader 
Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.). He attacked Democrats for engaging in the "rancid 
rhetoric of class warfare." 
</P>
<P>
But Democratic leaders repeatedly hammered away at the tax cut as a giveaway to 
the rich that would do little to spur long-term economic growth and would widen 
the budget deficit in future years. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be voting to give $25,000 a year on the average to . . . the wealthiest 
families in America," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), 
who received a standing ovation from Democrats for a speech that ended the 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia and Republican 
Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, was supported by 175 Republicans and 64 Democrats. 
Only one Republican, Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, voted against the White House, 
which lobbied heavily for the capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a telephone call to Archer, praised Republicans for a job "well done," 
and, in an echo of President John F. Kennedy's rhetoric, said that the tax cut 
would help "get the country moving again." 
</P>
<P>
The capital-gains measure is one of several divisive issues attached to a broad 
$16.6-billion deficit-reduction bill that lawmakers will continue to debate 
next week. Once it passes the House, the bill moves to the Senate, where the 
capital gains tax cut has a good chance of winning, despite stiff opposition 
from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"The Senate leadership feels as strongly as our leadership does," said House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). "This isn't the end of this process. It's 
the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bentsen Readies Plan 
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) plans to fight the 
capital gains cut with a measure that expands IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the third-ranking Democrat in 
the House, conceded that the unexpected strength of the coalition of 
Republicans and mostly conservative Democrats who supported reducing capital 
gains taxes puts "tremendous pressure on the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
A Bentsen staff member acknowledged that the Senate is traditionally more 
sympathetic to lower capital gains tax rates than the House but said that the 
influential chairman of the Finance Committee will oppose it because he 
"believes strongly that we cannot afford both IRAs and capital gains." 
</P>
<P>
Several lawmakers, however, predicted that Congress could end up approving both 
a capital gains tax cut and restoring at least a partial IRA tax deduction for 
millions of upper-middle-class taxpayers who lost the tax break in the sweeping 
1986 tax revision law. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Archer told reporters that Republicans, now counting on 
Congress to approve the measure later this year, plan to follow up their 
expected victory with a proposal in 1990 to make the temporary 19.6% capital 
gains rate permanent. "We have our foot in the door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman also has stated that the 
Administration plans to return to Congress with a plan to prevent the capital 
gains rate from rising to 28% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, 
said that the capital gains cut "savages tax reform." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, whose committee previously approved the capital gains cut by a 
slim 19-17 vote over his opposition, said that lower capital gains taxes are "a 
temporary feel-good gimmick" that will lose money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the expected increase in transactions in stocks, bonds, real estate 
and other assets that would stem from the reduction, the plan is expected to 
raise about $9.4 billion in the first three years. But after that, tax analysts 
believe, it would lose about $5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski charged that Bush "persists in the blind pursuit of shallow 
political victory" and is promoting "a fire sale" by encouraging wealthy 
Americans to sell assets now to take advantage of temporarily lower tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
It was Rostenkowski, however, who first opened the door to the capital gains 
cut in early June when he floated a trial balloon by suggesting a temporary 
capital gains tax cut as a means of meeting a budget requirement to raise 
government revenues next year. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to work out a compromise with Bush, an old friend who once served on the 
Ways and Means Committee, Rostenkowski ultimately lost control of the 
tax-writing panel and, together with several embarrassing losses this year on 
other issues, badly damaged his reputation as a shrewd politician. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing they could not defeat something with nothing, House Democratic 
leaders hastily put together a package aimed at derailing the capital-gains 
measure approved two weeks ago by the tax-writing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, recommending a tax increase on their own for the first time in 
years, proposed that roughly 600,000 taxpayers earning upwards of $200,000 a 
year should be required to pay a top rate of 33% rather than the 28% flat rate 
they currently pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democratic Target 
</P>
<P>
Although Republicans gleefully attacked the plan as revealing the Democratic 
fondness for tax hikes, Democrats hoped to pick up political backing from 
middle-income voters by tying it to a package that would have used the extra 
revenues to reduce the deficit and to broaden IRAs so that all taxpayers would 
receive at least a 50% deduction on contributions of up to $2,000. They also 
proposed to eliminate the 10% penalty on early withdrawals if the money were 
used to buy a first home or to pay family college expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans, however, fought back by picking off dozens of Democrats, many 
of them Southern conservatives, who have strong ties to local businesses, 
timber and farming interests that stand to gain from the capital gains tax cut 
and other tax measures in the bill. Of the 64 Democrats who voted against their 
leadership, 42 were from the Deep South, while several others represented 
largely rural and timber districts. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 45 California lawmakers in the House, all 18 Republicans lined up with 
the White House to retain the capital gains cut. Among the 27 California 
Democrats, four voted for a lower capital gains rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOTE ON CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- Here is how members of the California delegation voted Thursday 
when the House rejected a Democratic alternative to President Bush's proposed 
cut in capital gains taxes. A "yes" vote meant a vote against the capital gains 
reduction: 
</P>

Dixon, Dymally, Edwards, Fazio, Hawkins, Lantos, Lehman, Levine, Matsui, 
Miller, Panetta, Pelosi, Roybal, Stark, Torres, Waxman.

U.S. AND SOVIETS SEEK JOINT WAR ON TERRORISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the strongest indication to date of Soviet interest in superpower 
cooperation on international terrorism, a U.S.-Soviet counterterrorism task 
force today will issue a sweeping list of recommendations for joint action. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals include the "timely exchange of information about terrorist 
groups or individuals, their tactics, plans, specific operations and supply, 
training and support structures," members of the task force told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
They also call for mutual assistance in investigations of aircraft bombings, in 
release of hostages, in restricting the movement and financial activities of 
terrorists and in preventing terrorist acquisitions of weapons of mass 
destruction -- from plastic explosives to chemical or nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensitive Stumbling Block 
</P>
<P>
Sharing intelligence on terrorism has been the most sensitive stumbling block 
to superpower cooperation because both nations fear disclosure will endanger or 
expose sources. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong, closed-door talks in Santa Monica held by the Soviet-U.S. Task 
Force to Prevent Terrorism are considered important in testing the waters for 
more formal efforts. Both Bush Administration and Soviet officials have 
expressed interest in probing the depth of commitment on specific joint actions 
-- especially on intelligence issues -- through unofficial channels before 
direct negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism has been a continuing source of tension for many years," said 
terrorism specialist Brian Jenkins of the RAND Corp., which hosted the 
discussions. "For the two countries now to address this issue with the degree 
of candor that has been evident throughout the talks is extraordinary. There 
was nothing that was not on the table. 
</P>
<P>
"We were specific and often blunt about what concerns us the most. The Soviets 
were equally frank about putting their cards on the table." 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is genuinely committed to do whatever is necessary to 
eliminate terrorism, preferably with the United States," said Andrei Shoumikhin 
of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a member of the Soviet delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 10 American and 10 Soviet experts on terrorism met in Moscow in 
January for the first discussions on terrorism held at any level between the 
United States and Soviet Union, which helped pave the way for the opening of 
formal superpower talks on the issue last June. 
</P>
<P>
The task force proposals issued today will be relayed to both governments in 
preparation for what Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced last week would be a second round of 
official talks on terrorism in early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indication of Interest 
</P>
<P>
Although this week's talks are unofficial, the Soviet delegation includes the 
two highest-ranking former KGB officials ever to publicly visit the United 
States. Their presence is considered an indication of Soviet interest in 
establishing a new framework for joint counterterrorism efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The KGB has sent a clear message. It is willing to cooperate with the CIA," 
said John Marks, chairman of Search for Common Ground, a Washington-based 
public-interest group that was one of the talks' co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The new spirit of cooperation was evident in a recommendation by former leading 
U.S. and Soviet intelligence officials at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"No nation, nor any of its government services nor representatives, should 
engage in or sponsor, encourage, train or supply any kind of terrorist 
activity," it declares. 
</P>
<P>
It also calls on nations that condemn terrorism to "take all appropriate 
measures to prevent terrorism and to persuade other nations and groups with 
which they have contact to cease and desist from employing terrorism tactics." 
</P>
<P>
The proposals even urge joint U.S.-Soviet efforts to prevent portable missiles 
and munitions from falling into the hands of terrorists, and to recover those 
already available on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
On the growing problem with narco-terrorism, the task force calls for the 
superpowers to exchange information on production, smuggling and distribution 
of drugs as well as to cooperate on restricting laundering of funds derived 
from drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The American delegation included former CIA Director William Colby and former 
Deputy CIA Director Ray S. Cline. The two former Soviet officials are Lt. Gen. 
Fjodor Sherbak, who was deputy KGB chief, and Maj. Gen. Valentin Zvezdenkov, 
who headed the KGB's counterterrorism unit for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"They pay a price for being here. The mere fact they are engaging in 
discussions will be seen by some governments and groups as a hostile act," 
Jenkins said. "No matter what level of cooperation is ultimately established 
between the two governments, terrorist groups now have to take into account 
that KGB intelligence may be targeted against them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Forthcoming, Practical' 
</P>
<P>
Colby described his former Soviet counterparts as "very forthcoming and 
practical." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cline said: "I'm impressed with the long experience in 
counterterrorism of the Soviet participants. I am convinced that they have come 
with a clear signal from their own government that it is in the Soviet interest 
to come down on the side of combatting terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought Soviet cooperation was produced by more than just glasnost, 
as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness is known. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, they have finally realized that terrorism may turn against the 
Soviet Union, perhaps because of the increasing tension of ethnic minority 
groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration sources also have speculated that ethnic and religious 
turmoil in several Soviet republics, as well as a continuing exodus from East 
Bloc nations, could lead to the emergence of new terrorist groups that may 
target the Soviet Union or its personnel and facilities abroad.

HOW DOES IT WORK?; 
</P>
<P>
CREATIVITY: IT MAY BE MORE THAN BIOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is it that Leonardo da Vinci could paint the Mona Lisa, while another 
person is barely able to draw a stick figure? What enabled Emily Dickinson, in 
only four years, to write nearly 1,800 poems, some of the most lyrical in the 
English language, while many people can barely piece together an office memo? 
And how is it that Albert Einstein could revolutionize the world of physics, 
when most people don't even know how their car radios work? 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, philosophers and teachers have speculated on why some human 
beings are extraordinarily creative and others have merely mortal abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient Greeks thought it was the result of divine inspiration -- a gift 
from the gods. Some modern thinkers have theorized that it is just a lucky 
combination of genes, a happy but largely accidental coincidence of events. 
Others have equated creativity with the ability and tenacity to solve problems 
-- a skill, they insist, that can be learned by almost anyone, or even by a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with these pet theories and intrigued by the seemingly endless 
stream of contradictory observations, a small but determined number of 
researchers have renewed the study of creativity -- a subject that until 
recently had fallen into disfavor among serious scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the findings confirm earlier suspicions about the curious natures of 
creative individuals, but others are forcing scientists and educators to 
rethink what creativity is and how it is manifested. 
</P>
<P>
Creative people may have certain inherited talents or biologically controlled 
predilections -- a painter, for example, might have peculiar sensitivity to 
light; a musician, an unusual awareness of sound; a dancer, a certain physical 
size or muscle mass. Yet, scientists are finding that creativity goes beyond 
biology. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most surprising and important findings has been that, as people 
become more creative, they also become more consumed by their work. And their 
devotion seems to be at least as important to their success as innate talents. 
</P>
<P>
Many creative people, scientists now realize, also live with a certain degree 
of mental illness. In fact, one of the fundamental attributes of creative 
people may be the ability to make productive use of mental states, such as 
depression and mania, that tend to cripple others. 
</P>
<P>
Although still in its infancy, the study of creativity could have profound 
implications for modern society. If creativity can be understood -- better yet, 
if it can be cultivated and taught -- then mankind will surely be better 
equipped to do any of a number of things: beautify cities, cure diseases, 
improve the economy. 
</P>
<P>
While it may be some time before science can offer a reliable blueprint of how 
to teach creativity in the classroom or to encourage it in the workplace, 
enough information about creativity has been uncovered to begin to fill in 
important blanks in science's picture of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
It was World War II that provoked the first round of serious research on 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the first research was financed by the War Department. The military 
wanted new technology and more creative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 20 years, scientists devised dozens of tests to measure 
creativity. But most were little more than word games and visual puzzles -- 
interesting, but probably capable of measuring only the most trivial aspects of 
the creative process. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, most respectable scientists had all but abandoned studies of 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1960s' preoccupation with pseudo-creativity and free life styles 
that was partly responsible for giving the whole subject of creativity a "bad 
name," said Frank Barron, a retired professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz 
and a leading expert on creativity. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, social scientists became preoccupied with seeking more 
respect from the rest of the scientific and medical community. They 
concentrated on observable, quantifiable behavior and tried to distance 
themselves from subjects as intangible as creativity. 
</P>
<P>
What scientists did discover during these early years, however, were some 
puzzling inconsistencies in creativity research. While some creative people 
were clearly geniuses, others did not appear to be especially gifted. While 
some were unusually confident, others were remarkably insecure. Still others 
appeared to fluctuate, in a cycle of despair and optimism, self-doubt and 
self-assurance. 
</P>
<P>
There remained some universal traits that creative individuals seem to share: 
insatiable curiosity, openness to new experiences, willingness to take risks, a 
tendency to think in images. There was also what one researcher described as 
"the uncontrollable urge of almost every creative person" to go beyond 
established limits, to break rules. 
</P>
<P>
Although athletes are not usually thought of as "creative," Dick Fosbury was 
someone who seemed to meet all the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was just a lanky, awkward Oregon boy who 
wouldn't do the high jump like everyone else. Fosbury insisted on going over 
the bar backwards and headfirst. But the "Fosbury flop" not only won him an 
Olympic gold medal, it also inspired athletes that followed to break records 
experts said could not be touched. 
</P>
<P>
But fame and glory do not seem to drive most creative people, researchers 
found. It is the intrinsic rewards of the work -- the fascination of mixing 
paint or combining sounds or manipulating numbers. 
</P>
<P>
And the willingness to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Farber, a New York artist, recently described his work this way: 
</P>
<P>
"You put yourself in a situation where you don't know what's going to happen. 
If you really say what you think, you risk being ostracized; you may make a 
fool of yourself. But if you don't say what you think, you'll let yourself 
down. And that's worse. . . . It's that risk that is so compelling. It's like 
rock climbing, if you don't think something terrible could happen, it's not 
much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Although his ability to paint may in part be "biological," Farber said, it is 
also a matter of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of inspiration is a romantic one that has done artists as much harm 
as good," Farber said. "Sometimes people ask me where I get my ideas. It's 
simple. The ideas come from working, from getting up everyday and going to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
As Sir Isaac Newton so disarmingly put it when asked how he was able discover 
the law of universal gravitation: "By thinking on it continuously." 
</P>
<P>
Why are some people so driven? 
</P>
<P>
That question intrigued Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a Hungarian-born professor of 
psychology at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Csikszentmihalyi wondered how creative people behaved when they were alone. He 
also wanted to know what they thought about when they were in the throes of 
creation. Were they happy, sad, worried, relaxed? 
</P>
<P>
Csikszentmihalyi had an idea. 
</P>
<P>
He would ask research subjects to carry beepers, which could be activated 
randomly throughout the day. Subjects would stop and jot down what they were 
doing right then, and how they felt about it. The data would be fed into a 
computer and analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Csikszentmihalyi's idea not only worked in the 1970s, when he began to use it, 
the method caught on with other researchers. In a decade, thousands of subjects 
-- artists, composers, dancers, chess players, mountain climbers, basketball 
players, ordinary people -- had given researchers detailed snapshots of their 
activities and moods. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Chicago researcher documented what philosophers had long 
suspected -- that creative people simply do not always do things the way other 
people do -- nor do they think about what they are doing in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
People performing at their peak seem to enter another world, Csikszentmihalyi 
explained recently. "Time is distorted, a sense of happiness and well-being 
overcomes them." They have entered, what he calls, a state of "flow," "when 
things seem to go just right, when you feel alive and fully attentive to what 
you are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Athletes talk about entering of "the zone" -- when a basketball player makes 
one shot after another from seemingly impossible angles or distances. Batters 
will see a baseball gliding toward them, looking as big as a beach ball. They 
know they cannot miss, and they don't. 
</P>
<P>
Creative people such as professional athletes or gifted musicians are not the 
only ones to experience this state. But what makes them different is that they 
get these highs from their work, and with inordinate frequency. 
</P>
<P>
What about the people who have the potential to be creative, but are not? 
</P>
<P>
Csikszentmihalyi wanted to know more about them, too. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he chose as his subjects high school students who were highly gifted 
in mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
"All these students were equally talented, but, in the opinion of their 
teachers, half of them no longer showed any real interest in mathematics. We 
wanted to know why. Why should one group virtually abandon the subject while 
another group would take advanced courses, compete in tournaments, be involved 
in math clubs?" Csikszentmihalyi asked. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at all the data and analyze it, in the end what you find is that 
the committed students like spending time alone, they like solitude and in 
their solitude they find the time to pursue . . . their passions," 
Csikszentmihalyi said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, "most people cannot put up with solitude for very long. 
After a few minutes and certainly after a few hours, they start to feel a kind 
of psychic entropy. They are unable to coordinate their thoughts and feelings 
and actions in orderly ways. . . . To keep from feeling unhappy or bored, they 
pick up a telephone or turn on the television." 
</P>
<P>
Charles L. Fefferman, a professor at Princeton University who is considered one 
of the great mathematicians of this century, described some years ago how he 
spent his days after he had won a prestigious fellowship that freed him from 
his ordinary teaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, he went to his office -- in his home. There, making himself 
comfortable in a wingback chair, he worked quietly by himself the entire day. 
During those hours he did not talk. He did not turn on a computer. He did not 
even pick up a pencil or piece of paper. He simply sat -- and thought. Eight, 
10 hours a day doing nothing but thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Such solitude would drive most people crazy. 
</P>
<P>
What drives a chosen few to go off by themselves and concentrate, to tolerate 
solitude and even flourish in it? 
</P>
<P>
"We're only beginning to have some of those answers but clearly it has 
something to do with their homes and their families," said Csikszentmihalyi, 
who is now writing a book on the subject. "If the family environment is 
supportive but expecting children to do well and to work hard, that clearly 
helps. . . . If there is too much turmoil or if the families are too 
complacent, that will clearly affect the ability to focus and concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
What some researchers suspect -- and hope -- is that exposure to productive 
solitude will make talented young people crave more. Just like addicts who want 
drugs or athletes who seek runners' highs, truly creative people, those who are 
both talented and productive, have had an extraordinary experience, one they 
very much want to repeat -- again and again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think," Csikszentmihalyi said, "the desire to capture this euphoria is the 
root of all artistic pursuits." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else can be said about creativity, one thing is now clear: It takes 
more than raw talent or devotion to an idea to be genuinely creative, 
Csikszentmihalyi said. 
</P>
<P>
"To have creativity requires a society that cultivates creativity and promotes 
creativity," Csikszentmihalyi said in a recent telephone interview. "I studied 
the subject for over 24 years and only recently did I realize what creativity 
really is: It is the interaction between societal needs and individual 
talents." 
</P>
<P>
Schools have begun to realize this and are encouraging students to participate 
in creativity contests -- the most notable of which is "Odyssey of the Mind," 
started by a New Jersey couple 10 years ago and now financed partly by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which includes classroom materials and extracurricular art and 
science projects, encourages youngsters to have unpredictable ideas; to ask 
questions, rather than simply look for answers; to understand that there is 
nothing whatsoever wrong with failure, that it is a natural and necessary part 
of discovery. The idea is to make children realize that they are different and 
to understand that being different is good. 
</P>
<P>
And, fearing that Americans were not as creative as their counterparts in 
Japan, companies over the last 20 years have turned to "creative consultants." 
In fact, an entire industry of these experts has flourished in the United 
States. Dr. Edward deBono, a British professor of medicine, has toured the 
country, explaining the concept of brainstorming. William J. J. Gordon and 
George M. Prince, co-founder of Synectics Inc., has started a think tank in 
Boston to promote creativity in corporations. And James Adams, a Stanford 
University business professor, has explained the concepts of creative thinking 
to hundreds of thousands of people in a book titled "Conceptual Blockbusting." 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with efforts to cultivate creativity is that there is no 
"proof" that they do what they claim, said Robert W. Weinberg in a 1986 book 
"Creativity: Genius and Other Myths." For every study that said a certain 
approach worked, there was another study saying that it did not. Some studies, 
for example, have shown that brainstorming generates more ideas, but other 
studies say it does not always produce better ones. 
</P>
<P>
Although there may be no scientific formula for how to do it, one thing is 
clear about creativity, Csikszentmihalyi concluded: When cultures value it, 
creativity flourishes. When they ignore it or are afraid of it, creativity 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
Renaissance Italy was one culture that revered creativity, Csikszentmihalyi 
said. "Some of the greatest art the world has ever seen was produced in 
Florence in the 15th Century, not just because there happened to be some 
talented people living there at the time, but because the bankers and powers of 
the city wanted it. They wanted to create a community so impressive that it 
would be known as the second Athens. And so they did; they saw to it that it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, creativity was reviled in ancient Egypt. "For nearly 3,000 years, 
works of art made in Egypt looked the same . . . because what society valued 
then was order and consistency." 
</P>
<P>
In the modern world, particularly in the United States, there now exists an odd 
combination of reverence and indifference toward creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are people who strongly believe in the idea of creativity," 
Csikszentmihalyi said. "We admire it. We are proud of it. . . . But we do very 
little to encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
"Partly it is because we aren't sure how. . . . Perhaps we are a little afraid 
of it."

U.S. GRAND JURY OPENS PROBE OF BRADLEY CONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has opened a wide-ranging criminal 
investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's conduct in office and his personal 
finances, including his business ties to eight banks and brokerage firms, it 
was learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation surfaced through the serving of a subpoena this month on the 
city treasurer's office, an agency that has been near the center of controversy 
surrounding the mayor over the last year. A copy of the subpoena was obtained 
by The Times Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Slowly 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury's involvement in the case represents a significant acceleration 
of a federal investigation that had moved slowly for months. 
</P>
<P>
A federal official close to the case confirmed that investigators now are 
seeking evidence to present to the grand jury for a possible indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no two ways about it," said the federal official, who asked not to be 
identified. "This is a grand jury that is looking at Mr. Bradley. It's the old 
saying, 'Where there's smoke there is fire,' and there is heavy smoke here. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet if we are going to find criminality or just some bad 
judgment, but there's certainly enough to go through the grand jury process. 
It's a real thing." 
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury has more powers than any of the city agencies that have 
investigated the mayor thus far. It has the authority to compel witnesses to 
testify under oath and can subpoena virtually any records, including personal 
income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey Eglash, whose name appears on the subpoena, said: 
"I can't comment. I can't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
FBI Special Agent Stanley Ornellas seemed surprised when told that the subpoena 
was made public Thursday. Citing FBI policy, Ornellas refused to discuss the 
subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
The subpoena was sweeping. Served Sept. 11 by FBI agents for the U.S. 
attorney's office, it ordered the treasurer to surrender any and all documents 
relating to an assortment of allegations against the mayor. Among other items, 
the subpoena sought records related to a bank that hired the mayor as an 
adviser and a Beverly Hills brokerage house that sold him junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has also has received a federal subpoena requesting documents, said 
Bill Chandler, the mayor's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relevant Information 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor will cooperate in providing all relevant and appropriate information 
to aid in this investigation," Chandler said. "The mayor is confident that 
there has been no impropriety on his part." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler declined to specify when the subpoena was served on the mayor and what 
records it sought. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the grand jury involvement comes two weeks after City Atty. James 
K. Hahn issued a report that found insufficient evidence to prosecute Bradley 
on conflict-of-interest charges. Hahn nonetheless attacked Bradley's 
"indifference" to ethical concerns in recent years and said the mayor had 
"clearly stepped into the gray area" between innocence and a chargeable 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Until recent weeks, federal authorities were divided over whether to pursue an 
investigation of Bradley in connection with his investments through Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. and its former junk-bond king, Michael Milken, who has 
been indicted on charges of fraud and insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have told The Times that authorities in New York City initially wanted 
to launch an investigation of Bradley, while officials in Los Angeles were 
reluctant. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Justice Department's public integrity section headquarters in 
Washington, which is overseeing the federal probe, ruled there were sufficient 
grounds to investigate Bradley. FBI agents in Los Angeles recently became 
active in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with federal political investigations said that a grand jury 
subpoena generally indicates that a probe is becoming serious. A subpoena 
normally is issued after FBI field agents have already sifted through available 
evidence, including documents and interviews that are provided voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
The subpoena was disclosed Thursday as part of a status report to the City 
Council on the embattled city treasurer's office. City Administrative Officer 
Keith Comrie said his auditors "stumbled" across the document while monitoring 
investment activities by the city treasurer in the wake of a controversy 
involving Bradley and Far East National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"We were over talking to the city treasurer and he said, 'Look at this 
(subpoena). I've got all this work to do,' " Comrie said. 
</P>
<P>
The subpoena demands the treasurer's office produce by Oct. 10 "all notes, 
drafts, calendars, diaries, logs, account statements and other written 
material, photos, graphs, computer disks, tapes and other recordings" regarding 
four financial institutions and four brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions are Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., Far East 
National Bank, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and Gibraltar Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is under the scrutiny of federal regulators as part of the 
insider-trading case brought against Drexel and Milken. Bradley has a close 
political relationship with Columbia Chairman Abraham Spiegel and has invested 
in Columbia stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury subpoena requests all documents involving investment banker Ira 
Distenfield, a former Harbor Commission president and one of Bradley's biggest 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury has requested documents that involve three companies that 
employed Distenfield: ITD Inc.; Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., and Smith, 
Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co. The fourth investment firm is Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Distenfield suddenly resigned his powerful Harbor Commission post as 
The Times was preparing a report on sworn statements he had made in 1987 before 
a confidential New York Stock Exchange arbitration hearing. In his testimony, 
Distenfield said he used his influence with Bradley to obtain a hotly contested 
contract for Smith, Barney, which employed him as an executive. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has denied that he was influenced by Distenfield. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many individuals or agencies were served with 
grand jury subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald L. Olson, an attorney representing Far East Chairman Henry Hwang, whose 
payments to Bradley as a bank adviser ignited the ethics scandal, said late 
Thursday, "I am not able to respond on anything" regarding demands for records. 
</P>
<P>
A banking source said Thursday that Columbia Savings apparently received a 
subpoena to furnish federal authorities with numerous documents. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several city offices that have figured in the controversy and 
investigations -- including the city controller, city administrative officer, 
city clerk, Community Redevelopment Agency and Harbor Department -- said they 
had not received subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources familiar with federal investigations of public officials, 
such subpoenas are issued if potential witnesses refuse to turn over needed 
documents or if the case reaches a point where criminal charges are seriously 
contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they start doing the subpoena process, that means that the case is very 
good," said one source experienced in federal political cases. 
</P>
<P>
It could take weeks, even months, from the time that documents are subpoenaed 
until the investigation takes its next step: calling witnesses before the grand 
jury, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
News of the expanding interest in Bradley's financial affairs by federal 
investigators represents a major political setback for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as the mayor and his aides are pressing a new public relations 
offensive to put the six-month-old controversy behind them. That effort, 
including a series of image-building public appearances and dogged insistence 
that Bradley has been cleared of any improprieties, was launched Sept. 14 when 
Hahn concluded his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said Thursday that the expanded federal investigation will not affect 
the mayor's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"He is certainly attending to city business, and it is business as usual," 
Chandler said. "The city attorney's report is behind us, and the mayor is 
moving forward."

Sappell, Henry Weinstein and Tracy Wood contributed to this article.

UNDER SCRUTINY 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney subpoenaed documents relating to the following businesses 
and individuals as part of a grand jury investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's 
finances and conduct in office: 
</P>
<P>
 FAR EAST NATIONAL BANK -- Paid Bradley $18,000 as an adviser during 1988. 
Bradley later returned the money. In March, 1989, after the mayor talked to 
City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg, the city reinstated a $1-million deposit 
with the bank and added another $1 million, both without competitive bids. A 
treasurer's office employee later obliterated a notation on a bid sheet that 
had indicated that the investment was made "per the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY FEDERAL SAVINGS &amp; LOAN -- For about 10 years beginning in 1978, paid 
Bradley up to $24,000 a year as adviser. During that period, the mayor signed 
ordinances that permitted a subsidiary of Valley Federal to develop land. 
</P>
<P>
COLUMBIA SAVINGS &amp; LOAN ASSN. -- Bradley has a long and close relationship 
with Columbia Chairman Abraham Spiegel and has invested in the company's stocks 
and bonds. Spiegel has won zoning variances from the city for real estate 
development projects. Columbia has been scrutinized by federal regulators as 
part of the insider trading case against Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king 
Michael Milken, who faces a 98-count federal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT -- Bradley maintained a special trading account within 
Milken's high-yield bond unit at Drexel and purchased at least one security, 
Gibraltar Financial Corp. bonds, when it was not available to the general 
public. Bradley later urged federal lawmakers to allow Drexel to maintain its 
junk bond division in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
GIBRALTAR SAVINGS &amp; LOAN -- Held several hundred million dollars in city 
funds. The mayor had invested $100,000 in junk bonds issued by the thrift's 
parent, Gibraltar Financial Corp., and apparently lost most of his investment. 
City treasurer's office documents show white correction fluid was applied to 
numerous bid records involving Gibraltar deposits. 
</P>
<P>
IRA DISTENFIELD -- Resigned as president of the Harbor Commission last May as 
The Times was preparing a report that he used his clout with Bradley to steer 
city business to the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham. The request 
for records includes Smith Barney and two other investment firms that later 
employed Distenfield -- Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards and ITD Inc. Since 1985, 
Distenfield has been one of Bradley biggest political donors, contributing more 
than $86,000.Mayor Tom BradleyLos Angeles Times

JURIST DRAWS REBUKE FOR VICTORIA WRIGHT LENIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Commission on Judicial Performance on Thursday publicly rebuked a 
Ventura County judge for his "unusually lenient" handling of traffic tickets 
issued to the daughter of Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
The commission's action marked the end of a four-month investigation of Ventura 
County Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark, who dismissed two traffic tickets issued 
to 24-year-old Victoria Wright after meeting at his home with Cathie Wright in 
June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clark, Jack E. Frankel, the commission's director and chief 
counsel, noted that Clark did not require Victoria Wright to appear in court on 
the tickets and dismissed both tickets after she attended traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
Under state guidelines, violators can attend traffic school in lieu of another 
penalty -- which usually prevents the offense from appearing on Department of 
Motor Vehicle records -- as often as a judge will allow. But most judges permit 
an offender to do so only once every 12 months, according to DMV spokeswoman 
Gina McGuiness. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Victoria Wright had been ticketed for 12 moving violations in the 
previous three years. All told, she received 27 traffic tickets -- including 24 
for speeding -- and was involved in at least six accidents in the eight years 
before the DMV revoked her license in March. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clark acknowledged that his actions "created the 
appearance of impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, I should have disqualified myself from any action in 
the case," he wrote, "even though my decision appeared appropriate based on the 
facts available to me at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Clark became the first judge to be "reproved" by the commission under a 
constitutional amendment passed by voters in 1988. "Reproval" is one 
disciplinary notch below a public censure, which requires a hearing before the 
state Supreme Court. No other action will be taken against Clark, stated 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel criticized Clark for speaking privately with Cathie Wright about her 
daughter's case outside his judicial chambers, preventing prosecutors from 
participating in the discussion or the public from observing it. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's actions, Frankel noted, violated the state Code of Judicial Conduct, 
which states that a judge should not "convey or permit others to convey the 
impression that they are in a special position to influence them." 
</P>
<P>
The judge also violated a provision requiring judges to "conduct themselves at 
all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and 
impartiality of the judiciary," Frankel wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The judicial decisions you made, though lawful, were unusually lenient," he 
concluded, adding that "the incident appeared to be isolated." 
</P>
<P>
The commission began its probe of Clark after Ventura County Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury issued a 97-page report in May declaring that Assemblywoman 
Wright "demonstrated a clear pattern of attempting to obtain special treatment 
for herself and her daughter with the police, the courts and the Department of 
Motor Vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury cited several instances in which Wright was said to have tried to get 
police to void tickets issued to herself or her daughter. However, Bradbury 
said Cathie Wright committed "no clear-cut criminal violations" that would 
warrant prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Wright responded by charging that the inquiry by fellow 
Republican Bradbury was politically motivated and "shameful," but she did not 
address most of the specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Thursday, Wright said her conversation with the judge 
was "no big deal, except as they're making it into something in regards to me." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, nothing was done," she said. "I just talked to him. I talk to him at 
fund-raisers and social events. He's a person. . . . It was a casual 
conversation in which I was looking for advice." 
</P>
<P>
Wright is expected to face a stiff challenge in the June, 1990, primary 
election from Hunt Braly, chief of staff to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). 
Braly has promised to make Wright's ethics one of the main issues in the 
campaign.

PROBLEMS WITH CONTROLS PROBED IN PLANE CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
GRAND CANYON AIRLINER ON WHICH 10 DIED HAD PRIOR LANDING TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Attention focused Thursday on possible problems with the directional controls 
of a sightseeing airliner that crashed when attempting a landing at Grand 
Canyon Airport on Wednesday, killing 10 and injuring 11. 
</P>
<P>
A survivor said that she had seen the cockpit crew struggling with the controls 
in the moments before the crash, and Federal Aviation Administration records 
indicate that, last February, the De Havilland Twin Otter had veered to the 
right when attempting a landing at the airport, striking a wing tip on the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
The records say the plane "lost directional control" in the Feb. 27 incident, 
possibly as a result of a "nose-wheel centering problem." Ronald L. Warren, 
vice president and general manager of Grand Canyon Airlines, said he did not 
know whether there had been a final determination of the cause of the Feb. 27 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Men on Plane 
</P>
<P>
The records show that, during the February incident, only two men were aboard 
the aircraft -- a pilot trainee and William Welch, 47, of Sedona, Ariz., 
captain of the flight that crashed on Wednesday. Neither man was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said that the plane, built in 1975 and bought by Grand Canyon Airlines 
two years ago from an operator in Alaska, had performed well, with no major 
mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Mayes, 66, told reporters from her hospital bed in Flagstaff, Ariz., 
Thursday that she had seen Welch and co-pilot Keith Crosson, 43, of Kailua 
Kona, Hawaii, fighting the controls on Wednesday as the turboprop airliner 
touched down on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes, a Nashville, Tenn., resident, said that, seconds after the plane's right 
wheel touched down, the aircraft "shot straight up" in the air again. 
</P>
<P>
She said she heard a loud buzzing sound as the plane made a slow U-turn to the 
left before crashing on its side in a hillside grove of scrub pine about 300 
yards from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes, who suffered a broken pelvis and severely bruised shoulder in the crash, 
said she had dragged herself from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
"I crawled as far away as I could and I waited for the medics," she said. "It 
seemed like an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
Welch and Crosson were among nine people listed by the Coconino County 
Sheriff's Department Thursday as having died in the crash. The identity of the 
10th person killed -- said to be a woman tourist from Scotland -- was being 
withheld pending notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
The identified dead, in addition to the cockpit crew, were Joyce Jones, 52, of 
Woodbridge, Va.; Lorraine Murphy, 75, of Random Lake, Wis.; Barbara Marchand, 
61, of Meriden, Conn.; Eugenia Sheehan, 78, of Youngstown, Ohio; John Sutton, 
65, and his wife, Donna, 63, of Modesto; and Helen Zuckerman, 64, of Boca 
Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors, in addition to Mayes, are Florence Bickley, 63, of Manchester, 
Conn.; Minnie Bowden, 59, of Murfreesboro, Tenn.; Susan Cline, 42, of 
Farmington, Mich.; Catherine Hampton, 55, of Walnut Creek, Calif.; Virgil 
Jones, 54, of Woodbridge, Va.; Jesse Murphy, 75, of Random Lake; Ellen Newman, 
75, of Youngstown; Joanne Pembleton, 57, of Murfreesboro; Mary Shaver, 57, of

All eleven of the survivors remained hospitalized Thursday at the Flagstaff 
Medical Center, about 70 miles from the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Laurin Bosse, an administrator at the medical center, said that Jones, the most 
seriously injured of the survivors, was in guarded condition on Thursday, 
suffering from severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Bosse said that the other survivors were listed in serious or stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, there's a lot of fractures -- hip, pelvis, leg and arm," 
she said. "There are a lot of lacerations, and a lot of bruising about the 
head, face and chest . . . . A lot of them are still under sedation." 
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety board investigators are expected to spend four 
or five more days at the scene in their efforts to piece together evidence on 
what caused the crash.

Grand Canyon Airlines spokesmen said that there was no indication of any kind 
of trouble during the 55-minute flight over the eastern end of the Grand 
Canyon.

John Lauber, the NTSB member heading up the investigation, said Thursday that 
transcripts of conversations between the cockpit crew and air traffic 
controllers at the airport confirmed earlier reports that nothing was said to 
indicate any problems as the plane came in on final approach. 
</P>
<P>
"They were cleared to land, and that was the last communication with the 
aircraft," Lauber said.

An Amtrak train smashed into a fire truck at a railroad crossing Thursday night 
and derailed, killing three people and injuring more than 150 passengers. At 
least two of the dead were in the fire truck. 
</P>
<P>
Both engines and 11 cars of the southbound Crescent, bound from New York to 
Atlanta and New Orleans, derailed when the collision occurred about 7:40 p.m. 
in this northern Virginia town about 40 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., 
said Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The train was carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20, he said. Five cars of 
the 16-car train remained on the track, said Pat Jeffrey, another Amtrak 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two on Truck Die 
</P>
<P>
Two of the dead were on the fire truck, which was responding to a call from the 
nearby town of Catlett when the accident occurred, said Sgt. Butler Grant of 
the Fauquier County Sheriff's Department. It was not immediately known whether 
the third fatality was also a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
Fauquier Sheriff's Deputy R. R. Crawford said 150 or more people on the train 
were injured. They were transported to nearby Prince William Hospital in Prince 
William County and Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Ryan of Prince William Hospital said the hospital had treated about 
26 people, "most minor." Steve Givens, a Prince William spokesman, said three 
were in serious condition and the hospital expected a total of 34 injured.

SENATE USES PLOY TO BOOST FUNDING FOR 'STAR WARS'; DEFENSE BILL VOTED 
</P>

<P>
The Senate, just two days after voting to freeze funding for "Star Wars," voted 
Thursday to add $600 million to the controversial missile defense program for 
the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, by a vote of 96 to 2, the Senate adopted the full $288-billion 
military spending bill. A House-Senate conference committee will meet next week 
to thrash out a final version of the appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier vote had been widely interpreted as a setback for "Star Wars," and, 
on the surface, the vote appeared to be a reversal of that defeat. But sponsors 
of the increase said that the new vote represents no change in the Senate's 
basic reservations about the program. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), a leading advocate of 
Thursday's move, described it as -- in effect -- a parliamentary ploy in the 
complex negotiations now going on between the House and the Senate over "Star 
Wars" funding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Silent 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which opposed the Senate's freeze, had no comment on 
Thursday's action. "We're still a long way from a completed budget cycle," said 
Maj. Alan Freitag, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that the 53-47 vote did not reflect a change of the Senate's 
position. He said the additional $600 million would only help the Senate to 
achieve the goal of its earlier vote -- a freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in America -- only in the Senate . . . can we reach this kind of 
dilemma," Nunn said, referring to the anomaly of voting an increase to achieve 
a freeze. 
</P>
<P>
The current chapter in the saga of "Star Wars" funding began last Tuesday, when 
the Senate voted 66 to 34 to freeze funding for the program at slightly less 
than $4 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was it the first time that the Senate had ever rejected an increase in 
"Star Wars" funding, but the freeze represented about $600 million less than 
the Senate had approved earlier this year in setting a maximum ceiling on such 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
The House, which is more hostile to "Star Wars" than the Senate, had voted to 
spend only $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Senate vote occurred as members of the House and Senate Armed 
Services committees were engaged in hard bargaining to determine what the final 
spending level would be in fiscal 1990. House members interpreted the Senate's 
freeze vote as a sign of weakness on the part of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nunn said, House members are now demanding that the two chambers 
agree to something less than a freeze for "Star Wars" -- or about $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, in a Senate floor speech requesting the $600-million increase, warned his 
colleagues that he would be forced to cave in to the House demands for a cut 
unless the Senate bolstered his bargaining position by adding the extra money. 
His argument persuaded even some long-time "Star Wars" critics such as Sen. 
Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) to vote for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
But Nunn pledged that the goal of the second Senate vote was to hold next 
year's "Star Wars" spending at this year's level, not increase it. He said 
support for "Star Wars" is "eroding" in the Senate, which has always favored 
the program, even though the two votes may be sending a mixed signal about the 
true sentiment in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Goals Defined 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that Congress cannot continue to spend billions of dollars for the 
program unless President Bush more clearly defines the goals of what is known 
officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to have to take a hard look at what they really want," said 
Nunn, " . . . and clearly their time is running out." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Senate voted to bolster Nunn's bargaining position, it was 
uncertain whether the ploy would persuade House negotiators to accept a freeze 
-- particularly when the Senate vote was avowedly done only to affect the 
House-Senate conference. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) argued against the vote on precisely 
those grounds. "We should not be trying to create a phony bargaining chip that 
House members can see through as clearly as they can a cloudless day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and 
Nunn's counterpart in the negotiations, was unavailable for comment, but a 
spokesman said that House members are still adamant about cutting back on the 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in past years, when former President Ronald Reagan threatened to veto 
the Pentagon spending bill if Congress cut "Star Wars" funding, Bush 
Administration officials have been silent on the subject in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney acknowledged on Wednesday that "Star Wars" is 
competing for funds with other priority programs in Congress, such as anti-drug 
measures and aid to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted also to require that $820 million of the money authorized for 
"Star Wars" in fiscal 1990 be used for research on lasers and particle beams. 
Supporters of the proposal said they were afraid that the Administration would 
sacrifice long-term research on such "directed energy weapons" in favor of 
shorter-term research. 
</P>
<P>
The defense spending bill includes the following provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elimination of all $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident 2 missile 
but an increase of $70 million to Bush's request of $216 million for research 
and development of the submarine-launched weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Endorsement of Bush's request of $1.1 billion for the multiple-warhead, 
rail-garrison MX missile and $100 million for the single-warhead, Midgetman 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Endorsement of a plan to shut down 86 domestic military bases and scale 
down five more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Funding of $255 million for research and development on the Marine Corps' 
V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane the Bush Administration sought to 
cancel.

GORBACHEV OVERSEES DUMPING OF UKRAINE CHIEF; 
</P>
<P>
MAKES A SURPRISE TRIP TO KIEV FOR REPLACEMENT OF UNPOPULAR CONSERVATIVE

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, demonstrating his personal commitment to 
reviving public faith in the Communist Party, made a surprise trip Thursday to 
Kiev to oversee the dismissal of the Ukrainian party chief, an unpopular 
conservative who had controlled the second-largest Soviet republic for 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, 71, a holdover from the now-discredited era of party 
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, was dropped from the ruling Politburo at a meeting 
in Moscow last week in a move taken as a clear signal that his years in power 
were nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev Protege 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky was replaced as party chief in the Ukraine by his deputy, Vladimir 
A. Ivashko, 57, a Gorbachev protege who was elected by secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian party Central Committee accepted Shcherbitsky's resignation and 
"expressed gratitude for his many years of fruitful activity," the news agency 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's decision to oversee the dismissal was widely viewed as a sign of 
his determination to make sure that party officials at top levels have the 
support of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have shown that public confidence in party officials has fallen 
dramatically, partly as a result of statements by Gorbachev that have focused 
attention on apathy or even corruption in party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
While seeking to shake conservatives out of the party, Western analysts say, 
Gorbachev is at the same time mindful of events in Poland, where the Communist 
Party was unable to shore up the economy or win the support of workers and, as 
a result, has been forced to give way to the Solidarity trade union movement. 
</P>
<P>
After the party meeting, Gorbachev strolled down a Kiev street and told a crowd 
he is pleased that the public is demanding improvements from party officials. 
</P>
<P>
"People are pressuring us; that is good," he said in an encounter shown onn 
Moscow on the evening television news. 
</P>
<P>
He said bold action is now needed from the party and added: "It is not the 
moment to play with democracy. The people will not tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev returned to Moscow on Thursday night. He made a similar housecleaning 
visit to Leningrad in July and presided over the removal of party chief Yuri F. 
Solovyev, a conservative who failed to win a seat in the Congress of People's 
Deputies last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky, as Ukraine party leader, had acquired a reputation in the 1970s 
for his tough treatment of dissidents. He had become increasingly unpopular -- 
and a growing liability to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
He was widely criticized for dragging his feet on economic reform in the 
"breadbasket republic" and for maintaining tight control over the news media -- 
in opposition to Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ukraine has become the site of nationalist and religious 
unrest that Shcherbitsky has seemed unable to deal with. At the founding 
convention of a Ukrainian independent popular movement this month, speaker 
after speaker called for his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky entered the Politburo in 1971 and became Ukrainian party chief a 
year later. In 1987, he was forced to apologize for his failings after a series 
of accidents a year earlier, including the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Ukrainian party leadership was criticized in the Soviet news 
media for failing to calm miners who had gone on strike. And a number of the 
republic's party leaders had been defeated in the spring elections, a sign of 
low public confidence. Shcherbitsky won a seat in the new Parliament -- but he 
ran unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
The low-key method of dismissing Shcherbitsky was in keeping with Gorbachev's 
style, a change from earlier Soviet leaders. Josef Stalin had a number of 
former leaders executed; in Brezhnev's time they were often publicly 
humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky's successor, Ivashko, defeated a Ukrainian party secretary, 
Stanislav I. Gurenko, for the top party post, Tass said. It said the vote came 
after "a thorough discussion of the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Article in Pravda 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko is viewed as a Gorbachev supporter. Last summer he was assigned to 
write a front-page article in the party newspaper Pravda supporting Gorbachev's 
reforms and calling for action against inept bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky's removal had long been expected, but Western observers said he 
managed to hang on to his job for so long because he had a strong power base in 
the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian activists have speculated that Gorbachev intended to press for 
Shcherbitsky's removal during a trip to Kiev in February but postponed the 
decision after meeting resistance in the republic's party organization.

DRAMA AND PATHOS MARK A GREECE ADRIFT

Drama in a historic vote of censure in the small hours of the morning. Pathos 
at a funeral in the afternoon rain. Such were the political signposts Thursday 
in a country on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Greece, the divided and unstable kin of a united and powerful Europe, is 
adrift, searching for a new course. 
</P>
<P>
An improbable government of conservatives and Communists, formed after 
no-winner June elections, announced Thursday that, as planned, it will resign 
next week to clear the way for new elections Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
These elections could restore political direction to Greece, but there is no 
assurance that they will. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unchecked Terrorism 
</P>
<P>
A caretaker government of political personages will handle day-to-day affairs 
until November in a country where, for more than a year, the government has 
failed to effectively address economic trouble, unchecked terrorism and 
Greece's relations with the United States and its partners in the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives and Communists say their short-term pact to seek "catharsis" for 
sins of the political past bore fruit early Thursday when Parliament made 
Andreas Papandreou, Greece's Socialist leader, the first prime minister in 
Greek history forced to defend himself against charges of criminal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The small Athens stock market surged to record highs Thursday in the aftermath 
of the parliamentary action. If there was a new sense of confidence, a 
counterpoint to the need for national leadership, it was implicitly underlined 
at the sodden funeral Thursday afternoon of a conservative politician slain 
Tuesday by Marxist terrorists who, over the past 14 years here, have slain 
Greek and American alike with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
Large, respectful crowds applauded the police-flanked black hearse bearing the 
body of Pavlos Bakoyannis as it glided through the wet streets of downtown 
Athens. Bakoyannis was a son-in-law of conservative New Democracy leader and 
would-be prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis. 
</P>
<P>
New Democracy outpolled Papandreou's Socialists in June by 44% to 39% but fell 
six seats short of a majority in Parliament. This forced an alliance with the 
also-ran Communists. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, Papandreou, who was married and approaching 70, fell 
publicly -- some said scandalously -- in love with a former flight attendant 
half his age. Papandreou's attention wandered from the affairs of a government 
whose massive corruption he is now formally accused of abetting. Then he fell 
sick and traveled to London for heart surgery and a prolonged convalescence. 
</P>
<P>
In the policy vacuum that has continued since the June election, Greece has 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Deficit 
</P>
<P>
Inflation of nearly 16% a year is almost four times the European Community 
average. This, plus a massive public deficit and a painful foreign debt that 
are Papandreou legacies, will probably demand economic austerity in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
There are conservative expectations that the criminal charges of 
influence-peddling and bribe-taking against Papandreou will prove to be mortal 
political wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Papandreou has support among Greeks who agree with him that the 
conservatives and Communists were less interested in justice than in destroying 
him and his Socialist movement. 
</P>
<P>
Many voters, as they demonstrated in June, are undismayed by the spectacle of 
public scandal. At the grass-roots level, many are more interested in the 
roads, schools and hospitals that came during Papandreou's rule. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the punishment his opponents have meted out to him, Greek 
analysts see no chance that Papandreou could win the next election. But it is 
possible, they say, that the conservatives could lose it by failing to win an 
outright majority, thereby prolonging the Greek drift.

BAKER SEES 'POTENTIAL' MIDEAST PROGRESS

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, emerging from an extraordinary 90-minute 
meeting with the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt, said Thursday he sees 
"some potential for progress" in the deadlocked Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmet Abdel Meguid both tried to convince 
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens that Egypt's 10-point peace initiative -- 
which has the apparent backing of the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
gained the public endorsement of France earlier in the day -- is consistent 
with Israel's own proposal for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip and may be the only way to revive the Israeli plan. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the meeting, attended by the three men without any aides present, 
concentrated on "how we could take practical pragmatic steps to make that 
(Israeli election plan) work." 
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he believes the 10 points put forward by Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak are the only steps currently under discussion that 
could move the Israeli plan forward. 
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak initiative is a subject of a growing controversy in Israel. The 
rightist Likud Party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Arens, rejects the 
Egyptian proposals, but the centrist Labor Party of Finance Minister Shimon 
Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin accepts it. The Israeli Cabinet will 
debate the issue Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker refused to speculate on the outcome of the Cabinet meeting. But he 
emphasized that he saw no reason why Shamir, Arens and others should be 
suspicious of the Egyptian plan. 
</P>
<P>
"What is clear from our discussions today is that the United States does not 
see it (the Egyptian suggestions) as a competing proposal and Egypt does not 
see it as a competing proposal," Baker said. Meguid said in a separate 
telephone interview that the Egyptian plan "is not an alternative but a 
clarification" of the Israeli proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a debate in Israel about whether to pursue the (peace) process at 
all," Baker said. He did not spell out the implications of his remark, but it 
seemed to be intended to put additional pressure on the Likud to drop its 
opposition to Mubarak's plan. 
</P>
<P>
President Francois Mitterrand of France gave his endorsement to Mubarak's 
initiative Thursday. The Egyptian president stopped off in France on his way to 
the United States. He is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly today 
and will also meet with Arens. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand said Mubarak's proposals are "solid and useful" because they "avoid 
setting incompatible preconditions," Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours before he met Baker and Meguid, Arens huddled for an hour and 15 
minutes with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, urging Moscow to 
support Israel's West Bank and Gaza elections plan. Shevardnadze said the 
Soviet Union might do just that -- but only if Israel opened the process to the 
PLO, something no mainstream faction in Israel is willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not exclude as an interim measure this idea of elections," Shevardnadze 
said. "There was one very important point which I mentioned to the foreign 
minister. If the PLO is ignored in the process of settlement, then the 
settlement will never take place. The PLO is a real force." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet foreign minister said he offered to arrange a meeting between 
Israeli officials and representatives of the PLO in the Soviet Union. Israel is 
not likely to accept the Soviet initiative. If Israel wanted to talk to the PLO 
-- which up to now it has not -- it would have no difficulty finding a meeting 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also urged Israel to accept at least parts of the Egyptian 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We noted that there are reasonable elements in the proposal put forward by 
Prime Minister Shamir, and there are many interesting elements in the proposals 
put forward by President Mubarak," Shevardnadze said. "I do believe we have to 
look for reasonable elements in both plans."

CHINA DISDAINS VIETNAM'S WITHDRAWAL IN CAMBODIA

China declared Thursday that it considers Vietnam's troop withdrawal from 
Cambodia a sham and that it will continue to send arms to the Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas fighting the Vietnamese-installed government of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry also leveled new charges in the 
dispute with Vietnam over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. These 
charges appeared to be intended, at least in part, to increase the pressure on 
Vietnam over Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The two statements were not formally linked, but were announced at the start of 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'At Least 30,000' Remain 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to overthrow the murderous Khmer 
Rouge regime and install a client government, says that in the past few days, 
it has withdrawn the last of its troops from Cambodia. But the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, Li Zhaoxing, charged that "facts clearly show that Vietnam 
has not genuinely withdrawn all its forces." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "at least 30,000 Vietnamese military personnel have changed their 
uniforms" and have been integrated with Cambodian forces and that Vietnam "has 
left behind large amounts of weapons and military equipment." 
</P>
<P>
"Hidden among the over 1 million illegal Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia are 
many Vietnamese militiamen and special agents," he said. "Clearly, there has 
been no change in Vietnam's basic scheme for keeping Cambodia under its control 
and creating an Indochina federation." 
</P>
<P>
As Vietnam has withdrawn all or most of its troops from Cambodia -- at one 
point they numbered more than 140,000, according to Western estimates -- 
international concern has shifted to the question of whether the Khmer Rouge 
will retake power and engage in another wave of killings. The Khmer Rouge 
regime is believed to have caused the deaths of about 1 million people when it 
controlled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge is now the strongest element of a resistance coalition headed 
by the exiled Prince Norodom Sihanouk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions for Ending Aid 
</P>
<P>
Li, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China will discontinue its aid to the 
resistance only after Vietnam genuinely withdraws all its troops and the 
various Cambodian factions reach a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the dispute over the islands, Li charged that in the past four 
months Vietnam has sent troops to the Pengbobao Reef, the Wanan Shoal and the 
Guangya Shoal in the Nansha Islands, which are referred to in the West as the 
Spratly Islands. In Vietnam, the term is Truong Sa archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government strongly condemns the Vietnamese authorities for their 
illegal act of invasion and occupation of some of the reefs and shoals in 
China's Nansha Islands," Li said, "and firmly demands that the Vietnamese side 
withdraw from all the islands, reefs and shoals which it has illegally invaded 
and occupied." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Naval Battle 
</P>
<P>
Tension over the island chain erupted into armed conflict in March, 1988. China 
and Vietnam accused each other of initiating the fighting, which involved ships 
of both sides firing on each other near what China calls the Chigua Reef. 
Vietnam said that three of its ships were sunk, that four sailors were killed 
and 74 others were missing. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats in Beijing have said recently that they were expecting China 
to escalate the dispute in order to increase its leverage over Vietnam on the 
Cambodia issue. 
</P>
<P>
China is also seen as wishing to control the islands because of what are 
believed to be significant underwater deposits of oil and gas in the area.

BAHAMAS PRIME MINISTER SAYS U.S. FAILS TO BACK UP DRUG-WAR PLEDGE 
</P>

<P>
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling charged Thursday that the United 
States, while complaining about poor anti-drug cooperation from Caribbean 
nations, for five years has failed to back up promises to provide a 
high-technology radar balloon for detecting cocaine shipments through the 
archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
The forceful criticism of U.S. drug interdiction efforts came as Pindling, 
whose government has been implicated in cocaine-trafficking activities, mounts 
a new campaign to position himself in the forefront of mounting international 
anti-narcotics efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In a breakfast session with reporters and editors of The Times' Washington 
Bureau, Pindling urged the United States to expand its war on drugs by ordering 
the immediate recall of all large-denomination currency to hamper drug lords 
who must deal in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"This would convert rich traffickers and their helpers into paupers overnight," 
the Bahamian leader says. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling also endorsed a proposed multilateral anti-drug task force that would 
dispatch troops around the world to help nations eradicate illegal drug crops. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about what the State Department has called the disparity between such 
"public pronouncements" and the extent of corruption in his government, 
Pindling freely conceded that the indictments of several of his associates on 
drug charges have taken a toll on him. 
</P>
<P>
The Pindling associates indicted in the United States earlier this year were 
Kendal W. Nottage, a member of the Bahamian Parliament, and Everette Bannister, 
a longtime business associate of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Nottage was charged in Boston in a federal tax conspiracy indictment alleging 
that he and others conspired to conceal the illegal drug profits of organized 
crime figure Salvatore M. Caruana from the Internal Revenue Service. Bannister 
was charged in Florida in an indictment alleging that he conspired with the 
Colombian Medellin drug cartel to move drugs through the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
In the his interview Thursday, the prime minister insisted that the Bahamas 
"never has been" a haven for drug traffickers. He accused the United States of 
adopting a double standard in singling out the Bahamas for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that all of our fellows are angels," he said, "but don't you 
try and make out to me that all of yours are angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't apply a yardstick abroad in the Bahamas that you aren't prepared to 
apply at home," the prime minister warned.

FILIPINO COMMUNITY IN L.A. REMAINS DEEPLY SPLIT OVER MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In exile, Ferdinand E. Marcos split Los Angeles' Filipino community, leaving it 
bitterly divided over his efforts to return to his native country. In the hours 
after his death, there were sorrowful reactions from fellow expatriates -- and 
a clear sign that the Marcos controversy has not ended. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial reaction is sadness," Rolando B. Fernandez, president of the 
Filipino American Community of Los Angeles, known as FACLA, said Thursday. "He 
was a good man. He was brilliant, and I respect him." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Mel Red Recana, another prominent member of the local 
Filipino community, also had kind words for the former president. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a Filipino, after all. He did things we did not like, but he did good 
things as well," Recana said. "This is now a healing period for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Among the county's estimated 155,000 Filipinos, the years have seen a closing 
of the rift between pro- and anti-Marcos factions that had deepened in the wake 
of his ouster from the Philippine presidency and allegations that he had looted 
the country's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, whose organization claims the largest membership among the county's 
Filipinos, said he hopes that Marcos' death will work to unify his fellow 
expatriates and not reopen old political wounds. But many of the Filipinos who 
showed up at an afternoon dance at FACLA's Los Angeles headquarters not only 
mourned the death of the man some still revere as their president but also 
contended that he suffered needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
"As Filipinos, we pray that his sins will be forgiven," said Nemesio T. Bonoan, 
president of the Philippine Retirees Assn. of California. "Let us forgive and 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the crowd -- some of whom were dressed in their traditional barong 
tagalogs and butterfly-sleeved gowns popularized by Imelda Marcos -- called the 
news of Marcos' death tragic and defended a man who has been accused of 
plundering his own country of billions of dollars and who was forced to give up 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great president, and he should be allowed to go home," said Aledria 
Albano, who was busily circulating a petition among the dancers and card 
players asking President Corazon Aquino to allow the Marcos family to bury his 
remains in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of where the former president will be buried has galvanized Marcos 
supporters and others who feel that his body should now be returned to his 
native country. And a small group of protesters met Thursday with officials of 
the Philippine Consulate to press their view that Marcos should return "for the 
sake of national unity." 
</P>
<P>
Alex A. Esclamado, publisher and editor in chief of the California-based 
Philippine News, supported the Aquino government's decision not to allow burial 
in the Philippines and said Marcos loyalists should accept his death. He added: 
"I feel the death of Marcos will finally close the darkest period of Philippine 
history."

VISITORS OFFER CONDOLENCES, GIFTS TO FAMILY AT HOME IN HONOLULU

Visitors streamed through the large green gates of the Marcos family compound 
all day and into the night Thursday, offering condolences and bearing food and 
other gifts, while the family of former Philippine President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos mourned his death. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the palatial compound overlooking Honolulu, the body of Marcos lay in 
the living room, where his widow, Imelda, greeted mourners. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to the family said Imelda Marcos had been up all night and was "bearing 
it very well." 
</P>
<P>
"She's talking and receiving visitors," family spokesman Leonie Tan said. He 
expressed irritation that condolences from the White House over Marcos' death 
had been passed through the media instead of directed personally to the 
Philippines' former first lady. 
</P>
<P>
Tan also said Imelda Marcos hopes the White House will pressure the Philippine 
government of President Corazon Aquino to allow Marcos to be buried in his 
homeland. Aquino has refused on national security grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Family members were reported resting Thursday after the bedside vigil that 
ended with Marcos' death at 3:40 a.m. PDT Thursday at St. Francis Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
After the death was announced, women from Honolulu's Filipino community took 
cakes and other gifts to the family, while delivery trucks dropped off bouquets 
of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
No estimate was available on the number of visitors. But the line of cars to 
the compound choked the narrow, winding street on a hill in the exclusive 
neighborhood of Makiki Heights. 
</P>
<P>
While Marcos lived, many powerful Philippine figures came to visit, although 
the former president was confined to the medical center for the last nine 
months. Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel came last February on what he 
termed a "humanitarian mission," and former Cabinet members held a sorrowful 
reunion with Marcos in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcoses arrived in Hawaii on Feb. 26, 1986, after fleeing the Philippines. 
They often entertained, although not in the lavish style to which they had been 
accustomed in Manila, and continued to maintain a loyal retinue of followers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Marcos celebrated his 70th birthday with about 6,000 supporters at a 
public arena in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tan said Marcos' body would stay at the residence for three days. 
The family tentatively plans a funeral Mass on Sunday, he said, adding, "After 
that, we do not know."

IMELDA MARCOS REMINISCES ABOUT HER FAIRY-TALE LIFE

As a pastel sunset spread across the Pacific and mourners wailed in the 
background, Imelda Marcos stepped away from the casket of her husband, former 
Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, and reminisced Thursday night about 
the fairy-tale life he gave her. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a beautiful man and he has enriched the future. The fairy tale will 
always be there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All through the day and night, Imelda Marcos stood by the flag-draped coffin 
greeting throngs of well-wishers. She was dressed entirely in black, including 
a strand of black pearls and black pearl pin, ring and earrings. 
</P>
<P>
A Philippine flag draped the foot of the coffin, and the presidential seal was 
mounted on the wall behind it. Viewers strolled by the black casket on a red 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
When she finally stepped outside to the lawn overlooking Diamond Head and the 
city of Honolulu, Mrs. Marcos said she was depressed not only by her husband's 
death but by the Philippine government's refusal to permit his burial in his 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you find this man a threat to the national security when he is lying 
in peace?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that in death, her husband is being denied his homeland, and she 
called this "cruel, inhuman and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"If a president of more than 20 years is being denied his country it can happen 
to any Filipino," she asserted. 
</P>
<P>
A tent and picnic tables were set up in the Marcos family compound, and 
visitors streamed through the compound's large green gates all day and into the 
night Thursday, offering condolences and bearing food and other gifts, while 
the Marcos family mourned his death. 
</P>

PANEL ENDORSES TRAPS FOR CARS TO HOLD VAPORS

A House panel overrode opposition from auto makers Thursday and voted to 
require that cars built in the future be fitted with special canisters to trap 
smog-causing vapors released during refueling. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was hailed by environmentalists as a significant victory in the 
legislative battle, currently being fought in the House Energy and Commerce 
health and environment subcommittee, to strengthen President Bush's proposed 
clean air bill. 
</P>
<P>
However, a much more momentous battle was taking place behind the scenes, in 
closed-door negotiations where the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), was fighting both the Administration and the auto industry in 
an effort to impose stricter controls on the single biggest source of urban 
smog -- emissions from motor vehicle tailpipes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overriding Issue' 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to what's going on behind the scenes, the fight on the committee 
floor so far is just minor skirmishing," one legislative source said. 
"Tailpipes is the one overriding issue, and both sides are digging their heels 
in on it." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, defeated in an attempt Tuesday to get stricter emissions standards 
incorporated into the Bush bill, has been negotiating with several other 
committee members over a compromise. The compromise would extend the standards 
planned for California by 1995 to the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
However, legislative sources said that the talks remain deadlocked over 
Waxman's insistence on a second round of emission cuts to further reduce the 
national standards by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman originally called for a reduction of hydrocarbon emissions -- a major 
component of smog -- by 39% in 1993. Nitrogen oxides, another tailpipe 
component of smog, would be cut 60%. In the year 2,000, both pollutants would 
be cut a further 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The co-sponsors of the Bush bill, Reps. John D. Dingell (D-Mich) and Norman F. 
Lent (R-N.Y.), have fiercely criticized Waxman's reductions as technologically 
unfeasible and prohibitively expensive, even if the technology to achieve them 
is developed. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise offered by Waxman is believed to relax the second round 
reductions somewhat, but Lent told reporters that the two sides are still far 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
The canisters amendment, passed on a voice vote, would require auto makers to 
put vapor-collecting devices on the gasoline tanks of all cars and light trucks 
within four years of the clean air bill's passage. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said that the canisters, designed to trap vapors released into the air 
when a car is being refueled, would lower the overall level of hydrocarbon 
emissions by more than 3% at a cost of about $14 per vehicle.

A DEFINITION POSES DIFFICULT QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is creativity? 
</P>
<P>
Volumes have been written on the subject, but a precise and satisfactory 
definition seems to have eluded experts and novices alike. 
</P>
<P>
Is someone who is very bright -- a genius -- necessarily creative? Is a 
creative person necessarily a genius? Is an individual creative just because he 
or she does something original? What if no one appreciates the work or even 
notices it? Is the person still creative, or merely crazy, possessed by an idee 
fixe? 
</P>
<P>
And what of the creative act itself? Does creativity mean discovering, 
inventing, producing something new? Can it be a simple matter of solving a 
problem, a process of finding a new solution to an old dilemma? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Easy Answers 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers to these questions, but most scholars now accept a 
working definition of creativity. It must be original and it must be either 
useful or in some way valued by society. Nonetheless, a debate over the nuances 
and subtleties of creativity continues. 
</P>
<P>
Recently that debate took a sharp and unexpected twist. This latest furor over 
creativity was caused by a computer in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the American Psychological Assn. in 1985, Herbert Simon, the 
Nobel prize-winning psychologist and economist at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh, announced that he and his colleagues had programmed a computer to 
"rediscover" scientific breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Fed all the relevant data that the scientists had at their disposal, the 
computer can in a matter of seconds inductively re-create the original 
discovery, Simon said. Give a computer what Johannes Kepler knew in the 17th 
Century about astronomy and you will get the laws of planetary motion. Give a 
computer all that Charles Darwin knew in the 19th Century about animals and you 
presumably will get the theory of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Simon said, creativity is nothing more than simple problem 
solving. And if that is true, then a computer can be creative. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this conclusion has caused considerable consternation among 
social scientists who have been studying creativity and who think it involves 
such complex issues as human emotion and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
One scholar has likened the computer's efforts to forgers who can make flawless 
copies of great masterpieces but cannot create original works of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Another scholar evoked the words of Albert Einstein. "The formulation of a 
problem," Einstein wrote, "is often more essential than its solution, which may 
be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skills. To raise new 
questions, new problems, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires 
creative imagination and makes real advances. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, has been 
studying creativity for more than two decades and is one researcher who has yet 
to be persuaded of the creative potential of the modern-day computer. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else the cognitive scientists and computer specialists have done, 
Csikszentmihalyi wrote in an article last year in the journal New Ideas in 
Psychology, "They are helping to sharpen some of the conceptual issues in a 
field that has long languished for lack of stimulating controversy." ANNE C.

The state attorney general's crime prevention coordinator was stabbed in the

Chuck Moltz, 42, was stabbed with a hunting knife Wednesday as he leaned into 
his car to get a radio out, Sheriff Paul McGrath said.

The car was parked across the street from the attorney general's office when 
the unknown assailant stabbed Moltz, the sheriff said.

LAWSUIT CHALLENGES KEY PROPOSITION 13 PROVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a potentially far-reaching challenge to Proposition 13, a Los Angeles public 
interest law firm filed suit Thursday seeking to strike down a key provision of 
the landmark law providing for disparate taxation of comparable properties. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the Center for Law in the 
Public Interest, is similar to one dismissed in July by a San Diego County 
judge. That, too, relied on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in January, which 
tossed out a West Virginia law that assessed new property owners at a higher 
level than longtime owners on grounds that it violated equal protection. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Carlyle W. Hall Jr. said the suit is a formidable challenge to the 
1978 voter-approved initiative because it includes a survey documenting as much 
as a 15-1 disparity in taxes paid by owners of similar properties. Hall said he 
is prepared to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, Hall said, "the 1% cap would stay in effect, but what would be 
removed is the restriction on the Legislature from setting up a system that 
allows for more equal treatment of taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 set property taxes at 1% of assessed valuation and froze tax 
assessments for existing homeowners at 1975 levels. Unless a property is sold, 
these assessments may rise no more than 2% a year for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
When a property changes hands, however, the new buyer pays taxes based on the 
purchase price. Since home prices have soared in most areas of California, new 
owners pay as much as 10 times more in property taxes than neighbors who have 
owned their homes since the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 13 in 
1978. The issue was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In last January's 
ruling, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wrote the unanimous opinion, 
specifically noted that "we need not and do not decide" whether the case 
covered Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's suit was brought on behalf of a young attorney, Stephanie 
Nordlinger, who recently purchased a house in Baldwin Hills. Her tax bill was 
$1,701, five times higher than that of a neighbor, Hall said.

HAWTHORNE POSTPONES VOTE ON HANGAR FEES TO REVIEW ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council has delayed a vote to repeal increases in hangar 
fees at its municipal airport while it studies what improvements are needed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials want a number of improvements made. But Monday, council 
members heard from local pilots, some of whom said the improvements were not 
necessary. Pilot Bruce Traub, for example, said the extensive improvements 
sought by airport officials constitute a way for the city to justify its 
increase in monthly hangar rent. 
</P>
<P>
Hangar fees at the airport, which had been raised in July to $210 a month, last 
month were raised again, to $280. 
</P>
<P>
The council asked city officials to provide exact comparisons in hangar rents 
at surrounding airports. Council members complained that they have received 
different figures from the city and from the pilots and that some of the 
figures were estimates and not exact fee schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted for the increases in August, and in September airport 
officials sent a letter to City Manager Kenneth Jue listing needed hangar 
improvements, including roof repairs, upgrading of drainage, and additional 
electrical wiring and restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The 160-member Hawthorne Aircraft and Pilots Assn. has criticized the increase, 
maintaining that it violates an agreement the city made with the pilots in 1985 
to raise fees gradually from $125 a month to $200 over a four-year period and 
then tie future increases to the consumer price index. The four-year period 
ended in July, and the index increased the fee to $210. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in hangar rent was included in a package of other increases in 
municipal fees designed to reduce the city's $2.5-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The new municipal fees would raise $800,000 annually, with $50,000 coming from 
the new hangar rental fees, according to city officials.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DESIGN REVIEW LAW REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hermosa Beach City Council defeated by a 4-1 vote Tuesday a proposed 
ordinance that would have increased the city's design control and environmental 
review of large-scale commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
The vote overturned the recommendations of the Planning Commission and of 
Planning Director Michael Schubach, who had recommended adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, the council and Planning Commission would have 
been given discretionary review power to assess projects such as hotels, office 
buildings and retail developments for their impact on noise, traffic, parking 
and the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, such projects are subject only to administrative review, meaning 
that no additional environmental assessment is necessary if the project meets 
the city's building and zoning standards, Schubach said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor June Williams voted in favor of the proposed ordinance, arguing that the 
city needs increased discretionary review power to reduce the impact of large 
projects throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
But other council members criticized the ordinance, saying it was too 
restrictive and would place city officials in the position of evaluating the 
aesthetics of projects, rather than assessing their conformity to zoning and 
building standards.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSING SUBSIDY CERTIFICATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance has accepted 21 new federal low-income housing certificates to help 10 
elderly renters and 11 families pay their rent. 
</P>
<P>
The certificates require holders to pay 30% of their income toward rent, with 
the federal government subsidizing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, which now controls 569 of the certificates, has a two- to four-year 
waiting list for the rent subsidy program, said senior planning associate Susan 
Bornemann. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time we've been able to significantly affect our 
waiting list in a long time," Bornemann said, noting that it has been at least 
four years since the city was granted new certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rent subsidy program, low-income tenants must find apartments that 
cost no more than $491 for an efficiency, $588 for a one-bedroom, $684 for a 
two-bedroom or $876 for a three-bedroom, depending on the number of people in 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
The new certificates are expected to provide about $147,000 in federal 
subsidies each year.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUTTING BITE ON NUISANCE PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council is prepared to add more teeth to its animal 
control code by increasing penalties for the owners of noisy and destructive 
animals, particularly dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Although dogs are permitted to roam without a leash in the largely rural 
community, tolerance for nuisance animals is decreasing. As a result, the 
council Monday introduced a measure, scheduled for adoption by the council Oct. 
9, under which the owners of nuisance animals could be prosecuted for 
misdemeanor violations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, a second complaint against a dog that consistently barks or 
repeatedly destroys private property results in a hearing before the city 
manager. The manager then determines remedial action, which could include 
prosecution. The manager's decision may be appealed to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was introduced after several residents complained that barking 
dogs were disturbing them.

PIGGING OUT ON SCRAPPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "Scrapple -- The Way To a Philadelphian's Heart," Sept. 24, by Charles 
Hillinger. 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, Mr. Hillinger, but "scrapple" is much more prominent than you think 
and goes farther than just Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
I'm from Ottawa (pop. 5,000) in northwest Ohio, and all through my childhood I 
ate scrapple with apple butter on it for breakfast before school. However, we 
didn't call it scrapple. It actually has various names -- "liver pudding," "pan 
pudding" and, in a German influence, "pan hausen." 
</P>
<P>
However, you are right, Mr. Hillinger: You can't get the delicacy out in Los 
Angeles unless you know someone that can ship it. By the way, do you know 
someone - my apple butter awaits in the refrigerator!

Re: "America Killed Andre," Sept. 24, by Nikki Finke. 
</P>
<P>
"America" killed Andre Coffyn?! What nonsense! Must we be subjected to such 
nattering of yet another tiresome European emigre who came here, made a 
fortune, achieved a degree of trendy notoriety and -- what else? -- bad-mouths 
America? Quelle chutzpah! 
</P>
<P>
As an immigrant myself, I deplore Michel Richard's crass ingratitude. Given his 
own depiction of the privations of his childhood in France, Richard of all 
people should understand that for all its problems, this country remains a 
shining beacon for the rest of the world. Individuals from all over the globe 
literally risk their very lives just for the chance to come here and become one 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
But the way he talks, to him America is evidently just a place to make lots of 
money. His pockets bulging with American dollars, he pines -- oh, how he pines! 
-- for an inn far away from bad America, in the countryside of France whose 
citizenship he has so carefully retained. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there won't be so many ugly American dollars there, and local chefs 
may offer stiffer competition for the francs of the local gourmets who might 
prove just a tad more demanding than the trendy Westsiders. Ah, but think of 
how "good" France is compared to America, and what wonderful opportunities 
await the Richard children there -- eh, Michel?

TUNING IN TO THE WIT OF A RADIO COMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Allen: His Life and Wit by Robert Taylor (Little, Brown: $19.95, 340 pp., 
illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Pagliacci effect: the process by which a comedian's life becomes 
anything but comic. Fred Allen, whose particular kind of verbal wit is an 
endangered species driven almost to extinction by television's broader, coarser 
visual effects, was a phenomenon of the Golden Age of radio, a time when being 
funny was done with words. 
</P>
<P>
To excel at that, a comedian didn't need to look peculiar, use foul language or 
live flamboyantly. He could wear banker's gray, actually use "Good Heavens" as 
a tag line, remain happily married, deeply religious and almost excessively 
modest in his personal habits. Television ended all that virtually overnight, 
and Fred Allen stopped being a household word and became an instant 
anachronism. His kind of humor didn't cross over. There wasn't enough to see. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Well-Done 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why television is called a medium is because nothing on it is ever 
well-done," Allen quipped, but his caustic comments didn't help matters. The 
American public was infatuated with the tube, and couldn't have cared less what 
a disillusioned radio comic thought of it. Those were the days, remember, when 
people watched test patterns through the magnifying glass over the 7-inch 
screen, when they traded in the piano for a TV. 
</P>
<P>
A technological casualty, Allen wrote his memoir, called it "Treadmill to 
Oblivion," and outlived his era by a scant six years, dying in his early '60s. 
According to his biographer, " 'Treadmill' broke all records for a book on 
radio," but Allen wasn't comforted. "I'm appearing on TV and radio shows for 
nothing, speaking to motley groups of antique ladies, and going from 
door-to-door with my tome in my hand trying to stimulate the sale." A comedown? 
It was an expulsion from Eden. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a veteran Boston art and book critic, clearly has the warmest regard 
and admiration for his subject, consistently treating Allen with respect and 
affection. Unfortunately, Taylor's rigid and often tortured prose style seems 
completely at odds with Allen's easy colloquial wit. Taylor tends to favor 
strange, recherche forms of ordinary words -- fatidic for significant; 
estivated for spent the summer. He leaves no noun or verb unmodified, as if a 
naked word could be guilty of indecent exposure. Often the syntax becomes so 
entangled that reading the book is like finding one's way out of the Hampton 
Court maze. 
</P>
<P>
Let Allen have the last word. "All the comedian has to show for his years of 
work and aggravation is the echo of forgotten laughter" -- the original source 
of which Taylor lavishly quotes in this belabored but generous tribute.

PRAISE FOR THE DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems to me that Patti Davis should be admired and respected for her 
courage, intelligence, capacity for independent thinking, and ambitions as a 
writer instead of being subjected to arrogantly sarcastic editorializing and 
nit-picking as was evidenced in Bettijane Levine's article ("A Second Crack At 
'Daddy Dearest,' " Sept. 22). 
</P>
<P>
First of all, Davis is the daughter of former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan 
and she knows much better than Levine does whether he or they were good 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan went to Washington as the master of ceremonies for The 
Turn-Back-The-Clock Gang, and, as one of the worst Presidents in the nation's 
history, did his damnedest to please the unpatriotic, tax-hating, 
regulations-hating, racist, money-mad, would-be macho right-wing conservatives, 
taking much of his lead from the Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has properly described "my father's war" in Nicaragua. Praise for her is 
in order. Definitely!

Attention Rolling Stones fans: There is now a line of Rolling Stones clothing 
and accessories, carried by a number of nationwide retailers, including Macy's 
and JC Penney. We hear the unisex and supposedly ageless pieces, priced from $6 
for a bandanna to $450 for a bomber jacket, were designed "under the direction" 
of lead singer Mick Jagger and drummer Charlie Watts. T-shirts, for example, 
have prints originally done "in Mick's own hand." There are also decorated 
Converse high-tops and leather motorcycle jackets with the Rolling Stones' 
"lips and tongue" logo on the back. The Stones didn't throw in any pants, only 
shorts, but there are skateboards. Can't you see it now? The Stones rolling out 
on their skateboards, wearing their logo motorcycle jackets when they appear in 
concert in Los Angeles next month.

Boy, George

<P>
Boy George has a whole new look, but his makeup is what we noticed first the 
other night at the St. James Club, where he turned up at a party for Malcolm 
Forbes' new magazine, Egg. George arrived with heavily penciled eyebrows, a dab 
of glossy lipstick and a pale, sleek complexion that was thanks to his pancake 
makeup. No skirts, dresses or dreadlocks to be seen on the man. His red silk 
jacket came from a British designer whose name George forgets. And he found his 
green high-top sneakers in New York.

Winning By a Nose

Fred and Gale Hayman, who co-created Giorgio perfume, are up to new adventures 
this fall. He just introduced 273, a perfume named for his store's address, at 
Saks in New York, to the strains of his favorite sounds -- mariachi music. 
Meanwhile, she's putting final touches on the all-leopard environment from 
which she'll launch her cosmetics line, Gale Hayman Beverly Hills, at 
Bloomingdale's next month. (It's already available at Nordstrom.) He says Lena 
Horne was among those who took home a bottle of 273, and she says Raquel Welch 
and Gloria Steinem will be at her launch party. So far so impressive. But the 
race to watch begins next spring, when she introduces her first solo scent.

Two for Japan 
</P>
<P>
Designer Rachel London, whose 3-D flower fashions are favored by Jodie Watley, 
tells Listen her Melrose Avenue store is being re-created, inch for inch, in 
Japan. A group of Asian investors liked the eccentric look -- complete with 
double bed amid the sales racks and paper roses taped to the ceiling. She isn't 
free to name the investors. Meanwhile, Carmelo Pomodoro, the New York designer, 
says Takashamaya, the huge Japanese retail company, is building him his own 
boutique in Tokyo. He doesn't have one in the United States. Pomodoro's is 
nothing like London's. It's a glass-walled, concrete-columned space inspired by 
Palladio, the 16th-Century Italian architect. It opens Oct. 8, Pomodoro says.

Tune-Up Run

If you can't run, you can walk on Oct. 7 at the Reebok-sponsored 5K/10K Run and 
Notables Walk to benefit the Los Angeles Philharmonic and youth music education 
in Southern California. Participants will get a chance to rub elbows with 
world-class runner Ed Eyestone and win the respect of Lakers' coach Pat Riley 
and radio talk-show host Michael Jackson, co-chairmen of this latest addition 
to fitness-inspired fund-raisers. Frills include gift certificates, tickets to 
L.A. Philharmonic concerts, a jazz band and a $3 pancake breakfast. Fees are 
$12 for entries postmarked before Sunday, $15 thereafter. Registration forms 
are available at Front Runners stores in Brentwood and the Westside Pavilion.

Monaco Moniker 
</P>
<P>
Seems that during Ringo Starr's All Starr Tour, the erstwhile Beatle and his 
wife, Barbara Bach, occasionally used the alias Monaco. The choice behind this 
moniker is simple -- they live there. So it's no surprise that when tour 
producer David Fishof walked into the Beverly Hills boutique, Club Monaco, he 
decided to splurge on the incognito duo. For the Starrs and other participants 
in the tour, Fishof picked up six baseball jackets and two bathrobes, along 
with other odds and ends. All the items are emblazoned with the word Monaco, so 
Ringo can proudly wear his alias on his sleeve.

Another Elton John 
</P>
<P>
Elton John shopping in Los Angeles doesn't surprise us. But Elton John buying 
shirts and ties at the Polo Ralph Lauren boutique in Beverly Hills, now that's 
a bit of a shock. Maybe he wasn't getting them for himself. "Oh, yes, he was," 
says a company spokesperson, noting that the rock star is a frequent customer. 
Of course, the question is: Where does he wear the things he buys? "I have no 
idea," the same spokesperson confessed. "I go to England often and see pictures 
of him in the papers and see him on talk shows and he's never dressed in Polo." 
Just one more fashion mystery.

ROHRABACHER'S SUPPORTERS REMAIN TRUE AMID ARTS FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Financial supporters of an Orange County congressman who has become a 
controversial opponent of federal support for the arts say they disagree with 
his position but will continue to support him, because they agree with most of 
his other stands. 
</P>
<P>
Several arts patrons who also support Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said 
they had been unaware that he had led an effort in Congress to restrict federal 
funding of artwork. But more than half a dozen of these contributors also said 
his position on the arts would not affect their future support. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think the government should support" the arts, said Peter G. 
Muth of Santa Ana, a Rohrabacher contributor who is a major supporter of the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, Pacific Symphony and Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Arts patronage "should be voluntary," Muth said. "If (Rohrabacher) says 
don'tspend money on the arts, I'm with him. I feel very strongly that that 
should be voluntary." 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "free-enterpriser," Muth said "the government is involved in 
too damned many things already." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach investor Clifford S. Heinz, whose family supports the Center, 
South Coast Repertory, Opera Pacific and both the Newport Harbor and Laguna Art 
museums, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the least amount of government interference with anything," he said. 
"When the federal government supplies something, they take something away at 
the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Heinz said he has no problem with Rohrabacher's support for an amendment 
introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), which the Senate passed, that would 
specifically restrict NEA funding of artworks considered sexually explicit or 
thought to denigrate religion. The amendment to an appropriations bill is being 
debated by a conference committee of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"When a body can't police themselves," Heinz said, "I don't mind the government 
giving them help." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over federal funding has been set off by objections to photography 
exhibitions underwritten in part by grants from the National Endowment for the 
Arts. One in North Carolina, by Andres Serrano, included a photograph of a 
plastic crucifix submerged in the artist's urine. Another exhibition, scheduled 
for Corcoran Gallery in Washington but later canceled, included homoerotic 
photos by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a first-term congressman who was a speech writer for former 
President Ronald Reagan, has said he opposes federal support for the arts and 
has attracted national attention for his support of the Helms amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said this week that his opposition to federal funding in general 
and his support for restricting NEA grants had generated criticism from 
constituents, although not from those identifying themselves as campaign 
contributors and arts supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's district includes parts of Long Beach, where arts activists have 
generally been more outspoken in their criticism of the congressman's 
positions. But Rohrabacher's financial backers there do not agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I support the fine congressman," said James Lockington, who contributes to the 
Long Beach Civic Light Opera and the Public Corporation for the Arts, the local 
arts council. 
</P>
<P>
Lockington echoed Rohrabacher's feeling that other issues on the national 
agenda, such as health care, should come before the arts when it comes to 
federal support. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher has said he would be hard put to spend federal money on the arts 
while people are in need of health care, though he has not said the federal 
government should pay more for health care than it already does. 
</P>
<P>
Lockington said Rohrabacher's support for the Helms amendment does not bother 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a great believer in censorship," he said, "but there is a point when 
it goes beyond bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
Serrano's supporters said the use of the plastic crucifix in his photograph is 
a protest against exploitation of religious values. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano, who was raised a Roman Catholic, has said the image "could mean 
different things to different people. I find it to be a very comforting and 
spiritual image. I find it visually very much in keeping with the traditional 
image of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Munzer, who with her husband contributes to the Long Beach Museum of Art 
and the Public Corporation for the Arts, said she favors federal arts support 
and had not been aware of Rohrabacher's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said his stand would not affect her future support for the 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's campaign contributors from the arts and entertainment industry, 
while more critical of the congressman's position, echoed this sentiment. Jeff 
Segal, vice president of creative affairs for Hanna-Barbera Productions in Los 
Angeles, said his support for Rohrabacher, a longtime friend, is "not in any 
way based upon his position on the arts." 
</P>
<P>
While Segal said he might consider Rohrabacher's position on the arts in 
determining future support, it is the congressman's overall philosophical 
position and personal relationship that are the most critical factors. 
</P>
<P>
Segal is less comfortable with Rohrabacher's support for the Helms amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm opposed in principle to censorship, to a U.S. senator incorporating in law 
a certain perspective," he said. "I'm very sensitive about people trying to 
mandate creative instincts in some fashion." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Harry Evans Sloan, another longtime friend of Rohrabacher who 
is co-chairman of the board of New World Entertainment, said the film executive 
favors federal support of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said no one issue would affect his future support. 
</P>
<P>
Other Rohrabacher contributors from the entertainment industry -- including 
Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, Stanley Kaufman of Troma 
Pictures, Sammy Hagar of Van Halen and actress Stephanie Zimbalist -- could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher is listed as a donor to the Long Beach Symphony, in the 
$250-to-$500 category. He said the donation was in the form of a tour of 
Washington that was auctioned off as a fund-raiser.

MORNING REPORT: PROTESTS

Spanish-language station KVEA-TV Channel 52 in Glendale came under fire again 
Thursday from protesters who allege that the station discriminates against 
Mexican-American employees. The latest Mexican-American figure to leave the 
station was 11 p.m. anchor Alberto Aguilar, whose contract was not renewed last 
week. Frank Cruz, the station's general manager, was replaced in February, 
followed in June by news director Bob Navarro. "There is a pattern of 
dismissals there," said Raul Ruiz, coordinator of the protesters and a 
professor of Chicano studies at California State University Northridge. The 
protesters want the station to hire more Mexican-Americans and to air more 
locally produced programming. It was the fifth protest since June at the 
station, which is owned by the Telemundo network. DANIEL CERONE

THE GROVE EXTENDS SEASON FOR SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grove Shakespeare Festival, which is facing a revenue shortage, will extend 
its current season by two months, through mid-February, to accommodate a change 
of venue for its annual production of "A Child's Christmas in Wales" and the 
cancellation of a planned outdoor Winter Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic Director Thomas F. Bradac said Thursday that the programming changes 
at the county's second-largest professional theater company reflect "prudent 
management" and were decided well before the revenue shortage developed. 
</P>
<P>
He denied, moreover, that staff layoffs are under consideration and labeled as 
"totally erroneous" a report to that effect in the Orange County Register on 
Thursday. That report also claimed that no scheduling changes were being 
contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
The Grove had planned to stage "A Child's Christmas in Wales" at the outdoor, 
550-seat Festival Amphitheatre in Garden Grove from Dec. 1 to 24 as the 
highlight of an experimental Winter Festival. The adaptation of the Dylan 
Thomas story has been staged indoors since 1986 at the adjacent 172-seat Gem 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Bradac hoped to increase single-ticket sales by capitalizing on the 
non-subscription show's popularity, in addition to accommodating theatergoers 
who have had to be turned away from sold-out performances each Christmas at the 
Gem. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to move the show back indoors because we do not want to take a 
chance on the weather," Bradac said. "It has nothing to do with our cash 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The scheduling change has caused the postponement of Shakespeare's "Twelfth 
Night," which had been planned to run at the Gem while "A Child's Christmas in 
Wales" was at the amphitheater. Instead of running Nov. 21 to Dec. 23 at the 
Gem, as previously announced, "Twelfth Night" will run there from Jan. 19 to 
Feb. 17. "A Child's Christmas in Wales" will be at the Gem from Dec. 1 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bradac said the theater's cash-flow problems have resulted chiefly 
from a shortfall of "about $40,000" in season subscriptions and not from a 
decline in overall single-ticket sales, which have come "within $300" of 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue crisis has been compounded, however, by a loss over the past two 
years of nearly $150,000 in contributed income from two major sources: Rancho 
Santiago College, which withdrew an annual grant of $105,000 to invest that 
money in its own theater program, and the Garden Grove City Council, which is 
phasing out its annual appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to take a hit like that," Bradac said. "We're still reacting to that 
shortfall, even though our budget tried to take it into account." 
</P>
<P>
The Grove's annual budget leaped to $850,000 for fiscal 1989-90 from $570,000 
the previous year. The increase came from sweeping changes connected with the 
theater's continuing professionalization and its maiden effort to consolidate 
separately subscribed indoor-outdoor seasons into a shorter, more concentrated 
season of subscription offerings in a single repertory setting.

NEWS BITES / BEVERLY BUSH SMITH: GRAPE-FED WILD BOAR TO BE PIECE DE RESISTANCE 
AT NEWPORT DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard of grain-fed beef and milk-fed veal. Now you can try grape-fed 
wild boar. It's the piece de resistance of Showley Wrightson's second annual 
Guenoc Winemaker's dinner Sunday in Newport Beach. The boar, from the Guenoc 
Winery estate, literally feeds on the grapes in the vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Another unique twist to the dinner: a component wine tasting. Grant Showley 
explained, "Several different grapes are involved in making a Cabernet 
Sauvignon, and we will taste separately the Merlot, Petit Sirah -- all five of 
the components of Guenoc's Cabernet," as well as the finished Cabernet itself. 
</P>
<P>
Grant and Sharon Showley's menu also includes a salad of broiled salmon and 
greens with chervil vinaigrette, wild and Basmati rice timbales with porcini 
mushrooms; $65 per person includes dinner, all wines, tax and gratuities. 
Reservations: (714) 760-9700. 
</P>
<P>
MORE WINING AND DINING: Now that the beach crowds have departed, The Rex in 
Newport Beach gets down to serious wine dinners, showcasing Carmenet wines on 
Oct. 16 and Freemark Abbey vintages on Oct. 23. Reservations: (714) 675-2566. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Dana Point will launch a monthlong Oktober 
Weinfest. In contrast to a folksy "Oktoberfest," this celebration will explore 
"the modern, sophisticated new world of German wines, cuisine and fashion." 
</P>
<P>
With a wide selection of German wines available (many by the glass), the 
hotel's chefs will present compatible cuisine throughout the month. And from 
Oct. 10 to 13, chef Boris Keller from Boris' Restaurant in Walluf (in the heart 
of Germany's Rheingau wine-growing region) will join the hotel's staff to 
prepare "signature" menus. 
</P>
<P>
Other fest highlights include visits by German wine makers and fashion shows of 
German couture. Information: (714) 240-5008. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Stox in Anaheim opens its wine dinner season with vintages from Saintsbury 
in the Carneros region, presented by David Graves, Wednesday at 7 p.m. New 
releases as well as older wines will complement the cuisine of chef Scott 
Raczek; $65 per person. 
</P>
<P>
(The restaurant will also celebrate Oktoberfest with a participation dinner and 
cooking class Oct. 25. Learn to make sausage, potato pancakes, apple strudel 
and more, starting at 6:30 p.m. The tab is $60, gratuity included.) 
Information: (714) 634-2994. 
</P>
<P>
It's Aussie night on Oct. 18 at the Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach. An Australian 
dinner will accent Tahbilk wines, presented by Australian wine maker Alistair 
Purbrick. Reservations: (714) 673-3440. 
</P>
<P>
There's more: The Bouzy's annual wine sale throughout October offers 75 cases 
of rare and older wines to connoisseurs. These California and imported wines 
may be purchased by the case or mixed case. 
</P>
<P>
HERE 'N' THERE: New at McCharles House in Tustin is Edwardian High Tea, more 
substantial fare than the traditional high tea, served from 2 to 5:30 p.m., 
Monday through Saturday. With its hearty Shepherd's pie -- vegetables with 
chicken, beef, pasta or pork and a mashed potato topping -- it could serve as 
early supper. At $15.95 per person, it also includes McCharles House scones 
with cream and raspberry preserves, a pot of Fortnum &amp; Mason tea and your 
choice of homemade desserts such as bread pudding, apple crisp, 
chocolate-chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
El Torito Grill in Costa Mesa recently began a Wednesday "Salsa Night" at the 
Top of the Grill, overlooking the Noguchi sculpture garden. From 9 p.m. to 1 
a.m., a nine-piece salsa band entertains. There's no cover charge or increase 
in drink prices, and you can order from a seven-item appetizer menu. 
</P>
<P>
Two veteran restaurateurs died recently: Opasso (of Balboa Thai, Newport Beach) 
and Gus Muller (partner with brother Geril in the original Newport Beach 
Ambrosia). Balboa Thai remains open, with Opasso's nephew Peter in charge. 
</P>
<P>
OPENINGS: Carmelo Manto of Corona del Mar's Carmelo's will offer a new style of 
dining at his Viva Italia. Opening next week in Laguna Beach on Laguna Canyon 
Road, the trattoria will present meals under $10. They'll roast meats and 
poultry on a jumbo rotisserie, bake breads, focaccias and pizzas in a wood 
burning oven and prepare over two dozen varieties of pasta in the exhibition 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Active in the venture with Manto are brothers Vittorio and Ignazio Romeo and 
Frank Arciero. They'll open a second Viva Italia in Laguna Niguel at Crown 
Valley Parkway and Greenfield Drive before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar recently debuted in Mission Viejo on Muirlands Boulevard at La Paz 
Road. Partners are Cuban Alex Llorente, his French- Vietnamese wife, Evelyne, 
his mother-in-law, Lucie Alm (who ran a French restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla.) and Don Hilscher. The cuisine? Cuban, French and Vietnamese, of course -- 
from black beans with rice and meat or pork asada to crevettes Catalan or 
choucroute to salad with rice noodles, barbecued pork, shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Two gentlemen from Milan -- Tony Bagatta, who owned Capuccino in Laguna Beach, 
and Andrea Rogantini, opening chef at Tutto Mare -- combine talents at the new 
Il Ristorante Bagatta in Newport Beach. Bagatta has transformed the old Le 
Saint Tropez with mirrors, mauve carpeting, a center dome. The cuisine focuses 
on Northern Italian, with antipastos such as carpaccio of salmon or beef with 
artichoke, smoked Mozarella. The a la carte menu includes risotto with 
Dungeness crab, fresh spinach and dried tomato; rabbit in a slightly sweetened 
balsamic vinegar sauce; baby rack of lamb with tarragon, with all desserts made 
in-house. 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING COURSES: Larry Cano, busy developing his own restaurant operations 
(Cano's in Newport Beach, Studio Cafe in Corona del Mar, Salud! in Huntington 
Beach and Manana in Fountain Valley and Pasadena) has turned the management of 
six El Torito specialty restaurants back to El Torito Restaurants Inc. They 
include Las Brisas in Laguna Beach; Chanteclair, Remick's and Players in 
Irvine; the El Torito Grills in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. Mike Casey, 
president of El Torito Restaurants, termed the change a "mutual decision" and 
predicts " . . . a smooth transition." 
</P>
<P>
Corrado Gianotti, late of Sostanza in Los Angeles (and before that, Italy) is 
the new chef at Tutto Mare in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Maniacci Brothers changed their minds about selling Capriccio in Mission 
Viejo after they opened Sapori in Newport Beach. Sal Maniacci's in charge of 
the Saddleback Valley restaurant at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
ADIOS: John Pohl's Bistro in the South Coast Plaza area is closed. . . . So, 
too, is the nearby Ambrosia. . . . Ditto, Gemmell's in Costa Mesa. 
Award-winning chef Byron Gemmell is now with the Ritz in Newport Center. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE HOTEL SCENE: The Radisson Plaza in Irvine, known as the Registry Hotel 
in its earlier incarnation, opens Nov. 1 with two new restaurants, the 
Orangeflower Bistro and the Promenade Cafe. Gone is Le Chardonnay, converted to 
a ballroom, with the Orangeflower Bistro (formerly Cafe Chablis) the hotel's 
primary restaurant. According to food and beverage director Michael Minassian, 
it will specialize in a touch of French, French/California, with an Oriental 
flavor in the plate design. Moderately priced, it will serve breakfast, lunch 
and a more upscale dinner. The Promenade Cafe, highlighting a deluxe breakfast 
bar with fresh bakery items, fresh fruits and cereals, will also be open for 
lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hyatt Newporter, Tom Dusing promises that the new management won't touch 
The Wine Cellar, where Karel Vidlak remains as maitre d'. The Jamboree Cafe has 
retained the same basic menu, but, Dusing reports, executive chef Ted Gray is 
departing and a replacement has not been named. 
</P>
<P>
BETTER WATCH OUT: I know, it's not even Halloween yet. But if you don't want to 
to miss watching the Christmas boat parade from the windows of your favorite 
harbor restaurant, it's time to make reservations.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet Too, in Fashion Island, 1145 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 640-5250. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The gentrification of Chinese cuisine reaches new heights of absurdity in this 
self-consciously chic restaurant, the second effort of owner chef Michael Kang. 
The restaurant is visually stunning but often comes up short in the taste 
department: Many dishes are precious and ill conceived. The signature 
deep-fried catfish is excellent, and some imaginative dishes work well. Curried 
beef spring rolls are delightful. Kung pao three, with chicken, scallops and 
shrimp, is too. Desserts also are fine. Pity they don't serve humble pie. 
</P>
<P>
Capers, 34150 Coast Highway, Dana Point. (714) 661-3983. Open daily 11:30 a.m. 
to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A bright new seafood restaurant occupying the site of the former Dana Trader, 
Capers has a beachy, casual air well suited to the location. The food isn't 
half bad when the kitchen plays it straight, but the kitchen tries too hard to 
be creative, often with disastrous results. There is a noble, garlicky Caesar, 
not for wimps, some fair broiled fish and several good shrimp dishes. Be wary 
of the ill-conceived attempts at nouvelle, especially anything with the horrid 
lime dipping sauce, coconut batter -- or capers, the restaurant's signature 
condiment. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu, 315 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim. (714) 826-9910. Open Tuesdays through 
Thursdays and Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu doesn't compare with Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or the San Gabriel 
Valley, but that shouldn't put you off a visit. Just remember that the steamed 
fish might be frozen. Winter melon soup with shredded chicken is a masterwork, 
and the Sichuan shrimps are particularly fine. It's primarily a seafood 
restaurant but you may do just as well with the non-seafood items, such as the 
Peking spareribs or the mouth watering rice noodle dishes. Stay away from the 
retro-Chinese standbys like chop suey and egg foo young. They're awful. 
</P>
<P>
Salud, 17401 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1194. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Salud, a new high concept Mexican restaurant from Larry Cano, has an outlandish 
design that looks like a set Roger Corman might have used for a movie on Aztec 
discomania. All the trendy Mexican buttons are pushed: hand shaken margaritas, 
80's chiles, blue corn. Avoid the usualMeximush and head for soups, grilled 
meats and desserts. Pozole verde is hominy and shredded chicken in broth, and 
it's great. So is Ibarra chocolate bread pudding, little cubes of fudge soaked 
bread in a tequila orange cream sauce. Prices are reasonable.

WINGING IT IN TRAFFIC DURING WAYNE AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NEEDHAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cars come roaring off the San Diego Freeway, or barreling down MacArthur 
Boulevard, headed for John Wayne Airport and the plane they can catch only if 
everything breaks just right -- a fantastic parking space, no lines, a quick 
check of the baggage. 
</P>
<P>
All right! There it is, on MacArthur, the international symbol for an airport: 
white airplanes on a green background. But wait, what's this? Hey, it's an 
additional sign, a perfect symbol for today's John Wayne Airport: "Detour." 
</P>
<P>
At a crosswalk on the road heading to the main terminal building, a bus 
shuttling passengers from outlying parking lots to the terminals stops 
abruptly. No one can see around the bus. Eventually the driver crosses the road 
to another shuttle bus and hands its driver a piece of paper. Car drivers fume. 
Shuttle driver No. 1 finally reboards and drives on. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers hunting for spaces prowl the new parking structure, slowly passing 
tiny, hard-to-read signs that direct them higher and higher. "Caution, Level 
4," reads a warning as the driver emerges from mole-befitting darkness into 
blinding light to finally find a space -- on the roof, in the baking heat. Only 
one of the three elevators is working and all of them are at the end of the 
200-yard-long building farthest from the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Great. Just Great. 
</P>
<P>
Construction at John Wayne has been going on for a year and a half now, in an 
attempt to replace the facility's resemblance to a Third World airport with a 
facade a bit more suitable to the state's third most populous county. A new 
$50-million terminal is the centerpiece of the $310-million expansion program. 
More than 12,000 passengers arrive and depart through the main terminal on an 
average day now. After the expansion is completed, the numbers will gradually 
increase to about double the current level. 
</P>
<P>
But despite what a taxi driver termed "chaos," and remembering that the airport 
was never a prize in the first place, how far downhill you think things have 
careened since construction began depends largely on where you stand. 
</P>
<P>
Coming down on the side of gloom is Deputy Sheriff Keith Davis, who supervises 
the officers who make sure that no one climbs the fences onto the tarmac and 
that drivers don't double-park for ridiculously long periods. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," Davis says in the long, narrow control room with flashing 
lights, numerous buttons and television monitors showing what's going on 
outside the terminal. "It's just a lot more traffic. You've got the parking lot 
closures and what have you, due to the construction." In addition, some 
airlines have added a new type of aircraft, the Boeing 757, bringing more 
passengers in than in the old days. "It's like two planes coming in now instead 
of one because of the passenger loads." 
</P>
<P>
On the two-lane, one-way road that passes in front of the terminal, there 
aren't many spaces for people to pick up or drop off passengers, and the few 
metered parking spots just beyond the terminal are almost always full at peak 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place to park to pick up the people," says Davis. "They just drive 
around in circles until (passengers being picked up) get their loads out of the 
baggage claim area. They don't really appear to us to be parking in the parking 
structure to walk over to the terminal to meet their arriving passenger. They 
just drive around until the (arriving passengers) show up on the curb." Still, 
passengers and those meeting them "are pretty good," Davis says. "I think most 
people realize the situation, the way it is. You just have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Skycap William Pratt, in navy blue trousers and matching hat, white shirt 
looking crisp despite the heat, glides over to passengers emerging from a car 
in front of the terminal and starts to check their baggage. 
</P>
<P>
One bag, three, eight, it doesn't matter much to Pratt. He'll use a dolly when 
he can, hoisting the bags on after he tags them, then wheeling them in to the 
baggage belt of whatever airline the passenger is flying. If it's busy and some 
of his colleagues have the dollies tied up, he'll grab a bag or two and simply 
manhandle them into the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt leaves his Fullerton home each day around 5 a.m. for the 25-minute drive 
to the airport and a shift that lasts until 2 p.m. His minuet with the luggage 
never seems hurried; he just sort of glides from curbside to baggage belt, 
staying calm, not saying much, getting the luggage where it's supposed to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rushed," he says as passengers swirl around him on the sidewalk outside. 
"Travelers are . . . going all over." Any problems due to construction? "No, 
it'd be like this regardless." 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago he decided that being a full-time trumpet player wasn't going 
to get it; he became a Skycap. Compared to hefting a trumpet, "this is work," 
he says. At the end of the day, though, despite handling bags and packages of 
freight that can weigh upward of 100 pounds, he claims not to be worn out. 
"Naw, I'm a man," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Roditis, 45, driver of the taxi that is third in line across the road 
from the terminal, with nine more stretched out behind his, has been waiting 
for half an hour to get to the front of the queue and get a passenger. He hopes 
it won't be someone wanting to go just to a nearby hotel; maybe a nice long 
ride, like Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"The construction right now is causing big problems here," says Roditis, who 
lives in Anaheim and has been driving a taxi for 14 months. Around 8 or 9 p.m., 
he says, it may take a driver half an hour to get to the line-up road across 
from the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Roditis says the construction slows all traffic in the airport and on the road 
outside, making it nearly impossible to zoom out, drop a fare and get back to 
the airport and the line. 
</P>
<P>
He usually works from 10 a.m. until 11 p.m., driving a cab he leases for $510 a 
week from the company that has the concession for the taxi business at John 
Wayne. He came from Greece five years ago, worked as a pizza cook, and then 
took the taxi job because "I like to drive. . . . Some day probably I'm going 
to be a truck driver so I can drive day and night, drive across the country." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how bad the traffic is snarled, he figures he can get 10 to 15 
fares from the airport in a day, charging either by the meter or by flat rate. 
He isn't happy with passengers who have vouchers from airlines that cover the 
cost of a ride from John Wayne to Los Angeles International Airport. The 
vouchers pointedly tell a rider that the "tip is included." 
</P>
<P>
He is happy with people like the four passengers he drove a few weeks ago "over 
to the north parking lot, about a mile. And they realized it was a waste of 
time (for Roditis), so they gave me $30. After 14 months, that was the best tip 
I ever had." 
</P>
<P>
When the construction is done, there will be a new, larger terminal and more 
passengers arriving. That will mean more potential fares for Roditis and fewer 
traffic problems, he figures. He's happy about that. 
</P>
<P>
For now, he suffers the construction, earning money to support his wife and 
three children so the kids can go to good schools "so they can have a better 
job than I did." 
</P>
<P>
Marty Larsen, station manager for Trans World Airlines, can't wait for the 
construction to end and his passengers to get an airport where they can 
actually walk from the terminal onto the plane, rather than schlepping out 
across the pavement before boarding. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that (construction) is a major problem that I can see," he said 
from his vantage point inside the terminal and away from the road and parking 
structure. "Construction hasn't affected the airlines' performance." 
</P>
<P>
"The only suffering is by the traveling public because of the transition in 
parking," Larsen says, but "I don't think the employees as a whole have had a 
major problem in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, with mounds of dirt, piles of steel and scaffolding scattered about, 
it's "kind of hard to tell" just how things are going, he says. "It's certainly 
got to be an improvement" over what it was, he says. "I joke with my friends 
that when it's over we're going to have indoor plumbing and hot and cold 
running water." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen remembers his time in Kansas City for TWA, though, when, as at John 
Wayne now, people hiked out to the plane, and he remembers how much better it 
was when a new airport was built, with "jetways" that allow boarding right from 
the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"Having made the transition there to jetways, somewhere down the road I know 
how nice it's going to be, whereas a lot of these people have never known 
anything but what they have. It's going to be a shock to them, but a pleasant 
one." 
</P>
<P>
One person wondering if things will get worse before they get better at the 
airport is John Anderson of Laguna Beach, a nursing home administrator and 
frequent flyer, usually north to Portland, Ore., on business. 
</P>
<P>
A friend dropped Anderson off in front of the terminal for a Portland flight 
one recent day and he breezed through check-in and security and onto the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it would be a lot worse than it has been," he said before boarding. 
"I wonder if as construction progresses it will get worse." Anderson did say he 
makes sure to fly at off-hours when possible, and avoids peak-hour traffic on 
the freeways that can knot a traveler's stomach even before getting to the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been here during rush-hour traffic," he said. "I'm sure it's more 
hectic then." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Murphy, knee-deep in dirt some days and eyes bleary from blueprints on 
others, says the basic problem with the construction is simply that "we're 
building a new airport on top of an existing airport. . . . No matter how much 
planning you do, there's going to be problems." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is project manager for the construction. He points out that the 
pre-expansion airport was built for 400,000 passengers a year and now handles 
more than 11 times that amount, 4.6 million a year. The biggest problem for 
fliers, Murphy says, is parking. One day a lot is open; the next it's closed. 
But overall, "I think it's going pretty well" during the construction.

SINGLE LIFE: RUNNING A DATE PAST THE DEPENDENTS GETS TRICKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've recently met someone whose company you enjoy; the two of you seem 
compatible. You want to include him in all aspects of your life, including your 
family life. You would like to meet his kids and vice versa but wonder if the 
time is right. How do you decide -- and how do you handle the questions that 
children often ask about your single life? 
</P>
<P>
For many singles, it can be tricky to balance parent, child and the person they 
are dating. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Reder, founder and president of a county singles club, does not always feel 
comfortable introducing his 15-year-old daughter to his dates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it can scare off not only my date but my daughter," he says. "If a 
woman and I hit it off, there will be opportunities later on for 
introductions." 
</P>
<P>
As for casual introductions, "if I go to pick up a date and she introduces me 
to her child, that's fine, but if she is too eager to involve her kids in our 
activities right away, I feel uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Carty, who sells real estate investments and lives in Rancho Santa 
Margarita with her 9-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, has been divorced 
nearly three years. At first she was apprehensive about introducing dates to 
her children. 
</P>
<P>
"I was uncomfortable because the kids were," she says. "But now, if I know a 
lot about the man, I'll introduce them. But when it comes to including him in 
our social activities, I wait until I know him a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
James Taylor, 32, is an Irvine-based salesman, divorced six years. During his 
three years in the county, he has introduced his 11-year-old son to very few of 
his dates. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been seeing someone special for about six months, but until I knew how 
we felt about each other, I didn't involve my son in our relationship," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that it is vital to know how the other person views certain things 
before involving the children: "I have to know how this person feels about many 
different issues: children, divorce, remarriage. I have to know about her 
character before I involve my son." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Morvant, 35, who lives in Laguna Hills with her 10-year-old son and 
7-year-old daughter, has been separated for three years. "I haven't been ready 
for a big-time relationship," she says, "so most everyone I've dated I've 
approached as friendships." 
</P>
<P>
Her son is very receptive to her dating. "His father is contemplating 
remarriage, so he wants me to have someone too. He's always got ideas about who 
would be good for Mom," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
John Flannery, 34, owns a printing company and lives in Laguna Niguel, where he 
spends nearly every weekend with his 4-year-old son. "He meets nearly every 
woman I date," Flannery says. "He enjoys their company, and they enjoy him. 
It's healthy. Most of them have kids of their own, and it's good to see them 
socializing with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Flannery says it's not a major problem for his son when the relationship does 
not work out: "My son is at an age where these things don't leave a lasting 
impression. For example, one time I dated a woman with a child, and our kids 
became friends. When we stopped seeing each other, David missed the kid for a 
short time. But kids his age are very resilient, and I would rather he had the 
experience than not to have had it. I think overall it has been a very positive 
thing for him." 
</P>
<P>
How do these single parents answer the ticklish questions that children ask 
about their dating lives? 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor's son wanted to know if his parents were going to get back 
together, "I just told him the truth," Taylor says, "that I understood how he 
felt, but that, bottom line, it was never going to happen. Then I went on with 
my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I included him as often as possible until he became more secure about me as a 
single father." 
</P>
<P>
Morvant handled the same situation by letting her daughter know "that I 
understood exactly how she felt because I really did -- after all, I was hoping 
at one point that we would reconcile too. Validating someone else's feelings 
doesn't mean things are going to change; it's just a way of letting someone 
know they matter to you." 
</P>
<P>
Carty recalls her daughter's questions about dating. "She was 8 or 9 and wanted 
to know why I had to go out at night," she says. "I explained that a child 
usually sees their friends after school, during the day, but that parents work 
so they have to see their friends usually at night. It was a simple 
explanation, but it seemed to satisfy her." 
</P>
<P>
Morvant agrees that simple explanations are best: "When I decided to start 
dating, I knew my daughter had some apprehension, so I just told her that I had 
met a friend and that we were going to have dinner together to see if we wanted 
to keep being friends. I said, 'I may go out with him again or someone else. I 
need to make new friends now. You may be with a baby-sitter sometimes.' 
</P>
<P>
"The more platonic it looks to a child, the better for them, I think." 
</P>
<P>
And when a relationship reaches a serious level? "This is something for which 
my son would be prepared well in advance," Taylor says. "He would have an 
opportunity to watch the relationship develop and grow. If I were going to have 
her sleep over, I would have to be in a mutually committed relationship first. 
My son would know my feelings for her were very deep and lasting. Anything less 
is inappropriate, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
All agree that blatant displays of affection are inappropriate and out of place 
around kids. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone comes to pick me up for a date," Morvant says, "a kiss and hug is 
fine, but I don't like too much of that around my kids. I just don't feel 
comfortable, and they don't either." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, all these single parents agree that a common mistake parents make is 
to fill up all the empty spaces with their children when they are not dating. 
</P>
<P>
"When you aren't seeing anybody, you may be a bit lonely, so you involve your 
kid in everything you do," Taylor says. "Then you meet someone, and boom, it's 
no longer just 'Dad and me,' it's the three of us or the kid is left out 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important to make time just for you and your kid together, 
without a third person. Being a threesome is fine, but not all of the time, 
because when a kid starts to feel ignored, left out, that's when resentments 
build and problems begin."

POET TAKES ROLE IN SOLVING HOMELESS PROBLEM: SHE'S BEEN THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET, Penelope Moffet is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although she's never had to sleep on the streets, Laguna Beach poet Terry 
Kennedy has known the pain of being poor, unemployed and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's early-1988 bout with homelessness was brief (she and her husband were 
given housing by a friend she calls "my godmother," and they eventually 
acquired an apartment of their own), but the experience left a deep imprint on 
the poet. 
</P>
<P>
Now a part-time community college instructor and free-lance writer, Kennedy 
still struggles to make ends meet. Today, however, she lives in a gracious 
apartment with her husband, fiction writer Mark Miller. For the past eight 
months Kennedy has also been involved with the Orange County Homeless Issues 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was finally hired back as a teacher and a writer, I felt so grateful. I 
was just so grateful that I had a roof over my head, and I wanted to help other 
people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As chair of the Community Education Committee of the task force, Kennedy has 
researched and written a report on the need to create affordable housing in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And as part of her work to raise public consciousness about homeless people's 
problems, she's organized a free "Homeless Awareness Reading" for Sunday from 2 
to 5 p.m. in Laguna's Heisler Park. At least 12 poets will read poems on a 
variety of themes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not raising money, just hopefully people will pass by and hear some 
poems and want to get involved in some way," Kennedy said. The kickoff speaker 
will be Scott Mather, chair of the California Homeless Coalition. Orange County 
poets Marcia Cohee, John Brugaletta and Lee Mallory, San Fernando Valley poets 
Sylvia Rosen and Nancy Shiffrin, Long Beach writer John Brander and others will 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "A Shake-Up Wake-Up Out of Your Apathy Poetry Reading," the event is 
sponsored by the California Poets for the Poor. That group consists, basically, 
of one person: Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy is a short, vivacious woman who speaks passionately -- with audible 
exclamation points -- about most things that draw her interest. The idea for 
the "Homeless Awareness Reading" came from her desire to somehow make a 
difference in public consciousness about homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a poet, you do have a responsibility to awaken this spiritual part of 
people," said Kennedy, who's the author of three published books of poetry. 
"That's what poetry is about, it's about awakening this spirit in people, this 
giving, loving, generous spirit. . . . People on the street are not 
second-class citizens. They deserve a roof over their heads, and they deserve 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Father Colin Henderson is the director of Friendship Shelter, the only homeless 
shelter in Laguna. Henderson, who originally suggested to Kennedy that she work 
with the Homeless Issues Task Force, said he supports the idea of the "Homeless 
Awareness Reading." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, in a city which has strong links with the arts, this is an 
interesting way of approaching (homelessness)," Henderson said. "People tend to 
think of homelessness in stereotypical terms, and they need to think of it in 
personal terms. People do not know or understand how difficult it is for people 
of low incomes to live in Orange County, and probably beyond. I don't think 
it's getting any better, and I'm afraid it's bound to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
John Brugaletta, a Cal State Fullerton English professor and poet, said he will 
read poems on several different themes, including some about homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there is a need for raising people's awareness of the homeless," said 
Brugaletta, who's a regular volunteer at a Fullerton soup kitchen. "I'm not 
sure how effective a poetry reading is for doing this, but I think everybody 
ought to be doing everything they can. This is what poets can do." 
</P>
<P>
Terri Brint Joseph, a Chapman College English professor, said she'll read a 
number of poems about "homes, how I've felt about places I've lived, what a 
home can mean to us." 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is a good theme for a writer, Joseph said. "It's so emotionally 
laden. I think part of us is always a stranger, and isn't fully attached or 
fully related to those around us. I think that experience is somehow related to 
literal homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's research has shown her that there's plenty of literal homelessness in 
Orange County, which has one of the most expensive housing markets in the 
country. Not only is there a dearth of affordable housing (in her report, 
affordable housing is defined as housing that takes less than 60% of your 
income to maintain), but "I've found so many people who are literally just one 
paycheck away from homelessness," Kennedy said. The first real financial 
emergency could put these people on the street, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of dollars are given in Orange County to keep pieces of sculpture, 
pots, photos, paintings in a museum," she said. "Why can't those same 
(grant-giving) corporations give money to the homeless? I just don't understand 
the mentality that cannot help people in need." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy hasn't always been active on social issues. At one time, "I was a very 
wealthy lady," she said. "How I viewed (the homeless), if I did, was that they 
were sort of 'over there.' I never in my life dreamed that I could become a 
person who was homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Formerly married to a wealthy Bostonian, Kennedy was divorced in 1980 and came 
to California soon afterward. She lived in Laguna Beach and the Lucerne Valley 
while she taught, wrote and traveled. She married and divorced again before 
getting together with Mark Miller, her current husband. And in July, 1987, she 
and Miller won a grant from the Massachusetts-based Barbara Dunning Foundation 
to travel to Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"To live in New Zealand was very inexpensive for us," said Kennedy. "We were 
writing every day, and the cost of living was an artist's dream." The couple 
planned to stay overseas for another year, but Kennedy's attorney called to say 
her small, ramshackle Lucerne Valley cabin had been sold. Kennedy and Miller 
came home to collect the money, only to learn the offer on the house had been 
bogus. 
</P>
<P>
With their funds extremely low, the couple boarded a bus, came to Laguna and 
immediately began looking for jobs. They were lucky: By the end of the first 
day, Miller was employed at a bookstore and Kennedy had a job in a maternity 
shop. Yet, "we didn't even have enough money for a hotel," Kennedy remembers. 
That was when Luella Russell, Kennedy's Leisure World "godmother," gave them a 
home for two weeks. "I literally don't know what we would have done without 
her," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never told anybody what was happening to me," Kennedy added. "I was too 
embarrassed." They found a small apartment, and both worked more than full time 
at a variety of low-paying jobs they traveled to by bus. "We were working all 
the time to get a car. Once we got a car last November, then a whole new world 
opened up for us in terms of jobs," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller now teaches six writing classes at four different schools, while Kennedy 
teaches three classes through Orange Coast College and Rancho Santiago College. 
Both take the first few hours of each day for their own writing, even when it 
means rising at 4 a.m., Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy feels her involvement with homeless issues has strengthened her poetry. 
And she hopes that California Poets for the Poor will draw area poets together 
into an ongoing organization that runs workshops and sponsors readings at 
homeless shelters and other sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I think poets want to be actively involved somehow, politically, but they 
don't know how," she said.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: HOW A THOUGHT BECAME A POEM AND BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When poet-playwright Richard D. Gordon was asked by students at Valley High 
School in Santa Ana to do a poem on Martin Luther King Jr. as part of a black 
history program three years ago, he sat down and wrote a poem he had been 
thinking about for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The result is "Martin on the Mountaintop," a stirring poetic tribute to the 
slain civil-rights leader. The poem was inspired by King's famous speech, made 
the day before he was assassinated in 1968, that he had abandoned fear because 
he had been to the mountaintop and had seen the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
"It went over very well," recalled Gordon, 51. "Afterward, a student came up to 
me and said, in passing, 'As you read that, I could visualize what you were 
saying, and it should be a book.' " 
</P>
<P>
That comment was the seed for the illustrated book version of "Martin on the 
Mountaintop" (Cmark Press; $14.95), which Gordon, the 1984 recipient of the 
Lorraine Hansberry Award for best original play on the black experience in 
America, self-published a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since writing the poem, Gordon, a Lake Elsinore resident with strong ties to 
Orange County, has read it at schools and churches throughout Orange and 
Riverside counties. (Gordon, a Cal State Fullerton theater arts graduate, has 
sold about half of the 3,000 printed copies of the slim volume, mostly at his 
readings.) 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents will have a chance to hear Gordon read "Martin on the 
Mountaintop" at 7 tonight during his one-man show, "I Reckon It'll Be Me!" at 
the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center, 931 N. Harbor Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The "evening of drama and poetry" will have a six-performance run (tonight, 
Saturday and Sunday, and Oct. 6, 7 and 8). Admission is $10, or $7 for senior 
citizens and students. For reservations, call (714) 674-4785. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reading his own works, Gordon will include readings from his 
favorite writers, including Shakespeare, Langstan Hughes, Paul Laurence Dunbar 
and James Weldon Johnson. In fact, Gordon says, the rhythms and imagery of 
Johnson's poetry inspired his writing style for "Martin on the Mountaintop." 
</P>
<P>
As Gordon says in the preface, the poem was written in response to feelings 
about the human qualities of Martin Luther King Jr.: "I had wondered what 
emotions 'the man' Martin must have gone through when people he loved died in 
the cause. We know he valiantly struggled forward after every act of hate and 
violence; but I wondered if, in his quiet (or not so quiet) moments with God, 
he sometimes asked if the struggle was worth the lives of loved ones . . . 
especially those of innocent children." 
</P>
<P>
The father of eight children asked his schoolteacher wife, Carol, who has a 
degree in art, to do the illustrations for the book. "My attitude was, 'There's 
no way I can draw,' " he said. But when he showed her his rough sketches of the 
kinds of drawings he wanted to accompany his words, she suggested that he do 
the illustrations himself. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew she wouldn't be able to satisfy my enthusiasm," Gordon recalled with 
a laugh. "I have really learned something about myself in doing the 
illustrations for this book. As much as I love the poem, I'm more amazed at the 
illustrations. It was something I didn't know I had in me." 
</P>
<P>
King is a personal hero to Gordon, a former Orange County probation officer, 
who is working on a new play. 
</P>
<P>
"His philosophies are basically my philosophies," he said. "First off, I feel 
he knew how to love in spite of all the hatred around him, and that impresses 
me very much still. I think that's the only chance the world has. Personally, 
I'm really concerned about racism right now, some of the things that are 
happening, and I don't just mean black and white. . . . Gangs fighting each 
other -- it's the same thing. . . . I get frustrated sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, a member of Johnson Chapel in Santa Ana, said a portion of the proceeds 
from his one-man show -- and sales of his book during the show's run -- will 
benefit the Johnson Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Scholarship Fund. 
</P>

FOR POOR, CLOSURE OF SOUTH COUNTY WELFARE OFFICE SPELLS HARDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking the bus around her neighborhood in San Clemente already is a tactical 
nightmare for Marguerite Abrego and her four children. 
</P>
<P>
"People laugh at us," the 27-year-old single mother said on Thursday as she 
described how she juggles two toddlers in strollers while trying to keep her 
older two in tow. "It's like a crazy joy ride. God, I hate it." 
</P>
<P>
But soon, Abrego, who lives at the Anchor House, a temporary shelter, will have 
to make a five-hour, round-trip bus ride to Costa Mesa to apply for welfare and 
food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
She has to go to the Costa Mesa office because as of today the county's welfare 
office in San Juan Capistrano, the only such office in South County, closes its 
doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the objections of some local officials and social service workers, 
county welfare officials decided to shut down the branch facility, a small 
storefront office on Paseo Adelante that served about 300 new welfare 
applicants a month, to save money while a full-service welfare office in Laguna 
Hills is being planned. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Social Services Agency officials said funding for the Laguna 
Hills office will not be available until at least January, when the Board of 
Supervisors reviews a variety of mid-fiscal year budget requests. Even then, 
county officials say, there is no guarantee the money will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
But administrators of several agencies serving the poor said the closing of the 
facility is premature, adding that it will make it impossible for many eligible 
South County residents to collect welfare. County records show that 600 welfare 
recipients live in South Orange County, Social Services Agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a travesty for all the citizens who so desperately need access to these 
programs," said Boetta Saunders, executive director of the South County 
Community Clinic, a nonprofit medical facility for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders and others said that the closure is a sign that county officials have 
yet to face the reality that there are poor people in South County, better 
known for its abundance of expensive housing developments and sweeping coastal 
vistas than its destitute. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a perception that there is no need here," Saunders said, whose center 
helps many of those who seek aid from the county. "All they need to do is come 
down here and take a good look. These people are very, very real and have 
tremendous problems." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Gilchrist, head of the Episcopal Service Alliance in San Clemente, said 
that she was "very disappointed" in the closing of the San Juan Capistrano 
office, which, she added, "is going to make it extremely difficult for us down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Gilchrist said she is considering ways to help transport welfare applicants to 
Costa Mesa. But for now, she added, it is all she and her workers can do to 
field calls from residents inquiring about how to get to the welfare office in 
Costa Mesa on Fischer Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Gilchrist said that the trip into Costa Mesa will take three bus transfers and 
most of the day for applicants, many of whom are young, single mothers who do 
not own cars. 
</P>
<P>
"They are . . . young and confused," Gilchrist said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano office was opened more than five years ago at the 
urging of local social service workers and San Juan Capistrano City Councilman 
Kenneth E. Friess. 
</P>
<P>
It was billed as a temporary program, scheduled to close two years ago. But 
through the efforts of Friess, local social services and Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley, the office remained open until now. 
</P>
<P>
The office was staffed with two case workers for the Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children program and one Medi-Cal specialist. They signed up new 
clients and provided basic services. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone needing legal or more specialized help still had to make the trip to 
Costa Mesa, said Robert A. Griffith, chief deputy director of the county Social 
Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cancel the program was made after county welfare officials 
concluded that the three eligibility workers "could not handle the load," 
Griffith said. "It was a small operation, and the people could be better served 
in Costa Mesa." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith conceded that "it will be a difficult trip for many of them. But I 
believe it will be a temporary situation." 
</P>
<P>
In August, the Board of Supervisors considered spending $178,000 for the 
25-employee Laguna Hills office. That request was rejected because of budget 
constraints, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Those funds would have been for hiring new workers, Riley said. The 
6,000-square-foot building was leased by the county three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Riley vowed to lobby for money to open the Laguna Hills branch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sad about" the closing, he said. "But I feel very confident that 
there will be unanimous support" on the Board of Supervisors for opening the 
Laguna Hills branch office. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Friess, who last year persuaded fellow council members to approve a 
$17,000 emergency grant to keep the local office open, said he was disappointed 
to learn of the closing, but added that he believes the Laguna Hills branch 
office will open eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"I've fought battles on this before," Friess said. "I can't in my wildest 
imagination think that (county welfare officials) would renege now." 
</P>
<P>
But until the Laguna Hills office opens, many poor South County residents will 
have to make the long trip to Costa Mesa, said Lauren Fiore, a case worker who 
sat at a desk in San Juan Capistrano the day before closing. And when they 
finally do arrive, they will face an application process that takes about four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore said that about half of those who sought services in San Juan Capistrano 
were unaware that the office was due to close. 
</P>
<P>
"They . . . have been not pleased," she said.

GIRL'S ALLEGED ATTACKER GETS ATTENTION OF POLICE IN UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Utah police are looking at Kyle Joseph Borges, arrested this week in the 
abduction and rape of a 12-year-old Huntington Beach girl, as a possible 
suspect in five recent sexual assaults on young girls in that state, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement source said local police believe that Borges left Orange 
County in May -- shortly after he was acquitted on charges of raping an Anaheim 
Hills woman -- and went to Utah, where investigators think that he may have 
been involved in a series of rapes and burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
Borges, 29, an occasional construction worker and transient who has a history 
of sexual abuse citations dating back to his days as a teen-ager in Orange 
County, has relatives in the St. George, Utah, area about 300 miles south of 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City Detective Pat Smith, who is investigating several sex crimes, 
said of Borges: "He's a subject. This is a guy we certainly want to take a look 
at. . . . We're anxious to find out about him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other, Similar Assaults 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she has no other suspects in two sexual assaults that occurred in 
Salt Lake City in a period from May to July, one involving a 7-year-old girl, 
the other an 8-year-old girl. Both victims were abducted as they slept on the 
ground floor of their homes in quiet city neighborhoods. Both were taken away 
on foot by a man about 30 years old and were sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Separate police agencies in the greater Salt Lake City area are investigating 
an unusual rash of at least three other, similar sexual assaults since May, all 
involving the abduction of girls age 13 or younger, according to Brian Jackson, 
a sex crimes detective with the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the Huntington Beach case, Borges is suspected of having entered the gated 
Sea Cliff on the Greens community early Sunday and abducting a 12-year-old 
girl. The intruder allegedly took the girl in his truck to an open field, raped 
her and pushed her nude from the cab. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came five months after Borges was acquitted by an Orange County 
Superior Court jury of breaking into an Anaheim Hills home in October, 1988, 
and raping a 46-year-old woman. Prosecutors said a genetic DNA test indicated 
to a virtual certainty that Borges was guilty. But they were not allow to 
present the evidence because the results arrived only after the trial was under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City Detective Smith said she became immediately interested in Borges 
on Thursday when she saw an interagency police communication from Orange County 
that described him as a suspect in the Huntington Beach rape. 
</P>
<P>
Smith cautioned that "we don't have enough information yet to know if it's 
worth pursuing." But she added that "this is more than we've had to work with 
so far." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the composite drawing she had seen of the Huntington Beach suspect 
seemed to generally fit the description of the Utah assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Borges' family in Utah would not comment Thursday about his arrest. The mother, 
Doretta Borges, had told a reporter earlier: "Leave the family alone. . . . 
Have some compassion. Do you think that our heart is breaking or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ed McErlain of the Huntington Beach Police Department said Thursday of the 
Utah investigations: "I don't know that anybody's established that he's 
responsible for any other cases in other cities. I know that he's being looked 
at in other cases, but I can't say anything further." He described the review 
of Borges' arrest by other departments as standard procedure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Court Appearance 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Thursday, Borges made his first appearance in Municipal Court in the 
Huntington Beach rape case, but his arraignment was continued until Oct. 13 to 
give the public defender's office more time to prepare to represent him. In the 
only other action on the case, Municipal Judge Marvin G. Weeks in Westminster 
rescinded Borges' bail, which had been set at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the proceedings, Borges was hidden from public view, answering questions 
curtly through an open door and visible only to the judge and attorneys. Deputy 
Public Defender James Barnett said he feared that photos in the media of Borges 
might prejudice the case, which is said to rely heavily on physical 
descriptions of the suspect by several witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnett made clear that whoever ends up defending Borges will probably hit 
upon the victim's identification as a defense. Questioning the judgment and 
perception of a youthful observer, he said: "Typically, a small child is not as 
good a witness as a 30- or 40-year-old man or woman."

NEWPORT BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
DAMAGES SET AT $150,000 AS FIRE SWEEPS 6,300-SQUARE-FOOT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An early-morning fire partially destroyed a house under construction in an 
exclusive Newport Beach area Thursday, causing estimated damages of $150,000, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called to the scene at Ocean Beach Drive in the Spyglass Hill 
area about 2:20 a.m. after officers in a Newport Beach police helicopter 
spotted flames from the two-story structure, police spokesman Bob Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 firefighters brought the blaze under control but not before one-third 
of the building was gutted. Investigators believe that the fire was started 
accidentally by a plumber's torch, Battalion Chief Ray Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the owner of the 6,300-square-foot home estimated its value at $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was about half a mile from a home on Port Ramsgate that was damaged 
in a fire Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That residence, located across a greenbelt from a street plagued with fires the 
last 10 months, sustained $25,000 worth of damages. The cause of the fire is 
still under investigation, Brown said.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER WILL PLACE TIME CAPSULE AT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A time capsule that will be buried next week in the heart of the city's 
downtown will give Huntington Beach residents in the year 2089 a chance to view 
the trends and styles of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The capsule will be placed in a mosaic fountain at the site of the not-yet 
completed Pierside Pavilion, at Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway. When the 
pavilion opens in 1990, the $23-million, four-story complex will house 
specialty shops, restaurants and a six-screen movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items the capsule will include will be a string bikini, the city 
charter, a barrel of oil and a California raisin statue. 
</P>
<P>
"We are helping the city to grow and change," said Uri Gati of California 
Resorts/Haseko Associates, the developer of Pierside Pavilion. "But we wanted 
to keep the city's past very much present and remember it for future 
generations."

GOP CHIEF AT YORBA LINDA FUND-RAISER; 
</P>
<P>
ATWATER HAILS NIXON AT LIBRARY EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, carried the GOP's 
blessing to the site of the planned Richard M. Nixon Library in Yorba Linda 
Thursday, telling about 300 contributors that Nixon is "a man who history will 
remember as a great President." 
</P>
<P>
"It is already happening," Atwater told the crowd gathered at a reception in 
the bare steel structure of the future library building. "As I travel around 
the country, more and more people are thinking back on the Nixon years and 
understanding the massive accomplishments he made." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater also praised Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, host of the 
fund-raiser for the library on the site of Nixon's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to tell you, this is a man with a future," Atwater said. "This is a 
man you are going to be seeing and hearing about for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, 33, has been encouraged by the California Republican leadership to run 
for a statewide office in 1990. But he has declined, citing family reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Atwater, who met Tuesday with Vasquez in Washington, said the supervisor is 
important to President Bush's effort to expand the base of the Republican 
Party. "I can't think of a better example of what the President wants us to do 
than Gaddi Vasquez," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater's appearance at Thursday's a $100-a-person fund-raiser for the library 
is part of Nixon's recent re-emergence into the spotlight. And Yorba Linda has 
been at the forefront of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
The city received national attention last week when its City Council voted 
unanimously to make Jan. 9 -- Nixon's birthday -- a city holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon "was deeply gratified by it," said John Taylor, Nixon's spokesman, who 
attended the fund-raiser. "He thought it was another gesture of the genuine 
hospitality he has received from the people of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening of the Nixon library is scheduled for June 21, 1990, almost 
16 years after his resignation from office during the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is planning to appear at the grand opening of the library, which falls on 
the 50th anniversary of his marriage to Pat Nixon. Thursday, however, he sent a 
letter to be read at the fund-raiser that included a message for Atwater, who 
was known in the Bush presidential race for his aggressive, attack-style 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
"From one old-fashioned, hardball politician to another: I know we are living 
in a softball era, but don't be too kind and gentle tonight with our mutual 
friends in the media. If you are, they won't respect you in the morning."

HUNT YIELDS NO CLUE OF DEADLY SPIDER IN HOME; 
</P>
<P>
CORONER SAYS FULLERTON WOMAN DIED OF BITE, MAKING HER COUNTY'S FIRST SUCH KNOWN 
FATALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No evidence of a poisonous spider was found Thursday in the search of a 
Fullerton home after the death of a woman who lived there was attributed to a 
spider bite. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office has ruled that the death early Tuesday of 
Patricia Garcia, 54, was caused by a spider. It was the first county death ever 
attributed to such a bite, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Confirmation 
</P>
<P>
Garcia reportedly suffered from weak kidneys, cirrhosis of the liver and 
cardiovascular disease, problems that could have intensified the effects of the 
bite. She was not treated for the bite until six days after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she had these problems, and then the spider bite happened, and that 
compounded to kill her," said Bruce Lyle, a coroner's supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the official ruling, county officials and entomologists said no hard 
evidence had been gathered to confirm that a spider caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Webb, an entomologist at Orange County Vector Control, said that 
unless the spider is found it would appear that there is only a "remote chance" 
that the cause of her death was spider bite. 
</P>
<P>
Officials searched the Garcia home for signs of the poisonous brown recluse 
spider, or any other species that could offer better clues to the woman's 
death, but found mostly non-poisonous cellar spiders, which are common to the 
area, county entomologist Rudy Geck said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said Garcia's symptoms were similar to those caused by the brown recluse, 
a member of the Loxoscetidae family, a poisonous group often called violin 
spiders because of markings on their upper backs. 
</P>
<P>
"The violin spider doesn't wander," Geck said. "It's almost something you have 
to search out in the dark places." He said vector control officials will resume 
searching boxes and corners in the garage next week. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Garcia's husband of 35 years, Joseph, use pesticidal fog in 
the garage where the violin spider would most likely live, in nooks and 
crannies or darker areas. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's daughters took her to Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim at 4 a.m. 
Saturday after she awakened with a swollen eye and a blackened face, on the 
same side as the three bites resembling pimples over her eyebrow. She thought, 
and the coroner's report states, that she had been bitten by a spider about six 
days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Typical immediate treatment of poison victims entails removing the infected 
area to stop the spread of the venom. However, because of the time lapse since 
Garcia thought she was bitten, the area was too badly infected to prevent 
further spreading, said Dr. Elizabeth Grimley, who was present at the hospital 
but did not treat the patient. 
</P>
<P>
There are few recorded cases of fatalities from spider bites, and most 
entomologists consider it surprising that Garcia actually died from a bite. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very surprising," said Dr. Charles Hogue, entomology curator at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, estimating that nationwide less 
than 0.01% of those who suffer spider bites die of them. The last reported area 
sighting of a brown recluse spider was in Sierra Madre in 1969, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With proper medical treatment or antivenin, poisonous spider bites can be cured 
relatively easily, Hogue said. 
</P>
<P>
A poisonous spider bite "puts the whole body under stress and calls on all the 
body's resources to fight it off," Hogue said. "If things aren't up to good 
working level, something has to give."

RED GUYER, LONGTIME LAGUNA COACH, DIES OF CANCER AT AGE 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maurice T. (Red) Guyer, a former coach at Laguna Beach High School, has died of 
cancer at his Laguna Niguel home. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Guyer coached track at Laguna Beach High in 1934-69. His teams won 15 league 
championships, compiling a record of 100-47-8. Early in his career, he also 
coached football, basketball and baseball at the school. 
</P>
<P>
His football teams won eight Orange League titles and a Southern Section Lower 
Division title in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Guyer was elected to the California Coach's Hall of Fame by state 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Before coaching, he was an alternate on the 1932 U.S. Olympic 400-meter relay 
team. He ran the third leg on the USC 440-yard relay team, which set a world 
record of 40.8 seconds in 1932 at the West Coast Relays in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from community college in Santa Ana before attending USC. 
</P>
<P>
Guyer, who died at his home Tuesday night, is survived by his wife, Louise. 
</P>
<P>
An open memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. Oct. 7 at the Laguna Beach 
football stadium, which is named for Guyer. Funeral services will be private 
and were not announced.

LOS ALAMITOS OVERPOWERS COMPTON IN SECOND HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took more than half a football game for Los Alamitos High School to rouse 
its powerful offense Thursday night. In a revival led by Todd Gragnano and Erik 
Mitchell, the Griffins (3-1) scored 36 points in the second half to overpower 
Compton (1-3), 42-8, at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano ran for a seven-yard touchdown and completed 16 of 26 passes for 248 
yards and two touchdowns. Mitchell scored three touchdowns of his own, on a 
four-yard run and two others which proved to be the most exciting plays of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a screen pass from Gragnano, which Mitchell caught and ran 62 
yards untouched down the left sideline. On the second, Mitchell took an inside 
handoff and broke out to the left sideline for a 44-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Compton of the Moore League held Mitchell to 24 yards in 15 carries in the 
first half. Mitchell finished with 106 yards in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
In other nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda 20, Sonora 10 -- The Wildcats raised their record to 4-0 in a game 
played at La Habra High School that was stopped before its conclusion because 
of a bench-clearing brawl. Officials halted the game with 1:08 left in the 
fourth quarter when the benches cleared after three consecutive personal fouls 
were called on both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Brea's victory was secured with 2:37 left in the fourth quarter when running 
back Brook Coop capped a 14-play, 72-yard scoring drive with a four-yard run. 
The drive took nearly 7 minutes 30 seconds of the quarter and gave the Wildcats 
a 20-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 14, Buena Park 6 -- Kenison PoChing rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown 
to pace the Rebels' victory at Spaulding Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (1-3) scored first after Corey Owens recovered a fumble by Savanna 
quarterback Carlos Robledo at the Savanna 38. The Coyotes scored on a 
nine-yuard pass from quarterback Mark Medellin to Juan Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 12, Cypress 9 -- Ernie Akau's nine-yard run early in the second quarter 
gave Anaheim (1-3) it's first victory of the season at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The drive began on Anaheim's 29, when Ishmel Lopez blocked Richard Parson's 
41-yard field-goal attempt. Robert Jones and Sammie Serna moved the ball to the 
Cypress 9 in eight plays. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (1-3) scored first midway in the first quarter on Sundance Smith's 
73-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 14, University 7 -- Foothill's Sean Saunders rushed 153 yards in 22 
carries and scored one touchdown, but the Knights still lost to University at 
Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill scored six minutes into the second quarter on a nine-yard run by 
Saunders, but University gained control in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 37, El Dorado 3 -- Fullerton rolled in a nonleague rout of host El 
Dorado at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton quarterback Rene Arias had a hand in four of the Indians' touchdowns. 
He scored on keepers of 34 and 16 yards in the first quarter, threw a 13-yard 
touchdown pass to tight end Glenn Eggert on a broken play in the third, then 
capped off Fullerton's scoring with a 14-yard touchdown dash in the fourth.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S RALLY STUNS EL MODENA, 22-21 
</P>

<P>
Fountain Valley High School played a miserable first half Thursday. The Barons' 
third quarter was nothing to brag about either. 
</P>
<P>
But, oh, that fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Barons scored two touchdowns in the final seven minutes to beat El Modena, 
22-21, in a nonleague game in front of 1,000 at El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena was still in control of the game late in the fourth quarter, leading, 
21-14. However, Fountain Valley's Chris Clark recovered a fumble by Tom Mazzone 
to give the Barons one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Willy Puga, who completed 24 of 34 passes for 281 yards, drove the 
Barons 61 yards in the final 2 minutes 50 seconds. He connected with Doug 
Weaver six times on the drive, including a three-yard touchdown pass with 1:30 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver, who had 14 receptions for 199 yards, then caught a two-point conversion 
pass to give the Barons a 22-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (2-2) trailed, 21-0, midway through the third quarter before 
finding its offense. True, that offense consisted mainly of Puga and Weaver. 
But that was just enough. 
</P>
<P>
Puga, who had been harassed most of the evening by El Modena's defense, found 
his touch in the fourth quarter. He completed 12 of his last 13 passes for 152 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Puga, who threw three interceptions, and Weaver hooked up for a 20 yards 
touchdown late in the third quarter. Sean Mahoney's two-point conversion cut 
the El Modena lead to 21-8. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena (1-3) had Fountain Valley faced a fourth-and-14 situation on its 34 
with seven minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Puga found Weaver crossing over the middle at midfield. Weaver cut upfield, 
knifing between two defensive backs, for a 66-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards built their lead mainly through the efforts of quarterback Adam 
Garcia. He rushed for 141 yards, including a 61-yard touchdown run. Garcia also 
threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Ron Murietta.

Scenes from a recent El Toro High School football practice: 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rob Johnson makes his way to the line of scrimmage. He bends under 
center, hollers out a series of numbers and suddenly finds the ball in his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Back he goes, rolling to his right, scanning downfield for an open receiver. He 
plants his feet after a few yards and throws the ball with the full power of 
his 6-foot-4, 190-pound frame behind it. 
</P>
<P>
In a moment, Johnson is gone, sprinting out to his position as wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom steps to the line, screams out another set of 
numbers and finds the ball in his hands. He drops back swiftly, plants his 
6-foot-2, 195-pound physique and throws a strike to a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
To a casual observer it's a little confusing. Who is the starting quarterback 
here anyway? 
</P>
<P>
It's not the least bit confusing to El Toro Coach Bob Johnson or to either 
player. Rob Johnson, a junior, is the coach's son and the team's starting 
receiver and backup quarterback. Stenstrom, a senior, is the starting 
quarterback for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be the starter and Johnson will be his receiver when the Chargers play 
Tustin in a nonleague game at 7:30 tonight at Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's not the top quarterback (in the county), he's in the top three," Bob 
Johnson said. "There are other good quarterbacks, but my favorite one is 
Steve." 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom has completed 67.5% of his passes for 420 yards and five touchdowns 
in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, the plan is for Johnson to take over as quarterback. That's a 
natural step because Rob is the younger brother of Bret Johnson, who was a 
three-year starter at El Toro and now is the starting quarterback at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Rob would start for just about everybody else in the county," Bob 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Two great quarterbacks, both proteges of Bret Johnson, but one starting 
position. What's a coach to do? 
</P>
<P>
It really wasn't a difficult decision. Stenstrom passed for 1,600 yards and 14 
touchdowns in his junior season and Johnson wanted him as his starter again. 
</P>
<P>
The coach also decided to try Rob at wide receiver to take advantage of his 
size and skill. 
</P>
<P>
Better to have two standout quarterbacks on the field at once rather than have 
one playing and the other toting a clipboard on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have that depth," Bob Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro has had standout quarterbacks and receivers in the past, but never a 
standout quarterback who also is an impressive receiver. Johnson is both. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had never played a down at receiver before this season. He always had 
been a quarterback. Nevertheless, he said, it wasn't difficult to learn the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew all the routes, so it was easy," he said. And he has become quite 
proficient at catching passes. He's the team's leading receiver with 10 
receptions for 185 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really paying the price at wide receiver, but that's OK," Bob Johnson 
said. "He's a fish out of water out there. (But) he's making the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson doesn't seem to mind being a receiver while waiting to be the starting 
quarterback. He's taking it as a challenge and a learning experience. He's not 
one to get flustered anyway, says his mother, Debbie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"He flies by the seat of his pants and hopes it all falls into place," she 
said. "Rob's so much his own person." 
</P>
<P>
He and Bret are a study in contrasts. Rob is carefree and at ease, quick to 
make a joke with a stranger. Rob also is taller by four inches. 
</P>
<P>
But both are workaholics, says Bob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought nobody could work harder than Bret, but Rob does," Bob Johnson said. 
"And he's got great size to go with it (his work ethic)." 
</P>
<P>
He also has a big choice facing him before his graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Football? Basketball? Baseball? 
</P>
<P>
Rob plays all three sports at El Toro and excels in each. He averaged 17.2 
points a game for the Charger basketball team last season. As a pitcher on the 
baseball team, he had an 8-3 record with a 2.96 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson says he's not particularly interested in distancing himself from 
his brother's accomplishments, nor does he claim to be bothered by the fact 
that he'll always be known as Bret Johnson's little brother. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll always be like that and I don't care," Rob said. "I'm proud to be Bret's 
little brother." 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom spent his sophomore season watching Bret Johnson closer than any 
opposing defender, maybe even closer than Rob. He watched and learned, waiting 
for a chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bret) had so much poise and confidence," Stenstrom said. "He was the leader 
of the team. He was such a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom never would have had a chance to play understudy to Johnson had his 
family not moved from Plano, Tex., after his freshman year. And he certainly 
would not have had a chance to throw the ball the way the Chargers throw. 
</P>
<P>
"In Texas, you had to be a real speedster because everybody runs the option," 
Stenstrom said. "I had the strongest arm on the team." 
</P>
<P>
And that didn't count for much. Stenstrom was the freshman team's "throwing" 
quarterback. He played only when the team needed a lot of yards and didn't have 
much time to gain them. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to El Toro was the best thing that could have happened to Stenstrom's 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real lucky," he said. And last year, after a season of observing Bret 
Johnson, Stenstrom took over as the Charger quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's the teacher and another Johnson is the pupil. It makes for an 
effective passing combination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both in the same frame of mind," Stenstrom said. "He (Rob) knows how to 
make the same reads and find the open spots." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rob Johnson: "We both pretty much know what's going to happen at the same 
time. We have an advantage that way." 
</P>
<P>
At El Toro, Stenstrom and Johnson have proven that two quarterbacks are better 
than one, even if one is playing wide receiver.

CHAVEZ WINS UNANIMOUS DECISION AT IRVINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Ernie Chavez built a big early lead while winning a unanimous decision over 
Bobby Chinungu Thursday in front of 1,008 at the Irvine Marriott's monthly 
boxing program. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez a left-handed welterweight from Santa Ana, used a quick right jab to 
keep Chinungu of Zambia away for much of the bout. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez (7-0) finally tired in the eighth round and Chinungu (12-1) landed a 
series of punches that staggered Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez stayed on his toes and danced away for much of the ninth and the early 
part of the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
He again became the aggressor in the final minute of the fight, pinning 
Chinungu on the ropes with a powerful combination as the bell sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez won 96-95, 97-93, 97-93, on the judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll see many fights like that," Chavez said. "He was really 
tough. My jab just worked fantastic, but he kept throwing punches with 
abundance and that kept me off guard." STEVE KRESAL

MANAGEMENT GROUP WEIGHS GRADCO SYSTEMS BUYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith B. Stewart, chairman and founder of Gradco Systems, said Thursday he is 
leading a management group that is considering purchasing the Irvine-based 
manufacturer of paper-handling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement released late Thursday, Stewart said he "is actively 
pursuing a possible management-led leveraged buyout of the company." The group 
has not yet made a formal proposal to Gradco's board of directors, the 
statement said, and "there can be no assurance any transaction will occur." 
</P>
<P>
Gradco officials said the company disclosed the possible buyout after heavy 
trading Thursday in the company's stock on the over-the-counter market. 
Gradco's stock jumped $1.125 per share to $17.50, with more than 630,000 shares 
trading hands, about five times the company's normal daily volume. 
</P>
<P>
"We just felt that the activity (in the stock) warranted some sort of news 
release so we could inform the public at large," said Newton H. Lee, Gradco's 
corporate secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was unavailable for comment late Thursday. Lee, who is part of the 
management group, declined to comment on other aspects of the buyout plan. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco, once dubbed by a Wall Street analyst as the "unsung hero of the office 
automation industry," is the world's largest supplier of collating and sorting 
products for office copiers and printers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the U.S. and foreign patents it holds on its paper-sorter 
technology, Gradco has garnered about 70% of the sorter market, and sorters 
account for about two-thirds of Gradco's sales. 
</P>
<P>
The company makes sorters for every major domestic and foreign copier 
manufacturer -- names such as International Business Machines, Xerox, Canon and 
Ricoh. Despite its commanding hold on its market, the Gradco name is not as 
well known to the public because its products are sold under its customers' 
names. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco entered the computer printer market in 1987 by acquiring a New Jersey 
manufacturer of automatic paper feeders. More recently, Gradco has been 
developing paper-handling products for the facsimile transmission market. 
</P>
<P>
The company, riding the coattails of dynamic growth in the copier and printer 
market, has seen its sales double in the past two years, from $55 million in 
fiscal 1987 to $115 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco had record earnings of $5.6 million for the 1989 fiscal year ended March 
31, up 39% from $4.1 million in 1988. Revenue rose 27% to $115.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, the firm recently has found the going more difficult. Earnings dipped 
18% to $960,000 and revenue declined 6% to $25.1 million for the first quarter 
ended June 30 compared to the same period in 1988. The company attributed the 
lower financial results to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the sale of 
its contract manufacturing unit earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a native of Zimbabwe, founded Gradco in 1978. He owns 12% of the 
company's common stock, with other Gradco management owning an additional 4%, 
Gradco's Lee said. One of Gradco's biggest Japanese customers, C. Itoh, owns 9% 
of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco first sold stock to the public in June, 1983, at $18 per share. Its 
shares sold for as little as $5 after the October, 1987, stock market crash, 
but have recovered in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco has about 300 employees, mostly in Irvine.

JURY IS OUT ON OWNERS OF ORANGE-BASED THRIFT; 
</P>
<P>
RAMONA S&amp;L CHIEFS FACE 30 CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first criminal trial involving owners of a failed Southern California 
thrift went to the jury Thursday after 11 weeks of testimony in U.S. District 
Court that encompassed 35 witnesses and 350 exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Molinaro, 48, and Donald P. Mangano Sr., 52, former owners of Ramona 
Savings &amp; Loan in Orange, each face more than 30 charges, including bank 
fraud and conspiracy, in the real estate transactions that led to the thrift's 
collapse in September, 1986. The S&amp;L subsequently needed a $65.5-million 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The jury received instructions late Thursday from District Judge David V. 
Kenyon and was scheduled to begin deliberations today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complicated Transactions 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution and defense attorneys spent much of the 11 weeks leading jurors 
through the complicated transaction surrounding the sale of the Cherokee 
Village condominium project in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano and Molinaro bought Ramona in April, 1984, and spent about $25 million, 
or a quarter of the thrift's assets, building Cherokee Village. Neither man had 
much banking experience -- Mangano was a real estate salesman and Molinaro was 
a former carpet salesman. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Village was a flop -- just seven of the building's 180 units had been 
sold by the summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the two devised a clever scam to sell Ramona 
before the thrift and Cherokee Village went belly up. 
</P>
<P>
They set up several dummy corporations with the help of three outside 
investors, prosecutors said, then sold Cherokee Village to companies set up by 
those investors to get the condominium project off Ramona's books. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona booked a $4-million profit on the deal, and Mangano then bought the 
stock in the corporations, becoming the new owner of Cherokee Village. Molinaro 
took a $2-million dividend about this time, which the prosecution alleged was 
based on the profit it said was phony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appealing to Buyer 
</P>
<P>
The federal government alleged that the sale took place to make Ramona look 
appealing to a potential buyer and ward off regulators from taking over the 
ailing thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution said the purpose of the three borrowers was to deceive the 
regulators of the true owner," said Gerald V. Scotti, Molinaro's attorney. "But 
the records are so clear that even a Boy Scout could figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein strongly disagreed in his 
rebuttal, saying even some of the defense's witnesses did not understand the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
During his closing arguments Thursday, Scotti placed some of the blame for 
Ramona's collapse on federal regulators. During the mid-1980s many thrifts were 
in bad shape, so government officials encouraged them to invest much of their 
assets in real estate to generate more money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a war between the regulators and the owners," Scotti said. "Now they're 
denying they (the regulators) had anything to do with it (the S&amp;L crisis). 
Everybody just became a crook at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
The defense has said the three corporations were set up to protect Mangano's 
credit-worthiness in the event of Cherokee Village's failure and to fulfill tax 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution said outside investors were used to mislead regulators into 
believing that Ramona had made a legitimate sale. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason at all to use these three people except to perpetrate the 
fraud," Zipperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
After the trial closed, Mangano said the three corporations are a routine 
business practice and that he is innocent of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's solely in the hands of the jury," he said. "I do not believe at this 
moment that I am guilty of any crime, nor did I when I entered into any 
transaction." 
</P>
<P>
But Zipperstein told jurors that Molinaro and Mangano set out on purpose to 
loot the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramona was a small, mom-and-pop savings and loan in Fillmore, Calif.," he told 
jurors. "Two branches. It had been in business for 57 years. Then came the 
defendants. Molinaro and Mangano. In just over two years, they drove Ramona to 
ruins. They pilfered its assets." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Molinaro faces up to 165 years in prison and $8.3 million in 
fines; Mangano could receive a 155-year sentence and $7.8 million in fines.

COUNTY'S LARGEST ARCHITECTURAL FIRM TO MERGE WITH SACRAMENTO COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange-based Leason Pomeroy Associates, the largest architectural firm in 
Orange County, is merging with Foothill Design Group in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage isn't surprising: Lynn S. Pomeroy, brother of Leason Pomeroy, was 
one of the founders of Foothill in 1976. Leason Pomeroy already does a lot of 
business in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
For Lynn Pomeroy, the choice was one of growing internally or merging with 
another firm to compete with the big, outside firms now doing business in 
Sacramento, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Leason Pomeroy Associates -- corporate name: LPA Inc. -- was founded in 1965 
and says with 160 architects it's the fourth-largest architects' firm based in 
California. Foothill has 35 architects.

ROBINSON MANAGING JUST FINE; 
</P>
<P>
HE DOESN'T WANT SATISFACTION, HE WANTS ORIOLES TO WIN AL EAST 
</P>

<P>
Vindication? Redemption? 
</P>
<P>
Frank Robinson says no, that he had nothing to prove as a manager. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, of course. Satisfaction, he says, in the sense that his young and 
anonymous Baltimore Orioles have given him more effort than any team he has 
ever been associated with, that he has enjoyed this season more than any other 
and that he continues to evolve and mature as man and manager, in control of 
himself more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what people said because I heard it," Robinson said, sitting in the 
dugout at Milwaukee's County Stadium the other day. "They said I was the wrong 
person to manage this team. They said I couldn't handle young players, that I'd 
screw it up. I wonder what they are saying now?" 
</P>
<P>
Many are saying that Robinson should be the American League's manager of the 
year, and if that doesn't erase the memories of his firings in Cleveland and 
San Francisco, if that doesn't change the view that he was too combative, 
arrogant and short-tempered ever to succeed in managing players with only a 
fraction of his Hall of Fame talent, if that doesn't amount to vindication, 
it's definitely satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Many are also saying that Robinson and his Orioles, losers of 107 games last 
season, are assured of a satisfying season no matter what happens in this final 
weekend, this showdown series for the Eastern Division title with the Toronto 
Blue Jays at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been suggesting for two or three months now that it doesn't matter 
if we don't win, that we've had a tremendous year as it is, but I don't agree," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a championship within our grasp. Let's go for it. Let's finish it off. 
</P>
<P>
"We've definitely exceeded our expectations, but I've told the players that if 
we fall on our face the last week, if we quit and say we've accomplished 
enough, that's what people will remember and the only thing we'll remember. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we give 100% and fall short, we have nothing to be ashamed of. We can 
tell ourselves then that the other team was simply better. We've taken that 
approach all season or we wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
Here is one game behind the Blue Jays at the start of the season-ending 
three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Here is being assured of a 31-game improvement over last year's 54-107 record, 
the fifth-biggest jump ever. 
</P>
<P>
Here is also being assured of two major league records: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spending the most days in first place the year after finishing last, 116. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Holding undisputed first place later than any team that finished last the 
year before, Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
And the comparatively no-name Orioles have done it with one of the youngest 
rosters ever. Baseball's masked marvels? 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's right, and it's worked to our advantage," former Dodger Brian 
Holton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The less people know about us, the better it is. There's no pressure because 
we have nothing to lose. People have been waiting for us to fall on our face 
all year." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 players who have performed for the Orioles in 1989, 22 began the year 
with two years or fewer of major league experience, 19 made their Oriole 
debuts, and 13 are rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 players who were on the roster in August, 17 spent part of last 
season in triple-A, and the amazing relief ace, Gregg Olson, was coming off 
only a partial year in double-A after signing out of Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows any of our players except for (Cal) Ripken, (Jeff) Ballard, 
Olson, (Mickey) Tettleton and (Phil) Bradley, and they probably knew only 
Ripken and Bradley before the season started," Holton said. "But we've proven 
to ourselves we can play, if not to anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The decay of the Eastern Division contributed to the Orioles' ability to come 
back so far so fast, but it remains a remarkable turnaround, and Robinson's 
impact on it should not be diminished, General Manager Roland Hemond said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous, incomparable," Hemond gushed. "I mean, Frank isn't one to boast, so 
I know he's never going to say he had as much to do with this as the players, 
coaches or front office have, but I'll say it for him. I believe this has been 
one of the best managing jobs I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Hemond cited Robinson's spring preparations, his handling of a pitching staff 
that, with only two reliable starters, Ballard and Bob Milacki, has produced 49 
wins or saves by rookies and the patience and support necessary to keep a young 
club on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made fewer errors than any team in the league," Hemond said. "A young 
team has played like a veteran team. 
</P>
<P>
"The other night in Milwaukee, some scouts came over to compliment me on how 
well the players work before a game. They prepare well and perform well. 
</P>
<P>
"They personify Frank's pride and competitiveness. They play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson played with such intensity that teammates feared him and opponents 
hated him. He is fourth on the all-time home run list and the only man ever to 
win most-valuable-player awards in both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Pride and competitiveness may have been trademarks, but in some ways, some 
believe, they were detrimental to his managerial success. 
</P>
<P>
Both at Cleveland, where he became baseball's first black manager in 1975, and 
San Francisco, his tactical skills weren't the issue. He had problems dealing 
with anyone less talented and less intense, which was just about everyone. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that when it came to managing a clubhouse of individuals, 
dealing with players of varying ability, potential and motivation, he often 
resorted to intimidation and manipulation. He would yell and attempt to 
embarrass. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Justice, who covers the Orioles for the Washington Post, often attempts 
to have Robinson demonstrate the way he was for the younger Baltimore writers. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Robinson will say. "I don't want to make 'em cry." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the dugout in Milwaukee, Robinson said: "You grow, you mature, you 
adjust. I've benefited from my experiences and understand things differently 
than I did 15 or 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That second time I was fired I finally got a different perspective of myself. 
I realized maybe I was wrong more than I was right." 
</P>
<P>
He realized there was a need to be more patient, more communicative. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I've mellowed out, that I'm, like, laid back now, that I don't have 
the same fire and determination, but it's just that I'm able to control it 
better," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't like losing, but I'm able to live with it now. I'm able to look 
at a loss, analyze the reasons for it, and let it go. I used to take losing 
personally. I'd take it home with me and bring it back the next day, and I'd 
finally let it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have those outbursts anymore. If I screamed and hollered with these 
kids, I'd lose them. I have to teach here. I've had to stay on an even keel." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson maintained that equilibrium even when the Orioles went 2-12 on a trip 
in late July. The players were still giving the effort, so Robinson didn't get 
upset, didn't holler. Instead, he called in veterans such as Ripken and Bradley 
and quietly asked for suggestions as to how to snap the slump. 
</P>
<P>
There are other snapshots of the restrained Robinson: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When outfielder Brady Anderson irritated Robinson in April by failing to 
run out a pop fly, he was replaced between innings without a word said until 
Robinson held a team meeting after the game. Point made. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Olson encountered control problems during a tense situation in a 
recent game, Robinson came out, put an arm on his shoulder, said, "Hey, I've 
got enough gray hairs." That was it. Robinson left, leaving his 22-year-old 
reliever relaxed and laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Keith Moreland recently lost his job as designated hitter to Tettleton 
and angrily reacted by saying he didn't expect to get another at-bat this 
season and would retire when it ends, he was summoned to Robinson's office and 
told selfish disruptions would not be tolerated and he could retire immediately 
if he chose. Moreland apologized and stayed. 
</P>
<P>
Before games now, even during the final week of this stumbling division race, 
Robinson, 54, plays cards with players in the clubhouse and exchanges needles 
during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
His loudest outburst of an unlikely season wasn't directed at a player but at a 
group of American League umpires, whom he accused of unfairly preventing him 
from defending his team. Even for that he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank played like a machine," coach Tom McCraw said. "He realized every ounce 
of his potential. He's come to accept the fact -- if not understand -- that 
it's a different era and not every player is going to give him 100% all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
There's more to Robinson's success with the Orioles than maturity and 
acceptance, however. Insecurity is no longer a problem. Unlike at Cleveland and 
San Francisco, he was allowed to select his entire coaching staff and has the 
ear and support of the front office. 
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, where he led a team of only modest talent to an 81-78 record in 
his second season, General Manager Phil Seghi would pound the table in his 
executive box with such force when he disagreed with a managerial move that 
Robinson could hear him in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"How would you like that?" Robinson asked. 
</P>
<P>
Fired by the Indians in 1977 and hired by the Giants in 1981, Robinson missed 
winning the title in the National League West by two games in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no rapport between Robinson and General Manager Tom Haller, and 
at the end of that season, Haller traded second baseman Joe Morgan and allowed 
first baseman Reggie Smith to leave as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Without what Robinson called the heart of his club, the Giants didn't come 
close in either '83 or '84, after which Robinson was fired. He returned to the 
Orioles as a coach in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The late owner, Edward Bennett Williams, appointed Robinson as a special 
assistant to Hemond, the new general manager, after the 1987 season, and 
subsequently asked Robinson to replace Cal Ripken Sr. as manager after the 
Orioles opened last year 0-6 on their way to 0-21. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Robinson, a successful Los Angeles real estate agent, told her husband 
he would be crazy to take the job, that the obviously bad team would damage his 
reputation, but Robinson didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Williams (then dying of cancer) wanted me to do it and I felt an 
obligation to him and to an organization that had done so much for my career," 
Robinson said. "I knew it would be a difficult year, but I knew it was a much 
better situation than I had in either Cleveland or San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Said McCraw, who has coached under Robinson in all three locales: 
</P>
<P>
"I think (front office) people were intimidated by Frank. Here was an 
intelligent black man who knew how to put a ballclub together and was a little 
arrogant along with it. 
</P>
<P>
"This was new to baseball people and they resented it, but I'm sure Frank feels 
he could have done (in Cleveland and San Francisco) what he has done here if 
given the support and talent." 
</P>
<P>
Support? 
</P>
<P>
Robinson ended '88 believing that certain things needed to be changed and urged 
the trading of Eddie Murray, which Hemond supported. 
</P>
<P>
It was Robinson, as well, who wanted the inexperienced Olson and comparably 
inexperienced Steve Finley, an acrobatic outfielder, retained after spring 
training, and again he was supported. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to everyone pulling in the same direction," Robinson said. "I've 
been given that here and it's made it easier." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hemond: "Frank's goal was to improve the speed and defense, and we've 
tried to give him the type of players he wanted. He has a great concept about 
the game in entirety. I wasn't concerned when we turned a young club over to 
him. I felt he had benefited from his experiences and was ready for whatever 
type club he was given." 
</P>
<P>
For Holton, the move from Los Angeles to Baltimore has been more than culture 
shock. He said he has gone from the roller-coaster emotions of Tom Lasorda to 
the hands-off style of Robinson and isn't sure he's adjusted yet. 
</P>
<P>
"No hugs and sometimes not even handshakes," Holton said of Robinson. "He kind 
of just sits there and you don't know what he's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's kept everything on an even keel and I think his approach has been 
good for this club. He has good know-how as to when to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of times we could have folded, but he didn't let it happen. 
He's kept everyone's confidence up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "The satisfaction is not in proving to some people I could 
manage. I never doubted that. The satisfaction is in the attitude of the 
players. There hasn't been one confrontation. There hasn't been one player ask 
me why I did this or that, and I've never had that before. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been on a team with a better attitude. I've never had more fun. I 
don't know how some people gauge managers, but I've always felt I did as much 
as I could with the talent we had in Cleveland and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, the thing that separates managers is the ability of the players and 
this is the first time I've had 24 players giving the effort and doing the 
little things necessary to win." 
</P>
<P>
Having finally reached that stage, Robinson may return to the front office and 
quit managing next year, he said, citing the tedium of the road and some 
uncertainty as to whether he wants to make the three- or four-year commitment 
that a team in development deserves. 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation, as well, that Robinson believes his Orioles did a lot of 
overachieving this year and may not be ready to maintain a contending level. 
</P>
<P>
Said McCraw: "Frank was a winner as a player. By his nature he doesn't give up 
anything until he's won, and I don't believe he'll give this up until he's 
won." 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, of course, Robinson might have accomplished that.

HE DOESN'T KNOW ALL, BUT BO KNOWS BO; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR FOR JACKSON, AFTER A REST, TO CHANGE SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Yo, Bo, smile," said a young fan aiming a camera at Bo Jackson as the Kansas 
City Royals' outfielder emerged from the dugout before a game at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd gathered as Jackson stepped into the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo knows batting practice," a fan shouted, mimicking the "Bo knows . . . " 
commercial as Jackson belted a pitch into the center-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
As Jackson, America's most celebrated two-sport star, ran into the outfield to 
throw, a crowd gathered along the left-field line. When he teased the fans, 
pretending that he was about to toss a ball into the stands, hundreds of arms 
rose as one to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
Bo knows, all right. He knows how to work a crowd. Although it was a 
meaningless game between teams out of the running at the end of the season, the 
fans had come to see him. There were banners saluting him, one of which read: 
"Bo Knows Ballet." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Bo may not know how to dance "Swan Lake," but Bo knows baseball . . . and 
football. 
</P>
<P>
In his life as a Royal this season, he has hit 32 homers, driven in 105 runs 
and stolen 26 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Is this Jackson's best baseball season? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Jackson said. "That's for you all to decide." 
</P>
<P>
And his life as a Raider? 
</P>
<P>
After baseball season ends this weekend, Jackson plans to take a week off 
before reporting for the rest of the National Football League season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take my usual time that I've taken off for the past 2 1/2 years," 
Jackson said. "I'm going to take a week and then I'll report." 
</P>
<P>
Is it difficult to make the transition from baseball to football? 
</P>
<P>
"Nope," Jackson said. "It's what I've been doing all of my life. So it's easy 
for me. Next question." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Mike Shanahan said he hoped Jackson would stop by Raider 
headquarters in El Segundo and pick up a playbook. So, did Jackson plan to 
visit the Raiders this trip? 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I?" Jackson said. "I'll deal with the Raiders when I get there." 
</P>
<P>
Has Jackson been following the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get up every morning and go get the paper to see what the Raiders have 
done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does he think he can help revive the slow-starting Raiders, who have lost two 
of three games? 
</P>
<P>
"One man don't make a team," Jackson said. "I'm just one of the guys on the 
team. Whatever I can do to help my team win, that's what I do. I don't try to 
go out and do more than I'm capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Although his TV commercials are for cross-training athletic shoes, Jackson said 
he doesn't train for football by lifting weights or doing extra running. 
</P>
<P>
"I stay in football shape by running during baseball," Jackson said. "I don't 
have time to work out, because I play every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get tired. There is nothing physical about sports, it's all mental. If 
you can handle it upstairs, the rest is easy. There is nothing physical about 
what we do. You put it in your mind and go out and do it. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first day (of football practice) my neck will be sore from the 
hitting. But after that it feels like I've been out there for the whole 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said it's no problem for him to play football without training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The other guys say they wish that they could miss that hot camp and come in 
and play," Jackson said. "I wouldn't say camp is a waste of time. The younger 
guys need it to see what the NFL is all about. But the older guys . . . don't." 
</P>
<P>
What does Bo think of Deion Sanders, who left the New York Yankees to play for 
the Atlanta Falcons? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't (think of Sanders)," Jackson said. "I have better things to do." 
</P>
<P>
Is Jackson a better baseball or football player now. "I never knew I was that 
bad," he said. "You get wiser after playing because you learn more about the 
games and you learn what the opponents are doing to try to stop you." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has been bothered by minor injuries this season. He has pulled muscles 
in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a tough summer," Royal trainer Mickey Cobb said. "He had some leg 
problems in the early summer and it's carried over to late summer, but he's 
getting along real good." 
</P>
<P>
So does playing football and baseball put too much stress on Jackson's body? 
</P>
<P>
"We only have one person to gauge it on and that's Bo," Cobb said. "He seems to 
enjoy (playing both games). But he may have an advantage because he doesn't 
have to go through training camp and his body has not received the wear and 
tear that football offers it. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose a person would wonder if he were in shape enough to play football. 
All summer long he does a lot of running, and I would think he's not in too bad 
a shape." 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Jackson is trying to save himself for football by 
curtailing his base-stealing. 
</P>
<P>
What say you, Bo? 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody told you a lie," Jackson said.

JIM MURRAY: HE PREFERS TO DECEIVE THE HITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If the San Francisco Giants get in the World Series -- and that looks like the 
way to bet -- the American League batters are not going to believe their good 
luck when they get a load of the pitches No. 48 is throwing up there. Batting 
practice stuff. Medium fastballs. Lobs. Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
The batter's eyes bug out. His heart leaps. He lunges into the pitch with a 
glad cry and gives it the full 360-degree home-run swing and waits confidently 
for it to clear the center-field fence so he can go into his home-run trot. 
</P>
<P>
Only, there's this dull thud! Like a watermelon falling off a moving truck. The 
ball lifts impotently in the air over second base or trickles harmlessly on the 
ground to the shortstop for a routine out. 
</P>
<P>
The batter comes back to the bench with his teeth clenched and saliva dripping 
down his chin. He hurls his helmet in disgust, smashes his bat on the top of 
the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't got a thing," he growls. "A nuthin' ball! I shoulda killed it!" 
</P>
<P>
And Rick Reuschel has done it again, gotten another batter lulled into thinking 
he was getting his pitch -- when he was really getting Reuschel's. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel has been getting big league batters out "without a thing" for 18 
years. It's his stock in trade. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel is almost unfair. Guys who win 211 big league games, who turn Hall of 
Fame hitters into pop-ups, should look the part. They should be whipcord-lean. 
Their fastball should bristle and hop. You look at Dwight Gooden from the 
batter's box and you know you've got trouble. You look at Rick Reuschel and you 
think you're going four for four. 
</P>
<P>
He looks more like an Irish cop or an operatic tenor than a National League 
pitcher. First of all, there's that ample girth. If he weren't so tall -- he's 
6-feet-3 -- he'd be considered roly-poly. He doesn't look particularly mean. He 
certainly doesn't look hungry. At 240 pounds, Reuschel hasn't often missed 
dinner. He would have to slim down to be considered rotund. 
</P>
<P>
He's not young. But at 39 last year, he won 19 games for the San Francisco 
Giants. This year, at 40, he has won 17. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't so much throw the ball as kind of shotput it. He has this 
deceptively lazy motion. But he gets rid of the ball so fast, he's the hardest 
pitcher to steal on in the league. 
</P>
<P>
He can throw the ball in the 90-m.p.h. range if he wants to. He doesn't always 
want to. He is like a guy living off the interest of his talent. Only 
occasionally does he dip into the capital. He's not a junk pitcher. He can put 
spin on the ball but he also can bust it by you. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives a clinic out there every time he pitches," acknowledges his manager, 
Roger Craig, a former pitcher himself. "He has the same arm motion whether he's 
throwing a 90-m.p.h. fastball or an 80-mile curveball. 
</P>
<P>
"He has three fastballs he throws with the same delivery -- one will be at 89 
m.p.h, the others 85 and 82. The hitters almost break their arms trying to hold 
up on their swings. When the game gets tight and there are men on base, other 
pitchers get faster. Rick gets slower." 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers call it location, the art of being able to throw a baseball exactly 
where they want it. Reuschel does not totally rely on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't try to hit the corners," he says. "I throw the ball down the middle of 
the plate, but I keep it down and sinking." 
</P>
<P>
He has started 514 big league games -- and completed 105 of them. Which is 
extraordinary for a pitcher who was considered so washed up eight years ago 
that he was cut loose by the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs and wound up 
pitching in Quad Cities and Columbus and Honolulu in what was perceived as the 
twilight of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel has had a longer twilight than Norway in June. He was a 20-game 
winner with the Cubs back in the days when they were less a team than a comedy 
routine. He won 18 another year. But when he got traded to the Yankees in 1981, 
he came up with a rotator cuff injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I had worn a hole in it," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Yankees cut him adrift. The Cubs, for whom he won 129 games, 
re-signed him in 1983, sent him to Class A Quad Cities, then they cut him 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, protesting his arm was as sound as ever, caught on with Pittsburgh. 
The Pirates sent him to Hawaii, where he proved it. 
</P>
<P>
He had some good years at Pittsburgh, considering the quality of the team -- 
last place two years, next-to-last the other. He had an earned-run-average of 
2.27, which is Cy Young Award stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the Giants traded for him in the middle of a pennant race in 1987, 
he was 38 and Giant fans were less than thrilled. He promptly threw three 
two-hitters in the title run that September. He walked one or none in 24 games 
that season. He won five games in the month he was with the Giants and played a 
big part in their stretch drive to the playoffs that year. 
</P>
<P>
He has played a big part this year. He has an earned-run average of 2.64, a 
record of 17-7. He has won more games, pitched more innings and kept the team 
in the pennant race more than anyone else on the staff. He has won 41 games for 
the Giants in the little over two years he's been with them. 
</P>
<P>
He does it all with stuff that looks as easy to hit as Leon Spinks but is about 
as easy to hit as a lottery. He admits it's his sheep's-clothing fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to see those guys coming up to see how far they can hit it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the surprised looks on their faces when they make contact and not much 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my weapon," Reuschel agrees. "What looks like the pitch of your dreams 
turns out to be a dirty trick." 
</P>
<P>
Says Craig: "He throws them a dead fish." 
</P>
<P>
It's like a woman on stage who looks beautiful and desirable but, when she gets 
closer, you notice she's wearing a wig, corset, store teeth and too much rouge. 
And you wonder what you ever saw in her.

AFTER A SHAKY START, KONTOS' FUTURE BRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Kontos prefers a very vague version of how his hockey career hit the 
skids. 
</P>
<P>
The story of his career is crystal clear at the beginning, when he is a 
first-round draft pick of the New York Rangers and plays 44 games with them as 
an 18-year-old rookie. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a great story, rich in detail, when it picks up in the spring of 1989, 
with the Kings sending him a National Hockey League contract on the fax machine 
to the Beaver Lumber Yard in Midland, Canada, and his father pounding on his 
door in Waubashene in the wee hours of the morning to deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos signs the contract, transmits it back just 30 minutes before the signing 
deadline, then goes on to score nine goals in the playoffs. Now he's trying to 
win a spot on the Kings' roster for good and for real. Maybe even on Wayne 
Gretzky's left wing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted a full season in the NHL to prove what kind of numbers I 
could put up," Kontos was saying at Kings' training camp. "I just want the 
chance to contribute in the NHL, and I've never felt better about an 
approaching season." 
</P>
<P>
A great beginning. Potential for a great ending. But in between . . . 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began when, after just six games at the start of the 1983-84 
season, the Rangers sent him down to their Central Hockey League club at Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't like to talk about those days. He'd like to have them forgotten. No 
sense in bringing up all that dirt now that he has a chance for a fresh start, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
Asked about those times, Kontos says: "That was a long time ago. That has 
nothing to do with now." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about some of the crazy times when the Tulsa team was practicing at a 
mall, using soccer balls instead of pucks, Kontos says: "I don't know about 
that. That was while I was away." 
</P>
<P>
There is one problem, though, with trying to keep the past a secret from the 
new team. One very big problem. 
</P>
<P>
The coach of the Tulsa team at the time in question was Tom Webster, now the 
coach of the Kings. It does not come as news to Webster that Kontos refused to 
report to Tulsa. That he took his skates and went home. That he enrolled in a 
local university and threatened to leave hockey forever, rather than play in 
the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Will that hurt Kontos' chances with the Kings? Will that count as a minus when 
Webster makes his cuts early next week? Did it influence whether Kontos' name 
was among the protected 18 players on the list Webster and General Manager 
Rogie Vachon had to turn in Thursday night in advance of the Monday waiver 
draft? 
</P>
<P>
"Webster? He won't hold that against me," Kontos said. "First of all, he's not 
like that. But the biggest thing is, he saw me at 18. I'm 25 now. I've changed 
a lot. My attitude now is different. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Rangers sent me to the minors and I sat out until Christmas, I was a 
wide-eyed kid who thought I was invincible. I didn't know how to accept it, so 
I quit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, it hurt my career. But I look back and I'm kind of glad it happened. 
If it had always been easy, I never would have had to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
It did seem easy when he was drafted so high and went right to the big leagues. 
Straight to New York. No wonder the setback was such a jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a few special people every few years make the transition from junior to 
pro or from college to pro right away," Kontos said. "But when it's handed to 
you, you just accept it as the way things should be. I wasn't prepared to 
handle what happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Kontos would handle it much differently now. 
</P>
<P>
"Time makes the mind grow stronger," he said. "I started at 18. It was laid out 
on a silver platter. It was just there and you accept it. Then one day, it's 
taken away and you don't know how to feel. You don't know if you're a failure 
or if they're wrong. You just don't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"For four or five years I was a journeyman, playing in different leagues, 
learning different coaches, different management philosophies. I'm a 
professional hockey player now. I understand the game and how it works. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have easily fallen to the wayside. I could easily have been forgotten 
when I finished (the 1988-89 season) in Switzerland. But the Kings gave me 
another chance, and I think I showed I could still do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kontos' agent offered him to every team in the league and came up empty until 
the Kings decided to take a last-minute chance on him. 
</P>
<P>
Kontos had one goal as he played with the Kings in a limited role at the end of 
the regular season but he became the Cinderella story of the playoffs as he 
worked on the power play with Wayne Gretzky and scored nine goals in 11 playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Now the question is: Was it a fluke? Did Kontos just have a magical spree 
there, during the playoffs, when he said, "It's one of those strong feelings 
you get that everything's coming your way. I don't know if I'm blessed or lucky 
or talented or what." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Kontos is arguing for talent. Sure he got those goals on tips 
and deflections and rebounds as he camped in the crease, but that was where he 
was supposed to be and that was what he was supposed to be doing. It was no 
accident. It's his specialty. He was right where Gretkzy wanted him, and he was 
putting those pucks in the net. 
</P>
<P>
"If it happened once or twice, one shift or one period, we might have to say I 
got lucky," Kontos said. "But I've had two stints with the Kings now, and I 
held my own both times." 
</P>
<P>
Kontos was with the Kings for six games in February of 1988, when he was traded 
to Los Angeles from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kings sent him down to New Haven in 1988, he reported as ordered. No 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a different person now," Kontos said. "You can't judge me now on what I 
did when I was an 18-year-old kid. I definitely don't have an attitude problem 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys blossom a little later."

ECKERSLEY DOESN'T LET STEWART DOWN IN A'S 5-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last two times Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland Athletics tried to save a 
win for Dave Stewart, he blew the lead and wound up having to save himself. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley once again was called on to protect a victory for Stewart Thursday 
and shut the door on the Texas Rangers for his 33rd save as the A's scored a 
5-3 win at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out of the shower and heard the score was 5-3," said Stewart (21-9), 
who pitched five innings and left with Oakland ahead, 5-0. "I said, 'Oh no! 
What happened?' " 
</P>
<P>
Stewart gave up four hits before being relieved in the sixth by Todd Burns, who 
pitched two innings and gave way to Matt Young. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley was called on after Young, who pitched a scoreless eighth inning, 
failed to retire a batter in the ninth and Texas scored three times. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Sierra started the inning for Texas with his 29th homer and got his 
club-record 119th run batted in. Pete Incaviglia walked, Mike Stanley tripled 
and Eckersley relieved. Scott Coolbaugh hit a sacrifice fly for the final run 
before Eckersley retired the side. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who will start next Tuesday night in Oakland when the A's open the 
playoffs against either Baltimore or Toronto, matched his career high in 
victories. His 62 wins over the last three seasons are the most by any pitcher 
in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker hit his 22nd homer and singled home a run for the A's, giving him 
97 RBIs. The second-inning homer came off Texas starter Brad Arnsberg (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
Boston 12, Milwaukee 6 -- Nick Esasky hit his 30th homer and Rick Cerone added 
a two-run shot at Boston as the Red Sox took a one-game lead over the Brewers 
in the opening game of their series to determine third place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Mike Boddicker (15-11) allowed nine hits, including a two-run homer by 
Robin Yount, and four runs in five innings. His 15 victories are the most since 
he won 20 games for Baltimore in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox pounded Milwaukee starter Don August (12-12) for seven runs on five 
hits and four walks in less than three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 6, Cleveland 2 -- Pinch-hitter Alvin Davis greeted Indian reliever 
Jesse Orosco with a tiebreaking two-run double in the eighth inning, and Dave 
Valle also doubled home two runs as the Mariners came from behind to win at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman (8-10) pitched a six-hitter for his sixth complete game but fell 
behind, 2-0, when he allowed home runs to Cleveland's Joel Skinner and Joe 
Carter, his 35th.

BLYLEVEN ACCEPTS CHALLENGE ONE LAST TIME; 
</P>
<P>
HE SHUTS OUT ROYALS, 2-0, AND HALTS YET ANOTHER ANGEL LOSING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There will be no more Angel losing streaks for Bert Blyleven to stop in 1989, 
mainly because he has run out of starts and the Angels are running out of 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But for old times' sake Thursday night, the Angels made one final request of 
the Bearded One and sent out one final cry for help. 
</P>
<P>
Needed: An end to a six-game skid that threatened to obliterate all the good 
done in Anaheim the previous 5 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
What We Can Give You: Two runs in nine innings against journeyman pitcher Larry 
McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
Did Blyleven accept his assignment? 
</P>
<P>
Does Angels 2, Royals 0 ring a bell? 
</P>
<P>
Having already snapped Angel slumps of five and seven games, along with an 
assortment of two- and three-game losing streaks, Blyleven provided deliverance 
again -- this time with no pennant at stake, only Angel pride. 
</P>
<P>
And to Angel Manager Doug Rader, that was deliverance enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very important to me -- and it should be to everyone else 
associated with this organization -- that we finish strongly," Rader said. "The 
taste last year left in the mouths of everyone connected with our club . . . 
the thought of that happening again would almost ruin the whole year, as far as 
I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, before Rader and Blyleven arrived on the scene, the Angels careened 
through 12 losses in their final 12 games, setting a franchise record for most 
consecutive defeats and raising legitimate questions about team character and 
fortitude and heart. 
</P>
<P>
The '89 Angels seemed headed for a similar plunge after losing four games in 
Cleveland before returning home to lose two more to Kansas City. Entering 
Thursday night's game, the Angels had slipped all the way to third in the 
American League West -- seven games behind first-place Oakland and two games 
behind the second-place Royals. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had been waiting a week to become the fifth team to win 90 games 
this season and were starting to wonder if No. 90 was ever going to come. 
</P>
<P>
After failing in their first six chances to move beyond 89 victories, the 
Angels turned the ball over to Blyleven and Blyleven turned in his fifth 
shutout of the season at a most opportune time. 
</P>
<P>
The only run he needed came in the first inning, via two singles and a bunt. 
Devon White led off with a single, was sacrificed to second base by Mark 
McLemore and was driven home by Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
He got a second run when Brian Downing delivered his 14th home run of the 
season in the bottom of the eighth. Nice, but on this night, with the way 
Blyleven was pitching, it was needless surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven pitched a seven-hitter for his eighth complete game of the year, tying 
him for fourth in the American League with Oakland's Dave Stewart, Milwaukee's 
Chris Bosio and Kansas City's Mark Gubicza. His five shutouts lead the American 
League. His 17 victories lead the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
And his .773 winning percentage -- Blyleven is 17-5 overall -- established a 
new Angel single-season record among starting pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, this: With 44 walks in 241 1/3 innings, Blyleven also set another 
record among Angel pitchers with 200 or more innings in a season, eclipsing 
Frank Tanana's old mark of 45 walks in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"What is he, 17-5 with less than 50 walks in 240-some odd innings?" Rader said, 
shaking his head. "What's his ERA?" 
</P>
<P>
Rader was told it was 2.73 -- Blyleven's lowest since the 2.72 mark he had in 
Texas in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"And Texas in '77 was the epitome of a pitcher's ballpark," Rader added, "so 
that makes this year even more noteworthy." 
</P>
<P>
Rader was particularly impressed with Blyleven's work in the eighth inning, 
with Kevin Seitzer on second base after a leadoff single and right fielder 
Dante Bichette's fielding error. 
</P>
<P>
Still working with a 1-0 lead, Blyleven struck out Matt Winters for the first 
out. Then, following a discussion with pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, 
Blyleven also struck out George Brett before retiring Bo Jackson on a ground 
ball to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't put into words what Bert Blyleven has meant to me and to everybody 
associated with this ballclub," Rader said. "I don't know how to express 
myself, the gratitude and the sense of accomplishment. Any word I use is going 
to be trite." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, the final score would be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
At 22-6, Kansas City's Bret Saberhagen has one more start in which to break the 
Royals' club record for most wins in a season, which Saberhagen currently 
shares with Steve Busby (1974). Win or lose, however, Saberhagen seems a lock 
to win his second American League Cy Young Award in the past five seasons. The 
last time Saberhagen won it, in 1985, he was 20-6 with a 2.87 earned-run 
average. This season, Saberhagen leads the league in wins, earned-run average 
(2.19), complete games (12) and winning percentage (.786). "I don't think 
anyone in the world is going to beat out Saberhagen," Royal pitching coach 
Frank Funk said. "If Saberhagen doesn't win it unanimously, somebody is not 
very competent in his job." Saberhagen is scheduled to pitch against Bob Welch 
(17-8) Saturday afternoon in Oakland.

REDS ARE MISSING, BUT GIANTS CELEBRATE TITLE WITH PARTY AT CRAIG'S HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Craig threw a little party for the San Francisco Giants at his home near 
San Diego Thursday, and because of the Cincinnati Reds, the get-together was a 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Craig would have liked to include the Cincinnati players on the guest list, but 
they'll be traveling. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco manager did, however, figure out one way to express his 
gratitude for the Reds' 13-inning, 2-1 victory over San Diego Wednesday night 
that gave the Giants the National League West title and a playoff date against 
the East champion Chicago Cubs beginning next Wednesday night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to send (Red Manager) Tommy Helms a quarter of a share," Craig said 
late Wednesday night after he and his players -- who had just lost, 1-0, to the 
Dodgers -- learned that the Reds had eliminated the second-place San Diego 
Padres from the West race. 
</P>
<P>
After being swept in three games by the Dodgers, matching their longest losing 
streak of 1989, Craig and his players spent a tense hour and a half in the 
clubhouse waiting for the game in San Diego to end. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Padres won, the Giants would have faced a weekend series in San Diego 
needing a victory to clinch the West. Those final three regular-season games 
now are meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants became fervent Red fans during the clubhouse wait, listening to the 
game from San Diego on the radio and cheering for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
When the game finally ended, there were shouts of joy -- and relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Whew," first baseman Will Clark said. "We're all glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the best-of-seven matchup with the Cubs, Craig said he plans 
to use Scott Garrelts, 14-5 after Wednesday night's loss to the Dodgers and 
still the NL earned-run average leader, in the opening game of the playoffs, 
then go with Rick Reuschel (17-7) in the second game. The Cubs will open with 
Greg Maddux (19-12) and follow with Mike Bielecki (18-7). 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had a 6-6 record against the Cubs this season, with the teams 
splitting six games at both Candlestick Park and Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said there are similarities between his team and the Cubs, who are 
managed by Don Zimmer, a former teammate of Craig's with the Dodgers in 
Brooklyn and Los Angeles, and later with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're a little like Zimmer's club," Craig said. "Nobody expected us to 
be here." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said he was one of those that didn't expect the Cubs to win the NL East 
but added that they earned the title. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants will be shooting for their first NL pennant since 1962, the year 
slugging outfielder Kevin Mitchell was born. The Cubs haven't won a pennant 
since 1945, when Craig and Zimmer were 14. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco won the NL West title in 1987 but, hampered by injuries, finished 
fourth in the division last year, 11 1/2 games behind the Dodgers, who went on 
to win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Giants were alone in first place after June 17.

Alan Schwindt, 20, a pitcher for the University of San Diego baseball team, was 
in serious condition at Sharp Memorial Hospital following an accident during a 
pickup baseball game last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
According John Cunningham, USD's baseball coach, Schwindt underwent emergency 
surgery Saturday to reduce a blood clot near his brain after he was hit in the 
head by a line drive. He was upgraded from critical to serious condition 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still too early to tell," Cunningham said. "He's tried to open his eyes a 
couple of times, but they're keeping him sedated. They're trying to keep his 
brain activity down until they reduce the swelling." 
</P>
<P>
Schwindt, a junior from Rancho Palos Verdes' Chadwick High School, was pitching 
in the pickup game at USD when a line drive struck him behind his right eye. 
Witnesses said Schwindt was conscious for about a minute before passing out.

Mike Krushelnyski poked the puck past Steve Weeks to give the Kings their 
go-ahead goal just 37 seconds after Jim Sandlak tied the game in a 4-2 
exhibition victory over the Vancouver Canucks Thursday night before 11,013 at 
Veterans Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kudelski added a King goal into an empty net in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
For Krushelnyski, who has been getting a lot of time as the left wing on the 
line with Wayne Gretzky and Mikael Lindholm, it was the fourth goal of the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 1-1, after the first period on an early goal by Vancouver's 
Rick Sutter and a shorthanded goal by King Hubie McDonough. The Kings went 
ahead when Bernie Nicholls put in the rebound of a shot by Barry Beck on a 
power play at 15:05 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Sandlak tied it, 2-2, on a power play early in the third period, before 
Krushelnyski untied it. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey was in goal for the Kings for the fourth time in the exhibition 
season. He faced 23 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Weeks went the distance in goal for the Canucks, facing 35 shots. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>

With a mighty surge, Paula Abdul's "Forever Your Girl" album climbed two rungs 
to the top of the Billboard magazine pop chart. That's news, considering this 
album isn't exactly new. It's been on the chart 64 weeks and has sold more than 
2 million units. Albums that have been around this long usually don't have much 
surge left in them. The publicity from Abdul's MTV Awards victories and her hot 
new single, "(It's Just) the Way That You Love Me," fueled the surge. 
Aerosmith's "Pump" jumped to No. 9 in just its second week on the chart. This 
band would love to overtake heavy-metal rival Motley Crue, whose "Dr. Feelgood" 
is No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
* Look out, Paula Abdul. Your major competition for the dance-music-diva crown, 
Janet Jackson, is rocketing up the pop album chart with her new "Rhythm Nation" 
album, which entered at No. 28 and should crack the Top 10 next week.

Pedestrian deaths in Orange County in 1988 remained virtually unchanged from 
the year before. One-fifth of the deaths occurred in Santa Ana, by far the 
individual city leader. Several cities recorded no pedestrian deaths in 1988, 
but only tiny La Palma (less than two square miles and with a population of 
less than 20,000) has a clean record for the last five years.

Between Orange County and its four contiguous neighbors, almost 600 pedestrians 
were killed in 1988. The 57 deaths here ranked the county third, with 10% of 
such fatalities in the five-county area (and 6% of the entire state total).

comparison of the five counties:

Passenger traffic at all five county Amtrak stations increased during the 
second quarter (April through June) of this year over last year's comparable 
period. The biggest change was the 71.4% jump at San Clemente. Here's how this 
year compares to last in the number of people boarding and leaving Amtrak 
trains in the county:

BUSH TOURS HURRICANE-TORN AREAS, OFFERS $1.1 BILLION IN RELIEF FUNDS

<P>
President Bush today toured a region ravaged by Hurricane Hugo, offering "a 
little encouragement" and a $1.1-billion relief check while defending federal 
efforts against charges of foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know that there's been a critic or two" of the federal disaster-relief 
effort, Bush said after a brief look at the storm damage. "To the critics, I 
simply say: I understand. We are trying very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's 15-minute motorcade from Charleston Air Force Base inland to Summerville 
took him past decimated trailer parks, dozens of roofless buildings and pine 
forests filled with trees snapped in half. 
</P>
<P>
In Summerville, the President was shown around the Dorchester County Courthouse 
grounds, which were littered with smashed cars, fallen trees and twisted metal. 
He visited a community center where a school bus, flattened by a fallen tree, 
still stood in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he flew by helicopter over the Carolina coastline, where Hugo came 
ashore a week ago, and flew low over some of the hardest-hit areas of downtown 
Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Bush offered words of encouragement to residents of a state where 
270,000 people were made jobless by the hurricane, where more than 200,000 
people still have no electricity and where 50,000 remain homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering encouragement, Bush came to South Carolina to respond to a 
week of rising criticism that the federal government has been too bureaucratic 
and too slow in helping victims of what Summerville Mayor Berlin Meyers called 
"the worst storm that ever happened to our state." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was met as he landed by one of the most vocal critics, Charleston Mayor 
Joseph Riley Jr., who said it was "absolutely ridiculous" that only two federal 
disaster relief offices have been opened in Charleston. Riley complained that, 
when he asked for emergency power generators, he was told the proper forms had 
to be filled out first. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as he ended his two-hour visit to South Carolina, Bush told reporters 
that the hurricane "was tough. It was devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"But the spirit of the people of South Carolina came through loud and clear. . 
. . You couldn't help but be impressed to hear people say, 'We're going to 
bounce back.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for the complaints about the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which Sen. 
Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) had described as "as sorry a bunch of bureaucratic 
jackasses as I've worked with in my life," Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
"When all the dust is settled and the debris is removed, people are going to 
understand that this has been a total team effort."

REPAIRS UNDER WAY AS JET BLAST DISABLES AIRPORT'S LANDING SYSTEM 
</P>

The Federal Aviation Administration said today it will look into who was 
responsible for the jet engine blast that knocked out John Wayne Airport's 
instrument landing system, without which the airport will have to be closed 
during fog or rain. 
</P>
<P>
An engine blast from an America West Boeing 757 blew apart the small, red and 
white shed at the end of the runway that contains the instrument landing system 
at about 8:40 a.m. Thursday, delaying 30 to 40 departing or arriving aircraft 
of various types for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said the pilot failed to follow proper procedures by revving 
the engine too soon, before he had taxied the aircraft to the "blue line," a 
mark on the runway. However, airport officials acknowledged that the pilot had 
permission from an unidentified air traffic controller. 
</P>
<P>
"I presume that there will be an investigation, but what we're working at right 
now is to return the airport to the normal status," said the FAA's Joe Fowler, 
manager at the John Wayne control tower. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he has no idea yet how much it will cost or how long it will take 
to replace the damaged equipment. America West officials declined comment.

SENATE OKS MODIFIED FORM OF HELMS' 'OBSCENE ART' BILL

<P>
The Senate today endorsed a toned-down version of Sen. Jesse Helms' proposal to 
ban federal aid for "obscene art." 
</P>
<P>
On a 65-31 vote, lawmakers urged House-Senate negotiators to adopt legislation 
barring federal assistance for "obscene materials" depicting some sexual 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
"We do know in our hearts that there are community values that we all share and 
we must uphold as policymakers and Americans," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), 
who helped shape the new provision. 
</P>
<P>
The non-binding measure called for a change in a Senate-passed provision that 
would have prohibited federal aid for art that is "indecent" or that 
"denigrates" any race, religion, sex, handicap or age group. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has become a major stumbling block in the way of House and 
Senate agreement on a bill to provide about $11 billion for federal land and 
cultural programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Helms made his original proposal in reaction to two photography exhibits 
financed with federal grants awarded through the National Endowment for the 
Arts. The exhibits contained pictures he and others have found offensive. 
</P>
<P>
On July 26, with few members in the chamber, the Senate adopted the original 
version of the Helms restrictions on a voice vote. But shortly before midnight 
Thursday, lawmakers refused on a 62-35 vote to reaffirm the July action. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote clearly worried many legislators, who wondered openly about how 
it might be used by future election campaign opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"What 30-second ad might come out of this," Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said was 
a lively topic of conversation among his colleagues. The answer, he said, was a 
commercial stating, "Senator so-and-so voted for pornography." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty Democrats and 15 Republicans voted for the weaker restrictions, while 28 
Republicans and three Democrats opposed them. 
</P>
<P>
The language adopted Friday evolved when Helms offered to drop his insistence 
that federal aid should be forbidden for art that "denigrates" a religion, 
race, ethnic background, sex or handicap.

MOTHERS ACCUSED OF USING SIX CHILDREN IN SEX SALE

Two women have been charged with lining up their six children in the home they 
shared and allowing men to take their pick for sex, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Sanford, 34, was charged with four counts of first-degree criminal 
sexual conduct. Carolyn Wilson, 42, was charged with one count of first-degree 
child abuse and four counts of criminal sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they believe at least seven men visited the women's house 
often in 1987 and 1988 to choose their victims from the lineup. They said the 
children were then sexually assaulted in their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids would just look at each other as if to say 'O God, not again,' " 
Detective Patrick O'Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
The women, who are not related, each had three children in the house. 
Authorities have been unable to determine who their biological fathers are. 
</P>
<P>
The children, five girls and one boy, have been living in foster homes since 
May, 1988, after one of the girls came to school with bruises and told school 
officials of the alleged abuse. Five of the children are 8 to 13 years old; the 
sixth is a retarded 18-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Police didn't seek arrest warrants for the women until two weeks ago, when they 
believed the children were prepared to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the lineups occurred at least once a week for at least a year. The 
women also allegedly beat the children and forced them to clean floors with 
toothbrushes and eat dog food, police said.

MARCOS' EMACIATED CORPSE LIES IN LUXURY AS WIDOW PRESSES BURIAL DEMANDS

<P>
The emaciated corpse of Ferdinand E. Marcos lay in his luxurious Honolulu home 
today as his widow appealed tearfully for permission to bury him in his 
Philippine homeland, ensuring that the deposed dictator will be as 
controversial in death as he was in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only considered one wish, his wish and the wish of every Filipino, to 
be buried . . . in his fatherland," Imelda Marcos said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Philippine President Corazon Aquino's refusal to grant Marcos 
burial in his native soil, Imelda Marcos choked back tears and asked: 
</P>
<P>
"How can you find this man dangerous to security when he is now resting in 
peace forever?" 
</P>
<P>
More resigned family members in the Philippines said Marcos' death could end a 
long wait for his mother, whose embalmed body has lain on public display in a 
glass-topped casket there for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous Burials 
</P>
<P>
The Marcos family said it is considering burying mother and son at the same 
time. "Most likely they will be buried simultaneously in Hawaii and Ilocos 
Norte," their home province, said Marcos's younger brother, Pacifico Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners in Honolulu crowded around Marcos' coffin to glimpse the emaciated 
body of the man who died early Thursday of heart failure, aged 72, after months 
of critical illness. 
</P>
<P>
The politically charged question of where Marcos will be buried appears likely 
to ensure that in death the former president will be as shrouded in controversy 
as in life. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, who took power after Marcos was toppled by a popular uprising and 
forced to flee to Hawaii in 1986, has barred the body from the Philippines, 
saying its presence could become a rallying point for opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how long the Marcos family can keep the corpse legally unburied 
in Hawaii. The United States has supported Aquino, banning any aircraft from 
carrying the remains from the United States to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, Marcos supporters threatened protest marches and an appeal 
to the United Nations, and leading government senators called for an end to 
"rancor," adding to mounting pressure on Aquino to allow the body to return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' lawyers prepared an appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court to order 
Aquino to allow the corpse back. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino ordered flags in government offices lowered to half-staff in official 
mourning, and the army imposed tight but discreet security on Manila to prevent 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president held an emergency meeting with her top military 
advisers today to assess domestic security. 
</P>
<P>
"Other groups may take advantage of the situation to escalate the sentiments," 
Aquino's national security adviser, Rafael Ileto, said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Marcos family cremate the body. 
</P>
<P>
"If the family decides to cremate him, then nobody could prevent them from 
bringing that box or the ashes here."

SCHEME CAME IN 'A DREAM,' BAKKER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
FUND-RAISING MOST BURDENSOME TASK, PTL FOUNDER TESTIFIES 
</P>

<P>
PTL founder Jim Bakker testified today that the fund-raising technique at the 
heart of his fraud and conspiracy trial occurred to him in the middle of the 
night as "a vision or a dream." 
</P>
<P>
"I think fund-raising was my most burdensome job," Bakker testified. "It never 
left me. You never ever, ever get away from the pressure that you have to raise 
funds for next week, next month, next year." 
</P>
<P>
When he left PTL, the budget was $160 million a year, "which I think boils down 
to $3 million a week," Bakker said in his first appearance on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, Bakker described the 
roots of his PTL ministry in a low voice. At one point, when he looked at 
Davis, the lawyer pointed for him to look directly at the jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife, Children Absent 
</P>
<P>
Neither his wife, Tammy Faye, nor his two children, were in the courtroom when 
Bakker testified. 
</P>
<P>
After describing his early years as an evangelist, Bakker talked about his 
vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA Christian retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"The vision from God was to build a modern Christian campground where people 
could worship, attend seminars and workshops," Bakker said. 
</P>
<P>
As the ministry grew, he said, "we needed to build. In the middle of the night 
I woke up. It was a vision or a dream, I don't know. God gave me the concept of 
the Heritage Grand Partner Center, and I began to sketch it." 
</P>
<P>
He later described the same event. "I woke up in the morning and began to write 
down the concept of lifetime partnerships. I brought the concept to my staff 
and showed it to some vice presidents and accountants. I asked them if it would 
work and they said yes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Sales Transactions 
</P>
<P>
Bakker is accused of bilking followers of $158 million through the sale of the 
$1,000 partnerships, which typically entitled holders to three nights' lodging 
a year in PTL hotels near Ft. Mill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have claimed that the partnerships were not sales 
transactions and that the money paid for them constituted gifts to the 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
In their presentation, prosecutors presented several PTL partners who said they 
sometimes were turned away when they tried to use their lodging benefits. 
Prosecutors contend that Bakker oversold the partnerships and diverted $3.7 
million of the money to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker resigned from his ministry in a sex and money scandal in 1987 and is 
charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.

SENATE APT TO BE BALKY ON CAPITAL GAINS; 
</P>
<P>
BRADY HITS TAX CUT FOES FOR MAKING IT RICH VS. POOR ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democrats said today that President Bush's cut in capital-gains taxes is no 
sure bet in the Senate, while his Treasury secretary criticized opponents for 
discussing the issue in terms of rich against poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a reasonably good chance we'll be able to prevail here" and 
defeat the reduction, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a member of the Finance Committee, said he thinks 
the deficit-reduction plan to be written by the panel next week will not 
include the capital-gains cut, which the House approved on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the capital-gains cut, Bradley said the Finance Committee is likely 
to approve a measure making tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts 
available to more workers as an incentive for saving. 
</P>
<P>
At a Finance Committee hearing on IRAs, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady 
defended the capital-gains reduction as an important tool for economic growth. 
He said there is no certainty that IRAs increase savings, and called the 
proposal too expensive when the budget deficit exceeds $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Brady complained that 80% of the tax saving under the expanded IRA proposed by 
Bentsen would go to those with incomes over $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats' Argument Told 
</P>
<P>
Democrats' major argument against the capital-gains cut is that 80% of its 
benefits would be collected by those with incomes above $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard for me to understand why this whole discussion has to reach the 
level of rich vs. poor," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
"The rich are getting richer in this country and the poor are getting poorer," 
said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.). "You'll have to forgive us for bringing 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
Brady contends the figure cited by Democrats on capital gains is misleading on 
the ground that the over-$100,000 category includes many people of relatively 
modest earnings who, once in a lifetime, sell a small business or a home and 
for that year their income is pushed above that level. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, are taxed at the 
same rate as wages. Bush and a majority of the House want to tax only 70% of 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary cited an estimate that 47% of capital gains are realized by 
people whose other income -- not including the gains -- is less than $50,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bentsen Responds 
</P>
<P>
In response, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said the joint-committee staff, which 
provides technical tax advice to Congress, found that only 18% of the gains 
were taken by people who reported more than one capital-gains transaction a 
year -- eliminating the one-time sellers. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee will begin work next week on a package of spending cuts 
and revenue increases aimed mainly at reducing the deficit by about $17 billion 
during budget year 1990, which begins Oct. 1.

A federal judge today fined the captain and owner of the tanker World Prodigy 
more than $500,000 for a June 23 spill that dumped an estimated 300,000 gallons 
of light oil at the mouth of Narragansett Bay. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Ernest Torres fined Capt. Iakovos Georgudis $10,000, 
plus a mandatory special assessment of $25. In levying the fine, the judge 
noted that Georgudis had an excellent record and had assisted in clean-up 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has received assurances that the captain's conduct was negligent, as 
opposed to willful or reckless," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the ship, Ballard Shipping Co. of New York, was fined $1 million 
and placed on one month's probation. However, the judge suspended half that 
fine.

The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tian An Men Square 
last June has cost the People's Republic at least $1 billion in lost tourist 
revenues, a Chinese official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost $1 billion or so this year," said Chinese Counsel General Zheng 
Wanzhen after a brief appearance at a meeting of the International Assn. of 
Travel Research and Marketing Professionals. A panel of Asian experts said the 
lost tourist revenues would total $1.3 billion by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Zheng was optimistic that the tourist trade would snap back. "By next year it 
will be fully recovered," he predicted. "What happened in June and July is a 
very minor event in the course of China's history." 
</P>
<P>
Others at the meeting disagreed on how quickly travel to China would pick up.

SIMMONS' VALHI GROUP INCREASES STAKE IN LOCKHEED CORP. TO 10.43%

<P>
A group controlled by Texas billionaire Harold C. Simmons said today that it 
has increased its stake in defense contractor Lockheed Corp. to 10.43%. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a group headed by 
Simmons-controlled Valhi Corp. stated it had purchased more than 890,000 shares 
of Lockheed since Aug. 1 on the New York Stock Exchange at prices ranging from 
$47.25 to $48.63 a share. 
</P>
<P>
That raised Simmons' stake in the Calabasas, Calif.-based maker of the stealth 
fighter plane from 9.46% on Aug. 1 to 10.43%, or 6.62 million shares, of 
Lockheed common stock. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Valhi sold off more than 272,000 shares at prices 
ranging from $48.50 to $53 a share to "obtain funds to be used for working 
capital purposes," according to the filing.

LEADING INDICATORS RISE 0.3% IN AUGUST; 
</P>
<P>
1989 ANNUAL RATE INDEX TO DATE UP 3.8%, COMPARED WITH 4.5% INCREASE FOR ALL '88

<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose 0.3% in August, its 
second consecutive advance, indicating continued growth in the months ahead, 
the Commerce Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the index of leading indicators, designed to foretell economic 
activity six to nine months into the future, followed a 0.1% gain in July. It 
declined 0.1% in June. 
</P>
<P>
Today's index reinforced recent government and private industry reports 
indicating that the nation's longest peacetime economic expansion will reach 
its seventh birthday in December. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we're going to have a recession it probably won't start before then 
and I still think we will squeeze through 1990 without one," said Lawrence 
Chimerine, senior economic adviser at the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "But 
it won't be very buoyant growth." 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the leading indicators have bounced back and forth -- up in 
January, April, July and August, and down in February, March, May and June. In 
the past, three consecutive declines sometimes, but not always, have signaled a 
forthcoming recession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Consistent With Slow Growth' 
</P>
<P>
"This trendless result for 1989 seems consistent with the slow growth 
experience of the overall economy," said Ysabel Burns McAleer of the American 
Financial Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up the composite 
index contributed to the August gain -- an increase in manufacturers' new 
orders, higher stock prices, an increase in the money supply, lower initial 
unemployment claims and increased building permits. 
</P>
<P>
The others pointed down -- a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; 
lower prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand; a decrease in 
manufacturers' unfilled orders; fewer orders for plants and equipment; faster 
vendor deliveries, meaning declining demand, and a shorter workweek. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the index has risen at an annual rate of 3.8%, compared with 
an increase of 4.5% for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The economy has been growing steadily since November, 1982, when the nation 
came out of its last recession, but many thought it might be pushed into 
another downturn this year by Federal Reserve efforts to slow inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supply Tightened 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in March, 1988, the Fed gradually tightened the nation's credit 
supply. Its goal became known as the "soft-landing" -- continued, but slower 
economic growth to keep inflationary pressures in rein. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists, like David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York 
government securities dealer, try to avoid the "soft-landing" description. 
</P>
<P>
"The term is so overused that I hate to use it," Jones said. "In some sense, 
it's not a landing story at all. It's an economy that's growing at lower 
altitude of GNP (gross national product) growth than we saw last year."

Philip Poole, London's favorite purveyor of pens, nibs and peacock feathers, is 
closing shop, and with him goes another little piece of England. 
</P>
<P>
Poole is giving up his Drury Lane shop in the heart of London's theater 
district, forced out by a rent hike from $9,900 to $32,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
It may be inevitable in this age of supermarkets, word processors and ballpoint 
pens. But to lovers of tradition and good service, it is a tragedy. The closing 
of Philip Poole's is being recorded wistfully in newspapers and television, and 
customers are flocking in to buy up supplies for the lean years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Poole, 79, is so well-known in his field that he is nicknamed His Nibs. For 56 
years, he has sold and repaired pens for cartoonists, artists and practitioners 
of penmanship. But the store that bears Poole's name sits on some of the 
choicest real estate in London, and a sudden tripling of the rent is not 
unusual.

FLORIDA STATE VOWS: NO MORE DEION SANDERSES; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL RESPONDS TO MAGAZINE STORY ON FOOTBALL ALL-AMERICAN'S ACADEMIC FAILURE, 
DISINTEREST

<P>
Deion Sanders' academic legacy will never be repeated at a Florida college, a 
state university spokesman said today in response to a magazine story critical 
of college football. 
</P>
<P>
This week's edition of Sports Illustrated reported that Sanders had no interest 
in college and that Florida State officials turned their heads when the 
All-American cornerback didn't attend class last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was allowed to play in the Sugar Bowl last January even though school 
officials knew he had flunked all of his fall courses. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine article implied that university President Bernard Sliger defaulted 
responsibility, leaving Sanders' academic participation in the hands of former 
Athletic Director C. W. (Hootie) Ingram, who has since moved to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Terrible Image Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll let the athletic director handle the matter . . . just as I would let the 
dean of any other school handle a similar situation," Sliger told the magazine, 
which asked rhetorically if Ingram was the dean of the School of Football. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Turnbull, provost at Florida State, noted that the university changed its 
policy on academic requirements after the Sanders' case became public. 
</P>
<P>
"The real key, I think, is that we changed the requirement after we learned of 
the problem," Turnbull said. "It was a terrible image problem and we're sorry 
it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the state university system's board of regents enacted a new 
regulation dubbed the Sanders rule that forbids schools from allowing athletes 
to play in post-season games if they don't attend class or fail to pass the 
minimum number of hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we've had to react to the actions of a single athlete with a rule 
that applies to every athlete," said Patrick Riordan, state university system 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders told the magazine that college football was about money and that he had 
to be in college to prepare for the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' presence on campus indicated to the student body, fans and critics the 
extremes to which a school will go to produce a winning football team, the 
magazine said.

$60,000 IN NEW GRAND PRIX FINES ISSUED; 
</P>
<P>
WEEK'S TOTAL HITS $130,000 AS CONTROVERSY ACCELERATES IN SPAIN

<P>
Auto racing's international governing body fined world champion driver Ayrton 
Senna $20,000 and officials of the Spanish Grand Prix $40,000 today for a total 
of $130,000 in fines in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, from Brazil, was fined for ignoring signals to stop practice, and race 
organizers were fined for starting today's prequalifying session 30 minutes 
late. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement was made as a bitter dispute between Ferrari and McLaren still 
raged over $50,000 in fines and a suspension from Sunday's race against Ferrari 
driver Nigel Mansell of Britain. Two other drivers, Alain Prost of France and 
Martin Brundle of Britain, were fined $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's Portuguese Grand Prix, the International Federation of 
Automobile Sports fined Mansell for ignoring black disqualification flags. 
Mansell was disqualified for driving in reverse in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
Brundle was penalized for driving too fast in the Estoril pit lane last 
weekend, and Prost failed to attend a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Post Position 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fine, Senna was back in business later today, clocking the fastest 
time in preliminary practice for provisional pole position for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
Senna's hopes of recapturing the world championship dimmed after his 
McLaren-Honda collided with Mansell's Ferrari in last week's race. In 
qualifying for this race, he turned a 2.62-mile lap over the Jerez circuit in 1 
minute, 21.855 seconds, or 115.27 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Second-fastest today was the Minardi-Ford of Italy's Pierluigi Martini in 
1:22.243. Austria's Gerhard Berger had his scarlet Ferrari third fastest in 
1:22.276. 
</P>
<P>
Prost was fourth, Nelson Piquet of Brazil was fifth and Ivan Capelli was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Still, practice was overshadowed by the verbal battle between McLaren-Honda and 
Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
McLaren team manager Ron Dennis brusquely denied Mansell's claims that McLaren 
mechanics were partly responsible for his disqualification from the Portuguese 
Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't buy this whole thing," Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Mansell said he did not see the black flag and claimed that his view in the 
lane was blocked by McLaren tires and other equipment.

Chris Mullin has signed a nine-year contract with the Golden State Warriors, 
the NBA team announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin, 26, averaged 26.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and 5.1 assists last year in his 
fourth season. Only Chicago's Michael Jordan and Portland's Clyde Drexler had 
higher averages in all three categories. He was named to the All-Star team and 
All-NBA second team. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' first-round draft pick out of St. John's in 1985, Mullin became a 
restricted free agent following last season. There have been repeated rumors 
throughout his career that the Brooklyn native might eventually sign with the 
New York Knicks as a free agent, but the signing precludes that. Mullin's 
salary was $700,000 last season.
