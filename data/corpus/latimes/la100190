COMMUTERS' RESISTANCE TO CAR POOLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Eric Bailey's story, he wryly noted that "car-pool prophets" are merely 
waiting for people to become so fed up with traffic that they'll turn to 
ride-sharing on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, we prophets know that'll never happen. The only way people will share 
their work commute is if there are tangible incentives, such as time-savings 
realized from car-pool lanes or cash bonuses from their employer. Without those 
perks, why would anyone give up his solo commute and car pool, only to sit in 
the same traffic with everyone else?

COMMUTERS' RESISTANCE TO CAR POOLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During my daily commute, El Toro to Hawthorne, I observe sedans from various 
cities, Caltrans, area transit districts, the air quality district and unknown 
agencies bearing government plates. Most of them have the common denominator of 
a single occupant except for the few vans labeled as van pools. 
</P>
<P>
These cars are not only under-utilized, but they are subsidized by taxpayers 
providing free transportation to a government employee for his daily commute. A 
very nice tax-free addition to their income. 
</P>
<P>
I will consider the ride-share program as a serious attempt to alleviate 
traffic when cities and other agencies have 100% participation and no employee 
is allowed to commute in a government-owned vehicle other than a van pool. 
</P>
<P>
These agencies all have the same philosophy. We'll make rules that won't affect 
me and thee but will make it rough for the guy behind the tree (the beat-up 
taxpayer). 
</P>
<P>
Let these people stop their preaching and have them participate like the rest 
of us are expected to do.

SHERIFF BLOCK ON GANGS AND DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree wholeheartedly with your commendation of Sheriff Sherman Block 
(editorial, "Even Without Drugs, There'd Be Gangs," Sept. 21) for his bold 
insight into the cause of gang violence. Block correctly asserted that a 
fundamental connection exists between the deviance of gang violence and one's 
self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
As violence becomes an increasingly common phenomena, we must concern ourselves 
with ways of mitigating the attraction for self-enhancing experiences that 
gangs offer those who have previously only experienced lowered self-worth. Our 
inattention to this matter, as a society, manifests itself in an increase in 
violence and drug-related crimes. Violence and drug use are results, not 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
Block's perspicacious recognition of that reality should serve as guidance for 
leaders who fear to tread on what they must perceive to be the thin ice of 
political sophistication and candor. This perception is misguided as evidenced, 
at least, in the political arena, in incredibly low voter turnout. We deserve 
more! Thank you, Sheriff Block, for elevating the discussion!

U.S. INTERVENTION IN MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, The Times carried a story about Secretary of State James Baker's 
meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad. In that meeting Baker agreed with 
Assad's statement that the invasion of Kuwait is essentially an Arab problem 
that can best be handled by Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
If that is true, why are 100,000 of some of our finest young men and women 
sweating it out in the Saudi desert? Why? The honor of the civilized world is 
at stake! International law must be upheld! That bad man Saddam Hussein must be 
punished! So the powers-that-be proclaim. Good press, good propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Moral posturing aside, there are people, including many among the troops, who 
know the reason is oil, Almighty Oil. We are there to restore the ruling 
despots to Kuwait and keep the oil-rich sheiks of Saudi Arabia in power so the 
oil-guzzling industries of the West can continue poisoning the air and thinning 
the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't spending a few billion dollars on conservation and conversion to 
alternate fuels make better sense than war, especially a war that would surely 
result in destruction of the very oil wells we are there to protect? Let's face 
it, such a war could escalate into the dreaded nuclear holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
If it is an Arab problem for Arabs, why are we there? More important, how can 
we get out? No problem. Washington has experts in doublespeak. They can make a 
withdrawal sound like a glorious victory. Or were Secretary Baker and President 
Assad talking double talk?

AMERICAN MEMORY BEING SLICED AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST B. FURGUSON, Excerpted from Ernest B. Furguson's syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Burns' superb Civil War series on public television reminded us how lucky 
we were not to have fought in that war but how doubly lucky we are that our 
great-grandfathers did, and that everything came out the way it did. But 
today's epic battles are being fought in courthouses and zoning commissions, 
and this time history is too often the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Culpeper County, Va., they reached a decision in the second battle 
of Brandy Station. The good side lost. Down the road in Hanover County, they 
are still fighting the second battle of Cold Harbor, and so far the bulldozers 
are ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Where Union horsemen surprised Jeb Stuart and brought on the greatest cavalry 
fight in American history, soon there will be the greatest industrial park in 
Culpeper County. The developer there got permission to proceed after agreeing 
to set aside 248 acres of the 1,445-acre tract as a historic site. But those 
248 acres are steep land where nothing much happened in 1863; the plateau where 
the head-on clash of cavalry took place will be unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
That is the sort of one-sided compromise by which field after field of American 
memory is being sliced away, to leave little that reminds of who fought there, 
and how.

IF FORCED TO RAISE TAXES, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO; 
</P>
<P>
CLOSING INCOME-TAX LOOPHOLES WOULD BE THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE, BUT THE BUDGET 
PROCESS MUST BE REFORMED TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One thing we know for sure: The way the state of California conducts its budget 
process must change. The inability of the governor and the Legislature to come 
together to solve budget problems has resulted in frozen mandates on counties, 
increased partisan bickering and a general loss of the public's confidence that 
problems are going to be fairly solved in a timely manner. Instead, citizens go 
to the ballot to redress unsolved problems through the initiatives, and the 
Legislature remains in gridlock along with our streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
California cannot afford eight more years of budget gridlock. We need a 
governor who will get this state moving again and bring people together to 
solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
The projected $2-billion shortfall and a possible serious economic downturn 
mean that we must hold the line on new spending and concentrate on seeing to it 
that the state's economic engine continues to pump with jobs and paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
California's diversified economy puts us in much better shape than many other 
states. But it must be remembered that a strong and growing economy is the 
surest and best source of new revenues for the state's budgetary needs. So, 
maintaining a strong economy will have my constant attention. 
</P>
<P>
People must also know that the hard-earned dollars they pay in taxes are well 
and wisely spent. So, careful scrutiny of priorities, elimination of 
non-necessities and duplication, as well as cost-saving, wherever possible, 
remain the order of the times. Revenues must be carefully watched as the 
shortfall figures become more precise and the trigger mechanism forces 
automatic cutbacks across the board next year. 
</P>
<P>
I supported the three transportation and rail initiatives that passed on the 
June ballot; they will create a $21-billion opportunity for California to 
improve its transportation infrastructure. I intend to get control of Caltrans 
and see that these monies are carefully utilized so that the voters' intent of 
major rail and transportation improvements is carried out. With these funds, a 
rail spine can be built through central California to facilitate new 
communities so that growth can be managed by putting jobs closer to homes. 
</P>
<P>
I also support Proposition 133 on the November ballot to fight a real war on 
drugs through a one-half cent increase in the sales tax. The number of law 
enforcement officers has actually decreased in California, while at the same 
time our state has become the cocaine and heroin importation capital of America 
(also the PCP and methamphetamine manufacturing center). 
</P>
<P>
Drug pushers don't listen to politicians, but they do listen when they're 
arrested, put in jail fast and kept there. Proposition 133 would make $7.5 
billion available over four years, for added local police, prosecutors and 
jails, and for the drug prevention we need in every school and county across 
this state. Today, California is a paper tiger in the war against drugs. With 
Proposition 133, tomorrow can be different. 
</P>
<P>
I have pledged to protect residential property tax rates -- and I will do that. 
</P>
<P>
I also believe that the income-tax changes in Washington and Sacramento in the 
1980s have benefitted the wealthiest 5% of the taxpayers, who now actually pay 
a lower marginal rate than people who earn less than they do. That's not fair. 
This loophole should be closed, but income-tax rates for all other Californians 
must not be raised. Eighty percent of the revenues raised by closing such a 
loophole would come from couples making more than $500,000 a year. I want to 
protect working men and women from unfair increases in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
With the $21 billion in rail and transportation funding and the $7.5 billion in 
Proposition 133 to really fight drugs and crime, California can make major 
inroads on two areas of voter priorities. Other than the closing of unfair 
loopholes I foresee no major tax changes at this time.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
IS THIS TRIP NECESSARY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a councilwoman, Irvine Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan opposed the establishment 
of a sister-city relationship with Tsukuba, Japan. Now that she's mayor, she's 
planning to lead an Irvine delegation there in November. Sayonara consistency. 
</P>
<P>
What's changed in a year? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, a junket is no longer a junket when your political adversary is out 
of office and you are in his seat. She had first argued for paying attention to 
local issues but ended up saying prior commitments must be met. Even before 
Sheridan has boarded a plane, she's sending a signal that she's one mayor who 
doesn't travel well. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Mayor Larry Agran had wanted to send city department heads to Tsukuba so 
that they could engage in a meaningful work-related exchange of technical 
information that would benefit programs of both cities. All the while, Sheridan 
was making political hay, saying Irvine officials should stay home and take 
care of potholes. She made that argument strongly enough to get her own ticket 
to the mayor's office last spring. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Japan trip is at hand. Under the new administration, the city 
manager now says that Sheridan and council members must go because their 
Japanese hosts want high-level dignitaries, not staffers as Irvine originally 
planned. And the city must not offend its hosts, even if sending council 
members and the mayor will make it somehow less of a working trip than 
originally envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan now argues the city must keep its promises. Meanwhile, the trip had 
evolved from the working visit proposed by Agran to include such stops as a 
traditional Japanese farmhouse, a geological museum and side trips to shrines, 
gardens and museums. But if Irvine officials are so worried about what the 
Japanese would think of the delegation's composition, how are the hosts to 
interpret Sheridan's disdain for the entire sister-city program in the first 
place? 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Paula Werner, one of those planning to go, has expressed due 
concern about some of these issues. She was at first worried enough about there 
being so little business on the agenda that work had to be found for the trip. 
And then at the end of last week, Werner could contain her embarrassment no 
more: she decided to write a $734 check to the city to stave off any charges 
that she was participating in a junket. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, all politics is local after all. Even when it involves a new mayor's 
forays into international affairs on a $90,000 sister-city program inherited 
from a previous administration.

In the Nick of Time: A benefit concert for political candidates who support 
abortion rights -- featuring Bonnie Raitt, Rickie Lee Jones and others -- was 
abruptly canceled after the Veterans Administration said that its Los Angeles 
theater could not host a partisan event. The concert, whose lineup also 
included Robin Williams and Melissa Etheridge, was scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Women's Committee, a political action group, hoped to raise 
$200,000 from the invitation-only concert for the campaigns of congressional 
candidates. Margery Tabankin, executive director of the group, said that the 
committee got permission in July to use the V.A.'s Wadsworth Theater from UCLA. 
But UCLA officials said they did not know the purpose of the concert until last 
week. BETH KLEID

HAKEN HAGEGARD AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opera singers as recitalists sometimes disappoint through a lack of subtlety or 
a failure of finesse. Hakan Hagegard, who returned to Ambassador Auditorium 
over the weekend to open the hall's 1990-91 season -- its 17th -- disappoints 
through other means. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the celebrated Swedish baritone charmed his way through a program 
that zigzagged around the centuries, specialized in lightness of sound and 
feeling and sent at least one listener home musically undernourished. 
</P>
<P>
There was substance in this agenda: appealing arias by Rossini, Tchaikovsky and 
Mozart; Mahler's "Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen"; dramatic and touching songs 
by Sibelius and Stenhammar -- even three serious encores after the program 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
But a prevailing blandness and low-energy delivery -- with a couple of strong 
exceptions -- made the event seem monochromatic. 
</P>
<P>
That judgment stems clearly from the singer's basic sound, which remained 
through this evening a one-color resource. Usually smooth and ungrainy, 
Hagegard's is a healthy, if slender, voice, which tends to weakness in the 
lower register and never grows large, even at loud levels. 
</P>
<P>
More disappointing is the energy and intensity with which it is used. Most of 
the time, one suspects that the singer is making finely gauged and intimate 
vocal sounds; the reality is that his lack of involvement through much of his 
program is responsible for this impression. 
</P>
<P>
What he sang best on this occasion -- handsomely and comprehensively supported 
by the solid and colorful, if sometimes overmodest, pianism of Warren Jones -- 
were the characterful Finnish and Swedish art songs, and his fully engaged 
singing of three arias, ending with the "Largo al Factotum" from "Il Barbiere 
di Siviglia." The rest was mostly forgettable.

SHERRILL MILNES AT EL CAMINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Sherrill Milnes had thrown out the rule book Saturday at El Camino College 
-- the recital rule book, that is -- he would have led with his strengths: a 
personable manner best illustrated in the group of American songs that closed 
the evening. 
</P>
<P>
It was here, in the irony-tinged fire and brimstone of Malotte's "David and 
Goliath," that Milnes' dramatic mastery came across compellingly. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old baritone was the preacher at the pulpit. And his voice rang out 
with power that matched the narrative, with inflections that made the 
interpretive point. 
</P>
<P>
It could be seen as well -- despite the obligatory regalia of tuxedo and white 
tie -- because nothing stood between him and the character he was portraying. 
</P>
<P>
And for this final group of mostly old-time songs that included "Duna," the 
tall singer allowed himself to chat, offhandedly, with the audience. He was 
perfectly charming and natural. 
</P>
<P>
But for the Italian-German first half of the program, he followed prescribed 
practice -- offering a group of antiquities that warmed up his voice. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was an off night. Perhaps after three decades before the public, 
Milnes can at times be expected to be in less than top form. Perhaps this 
material and a stiff, almost mannered demeanor robbed him of his natural 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he seemed to be missing his characteristic richness of tone. In 
two Schumann lieder, however -- "Widmung" and "Der Nussbaum" -- when he used an 
aptly inward approach and could cover the voice instead of trying to project 
it, the results were poetic. DONNA PERLMUTTER

An Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony, an Obie, a Clio and a Grammy to Allen. Let's get 
back to basics! If the current crop of writers were properly educated, they 
wouldn't have to resort to shock material, which is nothing more than working 
the L out of shlock. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get back to regulation! There was a time in the not-too-distant past when 
regulations and the National Assn. of Broadcasters code wouldn't allow such 
sex, violence or language on television.

Until I read Allen's article, I was afraid I was in a class with only rednecks 
and Bible thumpers, but I'm sure nobody would classify Steve with those yahoos. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think that every dabbler with an unusual or esoteric creation is 
necessarily an artist. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a few years ago, it was reported that the State Legislature had 
funded a proposal of an "artist" to sail somewhere off the coast and serenade 
the whales with a wind instrument. It would seem that the solons in Sacramento 
did not do their homework on that one. 
</P>
<P>
For did they consider the possibility that some whales are tone deaf, or have 
no feeling for rhythm? Or suppose his audience consisted of killer whales, who, 
because of their life style, surely have no taste for the aesthetic?

KID BEAT: 'TOOTH': PUPPET SHOW WITH OFFBEAT BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Talking clocks, singing socks, sight gags and TV send-ups -- "The Timmy the 
Tooth Variety Show," a new live puppet theater production for children at 
Burbank's Gypsy Playhouse, holds offbeat appeal for adults as well. 
</P>
<P>
Timmy the Tooth, a congenial bicuspid and show biz enthusiast, along with his 
sidekick Ed McBrush-Brush, hosts an assortment of talents, from Dean Thesaurus 
("Don't quit your day job, Dean") to the rock 'n' rollin' New Socks on the 
Block, with their hit song, "Burnin' Itch." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Giraffe conducts a "Name That Fruit" segment where the hapless 
contestants end up in the blender, a commercial advertises "Ninja Babies" and 
Dr. Gum interrupts the proceedings to warn Timmy about a blue, tentacled Cavity 
Creep on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
With its obvious mix of Pee Wee Herman and "The Muppet Show" influences, it's 
no surprise to learn that writer-puppeteer Kevin Carlson plays Clockey, Floorey 
and Conky on "Pee Wee's Playhouse," or that co-writer and puppeteer James 
Murray has worked with the late Jim Henson and Disney Productions and on such 
shows as "D.C. Follies." 
</P>
<P>
Director Susan Carlson and producer-performer Dina Murray, with extensive 
backgrounds in children's theater, have also been involved with Muppet and 
Disney productions. 
</P>
<P>
The puppet designs lack originality and there are some timing lags, but the 
music and dialogue have professional polish, and Michael Fairman's lighting -- 
strobe and colors -- is a young crowd pleaser. It's pleasant fun from the 
Kidding Around Productions troupe, with one caveat: The small theater is stuffy 
on a warm day, despite overhead fans. 
</P>

 At 3321 W. Olive Ave. in Burbank through Oct. 27, Saturdays at noon and 2 p.m.

NUREYEV PERFORMS 'OVERCOAT' IN SAN JOSE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ballet is the celebration of the human body at its most vital. Its language is 
couched in terms of strength and limberness, which, like it or not, are the 
virtues of youth. Rudolf Nureyev, who as a young man was ballet's most daring 
and extravagant star, challenged this truth Friday night with the U.S. premiere 
of Flemming Flindt's "The Overcoat." 
</P>
<P>
Dominating the opening of San Jose Cleveland Ballet's California season -- the 
two-city company will dance "Coppelia" here next weekend -- Flindt's 1989 
ballet was designed to match the 52-year-old Nureyev's current abilities, but, 
despite the choreographer's good intentions, he failed to contrive a style 
flattering to his star. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of utilizing Nureyev's limitations to create a down-and-out character, 
Flindt either laughed at his hero or pretended he was a prince in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
Loosely based on Nicolai Gogol's bitter short story of the same name, "The 
Overcoat" tells of Akaky, a humble copyist in imperial Russia whose overcoat is 
so threadbare that his tailor refuses to mend it. The impoverished bureaucrat 
skimps and saves until the new coat becomes a symbolic reward for a lifetime of 
emptiness and self-denial. 
</P>
<P>
Sumptuously designed by Beni Montresor, the ballet moved easily from the vast 
library in which Akaky works to his bare hovel of a room to the luxurious 
ballroom in which he unveils his new possession. For music, Flindt followed 
John Cranko's lead and knitted together several of Dmitri Shostakovich's more 
accessible excerpts, drawn mainly from the composer's movie scores. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Akaky ought to have given Flindt and Nureyev varied opportunities 
for character development and pathos, but instead Flindt insisted on viewing 
the clerk's predicament from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed Charlie Chaplin-style, in tight jacket and baggy pants, Nureyev played 
the copyist mainly for laughs. Perhaps to cover for Nureyev's now-stiff and 
unyielding body, Flindt filled his ballet with extraneous props. Besides the 
overcoat, there was a long scarf in which Akaky is wrapped for no reason at 
all, a recurring umbrella worthy of an English gentleman, and a tea set that 
the dancer spends most of his central solo assembling onstage. 
</P>
<P>
When he is not laughing at Akaky, Flindt could think of nothing more than 
recapitulating heroic steps from Petipa's time. Most probably he was here 
following Nureyev's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
But Nureyev's turns are now wildly unsteady, his leaps barely get him into the 
air, and his leg gets maybe a foot off the floor in arabesque. The grand circle 
of leaps that once climaxed so many of his variations was here little more than 
a carefully calculated walk. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, every once in a while, the master shone through in the perfect 
alignment of his arms and legs in relation to his torso, but even these chance 
revelations barely outlasted the first 10 minutes of the ballet's increasingly 
labored 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the effortless elan of Karen Gabay and Raymond Rodriguez as the 
French couple and a zestful Marcia Haydee imitation by Pamela Reyman, the San 
Jose Cleveland dancers served mainly as a backdrop to Nureyev's embarrassment.

FRANCIS OVERCOMES DRAWBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"You really don't know what you have until you lose it," Connie Francis told 
her audience at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim on Saturday, referring to the 
years when she lost her voice after a traumatic 1974 rape and other personal 
tragedies. She has been actively singing again since 1981, and her 100-minute 
performance showed that the 52-year-old vocalist is making the most of her 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the sound mix was atrocious, with her voice run through a shrill 
electronic reverb. Her rhythm section and the hired pit band often seemed 
hopelessly out of sync, and an amateurishly produced film montage of her career 
further distracted from her singing. These drawbacks overwhelmed the first half 
of Francis' show, which featured her chirpy, barely rocking hits of the late 
'50s and early '60s, such as "Stupid Cupid" and "Where the Boys Are." 
</P>
<P>
The second half -- thankfully minus the movie screens -- allowed the quality 
and emotion of her voice to shine through. She drew on her heritage for an 
Italian-language tune and the emotion-drenched "For Mama," while "Malaguena" 
soared with melismatic, Moorish vocal touches. Her pain-edged voice dug deeply 
into a Judy Garland medley, and Francis even claimed a piece of the Sinatra 
signature tune "My Way," earning two standing ovations. JIM WASHBURN

BEHR CONDUCTS 'NIXON IN CHINA' AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Nixon in China" is not much of a conductor's opera, but all those who have had 
a turn with it have seemed able to impart a distinctive character. Certainly 
Randall Behr did so Saturday evening, when the piece returned to the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion after a 13-day layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Behr, Music Center Opera's resident conductor, stressed the lyrical aspects of 
the lush score, leading a suave, rounded performance that retained the clear 
textures and vitality instilled by his predecessor in this run, Kent Nagano. 
Behr also brought out the dance-based, vernacular rhythms, in a gracefully 
swinging account that provided scope for explosive contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
The reinforced Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra played with cohesive, stylish 
aplomb for Behr, momentary lapses at the end of Act I and the beginning of the 
ballet notwithstanding. This is a very persuasive orchestra for composer John 
Adams -- its luminous "Shaker Loops" still glows in some memories -- and it 
makes much of its manifold opportunities here. 
</P>
<P>
Some amplification inconsistencies skewed balances for the voices, both the 
established solo cast and the Music Center Opera Chorus, but otherwise the 
performance retained its now-familiar vocal character. 
</P>
<P>
A matinee Sunday is the final performance. JOHN HENKEN

An elderly Cuban immigrant taking her first steps in the United States was

<P>
At least five other passengers were injured. 
</P>

Bertola Agrispina Acosta-Bereda, 75, was killed under the weight of her fellow 
passengers as they fell on an escalator to the U.S. Customs Service and 
Immigration offices, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the 
escalator malfunctioned or if the immigrants' unfamiliarity with the machinery 
prompted the fall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants had arrived on a weekly charter flight bringing Cuban immigrants 
to the United States from Havana and exiles home from visits to the island.

A city councilman running for mayor said he will seek full disclosure of what 
mental health officials knew about the gunman who killed one person and injured 
seven at a bar near UC Berkeley last week before being killed by police. "You 
want to try and find out if there's something we could have done which could 
have prevented this catastrophe; learn from it and identify other people we are 
treating who could possibly be involved in something like this," Councilman 
Fred Weekes said. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County mental health officials said they referred Mehrdad Dashti, 30, 
whom they described as a paranoid schizophrenic, to Berkeley city mental health 
officials. But Berkeley officials -- citing state confidentiality laws -- have 
declined to say if they treated Dashti, let alone if he showed signs of 
violence. Dashti, an Iranian immigrant, took more than 30 hostages in Henry's 
pub in the Durant Hotel a block from the university Thursday.

ELECTIONS: WITH $900 IN FUNDS, AN AGOURA ATTORNEY CAMPAIGNS FOR CONGRESS 
DESPITE A HARSH POLITICAL LESSON ON THE POWER OF MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a first-time candidate for Congress, Agoura TV writer and attorney Richard 
David Freiman could barely contain his excitement last March as he departed for 
a two-day "candidates' school" sponsored by the Democratic Party in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He savored the prospect of high-minded seminars on national defense policy, 
foreign affairs and other great issues of the day. He envisioned tips from 
party leaders on how to act with wisdom and idealism once elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Freiman, 42, got a different kind of political education. 
</P>
<P>
"All they talked about was money," he said, shaking his head in dismay during a 
recent interview. "Money, money, money." 
</P>
<P>
But Freiman, like many neophyte candidates, is finding out just how crucial 
money is in politics. Due largely to his meager finances, he faces odds that 
are long -- if not impossible -- in his race against Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Although Gallegly has more than $200,000 on hand for the Nov. 6 election, 
Freiman has less than $900. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign headquarters is his house and his campaign manager is a free-lance 
court reporter who draws no salary and has no previous election experience. 
Instead of pouring tens of thousands of dollars into slick, self-promoting 
brochures to mail to voters, Freiman passes out handbills. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he can't afford cable television commercials, and he'll be lucky if he 
has enough money to buy a handful of radio spots near the end of the campaign. 
His tiny budget prohibits him from acquiring even such basic campaign equipment 
as a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers give Freiman virtually no chance of winning in the heavily 
Republican 21st Congressional District, which covers the suburbs of 
northwestern Los Angeles County and southeastern Ventura County and where 
Gallegly easily defeated Democratic opponents in the last two general 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Freiman, a self-described political junkie who as a boy thrilled to 
speeches by John F. Kennedy, is having a wonderful time on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this. I've wanted to do this all my life, ever since I read 'The Making 
of the President, 1960,' " he said. "I'm enjoying every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, for his part, has largely ignored Freiman's candidacy. With just five 
weeks remaining before the election, the two-term congressman has yet to hire a 
full-time campaign manager. Like many incumbents who see no reason to give an 
opponent a platform, he declined a challenge to debate Freiman. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, hasn't stopped Freiman from attacking the conservative Gallegly, 
46, at every opportunity, taking his low-budget campaign before senior citizens 
groups, college government classes and gatherings of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think I've got a shot," Freiman said over lunch this week at a 
Northridge health food restaurant. "As crazy as it seems, I've believed this 
since the day I got into this, because there's such a clear-cut choice between 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Freiman has made his advocacy of abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign, 
criticizing Gallegly for his anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
He also promotes himself as an environmentalist. He favors Proposition 128 on 
the November ballot, the so-called "Big Green" initiative that seeks to phase 
out cancer-causing pesticides and ozone-depleting chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman has repeatedly attacked Gallegly for not taking a position on the 
controversial proposed land swap involving entertainer Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres in Cheeseboro 
Canyon in southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the ranch, and 
park agencies would be allowed to buy an additional 4,600 acres of Hope's land 
in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for $10 million. Freiman opposes 
the swap. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he thinks it is inappropriate for a federal official to take a 
position on the swap until environmental impact reports on it are completed and 
until local officials including the Ventura County Board of Supervisors hold 
public hearings on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
But Freiman noted that Gallegly asked National Park Service chief James M. 
Ridenour in a June, 1989, letter for an expeditious ruling on the swap, a 
request that came long before the reports were finished earlier this year. 
Freiman pointed out that Gallegly has accepted $4,300 in contributions since 
1987 from a developer who hopes to build luxury homes on Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly denied that he was influenced by the donations, citing his continued 
neutrality on the issue as proof. He added that he sent the letter to Ridenour 
because constituents were eager to know the Park Service's position on the 
much-debated exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman also is trying to make an issue of Gallegly's vote against legislation 
that would have granted workers up to three months of unpaid leave per year for 
childbirth or to care for sick family members. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he voted against the legislation, which was vetoed by President 
Bush, because it would cost thousands of jobs and damage the ability of the 
United States to compete economically with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of campaign cash, Freiman, a native of the Bronx in New York, 
has thrown himself into the fray with a commitment unusual for many 
under-financed political neophytes. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, he quit his job as a tax attorney with a Camarillo firm after his 
bosses told him to choose between working or campaigning full time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial sacrifice, Freiman left the firm and returned to his 
previous vocation as a TV writer. Though he graduated from New York University 
Law School with an advanced degree in 1975, Freiman spent most of the past 15 
years writing for various comedy and action series. He took up lawyering, in 
fact, only after the 1988 Hollywood writers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
His credits include scripts for "Sanford and Son" and "Good Times." He also 
worked for a short-lived ABC show about a police robot called "Holmes and 
Yo-Yo." 
</P>
<P>
"We had important discussions such as what does a robot eat?" Freiman said with 
a smile. 
</P>
<P>
To make ends meet during the campaign, Freiman, who is married and has two 
young sons, is acting as a story consultant for the daytime soap opera "Santa 
Barbara." He also authored a script about Zorro for cable television and is 
collecting residuals from past shows. 
</P>
<P>
But as the campaign wears on, Freiman has lost many of his illusions about the 
nobility of politics. 
</P>
<P>
He described the Washington candidates' school as being more like a trade show, 
as political consultants acting as instructors hammered away at the need for 
candidates to spend heavily on polling, television commercials, debate coaching 
and other services -- which, for a price, the consultants would provide. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman described a breakfast held during the school at which he and other 
first-time candidates met with directors of political action committees, the 
powerful campaign arms of corporations and unions that provide large chunks of 
money to many congressional incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, however, made Freiman feel more like a courtesan being paraded 
before potential customers than a candidate stating his deepest political 
principles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my naivete, I thought that, if you agreed with issues that political action 
committees espouse, that the PACs would provide you with support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But what it turned out to be for them was an investment in stock. They are 
only looking for stocks that are going to win. And the safest stock is an 
incumbent or a challenger for an open seat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of cynicism among political professionals, however, has been more 
than offset by the devotion of people in his district who have volunteered as 
campaign workers, Freiman said. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have incredible gratitude for people who give up their time to help 
you out," he said. "It just makes you feel so good about the process." 
</P>
<P>
Ever the writer with an eye out for material, Freiman is keeping a campaign 
diary and plans to write a book about his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either going to be titled, 'How I Got Elected to Congress on $10,000 or 
Less,' or 'How I Ran for Congress on $10,000 or Less,' " he said. 
</P>

DISPLACED LOCKHEED WORKERS COUNSELED ON JOBS, ATTITUDES; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: A FEDERALLY SPONSORED CENTER IS HELPING THE BURBANK FIRM'S EMPLOYEES 
FIND NEW POSITIONS, BUT ADJUSTING TO LOWER PAY WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR MANY.

<P>
Lockheed's decision this year to dramatically curtail operations in Burbank is 
bringing an end to a gilded age for thousands of aerospace workers who earned a 
good living bolting together masterpieces of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Former workers in the secret Lockheed division that built the radar-eluding 
Stealth fighter are having to learn how to look for jobs in what they 
sardonically call "the real world," where stenographers aren't paid $31,000 a 
year. It's a rude shock to people accustomed to a financial cushion that 
allowed even mid-level professionals to buy small ranches in quiet communities. 
</P>
<P>
That shock was evident in the numbed faces of displaced workers filing into the 
federally sponsored Verdugo Job Center, which is helping the aerospace workers 
find new careers. The center is in the once-bustling Machinists Union hall on 
Victory Boulevard in Burbank, where layoffs have shrunk the 11 union locals to 
just two, leaving plenty of room for the counselors trying to help people such 
as Ted Moss. 
</P>
<P>
Balding and quiet, Moss, 38, carried a plastic bag full of awards, mementos 
from a job well done but no guarantee of a future that will allow him even to 
buy a decent used car for a daughter headed off to college. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dong had a decade of experience in the secret Skunk Works that built the 
Stealth fighter, but needed help deciding what to put on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Ford, 59, fidgeted during her counseling session. Having narrowly 
survived two previous layoffs, she was expecting to be bumped from her 
stenographer's job any day. She summed up the fears about the future that many 
of the workers felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they're trying to give me a heart attack," she said of the 
company's management, laughing nervously. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations in the bars and half-filled luncheonettes near the plant 
reflected a growing sense that a special era, when Southern California reigned 
supreme in the aerospace industry, had reached a turning point. "Burbank is 
drying up," one former employee said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Lockheed Corp.'s restructuring is complete, last year's work force 
of 13,000 will be reduced to as few as 2,000, company spokesman James Ragsdale 
said. A thousand jobs are going to Marietta, Ga., the new headquarters of 
Lockheed's aeronautical systems division, while an unspecified number are being 
transferred to the Palmdale plant, where advanced weapons will be built. A 
half-dozen buildings, housing the administrative offices of the advanced 
division, will be all that is left of Lockheed's 320-acre Burbank plant. 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale blamed the cutbacks on several factors. The company has completed work 
on four major contracts, including the Stealth fighter and the P-3 subchaser 
that the Navy had been ordering since 1962. At the same time, the defense 
industry as a whole has slowed down dramatically in the era of superpower 
detente. He said he had heard that industrywide, Southern California may lose 
20,000 aerospace jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company decided to close the Burbank plant, which had been in 
operation since 1928 and was its oldest. But while the jobs are leaving, most 
of the workers are staying, too old or too settled to pack up and move 
cross-country. Many were not even offered the chance to move to take new jobs 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
So those left behind are learning to change their lifestyles, cutting back on 
expenses to save money where they can, scrimping and saving on restaurant meals 
and putting off large purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, of Los Angeles, who made parts for airplanes and missiles for 20 years, 
was laid off Feb. 2. He tried to get a job with competing Northrop Corp. in 
Pico Rivera, but met a job freeze. So for now, he makes do with a $190-a-week 
unemployment check, which doesn't go very far compared to the $617 a week he 
used to make. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to tighten up," he said. "As far as recreation goes, I don't do too 
much of anything. I go to the park because it doesn't cost much, except gas 
money." 
</P>
<P>
He's not a homeowner, so he isn't facing a big monthly mortgage. However, his 
daughter is going off to college to become a lawyer and needs a car. He would 
like to buy one for her but can't do it now. "I told her I want to help her 
out. But I've got to go back to work." 
</P>
<P>
So Moss came to the Verdugo Job Center looking for tips. The job center, 
sponsored by the Verdugo Private Industry Council, offers instruction that 
amounts almost to a course in Job Hunting 101. Drake Beam Morin Inc. of New 
York City, which administers the center, often helps people affected by 
industrywide shake-ups to adjust. Its counselors were sent in to help laid-off 
General Motors workers in Detroit, as well as Texas workers after the Southwest 
oil boom went bust in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
New arrivals to the job center attend a one-day group workshop that coaches 
them in modern job-hunting skills that have surprisingly little to do with 
scanning the want ads. "Most people find jobs through networking," George 
Enoch, manager of the job center, said. The next visit is for private 
counseling and advice on constructing a compelling resume. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Ford was still on the job as a stenographer, but just barely, and she 
came in during a break, her ID badge still clipped to her sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be helping you focus on your job wants and develop ways to sell 
yourself convincingly," her counselor, Bill White, said. "We're going to video 
you, and at the next session we will develop a reference list." That taken care 
of, he wanted to know how she was holding up. "How do you feel? Depressed? If 
you're angry or depressed you can't go out and find a job." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fearful," she said. "I'm not 25 years old anymore. Yet I have to work." 
</P>
<P>
He nods, asks her salary. "I make $14.28 an hour," she said, sheepishly. "I 
would like to make the same, but I'm not convinced I will." 
</P>
<P>
It was a familiar refrain, but White counseled against self-defeating 
attitudes. "What is the magic sentence?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to consider it?" she said hesitantly. 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. "Right. Then you come back here and we'll teach you to negotiate" to 
get more money. 
</P>
<P>
The counselors said they were confident they could eventually get most people 
back to work. They could not guarantee, however, that the pay would measure up. 
</P>
<P>
Ford had already begun watching expenses. "We didn't take a vacation this year 
for the first time in 20 years," she said. "Usually, we drive back to New York 
to see all the family." 
</P>
<P>
She seemed a little concerned for her husband, who had become reserved at home. 
"He's not saying a lot, but I guess it's on his mind," she said of her imminent 
layoff. 
</P>
<P>
White said later that Ford was typical of laid-off employees. "They go through 
the whole grief cycle. Anger and shock, denial, depression, then acceptance." 
The counselors watch for any worker who is too upset and steer him or her to a 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Several former employees, active in the effort to keep Lockheed from moving, 
said they had heard of two or three suicides among ex-workers. Ragsdale said he 
had heard of one suicide involving a middle-management employee, but was not 
sure it was linked to the job. 
</P>
<P>
While union activists say they are still trying to persuade the company to 
stay, Braxton Berkley, one of those on the International Assn. of Machinists 
Committee to Save Jobs, is one of many Lockheed workers who have taken 
lower-paying jobs with Continental Airlines. "A lot of people from Lockheed are 
out there now. The problem there is, you can't go to work for $9 an hour once 
you made $14," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If there are stages in the healing process, Darlene New, 43, is still in the 
anger phase. She is angry at Lockheed and at her supervisors for letting her 
go. And for the way it was done. On June 29, she was called into the manager's 
office and informed that she would be leaving her $39,000-a-year job in 
Advanced Development Projects, she said. She burst into tears of humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been laid off from any job," she said. "You feel, 'Oh God, didn't I 
do the job well?' " 
</P>
<P>
It was especially devastating because she was not prepared for it. Having had a 
top-secret clearance, she was sure she would survive any layoffs. "I thought I 
would be at Lockheed for the rest of my life. It is like part of you is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Though her husband also works at Lockheed, the family needed her paycheck to 
help pay the mortgage on their 2 1/2-acre ranch in quiet Leona Valley near 
Palmdale. So instead of filing for unemployment, she went right out and found a 
job selling BMWs in Lancaster. It wasn't a good time, or place, to sell 
high-priced, sporty cars. In a month, she sold only two cars and quit. 
</P>
<P>
The family has withdrawn money from savings to pay bills, and the money her two 
sons earned by selling their 4-H animals at the Antelope Valley Fair was used 
to buy school clothes. New recently found a second job that starts in October 
and pays 40% less than what she made at Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one to stand around 10 hours and do nothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was disappointed by the lower wage she had to accept but realized that she 
had had it pretty good for a long time. "We were all overpaid, I feel. Out in 
what we now call the real world, people don't make that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
She still goes back to Burbank sometimes. She notices the business area around 
Lockheed is eerily quiet these days. "We went to one of our favorite 
restaurants on Burbank Boulevard and the manager came over to talk," she said. 
" 'Look at how empty our place is,' " New recalled him lamenting. The 
proprietor wasn't sure he would be able to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just sad," she said.

A MOTHER'S 21-YEAR QUEST ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: THE STRUGGLE FOR BILLIE JACOX ENDS AT GRAVESIDE OF HER SON, KILLED 
DURING A RESCUE MISSION IN THE NIGERIAN PROVINCE OF BIAFRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.W. McGARRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just over 21 years after the death of her son in a long-forgotten American 
rescue operation in Africa, a San Fernando Valley woman will visit his grave at 
Forest Lawn this week and place a single rose on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to observe the anniversary of his death at the graveside for the 
first time will mark her victory in a struggle with two governments for more 
than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Until two months ago the body of Richard Jacox lay in a deliberately unmarked 
and obscured grave in the Nigerian province of Biafra, where he died in the 
crash of a C-97 cargo plane loaded with fish and cornmeal as it tried to land 
on a jungle highway at night. 
</P>
<P>
Jacox was one of the volunteers who flew for the United States as part of an 
international airlift to bring food to the starving Biafrans during their 
unsuccessful war to secede from Nigeria. Many of them, such as Jacox, belonged 
to a California Air National Guard unit based until recently at Van Nuys 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the crash, his widowed mother, Billie Jacox, has badgered the State 
Department, the Nigerian government, United Nations diplomats -- anyone she 
thought could help return her son's remains. They have included every U.S. 
President since Lyndon B. Johnson. She acquired drawers and boxfuls of 
correspondence and stories about her campaign in American and Nigerian 
newspapers, all leading nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick was my life," Jacox said. The walls and shelves of her home are filled 
with photos of her son. She could not live with the thought that he would not 
be buried in the family cemetery plot with her and her late husband, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians regarded the airlift mercy pilots as mercenaries who prolonged 
the civil war. Until this year they rejected all Jacox's overtures. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't even let me have a visa to get into the country to see the 
grave," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacox's quest took a turn for the better after she told her saga to Santa 
Barbara attorney Edward Medvene last year. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife knew Billie as a friend," Medvene said recently. "She was at a 
stalemate and asked me to take a look at this thing. It was an incredible 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Medvene contacted John W. Foley Jr., a retired State Department officer who had 
tried several times to help Billie Jacox. Foley was connected to the airlift as 
director for Nigerian affairs during the Biafran War. He had located the graves 
of Jacox and about 25 other airmen who died in the airlift before he left 
Africa in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"Foley confirmed that her story was accurate and that he had been to the 
cemetery and seen the grave," Medvene said. "He thought a letter to the State 
Department from someone prominent in the government might help." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. portion of the airlift -- organized by an interdenominational 
religious group called Joint Church Aid -- had received support from the Nixon 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
And Medvene had an old friend, Herbert W. Miller, Nixon's Washington attorney. 
"I called Miller last October and asked if Nixon would help," Medvene said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Miller, Nixon wrote to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger, suggesting that relations with Nigeria had become sufficiently 
friendly to ask for the return of Jacox's body on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger's intervention succeeded, Miller said. Foley, coming out of 
retirement for one mission as a favor to Billie Jacox, went to Nigeria with 
State Department backing in June, located and disinterred the body, Miller and 
Medvene said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley declined to comment, saying "the State Department made a commitment to 
the Nigerians that we wouldn't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Foley had described finding the graves near St. 
Teresa's, a Catholic Church in the jungle next to the two-lane road that was 
once a makeshift airstrip, Biafra's only link with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
A caretaker "still had a diagram that showed where the graves were, and he took 
me to the site, way back in the boondocks," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
The food airlift was one of the most dramatic chapters of the Biafran war of 
1967-70, in which the oil-rich eastern provinces of Nigeria tried to secede. 
</P>
<P>
Nigerian federal forces occupied the ports and food became critically short in 
Biafra. Western newspapers and TV screens were filled with pictures of starving 
children, emaciated stick figures or with bellies bloated by kwashiorkor, a 
wasting disease caused by protein deficiency. Most of the estimated 600,000 to 
1 million deaths in the war were blamed on kwashiorkor. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure mounted from world public opinion to do something for the starving 
Biafrans. Church groups and the International Red Cross massed cargo planes on 
Portuguese-held islands off the coast of Nigeria, a few hours flying time from 
the improvised airstrip at Uli. 
</P>
<P>
Because gunrunners flew the same routes, Nigeria regarded the airlift planes as 
legitimate military targets and sometimes attacked them with MIGs and 
antiaircraft guns. The threat from fighters restricted the airlift to night 
flights. Landing on the thinly paved road, by the light of kerosene torches or 
auto headlights, was perilous. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the airlift in the summer of 1969, after the United States had 
become involved, 40 flights a night carried 500 tons of food into Uli. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jacox, then 25, died there because he did a friend a favor. 
</P>
<P>
A Glendale native and 1961 Birmingham High School graduate, he joined the Air 
National Guard's 146th Tactical Airlift Wing at Van Nuys Airport in 1965. 
Because the wing had been equipped with the C-97 cargo planes being used in the 
airlift, dozens of its members volunteered for it, saying they were acting as 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Jacox's mother knows far more than she otherwise would have about her son's 
last hours because of a remarkable coincidence: Her brother, Robert J. Leigh, 
an aircraft mechanic at Van Nuys Airport, was with him. 
</P>
<P>
About sundown on the evening of Sept. 26, 1969, Richard Jacox was reading a 
paperback book on the steps of Fat Freddy's, a bar on the Portuguese island of 
Sao Tome where the airlift crews hung out. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow cargo-handler from the Air Guard back in the Valley asked for a favor. 
</P>
<P>
Would Jacox switch planes with him that night? If the friend flew on the plane 
Jacox was supposed to be on, the pilot would let the friend log training time 
as a flight engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Jacox said. He headed for the flight line, tucking his novel into his 
pocket. It was "Fate Is the Hunter," a book by Ernest K. Gann about how casual 
decisions lead airmen into peril. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours later, the plane Jacox had volunteered to work on crashed 
into the jungle and exploded, killing all five men aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh, whose job was to work on the planes in Sao Tome, saw them take off and 
return each night, but he had never been to Biafra. Not until he heard his 
nephew had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
He volunteered to join a crash investigation team of four Americans who went in 
on a West German DC-6 the following night, because he wanted a death 
certificate for insurance purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for the fact that he was my nephew, I wouldn't have tried to be a 
hero and get in there," he said. "There was antiaircraft firing at us on the 
way in and on the way out." 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was scattered over a large area covered with debris. His nephew's 
body apparently had been hurled clear of the plane as it disintegrated. It had 
not been found. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane cartwheeled and busted open and exploded," he said. "They had about 
35,000 pounds of beans and grain and stuff in burlap sacks. It flew all over. A 
nun found the body the next day. It was burned pretty bad, but she recovered 
his wallet with it. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a grave dug for Dickie in the churchyard. The bodies were in little 
plywood boxes. The hole wasn't too deep." 
</P>
<P>
That is where Foley found the body in June. He escorted it as far as London, 
from where it was shipped to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of July 3, about 30 people, including Medvene's wife, attended 
a reburial ceremony at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills. The minister who conducted 
the service paid tribute to Billie Jacox's long struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited there until the grave was all filled in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tombstone now with his name on it. It bothered me all those years to 
think of him in an unmarked grave. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally have peace now."

They were just sitting there expressionless in front of their lockers, as if 
they had been told to wait for someone to pass out the dunce caps. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers failed their latest exam, 17-7, to the Houston Oilers, and 
Sunday's lesson in defeat was so elementary: Don't be stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams that have beaten us haven't been any better than we are," Charger 
quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "They're just smarter." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 48,762 fans who were left to contemplate the latest slapstick 
routine in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium apparently agreed. As the Chargers 
(1-3) filed off the field, the fans in the stands filled their earholes with 
all sorts of not-so-nice suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"We played stupid, there's no doubt about it," linebacker Gary Plummer said. 
"To jump offsides as many times as we did to give them second chances, you 
can't win in the NFL like that. If you're a dominating team like the 49ers, 
maybe you get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the San Diego Chargers," he said, "and right now we're a team trying to 
find ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
If they had a penalty box in football, that would be the first place to look 
for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A first-quarter unsportsmanlike penalty on linebacker Junior Seau on a 
missed field-goal attempt by Tony Zendejas allowed the Oilers to regroup and 
score two plays later on Warren Moon's nine-yard pass to Drew Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A second-quarter offsides call on defensive lineman Lee Williams on third 
and 10 from the Chargers' 27 gave Moon another play to complete a 22-yard 
touchdown pass to Ernest Givins. 
</P>
<P>
"You make those kind of mistakes in the NFL, and you're going to lose," Plummer 
said. "There's no doubt in my mind that we can beat the Houston Oilers. The 
final score is 17-7, and you take away seven of those points because of a 
stupid play, and it's an awful close game. Anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
And it did. It was the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Seau, and it was 
called for taking a running jump and trying to block Zendejas' 40-yard field 
goal try. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said he was advised by the officials that a player cannot 
taking a running jump to try and block a field goal. But he checked the NFL 
rulebook and said it indicates instead that a player should not use his hand or 
hands on a teammate to gain additional height. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do that; he didn't touch anybody," Henning said. "But he shouldn't 
have been jumping in the first place. He was supposed to be back there spying 
for a fake." 
</P>
<P>
But Seau jumped, and down went the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a stupid penalty, and it directly turned into seven points," Plummer 
said. "That's something that's basic. It's something Larry (Pasquale, special 
teams coordinator) has gone over. It just so happens Junior was holding out and 
wasn't here to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
"But you're a professional and that's your job. That hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (2-2) advanced from the Chargers' 23 to the 12 on the penalty. After 
Moon ran for three yards, he waited for Hill to get behind safety Lester Lyles 
and then connected for the touchdown. It was the first time the Oilers had 
scored in the first quarter this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, meanwhile, went scoreless on their first offensive possession in 
four games when Fuad Reveiz went wide right from 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have field goals kicked from inside the 20-yard line," Coach Dan 
Henning said after Reveiz went on to also miss from 27 yards in the fourth 
quarter. "I would think that we would consider changing kickers." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers could be forgiven for thinking the same thing. Although Zendejas was 
granted a reprieve on his miss from 45 yards by the penalty on Seau, he came 
back in the second quarter to miss from 36 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
That kept the Chargers in striking distance, and with time running out in the 
half, Tolliver went 27 yards to Anthony Miller to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Moon still had 1:41 remaining. He took his team to the Chargers' 27 on 
third and 10 and threw incomplete into the end zone to wide receiver Bernard 
Ford. But Williams was caught tiptoeing offsides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a stupid play by a veteran ballplayer that shouldn't happen," 
Williams said. "There's no excuses for it. It's just something that shouldn't 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Givins split the coverage of Martin Bayless and Lyles, and 
Moon beat the blitz to complete a 22-yard scoring play and build a 14-7 
halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a lot more to hurt themselves than we did to hurt ourselves," Houston 
Coach Jack Pardee said. "We respected their pass rush a lot; we threw the ball 
quickly, and Warren did an excellent job of recognizing the blitz." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Tolliver was not so good. On his team's first possession in the 
third quarter, he tried to go to H-back Craig McEwen, only to fire the ball 
into the hands of Houston cornerback Cris Dishman. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver opened the fourth quarter throwing a second interception. With the 
ball on the Houston 37, he tried to squeeze a pass into Anthony Miller, but 
safety Bubba McDowell was on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first interception, I thought it was a good throw," Tolliver said after 
completing 14 of 25 passes for 174 yards. "On the second I didn't see the 
coverage. It was a good decision but a bad throw." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers continued to chew up yardage in the second half behind the passing 
of Moon, who completed 27 of 46 for 355 yards, but they were thwarted by a 
stubborn defense near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Gill Byrd intercepted Moon's pass intended for Givins in the end 
zone to stop a third-quarter scoring chance, and the Oilers were forced to 
settle for a 34-yard Zendejas field goal in the fourth quarter after failing to 
push the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, while trailing, 17-7, made it to the Oilers' three-yard line with 
more than three minutes to play. But Tolliver was sacked for a loss of seven, 
and after a pair of incomplete passes, Henning elected to send Reveiz on for a 
27-yard field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz's kick off the infield dirt was wide left, and the Oilers went on to run 
out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," Chargers General Manager Bobby Beathard said. "They have to 
believe they have to overcome some of these mistakes. I think we're better than 
this, but even the good teams can't afford to make the mistakes."

PADRES FEEL BENEFITS OF REDS' PARTY

<P>
The Cincinnati Reds, staggering into the clubhouse Sunday morning after their 
late-night celebration, dressed oh, so quietly, and then stumbled around on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, clinching their first National League West Division title since 1979 
Saturday night, looked like a team that had been partying heartily, losing, 
3-0, to the Padres in front of a subdued crowd of 32,407 at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We played like we had a hangover," Reds Manager Lou Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Reds managed only four hits off Padre starter Derek Lilliquist 
(5-11) in six innings and just another off Greg Harris, who pitched the final 
three innings for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
But most important to the Reds was not the three-game sweep by the Padres but 
the lower back injury sustained by infielder Billy Doran. Doran, who has a 
history of lower back spasms, was admitted Saturday night to Christ Hospital 
and is questionable for the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"Doran is a problem," Piniella said. "The information I have is not very good. 
I was looking forward to having his bat in the lineup in the playoffs, but now, 
it doesn't look good. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Luis Rosa, the Chicago Cubs' Latin America coordinator, could be rejoining the 
Padres. At least, that's what he has been telling people. It's unknown whether 
Rosa indeed will return to the organization, particularly with the recent 
firing of Jack McKeon, but Padre officials say it's doubtful. Rosa was fired 
five years ago by the Padres. He signed Roberto and Sandy Alomar and Benito 
Santiago. . . . The Padres likely will start Eric Show in the season finale 
Wednesday against the Dodgers. Show has 99 career victories with the team, and 
Manager Greg Riddoch says he'd like to allow him the opportunity to achieve the 
milestone. The alternative is Bruce Hurst, whose turn comes up Wednesday, but 
he told Riddoch that he'd be willing to step aside for Show. . . . Hurst, a 
diehard BYU fan, took a lot of ribbing for BYU's defeat Saturday night to 
Oregon. He walked into the clubhouse, and on the chalkboard, read the final 
score. He turned to his locker, and there were three different signs, one 
revealing the score, one reading, "BYU Who?" "Nice guys, huh?" said Hurst, 
laughing and wearing a BYU baseball shirt. BOB NIGHTENGALE

MURPHY'S LAW WAS THE RULE LAST WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That was the week that wasn't for the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Last week was the NFL's Murphy Law's week: Everything that could go wrong, did. 
</P>
<P>
It made league officials long for the good ol' days of two weeks ago when Jerry 
Glanville made headlines by calling Jack Pardee a "jerk." Glanville would have 
been relegated to the back pages last week. 
</P>
<P>
The headline event, of course, was the tawdry situation in New England, where 
Patriots players made obscene comments and gestures to a Boston Herald 
reporter, Lisa Olson, and the team's owner, Victor Kiam, then was reported to 
have called her a "classic bitch." 
</P>
<P>
Kiam has since apologized, the league has appointed a special counsel to 
investigate, the Herald has called for a boycott of Sunday's game with the New 
York Jets and the suspension of Kiam by the NFL, and the National Organization 
for Women has called for a boycott of products made by Kiam's Remington 
company. 
</P>
<P>
That was only the most publicized of the league's problems last week. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Coliseum, a Pittsburgh fan from Arizona attending the game 
between the Steelers and Raiders was beaten and left in critical condition by 
Raiders fans. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Joe Phillips, the Chargers' nose tackle was sidelined for at 
least eight weeks after being beaten by three men outside a restaurant. He had 
left the restaurant with a woman, who wasn't his wife, and exchanged words with 
the men, who apparently made a comment about the woman, before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
At Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Jets Coach Bruce Coslet was involved in a 
verbal exchange with a rowdy fan. He told the fan, "Why don't you come down 
here and say that?" Coslet said the incident was "kind of funny," but General 
Manager Dick Steinberg said he'd speak to him about it. 
</P>
<P>
Last, but not least, the NFL found itself in a hassle in Washington. Rep. Peter 
DeFazio, D-Ore., said the league is using Super Bowl tickets and expansion 
teams as bargaining chips to gain votes in support of a measure to ban sports 
lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
DeFazio charged the league told representatives of states seeking expansion 
teams that they wouldn't be considered for a team if they favored sports 
lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
"They are being told ... they'd better back off, otherwise they are not going 
to get an expansion team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The league admitted lobbying on the issue, but denied the other charges. 
</P>
<P>
This just happens to be the first bye week of the season. The four National 
Football Conference West teams get the weekend off. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate the whole league can't take a bye and start the season over on 
a better note. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a grand day for John Hannah, the offensive lineman who 
was the best player ever to play for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired, he was involved in a lawsuit with former owner Billy Sullivan 
over deferred pay. Kiam settled the suit and the Patriots are welcoming him 
back into the team family by retiring his jersey Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But, the occasion is being overshadowed by the Olson controversy and the 
proposed boycott of the game. The way the Patriots draw, it may be hard to tell 
if the boycott is effective or the fans are just apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"If my luck ran any better, I couldn't stand it," Hannah said. "I'm honored 
they're going to retire my jersey. It's not appropriate for me to comment on 
the situation. I do want to say this, though. There are a lot of solid 
individuals on this team... but they're tagged with the image and that's just 
not right. If some players did what was reported they did, they were totally 
wrong. Their actions don't represent the team as a whole."

Baldomero gave retired jockey Bill Shoemaker his first graded-stakes victory as 
a trainer by capturing Sunday's Grade II, $200,000 Golden Harvest Handicap at 
Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Baldomero, a five-year-old mare ridden by Gary Stevens, got through along the 
rail and held on for a head victory in the 1 3/8-mile event over the Sawyer 
Turf Course. Nine 3-year-old and older fillies and mares competed in what ended 
as a three-horse photo finish with Freya Stark and Foresta. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, who retired in February as the world's winningest jockey, won the 
Golden Harvest three consecutive times as a jockey, taking both divisions in 
1982 and then in 1983.

Soviets Catching Up on Debt Payments: The Soviet Union is repaying overdue debt 
to foreign firms, but not as fast as it would like, one of the country's top 
bankers said in an interview published over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda quoted Yuri Moskovsky, head of the Bank for 
Foreign Economic Affairs, as saying that more than $1.75 billion has been 
repaid the past two months. Late payments by Soviet foreign trade 
organizations, which were until recently prompt payers, have worried Western 
creditors this year. But bankers say matters improved after Moscow borrowed 
$3.2 billion from West Germany in June.

AN EVER-RESTLESS RONSTADT GROWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Ronstadt's first pop-rock tour in almost a decade reminds us of how 
excellent a singer she is . . . and how restless an artist. 
</P>
<P>
First, it's misleading to say that it was the "old" Ronstadt at the Santa 
Barbara County Bowl on Saturday night, the first of 10 Southern California 
stops on her new "Cry Like a Rainstorm" tour. (She performed Sunday night with 
the Neville Brothers at San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre.) 
</P>
<P>
She did sing nearly a dozen of her old hits -- from the energetic "It's So 
Easy" and "Tumbling Dice" to the delicate and dreamy "Blue Bayou" and "Ooh Baby 
Baby." 
</P>
<P>
And she acted pretty much the same as before -- which means Ronstadt still 
doesn't quite know what to do between songs. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a denim jacket over a black sweater vest along with black stretch 
pants, she mostly just stood around waiting for the seven band members to start 
the next number, smiling sweetly and rarely speaking to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
And the old songs, while enjoyable on a nostalgic level, mainly served to 
demonstrate how Ronstadt has improved as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
She had already established herself as the premier female voice in mainstream 
pop-rock when she decided at the start of the '80s to look for new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
When that search led to such musically distant territory as Gilbert &amp; 
Sullivan, Mexican folk music and pre-rock pop standards, there was fear among 
some longtime fans that Ronstadt's rock instincts might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
But the discipline of working in those styles has heightened Ronstadt's ability 
to sing pop-rock -- as revealed Saturday in the added authority and control in 
her handling of the early hits. 
</P>
<P>
And she took advantage of that growth by opening the show with a knockout punch 
of eight of the early favorites in a row. It was such a dramatic beginning that 
even a 13-minute rain delay after the first number failed to lessen the impact. 
</P>
<P>
While she finished the concert with another group of oldies, the artistic heart 
of the show rested in the eight songs in between the opening and closing 
flurries: five Jimmy Webb compositions and three duets with Aaron Neville. 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt, 44, may be ready to concentrate on pop-rock again, but she is going 
to do it in ways that have new meaning for her. There are songs on "Cry Like a 
Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind," her lastest album, that recall the tone of her 
pop-rock successes from the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Ronstadt -- backed on the tour by such allies as guitarist Andrew Gold, 
drummer Russ Kunkel and singer Rosemary Butler -- left little doubt that it was 
the Webb ballads and the Neville duets from the album that interested her most. 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt's faith in Webb is justified, but the danger with some of his songs is 
that their sweeping romanticism invites instrumental over-embellishment. That's 
a problem on the "Rainstorm" album and still a lesser one live, where the 
intimacy of Ronstadt's vocals is sometimes sabotaged by some unnecessary 
keyboard touches. 
</P>
<P>
She has another standout partner in Neville, whose high, heavenly, 
vibrato-style voice makes him one of the most distinctive and appealing 
stylists in pop. Their version of the tender "Don't Know Much," a recent hit 
single for them, was so striking Saturday that it was hard for them to hold the 
audience's attention on two good but less dramatic numbers that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the minor hitches in the Webb and Neville sets, however, Ronstadt 
approached them with such commitment and purpose that she seemed a bit distant 
from the older pop-rock hits when she returned to them to close the set. 
</P>
<P>
Just as David Bowie's "Sound + Vision" tour demonstrated, there is a time when 
artists no longer relate to songs that once worked for them. That's why it's 
hard to imagine Ronstadt's building future tours around the old hits. She'll 
always be able to reach back for some meaningful songs to help the audience 
revive some memories. 
</P>
<P>
But the lesson of this return to pop-rock is that Ronstadt is still an artist 
in search of herself, which is one of the best things you can say about a 
quality singer who has been turning out hits now for more than 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
A bonus of the tour -- which, following a scheduled stop Sunday at the Open Air 
Theatre in San Diego, moves Oct. 9 to the Universal Amphitheatre for seven 
shows and then to the Pacific Amphitheatre on Oct. 20 -- is the Neville 
Brothers band. 
</P>
<P>
The long-admired group's 45-minute set spotlighted Aaron's vocals, the group's 
eclectic mix of jazz, reggae and New Orleans R&amp;B strains and new songs that 
often express humanitarian ideals. The music was well-received, but the impact 
might be heightened even further by giving more time for Aaron to reach for the 
R&amp;B intimacy of songs like "Tell It Like It Is," his '60s hit that was 
featured Saturday, or "Bird on a Wire," which was not.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: STYLISH 'AVENGERS' RETURNS ON A&amp;E; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE CABLE NETWORK TODAY BEGINS AIRING ALL 134 EPISODES OF THE '60S 
CULT CLASSIC, A DRYLY WITTY BRITISH SERIES ABOUT A PAIR OF SOPHISTICATED CRIME 
FIGHTERS.

<P>
"The Avengers," a British series that ran on ABC from 1966 to 1969, resurfaces 
in all its suave and satirical grandeur today on cable's Arts &amp; 
Entertainment network. 
</P>
<P>
Not included, happily, is "The New Avengers," an inferior sequel from Britain 
that CBS briefly tried as late-night programming in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, A &amp; E will air all 134 of the episodes that paired Patrick Macnee 
first with Honor Blackman, then with Diana Rigg and finally with Linda Thorson. 
The black-and-white episodes -- encompassing all of Blackman's work and a 
portion of Rigg's -- did not air on ABC, although the latter did have a run in 
syndication. 
</P>
<P>
The A &amp; E package is out of sequence, opening with Macnee-Rigg episodes, 
followed by Macnee-Thorson and then Macnee-Blackman. 
</P>
<P>
In a curious scheduling move that is bound to severely limit the show's 
audience, A &amp; E is airing "The Avengers" on the West Coast at 3 p.m. 
weekdays, with repeats the next day at 8 a.m. In addition, all 134 episodes 
will be played in weekly installments on Saturdays at 3 p.m., beginning this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Avengers" airs three hours later in the East. Not until 1992 will A &amp; 
E have a second satellite transponder that will allow it to have separate feeds 
for different time zones. 
</P>
<P>
So until then . . . set those VCRs. This stylishly urbane, creatively written 
series about two British undercover agents is treat time. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "The Avengers" has several distinct personalities, with Macnee being 
the tie that binds them as the tough but charming John Steed, who lives among 
antiques, drives vintage cars and wears a bowler and Edwardian-style clothes 
that give him the look of a man astride two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
The 1962-63 episodes with Blackman as Steed's partner -- the cool, 
judo-efficient anthropologist Catherine Gale -- were shot on videotape, and 
have an interesting, live-TV look that seems almost rudimentary compared with 
American TV production from the same period. Moreover, many of these episodes 
are pure adventure yarns with dated Cold War themes. 
</P>
<P>
Flash forward now to the Thorson stint in 1969, when "The Avengers" was 
definitely in decline and Thorson appeared totally lost and almost spacey as 
Steed's new partner, Tara King. 
</P>
<P>
Ah . . . but separating Blackman and Thorson was tall, lithe Diana Rigg (these 
days the host of "Mystery" on PBS) as that wonderfully wry, very, very mod 
widow Emma Peel. (Her long-lost husband was ultimately discovered only when 
Rigg decided to leave the show and a device was needed to explain her absence.) 
</P>
<P>
As Steed-Peel, Macnee-Rigg was arguably the best, freshest, most-appealing 
evil-fighting pair ever to fill the small screen, their playfulness approaching 
the blithely carefree and cheeky banter of William Powell and Myrna Loy as 
Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Many have tried, but probably only Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd in 
"Moonlighting" came as close to the Charleses as Macnee-Rigg did. Unlike the 
Charleses and David and Maddy in "Moonlighting," however, Steed and Emma were 
not romantically inclined, despite sharing infinite sly glances. No kisses. Not 
even a pass. So platonic were these two, in fact, that Steed never once 
addressed his partner as Emma, only as Mrs. Peel (just as he addressed 
Blackman's character only as Mrs. Gale). 
</P>
<P>
After Rigg joined Macnee, the series tilted toward quasi-science-fiction 
themes, and many of the black-and-white episodes with Rigg have a strikingly 
dark and mysterious hue. 
</P>
<P>
Typical is one called "Two Many Christmas Trees." It's as good an hour of TV as 
can be found anywhere, using frightening images from quirky angles to ominously 
shroud a story about Steed being tormented by nightmares that merge with 
reality. It seems that a telepathic spy ring is at work. That this is weekly 
television is boggling, for it's brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
The color episodes beginning today are more whimsical, with their comically 
eccentric characters broadly played to the hilt by the usual store of fine 
British character actors. Each episode begins with Steed showing up out of the 
blue and handing his partner a small card saying: "Mrs. Peel, we're needed." 
</P>
<P>
Their presence is needed in today's premiere to investigate the strange deaths 
of members of the planet-watching British Venusian Society, whose bodies have 
been bleached white by a speeding ball of light that no one can explain. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, grown men are mysteriously reduced to quivering, whimpering, 
babbling infants, and Steed and Mrs. Peel want to know why. On Wednesday, a 
fellow secret agent is found floating in the Thames with an ancient dagger in 
his back and a 16th-Century bullet in his chest. It seems that Steed and Mrs. 
Peel will have to do some time traveling. 
</P>
<P>
What a bitingly black sense of humor this series exhibits in parodying British 
convention and depicting an upper-class English realm that exists today 
probably only in the fantasies of tourists. Meanwhile, the delightful Steed and 
Mrs. Peel tackle life and each assignment with supreme bemusement while never 
taking themselves very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
If only more of American TV were like them -- still fun and contemporary after 
all these years. 
</P>
<P>
"The Avengers," you're needed.

EX-ENVIRONMENT ACTIVIST WILL TAKE HELM AT EDISON; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITY: JOHN BRYSON CO-FOUNDED NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN 1970. 
OBSERVERS ARE WATCHING CLOSELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Twenty years ago, John Bryson helped found one of the nation's most aggressive 
environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the former environmental activist takes over as chairman and chief 
executive officer of one of Southern California's largest polluters. 
</P>
<P>
The significance -- and irony -- of Bryson's ascendancy to the top job at 
Southern California Edison Co. and its corporate parent, SCECorp, has not been 
lost on either the business community or the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
Members of both camps hope that Bryson will become a prototype for a new 
generation of top corporate executives who understand how to manage a major 
company in a climate of growing environmental awareness and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"John's appointment suggests that the carriers of the environmental ethic may 
now be able to carry out those ideas from a position of power, rather than as 
critics of those who hold power," said Richard E. Ayers, who was a co-founder 
with Bryson of the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1970. Ayers now heads 
the group, which is known for its readiness to sue government and business to 
enforce environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Bryson, who at 47 succeeds retiring Howard P. Allen, is widely 
viewed as an inspired public relations move for the image-conscious utility. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson stressed in interviews last week that his primary loyalty is to the 
utility's shareholders and he cautioned that "the company is not in the 
business of providing (for) social needs." 
</P>
<P>
"We will . . . provide electric service in a way that is very sensitive to the 
environment," Bryson said. "(But) there is nothing that says in every case, 
every environmentalist will like what we're doing. In the environmental 
community itself there are always disputes about one thing or another." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson's rise to the top at Edison -- which serves 5 million customers as the 
nation's largest operating electrical utility -- under-scores a move among U.S. 
corporations to recruit executives for high-profile positions who have 
experience with environmental issues. For many companies this reflects a 
growing awareness that it makes good business sense to pay closer attention to 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Government environmental regulations are getting tougher, particularly in the 
aftermath of the Exxon Valdez and other oil spills. A negative public image on 
environmental issues can cost companies dearly in lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon, Monsanto and other companies have added board members with environmental 
credentials. Even Walt Disney Co. recently created a new corporate position of 
vice president for environmental policy, appointing a marine biologist to the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best-known appointment came at Browning-Ferris Industries, the 
nation's second-largest waste management firm. The company was widely applauded 
when it hired William D. Ruckelshaus, two-time administrator of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, as CEO and chairman of the board in 1988. But 
some environmentalists have criticized Ruckelshaus' performance for falling 
short where environmental quality is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
SCECorp, whose profits are set by the California Public Utilities Commission, 
earned $778 million last year on revenues of $6.9 billion. As a 
government-regulated utility that operates, in effect, as a monopoly, Edison is 
under more pressure than most companies to be sensitive to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson, who joined Edison in 1984 as a senior vice president, will be put to 
the test as soon as he walks through the door at the company's Rosemead 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The utility is embroiled in a major controversy over its proposed $2.5-billion 
merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. Environmentalists and other 
critics, including state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, object to Edison's 
plans to shut down older power plants in San Diego and shift electricity 
generation to under-used facilities in the South Coast Air Basin, the nation's 
smoggiest urban area. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, criticism lingers over Edison's opposition to a far-reaching plan to 
bring Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties into 
compliance with federal clean air standards by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
Edison vigorously fought the plan and spent at least $1 million on a rival 
proposal. The utility agreed to support the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's version only after winning important financial concessions. The 
compromise has not yet been approved by EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson, whom one colleague describes as a "thoughtful, bulldog-type of man," 
has consistently supported Edison's position on both sensitive issues and sees 
no conflict with his environmentalist roots. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is concerned, correctly so I think, about a healthy environment," 
he said. "Energy, and particularly electricity, is at the heart of the modern 
economy and I would say we as electric utilities have an obligation to provide 
that reliably, but also promote sound environmental objectives." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson also may face management challenges within Edison. Some observers say 
mid-level executives at the utility have been slow to grasp environmental 
concerns and the importance of energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"Edison's middle management is still somewhat confused about whether it should 
be selling more electricity or less," said Amory Lovins, the well-known 
alternative energy proponent who is a Bryson supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson can be expected to attract critics among those opposed to the SDG&amp;E 
merger and others who believe the AQMD plan is not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have our differences," predicted William S. Shaffran, deputy city 
attorney of San Diego, where public and private agencies from the mayor to the 
Chamber of Commerce strongly oppose the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson raised eyebrows recently when he got the NRDC to endorse an Edison plan 
for offsetting air pollution increases expected to result from a merger with 
SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe the NRDC position helped persuade AQMD to go along with the 
pollution reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
"John asked me to take a look at this issue," NRDC's Ralph Cavanagh said. 
"There's no question, given John's connections in the environmental community, 
that he had the ability to get an issue on the (NRDC) agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Was it the "old-boy network" at work? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't describe it as the old-boy network," Bryson said. "It meant that I 
had the acquaintance of many of the NRDC (staff) and I hoped, based on my work 
in the past, I had the respect of those people." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson also opposes one of the favorite projects of environmental activists in 
California -- passage of Proposition 128, the environmental initiative on the 
Nov. 6 ballot known as "Big Green" by its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson praises the measure's "worthy objectives," but said he is concerned 
that, for the utility company, it may be too "inflexible." 
</P>
<P>
Many environmentalists have no illusions about where Bryson's main allegiances 
are now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Bryson's) loyal to his company," said Mary Nichols, a senior attorney 
in NRDC's Los Angeles office. "He's not going to do anything as CEO of Edison 
to compromise the interest of shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "I think his view of his responsibilities and philosophy of how 
he carries them out will clearly have a broader environmental component than 
any previous CEO of Southern California Edison -- or any other head of a 
utility in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce President Ray Remy, who occasionally plays 
tennis with Bryson, said the Edison executive called recently to ask whether 
his NRDC history posed a problem for the chamber. Remy told him it did not. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson, who lives in South Pasadena with his wife, Louise, and four children, 
said many people might consider his environmental career "the most intriguing 
part of my background. But, in terms of what I have learned and bring to the 
job . . . I don't know that I would say that NRDC contributed more." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bryson is expected to generally follow the course at Edison set by the 
departing Allen, the new chairman will have a decidedly different management 
style. Allen was known for his sometimes gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, in 
contrast to Bryson's conciliatory approach. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson's style and background in the environmental movement can be expected to 
not only reap public relations dividends, but prove to be an advantage in 
working with environmental groups and making life easier for Edison down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Bryson's unorthodox corporate career path, Allen worked at 
Edison since 1954 and gradually rose through the ranks. Before retiring, he 
served as president as well as chairman and chief executive officer. Bryson, 
however, will not hold all three positions. Executive Vice President Michael R. 
Peevey will serve under Bryson as president. 
</P>
<P>
Peevey may counterbalance Bryson's image as an environmentalist. Peevey's 
career includes a 10-year stint as president of the California Council for 
Environmental and Economic Balance, an industry-labor coalition that most often 
opposed environmental agendas. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson, who grew up in Portland, Ore., graduated from Stanford University and 
Yale Law School. In 1970, he was among a group that used a Ford Foundation 
grant to found the NRDC. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was an organization that would base itself on good science and 
careful advocacy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, NRDC is one of the country's leading environmental organizations. It has 
sued the federal government so often that some have called NRDC the "shadow 
EPA." More recently, NRDC sparked a nationwide controversy when it released a 
report warning that apples sprayed with the pesticide Alar were unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Bryson married and left the environmental group to work for a private 
law firm in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
By 1976, he was back in California, as chairman of the State Water Resources 
Control Board during the administration of Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
There he became a valuable intermediary for bureaucrats vying for the 
governor's ear. 
</P>
<P>
"John was an unfailing co-conspirator," said Michael Fischer, now executive 
director of the Sierra Club, who then was deputy director of the governor's 
Office of Planning and Research. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer recalled that Bryson would argue before Brown the merits of a proposal 
on behalf of Fischer and others. Then, Bryson would call them at night to 
report, "I think I've got Jerry softened up. Now's the time to come in." 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 through 1982, Bryson served as PUC president, generally receiving 
good marks. At one point, he joined commission members in slapping Edison with 
an $8-million fine for defying a PUC order. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a good regulator because he was fair," said Edward J. Tirello 
Jr., managing director and senior utility analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham 
&amp; Co. in New York. "I always felt he gave every side a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson has also gained a reputation as a deft negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Yergin, now president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and a 
seasoned consultant to government and business, first met Bryson during the 
early 1980s. Yergin recalled a conference on energy issues Bryson organized at 
the Stanford campus. 
</P>
<P>
"John put together this extraordinary conference that brought all sorts of 
people together from all different points of view in what were then very fierce 
energy debates. He shaped it into a reasoned and creative discussion. . . . It 
showed a real capacity to bring different people together and to focus on 
common concerns rather than knee-jerk antagonisms," Yergin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at that conference," said energy researcher Lovins. "I think if John 
hadn't taken up this line of work I think he would have been a fine diplomat. 
He's the kind of lawyer who tries to solve problems, not win fights." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson is a proponent of several ideas that have long been discussed by 
environmentalists, but only lately welcomed in utility company planning 
meetings. These often include the use of financial incentives to encourage 
energy conservation. The idea is to use government regulation to set 
conservation goals, but allow business to develop the technologies and methods 
to meet those goals. Energy savings, so the theory goes, will come more 
efficiently this way than if government dictates every move. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson notes that Edison recently proposed to the state that alternative and 
renewable energy sources -- such as co-generation and geothermal -- be given 
greater weight in planning for energy needs because they involve less potential 
environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sound from an environmental point of view," Bryson said, "but also 
just as plain sound business. It would be a mistake in judgment, I believe, to 
approve a coal plant today that had some level of carbon dioxide emission that 
would add to its cost about 15 years down the way -- while the geothermal 
facility might have less." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson's supporters see his appointment as an opportunity for a harmonious -- 
and unusual -- confluence of environmental and business interests. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great opportunity to see whether or not that confluence works," said 
PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk. "I've got a lot of optimism that says it does."

EXPATRIATE RETURNS HOME TO PRISON, NOT DEMOCRACY; 
</P>
<P>
TAIWAN: ZAU-NAN CHEN'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS SAY HE IS INNOCENT, NOT AN ADVOCATE 
OF VIOLENCE AND SEDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Taiwanese officials finally gave Zau-Nan Chen a visa to return to his 
homeland last spring, the Westminster businessman took it as a sign that 
Taiwan's new government was serious about democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the video store owner and democracy activist was arrested before he 
got off the plane at the Taipei airport. 
</P>
<P>
Though Chen is an Austrian citizen who has lived in the United States for a 
decade, Taiwanese officials jailed him and charged him with sedition. On Sept. 
22, he was convicted and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Taiwan government in Los Angeles said Chen had advocated 
the violent overthrow of the island's government. But Chen's wife and friends 
insist that he is a political prisoner who was targeted because of his 
association with Taiwan's most famous dissident, Hsu Hsin-liang. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1984, Chen was general manager of the Formosa Weekly, a 
now-defunct newspaper published by Hsu in Los Angeles, associates said. The 
newspaper criticized martial law in Taiwan and was a rallying point for the 
political opposition in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the evidence against Chen was a 1984 series of articles published by the 
newspaper about urban guerrilla warfare. The government alleges that the 
articles were aimed at "inciting people to start guerrilla warfare to overthrow 
the government on Taiwan," said Carol Cho, spokeswoman for the Coordination 
Council for North American Affairs, Taiwan's quasi-official diplomatic mission 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to paint Mr. Chen as a violent (person). He is not," said Chen's 
longtime friend Ching J. Shieh, a Fountain Valley aerospace engineer who 
attended part of Chen's trial in Taipei. "We maintain that we promote the 
Taiwanese democratic process through peaceful means." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's conviction has left his wife, an ailing piano teacher, struggling to 
manage three children and three businesses alone. Fung In Chen, 43, was 
hospitalized briefly last week with a bleeding ulcer, a condition she says has 
been worsened by the stress of her husband's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I support my husband's ideals, that he cares about his motherland so much," 
she said through an interpreter during an interview Thursday. "He's the kind of 
a man that I respect very much. But being his wife and the mother of three, I 
also worry that it will end up like a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
"Our three children, they've been very understanding . . .," she said. Mrs. 
Chen bowed her head low and covered her hands with her eyes, but tears dropped 
onto the table in front of her. "Of course, they worry about their father very 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's arrest has also left Taiwanese-Americans like Shieh wondering why 
Taiwan's officials gave Chen a visa if they intended to arrest him, whether 
other U.S. citizens risk retaliation for political activities in this country, 
and whether the Taipei government is sincere about ending four decades of 
one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big case here," said Vincent Diau, a Los Angeles reporter for the 
Chinese Daily News, the leading Chinese-language newspaper in Southern 
California. "In this case Mr. Chen is arrested, but who is next nobody knows. . 
. . The situation right now is very unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's backers say the businessman has been made a scapegoat since many far 
more prominent dissidents, including Chen's mentor, Hsu, have been pardoned. 
</P>
<P>
Hsu spent nearly a decade in exile in Los Angeles and was repeatedly refused 
permission to return to Taiwan. Last year, he was arrested when he tried to 
slip back into Taiwan on a fishing boat and was convicted of sedition. In May, 
Hsu and nine others were freed by Taiwan's new President Lee Teng-hui. 
</P>
<P>
"The president gave everyone the impression that this is the time for the 
wounds to heal, and everyone who has previously opposed the government should 
come back and talk," said Daniel Sheh, who owned a business next door to 
Chen's. "So he went back and he was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Chen was arrested on June 24 and released six days later. On July 4, the 
government and opposition agreed on democratic reforms, including a popular 
vote for president, a decision that one opposition leader called "a peaceful 
revolution." In light of that, Chen's wife said she expected the charges to be 
dropped, but his trial began in August. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian consul general in Los Angeles, Franz Cede, said he was 
"flabbergasted" to learn Thursday from a reporter of Chen's conviction, since 
the last report from the embassy was that Chen had been freed. Cede said he 
intended to inform Vienna of the case but was not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely it will not be easy for the Austrian authorities to help him in 
Taiwan as we do not have diplomatic representation there," Cede said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen's troubles began when he boarded a plane on June 22 to return home for the 
first time in 20 years. He and his wife had left Taiwan in 1969 to study music 
in Austria, Mrs. Chen said. There, they renounced their Taiwanese citizenship 
and became Austrian citizens. Chen became involved in Taiwanese exile politics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the couple moved to Southern California to help Hsu launch his 
newspaper. Though Chen occasionally wrote editorials, he was mainly involved in 
fund raising and managing the business side of the newspaper, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Chen left the newspaper to start his own business. His Taiwanese 
Cultural Center, which rents Chinese-language videotapes and sells books and 
magazines, now has branches in Westminster, Irvine and Huntington Beach. Though 
Mrs. Chen became a U.S. citizen, Chen retained Austrian citizenship so he could 
look after business interests there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Chen joined the newly formed Taiwan Revolutionary Party, of which Hsu 
was also a member. Spokeswoman Cho said the party advocated overthrowing the 
government by force; Chen's associates say the party explicitly rejected 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Chen had been refused a visa to return to Taiwan since his days in Austria, but 
he continued to apply each year, his wife said. His mother had surgery this 
spring, and he was desperate to go back. When his visa came through on June 12, 
he was ecstatic, friends said.

"For over 20 years he has been refused to go back," said Leonard Hsu, a 
Monterey Park businessman and secretary general of the Taiwan Democratic 
Movement Overseas. "For somebody like him, he was so happy when he got a visa 
from the government, so it was really like falling into a trap by the (ruling) 
government." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cho, Chen was well aware that a warrant had been issued for his 
arrest in 1985 because property he owned in Taipei had been seized by the 
government. Regaining that property was the real motive for Chen's trip, 
Taiwanese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he applied (for) the visa, my colleague in the visa section advised him 
that he would be arrested because he is on the wanted list," Cho said. 
Moreover, she said, Chen signed a statement saying that he would accept legal 
responsibility for his words and deeds during his years abroad, "even if this 
means putting myself in prison." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's friends, however, insist that if such a warrant did exist, it was never 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
"The warrant was never published until he was arrested, and then the government 
claimed the warrant was issued in 1988," Shieh said. He said Chen was warned he 
might be questioned upon arrival in Taipei but was never told of the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Sheh, who owns an insurance business next to Chen, said he isn't 
involved in exile politics but believes that the Taiwan government has no right 
to try a foreign national for treason. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an American citizen and I was born and raised in Taiwan," Sheh said. "I 
thought that I am protected by the First Amendment. . . . But then this 
constitutional right has been challenged by foreign authorities. This is the 
real issue here."

SOVIET UNION, S. KOREA TO ESTABLISH FULL TIES; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THEY WILL EXCHANGE ENVOYS NEXT JAN. 1. MOSCOW ALSO SAYS IT IS 
RESTORING CONSULAR TIES WITH ISRAEL.

<P>
The Soviet Union obliterated two of the remaining remnants of the diplomatic 
divisions of the Cold War on Sunday by establishing full diplomatic relations 
with South Korea and restoring consular ties with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze hammered out the details of the 
agreements in back-to-back meetings with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy 
and South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Ho Joong in the offices of the U.N. 
Security Council president. 
</P>
<P>
By upgrading its relations with two staunch American allies, the Soviet Union 
stole a march on the United States, which Saturday held its first high-level 
talks with Moscow's ally, Vietnam, in more than 15 years but stopped far short 
of establishing diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
"As of today, full diplomatic relations are in place between the Republic of 
Korea and the Soviet Union," Shevardnadze told reporters with Choi at his side. 
"I think it is a normal, logical process." 
</P>
<P>
A joint communique said that Moscow and Seoul would exchange ambassadors next 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are convinced that this step will contribute to enhancing 
stability and to a peaceful settlement on the Korean Peninsula," the communique 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that in addition to establishing consular relations with 
Israel, he and Levy agreed to meet regularly, perhaps clearing the way to 
establishment of full diplomatic relations later. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945 into Communist-ruled North 
Korea and anti-Communist South Korea, the Soviet Union has maintained friendly 
ties only with the regime in the North. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that Moscow's decision to establish relations with Seoul 
would not change the Soviet relationship with the North Korean government in 
Pyongyang. Choi added, "We hope that the Soviet Union will continue to have 
good relations with North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the action is a dramatic setback to North Korea's Stalinist-style 
government and its aging leader, Kim Il Sung. It leaves China as North Korea's 
only remaining patron. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and 
South Korea will aid the cause of stability in Asia and the Pacific region," 
Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and Israel broke diplomatic relations during the Arab-Israeli 
war of 1967 when Moscow sided with the Arabs. Paradoxically, the Soviet-Israeli 
chill lasted for more than a decade after Egypt, which fielded the largest Arab 
army in the war, established diplomatic relations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Contacts between the Soviet Union and Israel began to ease in 1987, when the 
Soviets posted a delegation in Tel Aviv that operated through the Finnish 
Embassy. A year later, Israel established a low-level mission in Moscow under 
the auspices of the Netherlands Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"This means we will no longer need the offices of the Netherlands Embassy in 
Moscow," said Yuval Rotem, a spokesman for Israel's U.N. mission. "Now, we will 
be able to grant visas to immigrants on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Rotem said that Ariel Levine, head of the present Israeli mission in Moscow, 
would probably be named consul general. 
</P>
<P>
The action chips away at the bipolar world of the Cold War in which the United 
States and the Soviet Union led rival and antagonistic camps. Moscow's decision 
to establish relations with South Korea came just three days after North Korea 
proposed opening talks with Japan in November to establish diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea, aided by Chinese troops, fought a bitter war with South Korea and 
its allies, including the United States, from 1950 to 1953. The dividing line 
between the two Koreas remains one of the tensest borders in the world, now 
that the Berlin Wall has fallen and East-West hostility in Europe is virtually 
at an end. 
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains more than 43,000 troops in Korea 37 years after the 
war ended in an uneasy truce. 
</P>
<P>
Choi said he hopes that both South Korea and North Korea will soon be admitted 
to the United Nations. The rival regimes now have only observer status at the 
world forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I very much stressed that on the principle of universality, Korea should have 
its rightful place in the United Nations," Choi told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea has opposed membership for both states on the grounds that such a 
solution would perpetuate the division of the peninsula. Pyongyang has 
suggested sharing a single seat until the two Koreas are able to unify. 
</P>
<P>
Choi said Shevardnadze agreed that the question of U.N. membership should be 
discussed between the two Korean states. But he added, "If we cannot find 
common ground, we will have to make our own decision." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Seoul would agree to share the seat, he snapped: "No, no. Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Choi said that the prime ministers of the two Koreas will meet in Pyongyang on 
Oct. 16. The talks would be a follow-up to a meeting between the prime 
ministers in Seoul earlier this month which marked the highest-level political 
contact since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try to change the North Korean position," Choi said. "We have a good 
example with Germany and Yemen before us." Divided Yemen and Germany both have 
recently unified or agreed to do so, even though their once antagonistic halves 
each had enjoyed full U.N. membership. 
</P>
<P>
Choi said he and Shevardnadze agreed that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and South Korean President Roh Tae Woo would exchange visits soon, although no 
date has been set.

<P>
After 4 1/2 years as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration chief here, Andy 
Fenrich figured that Operation King Cobra was bound to be a classic. 
</P>
<P>
Two Philippine businessmen wanted to sell 22 pounds of high-grade heroin. 
Unknown to them, the buyer was an undercover DEA agent backed by elite 
Philippine police. As hidden video cameras rolled and tape recorders whirred, 
the date and price was set for one of the biggest Philippine drug stings -- 
called a "buy-and-bust" here -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been a case that's gone more by the book," Fenrich told friends. 
"Absolutely by the book." 
</P>
<P>
Some book. When the smoke cleared last July 10, the "businessmen" turned out to 
be highly decorated military officers. They also turned up dead, shot in the 
head. Fenrich and two other DEA agents fled the country, facing death threats 
and reported murder charges. And DEA operations have collapsed in a country 
that transships increasing amounts of Southeast Asian heroin, marijuana and 
methamphetamines to the United States, mostly through Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"With the DEA gone, it's wide open here," said an Asian diplomat. "Now, there 
are no controls." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are conditions likely to improve. The head of the nation's chief 
drug-fighting agency admits that his men have funneled tons of confiscated 
drugs back onto the street. Customs officials concede widespread corruption at 
the nation's harbors and airports. Only one in 10 drug arrests ends in 
conviction. And the chairman of the Senate narcotics committee estimates that 
up to 40% of Manila's police are involved in the illegal drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be frank," said Sen. Ernesto Herrera. "We live in a country where law 
enforcers can be bribed, court cases fixed, and protection from the law can be 
had for a monthly retainer." 
</P>
<P>
This is the war on drugs, Philippine-style. According to police records, DEA 
reports, and interviews, it is increasingly a shooting war between corrupt 
police and rogue military men over control of the spoils of a drug trade worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It is a war with few heroes and many 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
In Senate speeches last fall, for example, Herrera charged that at least 17 
ranking police and military officers were running drugs or protecting drug 
lords. Using information supplied by the DEA, he also identified more than 100 
alleged drug dealers. Scores were arrested. Others weren't so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, 31 have been killed by law enforcement," the senator said in an 
interview. "My list was like a death warrant." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents, the nation's FBI, 
used "summary executions" and simply reported that the dealers were killed in 
shoot-outs, Herrera said. "The NBI's reputation is they have a license to 
kill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious drug kingpin, Jose (Don Pepe) Oyson, who openly kept 
soldiers and police as bodyguards, was shot twice in the head inside a closed 
NBI van last March 17. The NBI had picked him up to question him about 44 
pounds of heroin in two golf bags at Manila airport two days earlier. Diplomats 
suspect that Oyson was silenced to keep him from naming names before Herrera's 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says the NBI chief, Gen. Alfredo S. Lim, a gray-haired, taciturn man 
who keeps assault rifles stacked by his office door. He says Oyson was shot 
"trying to grab" a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Lim, a former Manila police chief, drew more headlines last week when he won 
the $200,000 grand prize in a national lottery he was investigating for 
rigging. 
</P>
<P>
"I got lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luck isn't the problem in "Narcom," the nation's lead drug agency. The 
1,000-man narcotics command is part of the national police, itself an arm of 
the military. The last two Narcom chiefs were transferred for alleged drug 
trafficking. The current head, Brig. Gen. Virgilio M. David, says he has 
relieved more than 70 men this year "because they are corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
But Narcom remains "beyond hope," complains a diplomat who studies the drug 
trade. "No matter where the seizure is, it's not uncommon to have the drug 
suddenly shrink in half between the seizure and when it's officially weighed. 
It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
DEA agent Fenrich, 46, clearly agreed. He simply refused to deal with Narcom. 
He had good reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the DEA provided $24,000 for a drug sting with Narcom. The money and 
the drugs disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a 33-page DEA intelligence report given to Narcom suddenly appeared in 
newspapers. So did the DEA's "suspect vessel list," based on classified reports 
from U.S., Australian and Asian police forces. 
</P>
<P>
"So every dope peddler with a boat knew if we were looking for him or not," a 
DEA agent said in disgust. "We didn't have a single successful prosecution with 
Narcom." 
</P>
<P>
That was why Fenrich called the NBI, rather than Narcom, when an informant 
walked into his office on June 15 and said two friends wanted to sell 10 
kilograms of 84% pure heroin for shipment to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Heroin is not produced here. Instead, Hong Kong syndicates such as the 14-K and 
Bamboo Gang use Manila as a way station for smuggling dope from Myanmar, Laos 
and Thailand. In October, U.S. officials seized two tons of Philippine-grown 
marijuana as it arrived in Los Angeles. And highly addictive, smokable 
Philippine methamphetamine hydrochloride is increasingly sold as "ice" in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Fenrich figured that the heroin was part of a haul seized in January, 1989, in 
a dingy hotel in Angeles City, outside the giant U.S.-run Clark Air Base. DEA 
intelligence said the local military had confiscated 20 kilograms of heroin and 
$200,000. Only 2 kilograms of dope was turned in, however; the other 18 
kilograms and the money disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The officer in charge was Col. Rolando de Guzman, deputy chief of the 
40,000-strong northern Luzon command of the Philippine armed forces. A senior 
intelligence officer, De Guzman had a record that also included charges of 
kidnaping, extortion and smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
"His trusted men were known hoodlums/killers," who carried out holdups and 
murder, according to an NBI report. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk on July 5 this year, a heavyset man with thick eyebrows walked into the 
Rotisserie Restaurant at the Manila Pavilion Hotel. He said he was Rolly, a 
businessman from central Luzon. An intermediary, 50-year-old Estrella Arrastia, 
introduced him to Philip Needham. The tall American didn't say he was a DEA 
agent from Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Running surveillance from a car outside, Andy Fenrich recognized Rolly as De 
Guzman, whom he had met twice before. Later, reliable sources said, the local 
DEA chief would warn U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt and his chief deputy that a 
senior officer in the Philippine military was selling heroin. They told him to 
make sure the NBI knew. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy claims he told the NBI who De Guzman was," says one frustrated U.S. 
official. "The NBI says Andy did not tell them." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, agent Needham met repeatedly with Arrastia in his 
eighth-floor hotel room to discuss the price. As DEA cameras watched, Maj. 
Franco Calanog, an intelligence officer with two dozen medals and awards, 
arrived July 8. He offered the heroin for $400,000. The deal was set. 
</P>
<P>
When night fell two days later, a dozen NBI agents carefully tailed Needham and 
Arrastia to a parking lot in Manila's Makati district. After chatting with De 
Guzman, Needham went to a blue Volkswagen and inspected a black briefcase 
stuffed with 19 bags of light brown powder. Then he took out a handkerchief, 
and pretended to sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
NBI Capt. Reynaldo Jaylo quickly moved toward De Guzman, 52. Other agents 
surrounded Calanog, 39, and his driver, police investigator Avelino Manguera, 
26. Needham jumped in a car and raced off with Fenrich and a third DEA agent, 
Jake Fernandez, to recover the "buy" money from a hotel safety deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is in considerable dispute. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jaylo, a car full of De Guzman's bodyguards suddenly sped by, 
shooting. De Guzman, he said, quickly grabbed a 9-millimeter pistol inside his 
Saab. Jaylo pulled his .45. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm virtually next to him," Jaylo recalled, re-enacting the event in his 
office. "We shoot at the same time. Bang, bang! Bang, bang! I fire two shots. 
He fires two shots. He hits the window. I hit him in the left eye and the 
chest." 
</P>
<P>
Other NBI agents said Calanog also began to shoot, forcing them to open fire. 
Later, paraffin tests for gunpowder would indicate that Calanog, shot between 
the eyes, didn't fire a gun. The driver, Manguera, was shot point-blank in the 
forehead; he was unarmed. Both were hit four times. None of the NBI agents were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses later told a presidential commission investigating the case that 
they saw a man kicked and shot while belly-down, arms outstretched, on the 
ground. Businessman Ramon Zuniga Jr. said he, his wife and child also saw 
someone "place a gun in the hands of the dead man in the driver's seat of the 
Saab and fire the gun twice." 
</P>
<P>
The commission accepted the NBI version of how Calanog and De Guzman died. A 
day after the shooting, President Corazon Aquino decorated Jaylo as one of the 
nation's "outstanding policemen." But military leaders were furious. De Guzman 
was a 1961 classmate of many top generals. He was buried with full military 
honors, and most of the top command attended. 
</P>
<P>
"It was cold-blooded murder," charged Brig. Gen. David, head of Narcom. "It was 
a deliberate, planned murder." 
</P>
<P>
An air force general agreed. "It was a rub-out, plain and simple," he said 
angrily. An army general called it "revolting to the military." 
</P>
<P>
"People are very bitter, very angry," he said. "What makes it so bad is the 
arrogance, the arrogance of shooting them like dogs. . . . To the military it 
was a humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
At first, a showdown appeared imminent. Jeeploads of heavily armed soldiers 
sullenly circled the NBI headquarters, demanding to see Jaylo. Ten days later, 
NBI agents with Uzi submachine guns shot and killed two Narcom men and wounded 
five. Fenrich and the two other agents fled, effectively closing the DEA office 
here. NBI chief Lim took an unscheduled trip abroad. The military ordered 
twice-daily head counts to prevent unauthorized movements by angry troops. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, the military announced that it had charged the three DEA agents, 
plus 10 NBI and police officers, with murder. Despite international headlines, 
the Americans were never indicted. And Jaylo, barricaded in his NBI office, a 
grenade at his side and a dozen nervous bodyguards outside, says he's "heard we 
have been charged but haven't seen any papers." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, what is my motive for killing them?" Jaylo asked. "I do not even know 
they are military! This is a cover-up for the embarrassment that two senior 
officers were involved in drug peddling." 
</P>
<P>
The DEA hopes to move a new agent back to the Philippines this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to redefine the rules of engagement, and who they cooperate with," 
said one DEA official. "Unfortunately, it means probably the military again." 
</P>
<P>
A final irony is that De Guzman was apparently planning a sting of his own. The 
heroin was 2 1/2 pounds short, and hardly high quality. Chemical analysis 
showed 15 of the 19 bags contained less than 1% heroin. Only one bag was more 
than 10% pure. 
</P>
<P>
Narcom chief David laughed when asked about the apparent attempt to swindle the 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this is how dirty the Philippines is," he said. "Very dirty."

A FATHER WONDERS WHY HE SURVIVED SHIPWRECK THAT KILLED HIS SON

Barry Holmberg's son died in his arms late last week in the chilly, 
storm-stirred ocean off British Columbia as the lights of their would-be rescue 
ship flickered just minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
For several hours, the Studio City man and his 23-year-old son, Rob, had clung 
to a piece of floating plywood, a pair of life jackets and each other after 
their tuna seiner capsized in heavy seas around 1 a.m. Friday, about 200 miles 
offshore in the Queen Charlotte Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five crew members of the 69-foot Quicksilver, on a six-month tuna run 
out of San Diego, only father and son remained alive -- barely -- as dawn 
approached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were dead, it was all over," Barry Holmberg said in a telephone 
interview from a Vancouver hospital, where he was recovering from hypothermia 
and trying to figure out why he, alone, survived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was raining and it was storming, and there were 20-foot swells and 50-knot 
gusts," he recounted. "It was like trying to fight Godzilla with a fly swatter. 
You couldn't do anything but pray." 
</P>
<P>
For Rob Holmberg, who lived in Huntington Beach and was in his second year on 
the tuna runs, it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing an incomplete "May Day" call from the tuna boat, as many as seven 
vessels combed the area for survivors. As the Holmbergs floated in the 
54-degree water, they could spot the ships' taunting lights -- close enough to 
offer hope of a rescue, but uncertain enough, through the dark, pounding rains, 
to keep them discouraged, Holmberg said. Finally, hours into the ordeal, Rob 
decided he had waited long enough -- he would find the ships. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'don't do it, don't do it. You've got to save your energy.' But he 
panicked, he wouldn't listen. He was going to save us," the father recalled. 
"He was a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Scrapping his life jacket to make swimming easier, Rob ventured toward the 
ships' lights. But, about 10 minutes later, he returned unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
Exhausted, the young man clutched his father, his head hanging heavily. Barry 
Holmberg said he tried to hold him up, but his son's body was like a heavy 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dad, I don't think I'm going to make it,' " Barry Holmberg heard his son 
whisper. "Then he just died right there in my arms." 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, a large ocean swell rolled through, splitting the two, 
Holmberg said. He said he tried frantically to find his son's body, but he was 
beginning to lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
According to Canadian Coast Guard officials, another fishing boat found 
Holmberg -- incoherent, but alive -- around 6 a.m., probably just a few minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really remarkable that he survived that long," said Capt. Bob Morris, who 
directed the search mission from the Victoria Rescue Coordination Center, run 
jointly by the Canadian Coast Guard and Armed Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The captain said the water temperature -- about 10 degrees above seasonal norms 
-- certainly helped keep Holmberg alive. But, he added, the rough storm 
conditions, along with the man's slight build and light clothing -- underwear 
and a T-shirt -- made his survival extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Except for his son, Holmberg and the other three crew members were all asleep 
when the boat began to sink -- apparently because of a broken line on a "sea 
anchor," a water parachute used to maintain position through wind direction. 
</P>
<P>
There was little time to do anything but flee, Holmberg said. A part-time 
stuntman who said he has worked on films with Burt Reynolds, Holmberg signaled 
to two men below deck to get out, but they apparently never made it. 
</P>
<P>
The two -- identified by Holmberg as Manuel Faldala, in his 50s, originally 
from Guadalajara, Mex., but who had been living in the Southland, and Bill 
Taylor, 43, of American Samoa -- are presumed drowned, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holmberg, his son and the ship's captain -- Charles LaGamma, 42, of 
San Diego -- tried to reach a life boat on deck. But with the larger vessel 
about to capsize, they failed and were forced to jump ship, Holmberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In the water, the three grabbed a 4-foot-by-4-foot plywood hatch cover, riding 
out the waves and praying for help. LaGamma, wearing nothing but a life 
preserver, was the first to die, apparently the victim of hypothermia, Holmberg 
said. Then, after another large swell, LaGamma's body and the plywood cover 
were gone. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Holmberg's son would be lost, too. 
</P>
<P>
"God must have wanted me for something," Holmberg said of his survival. "I 
don't know what, and I don't know why. I just wish He had taken me and not my 
son."

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Sunday vetoed a bill to restore $9 million for the 
California Assessment Program, removing what many educators regard as an 
important tool in measuring public school performance and in keeping the 
pressure on for educational reform. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP veto was one of dozens Deukmejian issued during the last day -- in the 
last year of his two terms in office -- on which he could sign or reject 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter accompanying the veto, Deukmejian said he supports "an assessment 
program . . . such as CAP," but insisted that the money should come from 
Proposition 98 funds, not from general state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98, a state constitutional change approved by voters two years ago, 
stipulates that public schools and community colleges receive roughly 40% of 
the state's General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian first eliminated CAP funding when he signed the state budget on July 
31. The Legislature sought to restore the money, but with his veto on Sunday, 
funding was denied. The governor contended that a bill he supported, defeated 
in the Senate Education Committee, would have restored the CAP money from 
Proposition 98 funds. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Supt. of Public Instruction Joe Holsinger said the law would not have 
allowed the testing program to be financed from Proposition 98 funds "unless 
the Proposition 98 base is recalculated and the governor has refused to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
State schools chief Bill Honig was out of the country, but issued a statement 
calling the veto "a sad day for students and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
Honig said CAP "is widely acknowledged as the best student achievement testing 
system in the country." By vetoing the funding measure, said Honig, who has 
battled the governor for years over school money, Deukmejian "has secured his 
place in California history as the anti-education governor." 
</P>
<P>
CAP tests all California third, sixth, eighth and 12th graders in reading, 
writing, mathematics, science and history or social studies each year. 
</P>
<P>
The tests measure a school or school district's performance relative to other 
schools and districts, not individual student performance. Many districts use 
other tests to judge individual achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Tied closely to new curriculum guidelines and textbooks, CAP has been 
considered an important part of the educational improvements that have taken 
place in California in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't improve if you don't know how well you're doing," said Dale C. 
Carlson, director of the assessment program. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Odden, professor of education at USC, said the program is "at the cutting 
edge in the national testing field." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the governor's veto, Carlson said, the 12th-grade writing test, 
scheduled for late November and early December, will be canceled. Department of 
Education officials hope to find a way to offer the third-, sixth- and 
eighth-grade tests scheduled for spring. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein has said she would restore 
the money for CAP if she is elected. Republican candidate Pete Wilson has not 
stated a position. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in other action, the governor vetoed a bill to extend the statute of 
limitations for people to sue the state for illnesses, injuries or deaths 
allegedly caused by malathion spraying in fighting the Mediterranean fruit fly 
menace. 
</P>
<P>
In his veto message, Deukmejian said there is "overwhelming scientific and 
medical evidence" that malathion "poses no unreasonable risk to the public and 
our environment." He said the proposed legislation could generate "unwarranted, 
but significant, litigation" based on allegations of damaging health effects of 
the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Authored by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), the rejected measure would 
have allowed a person to sue the state within one year after the discovery of 
the condition instead of one year after the spraying occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The governor earlier signed into law six other bills relating to fighting the 
Medfly, including one that seeks alternatives to malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Among his final acts on legislation, Deukmejian also: 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) to give a sales tax 
break to the purchasers of new automobiles that produce less air pollution and 
use less gasoline, starting in 1993. The governor said he was concerned the 
bill would "greatly complicate" the administration of the sales tax, and 
establish an "inadvisable precedent" to extend this type of treatment to a 
variety of other products. 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed another bill by Sen. Hart to allow judges to place corporations 
convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanor crimes on probation in addition to 
fines and other punishment. The governor said he believed the bill was overly 
broad and could be used for any felony crime, including first and only 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill to require health insurance plans to offer coverage for drug 
and alcohol dependency treatment programs. Deukmejian said this was specialized 
coverage for which the need and the availability should be left up to the 
consumer and the private sector. The bill was sponsored by Assemblyman Terry 
Friedman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
* Vetoed a bill by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) to report crimes that occur 
on college and university campuses to the state Department of Justice on an 
annual basis. The governor said this requirement would work a hardship on 
smaller private schools that may not have the capacity to compile these 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed into law a bill by Sen. William Craven (R-San Diego) to make it a 
crime to publish any campaign advertisement containing an unauthorized 
signature with the intent of deceiving the voters. The bill was introduced 
after Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) was charged with mailing hundreds of 
campaign letters in 1986 bearing the signature of then-President Reagan. The 
charges were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed into law a bill by Sen. William Lockyer (D-Hayward) to require the 
courts to suspend, restrict or delay for one year the driving privilege of 
anyone under the age of 21 but over the age of 13 who is convicted of offenses 
related to using alcohol or drugs while operating a motor vehicle or vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscally conservative governor set a veto record of more than 2,250 bills 
during his two terms in office, topping by far the eight-year rejection marks 
of either former Govs. Edmund G. Brown Jr. or Ronald Reagan. Reagan vetoed 981 
bills; Brown's total was 739. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday evening, Deukmejian had vetoed 396 bills passed in the 1990 
legislative session -- a one-year record -- and signed 1,639 others. There were 
about 30 bills still left on his desk for action.

POLICE ARREST 31 FANS AT ROWDY RAIDERS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: HUNDREDS OF OFFICERS AND SECURITY GUARDS TRY TO PREVENT REPEAT OF 
VIOLENCE. NONETHELESS, SEVERAL FIGHTS STILL BREAK OUT.

<P>
Forget the fanfare of the starting lineups. Forget the barkers hawking game 
programs. Forget those strident sellers of Silver-and-Black souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
For fans at Sunday's Los Angeles Raiders-Chicago Bears football game, the 
loudest message came from the four black-and-white jail buses sitting ominously 
outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the army of police officers 
stationed inside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The most telling announcement was the one that greeted fans as they entered the 
Coliseum, warning them that they were subject to searches for such contraband 
as alcohol, bottles, cans and coolers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coliseum and Raiders staff urge you to enjoy today's game," the 30-second 
tape boomed on the loudspeaker, "and remember, we're all on the same team." 
</P>
<P>
Is that any way to sell a rivalry between the Monsters of the Midway and the 
rowdy Silver-and-Black clad Raiders -- who both entered the game unbeaten, 
untied and unforgiving? 
</P>
<P>
It is when your last home game was marred by a vicious beating that left one 
fan of the opposing team hospitalized and local officials vowing to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Albrecht, 35, a Pittsburgh Steelers fan who lives in Tucson, Ariz., was 
kicked in the head and beaten the previous Sunday at the Coliseum as he walked 
through a crowd of jeering Raiders fans. Albrecht remains in serious condition 
at County-USC Medical Center. The man accused of assaulting him -- Shane 
Geringer, 19, of Agoura -- is facing possible criminal charges of assault with 
a deadly weapon with great bodily injury . 
</P>
<P>
That incident outraged local politicians and law enforcement officials and led 
to Sunday's crackdown. By game's end Sunday, the Los Angeles Police Department 
reported 31 arrests for disturbing the peace and alcohol-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
About six of the arrests came during a fight that erupted on the concourse 
level at the peristyle end of the Coliseum midway through the fourth quarter, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent about a half-dozen officers into the upper stands near tunnels 1, 2 
and 3 to quell it," said LAPD Lt. Alan Kerstein, the officer in charge of the 
off-duty security detail. "Several people threw beer at officers." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the six are being held on suspicion of disorderly conduct and the 
others for investigation of battery on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the combatants required treatment for cuts and bruises, Kerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 88 other boisterous fans were escorted from the game after being 
involved in arguments or minor scuffles. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 115 LAPD officers inside the Coliseum to supplement about 200 
private security guards and more police outside the stadium, Moore said there 
was little chance of a repeat of last Sunday's violence -- the most serious 
single incident since the Raiders moved from Oakland in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Sunday that he would ask the Coliseum 
Commission on Wednesday to consider some kind of ban on alcohol sales, this 
after witnessing the fourth-quarter skirmish between fans and police. "This was 
a crowd that was on its best behavior, and still the police could not control 
the crowd," Yaroslavsky said. "If the police can't defend themselves, then how 
can a fan?" 
</P>
<P>
For some of the 80,000-plus fans who witnessed the Raiders 24-10 victory, the 
security crackdown was irksome -- especially to those who savor their 
boisterous image as an extension of the Raiders' on-the-field rowdiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an overreaction," said one season ticket holder who asked not to 
be identified. "Why do you need all this police here hassling people? That 
beating was an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
Others said they welcomed the scores of uniformed police. 
</P>
<P>
"If they start hitting each other, then take them to jail," said Eddie Martinez 
of Pacoima. "But if they are just high-fiving each other and yelling -- hey, 
then let them go." 
</P>
<P>
During pregame tailgate parties in a parking lot, Martinez and his friends were 
busy spray-painting Raiders slogans on a white convertible that had been 
decorated with the distinctive blue-and-orange markings of the Bears and a team 
pennant. In defense, its owner, Pat Perino, helped the cheering Raiders crowd 
repaint his car. 
</P>
<P>
"The big reason I'm letting them do this to my car is because of the violence, 
and I want my car to be here when I get back," said Perino, a Chicago native 
who lives in Huntington Beach. "To be honest, I'm just playing it safe right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Perino was not alone in playing it safe. Vendors said sales of Bears souvenirs 
were extremely slow. One saleswoman outside the main Coliseum gate said police 
officers asked her not to sell Chicago pennants that could inflame Raiders 
fans.

HIS ANGER FUELED MINI-MARKET BLAZE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: WITNESSES SAY A DRIVER WHO WAS REFUSED BEER PLOWED HIS CAR INTO THE 
ESTABLISHMENT'S GAS PUMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A motorist who apparently became enraged when a clerk at a Maywood mini-market 
refused to sell him beer early Sunday drove his car into one of the market's 
gas pumps, setting off an explosion and fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk and two customers ran from the fire and escaped injury, but the 
gas-station portion of the Arco AM/PM market was destroyed, Maywood Police Sgt. 
Steve Nagy said. The explosion, which sent flames 150 feet into the air, blew 
out about six windows on nearby apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Jehzeel Narchena, 22, was arrested on suspicion of felony vandalism; a 
companion fled before officers reached the scene, Nagy said. Their car, a 1983 
model, was destroyed in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like something out of Vietnam, like a napalm drop," said Nagy, one 
of the first officers to arrive. "The whole thing went up . . . all eight pumps 
exploded into one mushroom cloud. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat was incredible. I couldn't even get close to the market to see if 
anyone was injured." 
</P>
<P>
It took 75 firefighters from Maywood and surrounding communities about 45 
minutes to extinguish the blaze. Damage was estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Narchena initially gave them several different names. He was being 
held at the Maywood police station. 
</P>

Authorities said the incident began about 5:40 a.m. when Narchena and his 
passenger tried to buy beer at the market at 4700 E. Slauson Ave., but were 
told that California law prohibits the sale of alcohol from 2 to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The men argued with the clerk and, when still refused service, returned to 
their car and "started driving recklessly . . . doing 'doughnuts' (looping 
around the pumps) in the parking lot," Nagy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he came back around and purposely rammed one pump, ran over the pump 
(and) completely severed it from its base, which started spewing gasoline all 
over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the car just got away from him," Nagy said. 
</P>
<P>
The car crashed into a metal support beam at the station just as the spewing 
gasoline ignited and "the whole thing went up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Narchena, arrested while walking from the scene, was "believed to be somewhat 
intoxicated," Nagy added.

Like 1,400 other runners at the Marine Corps Air Station on Sunday, John 
Voracek carried a message for the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
All the runners wore yellow ribbons on their race numbers. But in addition to 
the yellow ribbons, Voracek carried a somewhat more emphatic message. On his 
bare chest, Voracek, 47, had written in grease pencil: "God Loves Grunt Marines 
and Desert Shield." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an ex-Marine, an ex-jarhead, and what I'm doing is keeping faith with my 
brothers over there," Voracek explained. "I was in 'Nam, class of '65-66. I 
spent four years in the Marine Corps, and I've got some friends from this base 
who're over there with (Operation) Desert Shield. I'm wishing them luck and 
hope for a speedy return. And I'm hoping they kick some butt over there." 
</P>
<P>
Voracek, a Costa Mesa free-lance photographer, was part of the colorful crowd 
at the air station runways on Sunday morning. The runners had come to take part 
in the 3rd Annual Leatherneck Run of the Runways. The three races were a 
5-kilometer (3.1 miles), a 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) and a half marathon (13.1 
miles). All the races followed courses along the vast runways of the air 
station. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, 200 to 300 Marines participated in the races, while many 
more helped greet the civilian runners visiting the station. But with their 
ranks depleted by Operation Desert Shield, only about 100 Marines entered the 
events. 
</P>
<P>
The ubiquitous yellow ribbons noted the absence of many Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"The general thought was this is a good time to dedicate this race to our 
Marines who are gone," said Maj. Russ Tippett, 41, the air station's recreation 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Tippett said the Run of the Runways was expected to raise about $5,000 for the 
air station's Morale, Welfare and Recreation Fund. The fund was recently tapped 
to send morale-boosting items to the El Toro Marines now stationed in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent an airplane last Thursday that was loaded with about 18,000 pounds of 
recreation gear, and the money for those items came from the Morale, Welfare 
and Recreation Fund," Tippett said. "The stuff on that plane included gym 
equipment, board games, about 4,000 to 5,000 books, ice cream machines, snow 
cone machines, popcorn machines -- things to make Marines happy in a place so 
far away." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other Marines at the race, Tippett said he was thinking of his 
comrades overseas. "The helicopter squadron I came from is over there," he 
said. "You always think about your friends." 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Les Pagano, 38, a supply officer, added, "The people over there are on our 
minds. You can't help but . . . think about them. 
</P>
<P>
Near the finish line, one civilian, Monica Lawrence of Laguna Niguel, held her 
4-month-old son, Daniel. Daniel, in turn, clutched a small American flag in his 
chubby fist. Lawrence said that she and the baby were waiting for her 
father-in-law, Robert Lawrence, 53, of San Juan Capistrano, to complete the 
half-marathon run. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lawrence, after finishing the race, joined his flag-waving grandson and 
said, "I'm glad people are remembering the ones who are over there. I hope 
everybody remembers them today.

GROUP TO BUY TREES, SHRUBS FOR BARE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 trees and shrubs are headed for a bare section of land near the 
east end of Laguna Lake through the efforts of the Tree Society of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Heninger, executive director of the Tree Society, said that the group, 
together with volunteers who live in the Laguna Lake area, has formed a joint 
committee to plant the trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising to buy the greenery is now under way, Heninger said, and the 
planting is scheduled "come rain or shine, at 9 a.m. on Nov. 10." 
</P>
<P>
The site is at the intersection of Hermosa and Lakeside drives, near the east 
end of Laguna Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Many volunteers are needed to make light work for all and to complete the 
planting by noon (on Nov. 10)," Heninger said. Volunteers can call the Tree 
Society at (714) 449-7170. 
</P>
<P>
Heninger said the trees are being purchased at a discount from a commercial 
nursery. The city of Fullerton has agreed to install water pipe and connectors 
at 100-foot intervals along the bare land so that the trees and shrubs can be 
watered, he added. -- BILL BILLITER

CURBSIDE RECYCLING INCREASES TRASH FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trash collection bills will go up about $1 per household once curbside 
recycling starts in 1,000 test homes this month, city officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The actual increase will be 10.7% for each household and business to cover the 
estimated $147,210 cost for testing curbside recycling for one year, said 
Assistant City Manager George Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of one year, the actual costs will be audited and reassessed by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council recently voted to spread the cost throughout the entire city rather 
than limit it to just the tested households. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a far better approach that the entire city accept the burden, not 
just a small group of people," Councilman Kenneth E. Friess said. "Ultimately, 
the whole city will have to accept the burden anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Along with San Juan Capistrano, curbside recycling is being tested in homes in 
two other South County cities -- Dana Point and San Clemente -- which all use 
the same trash collector, Solag Disposal Inc. Recyclable materials including 
newspaper, cans, glass and plastic will be collected in three bins on the 
regular trash collection days. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CANNED-FOOD DRIVE EXPANDED THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A canned-food drive aimed at helping the county's hungry will be held Oct. 15 
to 19 to coincide with "National Hunger Week." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say one goal of the food drive is to increase awareness of a problem 
that affects thousands of county residents each month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to alleviate hunger before you make people aware that the 
problem exists," said Dina Weaver, a resource specialist at the nonprofit Food 
Distribution Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is not like Ethiopia; we don't have children with extended 
bellies. In a county as wealthy as this, it's hard to realize that there are 
380,000 people who will experience hunger at some time during each month," 
Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The food drive was held on a smaller scale last year, with mostly county 
agencies participating, said Bill Secor, event co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"The drive has been expanded substantially," Secor said. "This food will be 
going to working families where the last thing that's paid for is food, of 
which there's usually not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 12,249 pounds of food were collected and distributed to more than 
200 county social service agencies. It is hoped that this year's drive will 
bring in more than 20,000 pounds of food. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that recently purchased canned food is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten some pretty strange things donated in the past," Weaver said. 
"We've actually had cans from the 1940s, Campbell's collector cans. You would 
be amazed." 
</P>
<P>
The food will be taken to the Food Distribution Center, where it will be 
examined and distributed to various agencies. Weaver said there is always a 
shortage of volunteers to help with this process. 
</P>
<P>
"We need volunteers all the time. Getting the food is one thing; getting it out 
is another, because all of this food needs to be examined," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
Collection barrels will be placed at more than 80 locations in participating 
cities, which include: Costa Mesa, Cypress, Dana Point, Fountain Valley, 
Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Los Alamitos and Santa Ana. 
Barrels will also be placed inside most county buildings, as well as at John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
For specific barrel locations, call the Food Distribution Center at (714) 
771-1343.GREG HERNANDEZ

NEW SURGERY SPEEDS RECOVERY FROM PAINFUL WRIST SYNDROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, Doheny is a free-lance health writer living in Burbank. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new surgical technique to repair carpal tunnel syndrome -- the painful wrist 
problem that afflicts typists, laborers and others whose jobs involve 
repetitive hand motions -- can speed the return to work by about three weeks, a 
Sacramento surgeon reported last week at a meeting of physicians in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
But some surgeons are taking a wait-and-see approach to the new surgery, saying 
they are worried that the risks may outweigh the benefits. And others say a 
variation of the new technique works even better. 
</P>
<P>
Carpal tunnel disease begins when compression of one of the major nerves of the 
hand causes numbness, pain and tingling in the carpal tunnel, a bony passage in 
the wrist. Surgery to relieve the pressure on this median nerve is needed when 
non-surgical treatments fail. 
</P>
<P>
The new surgery -- called endoscopic carpal tunnel release -- is similar to the 
arthroscopic surgery now popular to correct knee problems. The surgeon first 
makes a half-inch-long incision on the wrist of the patient, who is given 
general or regional anesthesia. The doctor inserts the endoscope, a special 
instrument for visualization, which also contains a device that cuts the carpal 
tunnel ligament, relieving painful pressure on the median nerve. Eventually 
scar tissue fills the gap and in effect lengthens the ligament. 
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, surgeon 
John Agee of Sacramento told colleagues that his study included 122 patients 
who underwent 147 carpal tunnel procedures -- 82 endoscopic surgeries and 65 
conventional, or "open," surgeries. He reported that patients who underwent the 
endoscopic procedure returned to work an average of 25 days after surgery, 
whereas those who underwent the conventional surgery took 46 days to return. 
</P>
<P>
Endoscopic surgery patients also returned faster to daily activities, such as 
dressing and food preparation -- nine days, compared to 13 for conventional 
surgery patients. All patients were followed up for 26 weeks, said Agee, who 
invented the Inside Job endoscopic cutting instrument that is used in the 
surgery and made by 3M. 
</P>
<P>
Endoscopic patients wear a dressing for about 10 days after the operation and 
are in a splint for about three weeks. The procedure has been performed so far 
on more than 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
Carpal tunnel syndrome has been called the new industrial epidemic. As many as 
20% of employees in certain occupations, such as clerical work and 
construction, are at risk of developing cumulative trauma disorders, according 
to government estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the new procedure will replace "open" procedures, which require 
larger incisions and cutting through more tissue. But some orthopedic surgeons 
are reluctant to jump on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the indications for the new surgery are limited," said Dr. Roy Meals, 
an orthopedic surgeon at Century City Hospital and UCLA's chief of hand 
surgery. "In the average patient, the risks -- such as nerve laceration -- 
outweigh the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Other surgeons are performing a variation of Agee's technique. Dr. Charles 
Resnick, an orthopedic surgeon at Orthopedic Hospital in Los Angeles, said he 
learned a variation pioneered by Illinois surgeon James Chow. 
</P>
<P>
The Chow method, also performed through the endoscope, allows better 
visualization, Resnick says, and makes post-operative splinting unnecessary. In 
the last year, he and his partner have successfully performed about 60 such 
procedures, Resnick said. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients who are candidates for carpal tunnel surgery can undergo the 
endoscopic technique, said Dr. Jessica Cohen-Brown, a Santa Barbara orthopedic 
surgeon. Cohen-Brown trained at one of 10 sites where the Inside Job device was 
evaluated, and she recently performed the endoscopic surgery for the first time 
in her practice at the Sansum Medical Clinic. Inventor Agee agrees with her 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
But Cohen-Brown noted that it is important for patients to try conservative 
treatment first, such as activity modification, splinting and medication.

<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers from UC Santa Barbara have been chosen by the National Science 
Foundation to establish a new Long-Term Ecological Research Site in Antarctica, 
the foundation announced last week. NSF currently has 17 such sites elsewhere 
to monitor slow changes in the environment, but this will be the first on the 
southernmost continent. 
</P>
<P>
The $500,000-a-year project is designed to monitor the ice-dominated marine 
ecosystem at the bottom of the world. In the Austral winter, sea ice in the 
region grows to cover an area twice the size of the United States, but in the 
austral spring and summer, more than 80% of it melts. The ice has a major 
effect on ocean currents, penetration of the water by sunlight, and the growth 
of microorganisms.

<P>
City Hall is scheduled for some interior building changes, and officials say 
the goal is to make it easier for the public to be served. 
</P>
<P>
A key change will be to put a public information counter, now on the second 
floor, on the first floor so that people have an immediate place to ask 
questions and seek directions. 
</P>
<P>
The counter will also sell city of Huntington Beach souvenirs and publications. 
</P>
<P>
The remodeling work also calls for small interior changes on the second and 
fifth floors of City Hall. Affected agencies will be the city treasurer's 
department, the economic development department, community services and 
administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Barnard, deputy city administrator, said the city has estimated the 
cost of the work at $62,054. He said that plans for the remodeling currently 
are being completed and that then a contractor will be selected. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see all the building changes in place by the end of this year," he 
said.BILL BILLITER

For decades, the three small buildings commanded a million-dollar view. Perched 
on the edges of the Huntington Beach Pier, they had vistas of ocean and miles 
of beach. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the three little shops sit ignominiously at the rear of the 
city's vast work and storage yard at 17371 Gothard St., 4 miles from the ocean. 
The brown-and-cream-colored buildings, with their fanciful roofs and wall 
decorations, look like displaced toys. Weather-worn signs tell their names: the 
Tackle Box -- Tackle, Bait, Rentals; Captain's Galley -- Fish, Chips, Chowder; 
Neptune's Locker -- Beer, Sandwiches, Smoked Fish. 
</P>
<P>
For three generations, thousands of people from all over the world stopped in 
these shops on the pier. And now, as the tiny buildings sit in inland exile, 
they have become the objects of a preservation fight. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 4, the city removed the three buildings from the pier, which is 
scheduled to be razed by late October and rebuilt. Preservationists vow to see 
the three old shops returned to the new pier. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Milcovich, archivist for the Huntington Beach Historical Society, said: 
"These buildings very much were a part of the character of the old pier. When 
the old pier is destroyed in a few more weeks, these buildings will be the only 
remnant left, and they should be preserved. With a little cleaning, and some 
windows restored, they'd be charming on the new pier." 
</P>
<P>
A city advisory group, the Pier Design Committee, overwhelmingly disagrees with 
Milcovich. By an 11-1 vote, the committee decided that it would not be feasible 
to restore the three former pier shops to the new pier. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman and committee member John Erskine said: "These are nice buildings, 
and maybe they can be saved and placed somewhere else in the city, but the 
committee believes they're just not safe for the new pier. These old buildings 
are just held together right now with tape and baling wire. We just don't want 
to put unsafe buildings on the new pier." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell, also a member of the Pier Design Committee, argued 
that the old buildings "would not be beneficial to the shape or harmony of the 
new pier. It's different when you have buildings on a street. In this case, 
however, you're removing the basic structure -- the old pier -- that the 
buildings once were part of." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Person, chairman of the city's Historic Resources Board, was the only 
member of the Pier Design Committee to vote for keeping the old shops. He 
disagreed with Erskine's contention that the buildings are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"These buildings are in good shape," he said. "And what better way to 
incorporate a historical look into the new pier than by using some of the old 
pier itself? These are Art Deco buildings, and there are very few Art Deco 
buildings in this city." 
</P>
<P>
The three shops reflect the geometric style of Art Deco in their tiered blocks 
and decorative circles. The old bait shop features the curious mix of a mansard 
roof -- a 17th-Century French design -- on a 20th-Century Art Deco building. 
Milcovich believes that the eclectic combination of styles adds to the shop's 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
"These three buildings date back to the 1920s, and they're an important part of 
the city's history," she said. She also noted that the city received a 
$1.3-million federal grant for the new pier and that the funding is contingent 
on the city's incorporating a historical element into the pier's design. 
</P>
<P>
Milcovich is leading a letter-writing campaign, through the city's Historical 
Society, to pressure Mayor Thomas J. Mays and the rest of the City Council to 
save the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said that he is sympathetic to the idea but that the city must have hard 
evidence that the old buildings are safe and of actual historical value. He 
said the city is hiring an expert to make such an assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, this is a decision that probably won't be made until about a year 
from now," he said. "It's something the new council members being elected this 
fall will have to decide, after the city gets a report from the expert." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the three old buildings wait for the verdict. Humble as they 
are, Milcovich said, the little shops are city treasures. 
</P>
<P>
"You can read a city by its commercial buildings," she said. "These are 
interesting old parts of our old city. No city should wipe away the memories of 
its past."

<P>
ELECTION: WESTMINISTER OFFICIALS SAY THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS LONG BEEN 
NEGLECTED. A PLAN TO RAISE THE BUSINESS TAX COULD HELP REBUILD CITY FACILITIES.

<P>
With the city still recovering from near-bankruptcy in 1984, candidates in the 
city's Nov. 6 election promise to focus on plans that ensure Westminster's 
long-term financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
Related issues are sure to include proposed tax increases and increased funding 
for police to fight growing drug- and gang-related activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing catch-up on a lot of infrastructure problems," incumbent Mayor 
Charles V. Smith said. "The city's been long neglected because of financial 
conditions. We still need to institute long-range fiscal planning so that we 
don't get back into the situation we were in 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
In November, voters will decide a mayoral race, a council race and two ballot 
measures, one of which would almost double the city's business tax if passed. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's race promises to be a lively one as Smith squares off against 
Councilman Frank Fry Jr., a former Westminster mayor with 20 years of 
experience on the council, and dark horse candidate Daryl DeGraw, a vocal 
29-year-old community activist who would become the youngest council member if 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for a council seat, incumbent Anita Huseth is opposed by Craig 
Schweisinger, a city planning commissioner. Schweisinger has received the 
endorsement of the Westminster Firefighters' Assn., which is traditionally a 
strong force in campaigns, with its members canvassing the community to solicit 
support for its candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Ballot Measure LL would raise the city's business tax to offset inflation. The 
tax was last adjusted in 1978. Huseth and DeGraw said they are the only 
candidates who oppose the business tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad time to put a tax on the ballot, when we have a recession and 
people are out of work," Huseth said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chamber of Commerce President Ken McNicol said the chamber supports 
the increase, which would add $30 to the $50 fee for most businesses, plus an 
additional $5 fee for each full-time employee and $2.50 for each part-time 
employee . 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber feels businesses should pay their way," he said. "It's equitable. 
If you have 10 people, you have 10 people using city services. If you have 100 
people, you have 100 people using city services." 
</P>
<P>
The other measure on the ballot, Measure KK, would designate one council seat 
in the 1992 election as a two-year post, evening out the number of seats open 
in each election. 
</P>
<P>
The current system is staggered. This creates three vacancies in the four-seat 
council. If the ordinance is passed, a designated seat would become a two-year 
term starting in 1992, but revert to a four-year post in 1994, making two seats 
open in every election. The ordinance would not affect the mayor's position, 
which remains a two-year post.

OFF-DUTY OFFICER FIRES GUN IN TRAFFIC DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty Los Angeles police officer, in a traffic dispute outside a popular 
all-night Westlake hamburger stand, fired 13 rounds toward another car early 
Sunday and slightly injured its four occupants after one of them allegedly 
pointed a gun at him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the other car, Rawl Benavides, 19, was later booked on suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly brandishing the gun, after he 
walked into Hollywood Presbyterian-Queen of Angels Medical Center seeking 
treatment for two gunshot wounds to the leg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He had allegedly fled the scene of the 2:45 a.m. confrontation at Beverly and 
Rampart boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Officer Keith Lewis was leaving Tommy's hamburger stand when he was 
cut off by the car in which Benavides was riding, sparking an exchange of 
words. When Benavides pulled a gun, Lewis drew his 9-millimeter pistol and 
emptied 13 rounds in the direction of the car, according to the police account. 
It was not known if Benavides fired. 
</P>
<P>
When the officer ran out of ammunition, he went to the local police station. 
</P>
<P>
Three female passengers in the Benavides car were slightly wounded and released 
from the Hollywood hospital.

AFTER WIN, BLUE JAYS ARE ONE OUT WITH THREE LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was beyond winning ugly, a new low in the era of parody, a slapstick 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff, the Toronto Blue Jays' first baseman, provided the perspective 
after a 10-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a win and those things don't have to be pretty to make you happy," 
McGriff said. 
</P>
<P>
Happy is being one game back of the Red Sox in the American League East 
compared to three back with three to play. Happy is preventing the Red Sox from 
clinching a tie for the division title. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays did it by salvaging Sunday's series finale, assembling 19 hits 
off a parade of Boston pitchers in overcoming their own parade of sins. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play that well, but they played worse," Toronto relief pitcher Tom 
Henke said of the Red Sox. "We were fortunate to score a lot of runs." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Blue Jays end the regular season with a lockout-created, three-game 
series in Baltimore. They have a 7-3 record against the Orioles, including 2-1 
at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox remain at Fenway Park, playing host to the Chicago White Sox and a 
former Boston landmark named Carlton Fisk in a three-game series. The White 
Sox, at 93-66, have a better record than either the Red Sox or Blue Jays and 
swept a four-game series from Boston at Comiskey Park less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
They are 5-4 against the Red Sox, but 0-3 in Boston, where Fisk, with 16 homers 
since his departure, is second to Gary Gaetti among active opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk, in fact, has tormented the Red Sox since leaving as a free agent. He has 
a .321 average, 27 homers and 64 runs batted in in 87 games against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlton is a good guy to have going for us," said Jimmy Key, Toronto's winning 
pitcher Sunday. "The Red Sox definitely have the tougher team to play now. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago has a better record than either of us and they're probably saying that 
they're better than both of us. And they've got a point." 
</P>
<P>
Key conceded, however, that a three-game sweep against the Orioles might not be 
enough for the Blue Jays, that at best it might only create a one-game division 
playoff Thursday at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, however, the Blue Jays would settle for that. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had lost today it would have been over," Key said. "This division has 
been crazy all year, and we have to feel that maybe we've put a little doubt 
back in Boston's mind." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox live with doubt, the residue of their failures in other autumns, 
but they applied their best cliches to Sunday's inability to clinch a tie by 
sweeping the series. 
</P>
<P>
"Today would have been icing on the cake," Jody Reed said, "but we have to 
remember that we won two of three and that's what we wanted to do. We're still 
in the driver's seat. If we take two out of three from Chicago, they've got to 
sweep in Baltimore (for a tie)." 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs dismissed the sloppy nature of Sunday's game by saying that a loss 
is a loss, and also dismissed the recent four-game sweep of the Red Sox in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus among our guys is that nobody likes Comiskey Park," he said. 
"It's a bad hitters' park. We have more confidence here and that shows in our 
record against them. We're going to be loosey-goosey." 
</P>
<P>
Cynics might say that already frayed collars were beginning to tighten Sunday 
for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs and catcher Tony Pena made errors that compounded the Blue Jays' 
offensive onslaught. Shortstop Luis Rivera showed limited range when he could 
only deflect a pair of first-inning grounders, producing a quick Toronto lead. 
Left fielder Mike Greenwell made an unwise and errant throw that set up one 
other Toronto run. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays stranded 13 runners, had two others thrown out at second and 
third, saw Mookie Wilson mimic Greenwell with a misguided throw that set up a 
Boston run and watched George Bell play left field in a manner that would have 
made Carl Yastrzemski shudder. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox had 10 hits, including Tom Brunansky's fifth home run of the 
series, but after rebounding from a 4-1 deficit to forge a 4-4 tie in the 
fourth, they fell behind for good in the fifth on a tie-breaking homer by 
Junior Felix and a two-run single by McGriff, a grounder through the left side 
of the infield that Boston Manager Joe Morgan called "the luckiest hit of the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris, the Boston starter, faced 12 batters and eight reached base as he 
pitched 1 2/3 innings, allowing five hits and four runs. Joe Hesketh, released 
previously this year by the Montreal Expos and Atlanta Braves, faced 17 batters 
as Harris' successor and 11 reached base, allowing eight hits and three runs in 
2 2/3 innings, including the decisive hits by Felix and McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a 13-game winner as the No. 3 Boston starter and a converted reliever 
who had started only once in the previous two years, represents a real trouble 
spot for the Red Sox if they make the playoffs. He has lost his last four 
starts, permitting 27 hits and 19 earned runs in 16 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I went to a fastball today they hit it," he said. "If I pitch in 
the playoffs it will be with eight days rest and maybe that's what it will 
take." 
</P>
<P>
Harris and the Red Sox, of course, hope to find out.

As Sunday's Berlin Marathon field of 25,000 streamed through the Brandenburg 
Gate, into East Berlin and back, some runners toward the rear of the pack 
carried German flags, while others were dressed in festive and outrageous 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the day was peaceful revolution and unification, but one runner 
focused on the wave of consumerism in East Germany's new free-market economy. 
He ran the 26.2 miles pushing a grocery cart.

It is family: For the past month, promotional organizations in Pittsburgh have

<P>
On the line was an American soldier who said he bought 1990 season tickets 
before learning he would be shipped out. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Boulware, Charger assistant publicist, said: "I gave him our rushing and 
receiving leaders and told him about the quarterback situation and all the 
scores." 
</P>
<P>
Boulware said the soldier had one question. 
</P>
<P>
"How did we lose to Dallas?" 
</P>
<P>
Make that five: Reader Dan Jenkins of Pacific Palisades was puzzled after 
seeing in last Friday's Morning Briefing that ESPN commentator Bill Robinson

Two men. Two teams. Bengals and Seahawks. Both men root for the same team. 
Which team? No mystery. Think about it.

Rays of hope: In game 2 of the 1972 American League playoffs, a pitch by 
Detroit's Lerrin LaGrow hit Oakland's Bert Campaneris in the ankle. Campaneris

<P>
The incident cleared both benches. Tiger manager Billy Martin had to be 
restrained by three umpires. American League president Joe Cronin suspended 
Campaneris for the rest of the playoffs and fined him $500. Commissioner Bowie 
Kuhn reinstated the A's shortstop for the World Series but suspended him for 
the first seven games of 1973.

Last week, Campaneris and LaGrow signed with the Sun City (Ariz.) Rays of the 
Senior Baseball League.

DODGERS CAUGHT BY GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers went from one race to another Sunday in one embarrassing step. 
</P>
<P>
No longer fighting for the division championship, they have suddenly found 
themselves fighting for second place and self-respect. And they are losing that 
fight, as evidenced by an 8-2 loss to the San Francisco Giants that allowed the 
Giants to sweep them and their raucous fans to taunt them. 
</P>
<P>
Before 44,235 at Candlestick Park, most of whom were chanting, "Sweep, sweep, 
sweep," the Dodgers fell into a tie with the Giants for second place with three 
games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"You battle all season, you work, you struggle, and then suddenly it's over. 
I'm sure it's hard for the majority of these guys to go out and keep their 
aggressiveness," said catcher Barry Lyons, who provided the only bright spot by 
hitting a pinch homer in his second at-bat as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
One day after eliminating themselves from the National League West championship 
race that was won by the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers committed three errors 
and Fernando Valenzuela suffered through a potential free agent's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela gave up eight runs, seven earned, in four innings, ensuring that he 
ends the year with one victory in his last six starts with an 8.69 ERA in that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Was it his last start as a Dodger? Nobody will talk about it, but while the 
statistics say he will not return to the team, reality says he probably should. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers may not like his 13-13 record and 4.59 ERA, and the fact that he 
has not been above .500 since 1986. But he pitched 204 innings after pitching 
196 2/3 innings last year. 
</P>
<P>
With Orel Hershiser and perhaps Tim Belcher questionable for the start of next 
season , they might need those innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been going out there every fifth day and has been doing that for years," 
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "And tell me, how many more guys have won 13 
games?" 
</P>
<P>
In the National League, just 11 other pitchers have won 13 games this season.

Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, is offering no hints. He said he will not 
outline off-season plans until after the club's organizational meetings in 
Arizona Oct. 10-13. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela left the clubhouse before the end of the game Sunday and was not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers open the 1991 season April 9 in Atlanta. . . . When Dodger catcher 
Barry Lyons met reliever Pat Perry, making his first appearance since June 2, 
at the mound during the eighth inning, there was some question as to whether 
the two little-used players had been introduced. "No, I know Pat Perry real 
well," Lyons said. "I hit my first career homer off him." . . . Despite a sore 
right wrist he thought might cause him to miss the final games, Lenny Harris 
asked to remain in the lineup and responded with three hits.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
Four-and-oh is no fluke. Stamp the Raiders as legitimate Super Bowl contenders 
after the way they handled the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only thing that could keep the Raiders out of the expanded playoffs 
would be more injuries. They've had enough already to deplete an ordinary team. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 80,156 was the biggest in the NFL this season, but not among the 
best behaved despite the push to make the Coliseum a nicer place on Sunday 
afternoons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scoreboard message that was ignored by many fans, mostly in the east end: "Be A 
Team Player -- Root Responsibly!" . . . 
</P>
<P>
Block of the Day: Marcus Allen's demolition of Richard Dent during a 20-yard 
Jay Schroeder- to-Mervyn Fernandez pass play early in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who isn't forcing anything, is making all the right decisions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raider defense has scored three more touchdowns than the Pittsburgh Steeler 
offense this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An early defensive rookie of the year candidate is linebacker Aaron Wallace. . 
. Strangest penalty of the day was the one assessed against the Bears for 12 
men on the field -- on the first play after a timeout. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to Raider Steve Wright, who has filled in superbly for the injured 
Bruce Wilkerson at offensive right tackle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who would you rather have as your offensive coordinator, the Vikings' Joe 
Schnelker or the Steelers' Joe Walton? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe, but the Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings and 
Philadelphia Eagles are each 1-3. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots got what they deserved Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This has been a great year for Eddie Murray, the Dodger slugger, but a lousy 
one for Eddie Murray, the Detroit Lions' kicker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's time to give the Cincinnati Reds some credit. 
</P>
<P>
They bent, but didn't break. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest reason the Pittsburgh Pirates won the NL East pennant is that they 
were hungrier than the New York Mets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I liked Comiskey Park better than Wrigley Field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, a different name should have been given the new park across the 
street. Bill Veeck Stadium would have been perfect, but White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf wasn't a big fan of the greatest showman in baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is Tom Lasorda's second best job of managing. His best was in 1988 when 
the Dodgers won the World Series with maybe the weakest lineup ever in the 
Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This will be remembered as the year the New York Yankees and St. Louis 
Cardinals finished last. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lost and found: The USC and UCLA rushing attacks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, all bets are called off if 55 minutes or more aren't played in a 
football game. The USC-Ohio State game was stopped after 57 minutes and 24 
seconds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Cooper should ask his athletic director never to schedule Larry Smith 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA-Washington State was an exciting game, but were you able to stay up until 
the end? It didn't end until around 11:30 p.m. because of the late starting 
time dictated by ESPN and all those TV commercials. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Maddox is going to make Bruin football exciting for the next three-plus 
years -- or until he opts for the NFL draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hype of the week: ESPN announcer Wayne Larrivee calling Northern Illinois 
quarterback Stacey Robinson a "bonafide Heisman Trophy candidate" before the 
Huskies were routed by mighty Northwestern. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Despite its come-from-ahead defeat to Notre Dame in South Bend on opening 
night, Michigan may have the best team in the nation. On a bad day, the 
Wolverines still were able to handle decent Maryland, 45-17. . . . 
</P>
<P>
BYU quarterback Ty Detmer on being intercepted five times by Oregon: "I threw 
'em, they caught 'em." . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the hot Arizonas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Auburn Coach Pat Dye sure loves ties. He wore a grin and waved his cap to the 
fans on his way to the dressing room after the Tigers' 26-26 tie with 
Tennessee. And remember that draw with Syracuse in the Sugar Bowl? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Dye had gone for one point instead of two when the Tigers trailed 19-9, they 
would have won Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State freshman running back Robert Smith had his problems against USC, but 
he's a dead ringer for O.J. Simpson with those long, graceful strides. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bad taste award: To CBS for reporting that New York Jets Coach Bruce Coslet was 
fined by the NFL for making an obscene gesture -- and then showing it on "The 
NFL Today." . . . 
</P>
<P>
No changes were reported over the weekend in the NFC West standings or Willie 
McGee's National League batting average.

SEEMAN GIVING UP FLAGS FOR THE FLAGSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER 16 YEARS AS AN OFFICIAL, JERRY SEEMAN WILL LEAVE GAME DUTY 
TO BECOME THE TOP COP IN THE NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FRIDLEY, Minn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the last of Jerry Seeman's 16 years as an NFL game official. 
</P>
<P>
Next year he will succeed Art McNally, 65, as the league's chief umpire. 
</P>
<P>
And when he moves to New York, Seeman, 54, will take along a big glass cookie 
jar full of screws -- tiny ones, oversized ones, aluminum ones, brass screws, 
iron screws, even one shining copper screw. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been our favorite conversation piece," Seeman's wife, Marilyn, said 
recently at their home near Minneapolis. "The screws were all donated by 
Cleveland Browns' fans a few years ago after Jerry refereed a game (there). 
</P>
<P>
"Some controversial penalties (were called). And an Ohio sportswriter suggested 
action (when the Browns lost). He told the fans to write the NFL office 
enclosing screws and messages stating that Jerry Seeman 'screwed Cleveland.' 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of dismays some of our friends to see that hundreds of fans were that 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't dismay the NFL's new top cop, whose official title will be 
director of officiating -- making him first among the 107 equals in a 
department with such household names as Jim Tunney and Jerry Markbreit, among 
other recent Super Bowl referees. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the people are happy with every call you make," said Seeman, who will be 
working tonight's Cincinnati at Seattle game. "And half are unhappy. You just 
can't let it bother you. That's the first thing a (referee) learns." 
</P>
<P>
So it was the first thing he told his sons when, as teen-agers, all three of 
them started off in his footsteps as Little League umpires. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers when his youngest son, Jeff, after working a Little League game, 
came home uncharacteristically quiet and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
And that depressed his mother, who asked: "What's wrong, son?" 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand it when people yell at me," Jeff said. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to do it is, simply ignore (the crowd). When you know you're right, 
you don't even hear them," said his father, expressing sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the problem, Daddy," the young umpire said. "I don't know if I'm 
right." 
</P>
<P>
To Jerry Seeman, that is the cardinal sin. Being right, he holds, is almost all 
there is to officiating, and he has so informed his sons -- among many others. 
Knowing the rule book is Seeman's fetish. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know you're right, you shouldn't be out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to do a 10-chapter book on refereeing, the first nine chapters would 
be on preparation -- on rules study, mechanics, communication, and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"The 10th and shortest chapter would be headed, how to referee a football game. 
If you're fully prepared, refereeing takes care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MIDWESTERNER 
</P>
<P>
Though widely traveled, Seeman, a high school mathematics teacher by 
profession, has rarely spent more than a weekend away from the rural Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in small towns all his life. 
</P>
<P>
His father managed a grain elevator near St. Charles, Minn. (population 1,548) 
in the years when Jerry and an older brother were born in a nearby Mississippi 
River town, Winona (population 25,031). 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn and Jerry both went to the small college there, Winona State, and their 
sons -- Michael, 33; Jon, 31, and Jeff, 27, who all live in Minneapolis -- are 
business graduates of the University of Minnesota, where they were on the golf 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Seemans are a close-knit family that seldom leaves home except on business. 
They have strangely never even had a real vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the year I'm out of town weekends to (referee) NFL games," Seeman said. 
"So I take my vacation a day or two at a time on those trips." 
</P>
<P>
Said son Michael: "When we were growing up, the highlight for us kids was a 
trip with dad. He took one of us to an NFL game every year, and he let us pick 
out the towns -- anywhere we wanted to go -- San Francisco, New Orleans, New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, as a decidedly provincial person, the head of the family has, until 
now, carefully avoided New York. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the NFL want this man? 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry is a proven administrator as well as an excellent referee," Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue said, adding that no other candidate is as well qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeably, Seeman now supervises 250 employees in the school district 
where he lives, a district that promoted him years ago to director of finance 
and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
On the side, he negotiates labor issues with groups of teachers, clerks and 
custodians. 
</P>
<P>
On still another side, Seeman has been officiating basketball games three times 
a week for 27 years, and doubling, since 1975, as the Minnesota state 
supervisor of high school basketball officials. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, he also did high school football," Marilyn Seeman said, mentioning 
the day that Jerry made a 120-mile trip in a November blizzard to work a 
football game at Cosmos, Minn. (population 382). 
</P>
<P>
It snowed so hard during the game, she said, that "not a single spectator 
showed up." 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days when football officials carried red penalty flags or 
markers, and, in the storm, "Jerry's bright red flag faded all over his 
uniform," Marilyn said. "We had to throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
That hurt because in that league, football officials outfitted themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"He got his usual $15 (fee)," his wife recalled. "It paid for his gasoline and 
the flag, but not, of course, the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhat bitterly, I asked him, 'Was it worth it?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I had a ball,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Jerry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAN IN MOTION 
</P>
<P>
Last month, unexpectedly, Seeman spent the Labor Day weekend in jail. At the 
beginning of one of his rare three-day holidays, he was coming home from a 
Friday night game at Kansas City when his wife picked him up at the Minneapolis 
airport and drove him to Preston, Minn., where she had heard about a 
bed-and-breakfast place known as the Jail House. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time it really was a jail," Marilyn said. "And it's still a very quiet 
place -- a great place to get away from it all." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, she wasn't surprised a few hours later to see her hard-working 
husband enjoying his mini-vacation. Sitting contentedly by the pool, he was 
reading a book. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked over his shoulder, I could see what it was," she said with a 
trace of vexation. "The NFL rule book. At home, he can read it by the hour. I 
guess it made his holiday, too." 
</P>
<P>
There are weeks without end when Jerry Seeman is never still or tranquil except 
when reading the rule book. He is a man of action, a man of apparently 
limitless energy. 
</P>
<P>
Erect, slight, barely of average height, he is also distinguished by a youthful 
military bearing. He could pass for a 1970 graduate of West Point. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, mingling with football players who seem a foot taller, he is a 
more erect Lou Holtz -- equally intense, perhaps less irritable, but no less 
energetic. 
</P>
<P>
His wife remembers a night game he officiated not long ago at Texas Stadium, 
when, as usual, she recorded it on the family VCR, and then went to bed at 
midnight while he was flying home from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Awakened by a strange noise at 4 a.m., Marilyn crept down to the living room, 
where Jerry was engrossed in the tape -- three hours before an alarm clock was 
set to wake him for his school job. 
</P>
<P>
"He hardly needs any sleep," she said. "On the other hand, he's one of those 
unusual people who can sleep in. Any time they want to. Most of the time, 
though, he doesn't have time to sleep. When you work day and night, who does?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IT MUST BE SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
Seeman's schedule is a study in how to escape a life of indolence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He puts in an eight-hour day at school, works overtime most afternoons, 
directing the state's basketball officials, drives to other high schools at 
night -- to officiate games or practices -- and flies out weekends to referee 
NFL games or minicamp scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three times a week, he swims, runs and lifts weights. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is often the featured speaker at Midwestern chambers of commerce, 
Kiwanis clubs and other such places. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And if he's ushering at the family church, St. Philip's Lutheran, it must 
be Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cadwell, a fellow usher, said: "When Jerry's in town, he never misses a 
church service. If anybody wants him, he never misses a baptism, either, or a 
wedding or funeral." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, from one 16-hour day to the next, Seeman manages to project 
an inner lightheartedness. He is strangely as unemotional as he is intense. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry is just a fun guy to be around," said Cadwell, the athletic director at 
Columbia Heights High School in a Minneapolis suburb. "He lights up the place 
wherever he is." 
</P>
<P>
Even, apparently, when playing golf, which is hard to do lightheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf is his only real hobby, and it's one of the things we do together," his 
wife said. "Last month when he had a few hours off, we went out to the Chosen 
Valley Golf Club and played 18 holes." 
</P>
<P>
Then as Marilyn called it a day, Jerry went back to the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
"He hooked on with three or four other guys -- he'll hook on with anyone who's 
there -- and played another 18 holes," she said. "He's got so much energy that 
36 holes are never enough." 
</P>
<P>
A close friend, Bernie Kukar, a Minneapolis-based NFL field judge, has noticed 
that Seeman has "absolutely no other interests." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the trip they made together to a northern Minnesota lake, where 
Seeman didn't fish or hunt or hike anywhere, Kukar said: 
</P>
<P>
"All he did was sit by the damn fire and read the damn rule book. As you may 
have heard, Minnesota is the snowmobile capital of the world, and he's never 
even been on a snowmobile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BUSY HIKER 
</P>
<P>
At one Monday night game that he remembers with little fondness, Seeman, 
watching a Chicago Bear block a Cleveland Brown during a kickoff return, blew 
the whistle. Clipping. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a great call," he said. "I clearly saw the low block." 
</P>
<P>
But when Seeman got home, his wife straightened him out. She had videotaped the 
game, and the verdict was in living color: a beautiful block, a legal play. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy had come off a high block," Seeman said. "I'd just caught the latter 
part of it. I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Which seems to prove two things. Seeman believes that confessing is good for 
the soul. And he has a helpful wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Marilyn records every game I work, and we study the videos carefully," he 
said. "(Officiating) is an integral part of her life. She reads Referee 
magazine cover to cover." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Marilyn would rather be outdoors in Minnesota than inside, anywhere, 
reading Referee. Thus when Jerry moves to New York, she's going to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I don't like New York," she said. "It's that our entire family 
is here -- three children, five grandchildren, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry will be only the second Seeman in 75 years to leave Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll visit him a lot, and he'll come through here many times on the kind of 
job he has, but, well, the NFL has a big office. He doesn't need me to tape his 
games anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, moreover, Marilyn has two jobs of her own. She is a homemaker who 
doubles as a sales representative for a cosmetics company. 
</P>
<P>
"If I leave, I leave all my customers here," she said. "Most of the business is 
re-orders now, but I still do shows once a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
The shows, for five or six potential customers at a time, can be in any 
Minneapolis-area home including hers. 
</P>
<P>
She prefers hers. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 25 years, the Seemans have lived on one of Minnesota's 10,000 
lakes, Moore Lake, where their children grew up swimming and fishing in the 
summer, and ice skating and ice fishing in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Their home is one of several hundred middle-class residences in the town of 
Fridley, the Minneapolis suburb that is known throughout the area as friendly 
Fridley. It's so small that it doesn't have a real downtown. But it is full of 
friendly neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all of us have lived here 20, 30 years," Marilyn said. "The school 
district gets smaller and smaller because there are fewer and fewer children. 
Most friendly Fridley old-timers love it so much they won't move." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, three of them were out walking again -- Marilyn and two 
other women who live on her street. They hike nights because they work days, 
she said, and as usual it was dark before they started their usual three-mile 
hike, which as usual was completed without incident. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing to be afraid of after dark in friendly Fridley, Marilyn said, 
so she walks every night of the year unless it's 20 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
"We bundle up and go out in rain or snow, or even when it's 10 or 15 below," 
she said. "We keep track, though, and if it's 20 below, it's, 'See you later.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference between 15 and 20? 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty below is really cold," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PREVENT OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, when Seeman began his NFL career, he had already put in 10 
years as a football official, most recently in the Big Ten, although, as a high 
school and college referee, he was hardly a celebrity. Few prep or college 
officials are. 
</P>
<P>
And so at his first pro game, as he stepped onto the field, Seeman basked in 
the approval voiced by a large Kansas City crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"The young women, especially, were oohing and ahing," he said. "I told myself, 
'Hey, Jerry, you've arrived.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then, glancing around, he happened to notice that the New York Jets' 
quarterback, Joe Namath, was coming along behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the players were looking at Namath," Seeman said. "I got a little 
humility that day." 
</P>
<P>
Not enough, though, to undermine his self-assurance, or his sense of 
self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
At Menomonie, Wis., they remember the college basketball game that Seeman, with 
his customary confidence, worked one time shortly before Thanksgiving, when, on 
a dare, a couple of students released a turkey they had smuggled in. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to call time," said Seeman's fellow official that night, Bernie Kukar. 
"The turkey flopped around on the basketball floor, and deposited little tokens 
of its presence everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Most officials would have summoned the custodians and sat down to wait things 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my inclination," said Kukar. "But not Jerry's. He immediately ejected 
the turkey for traveling. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he borrowed some towels from the bench, and got down on his hands and 
knees, crawling from place to place, cleaning things up. You don't know many 
people who would take charge that decisively at such a time. Or who would feel 
sure enough of themselves to do it." 
</P>
<P>
As a referee, Seeman is defined by his decisiveness -- a virtue that coaches 
treasure second only to calls against the other team. 
</P>
<P>
Said a veteran Minnesota basketball coach, Ron Cadwell: "There's never any 
doubt that Jerry Seeman has really seen the (foul). He drops to one knee, 
finger pointing, eyes flashing, always confident, always in control." 
</P>
<P>
Another veteran Minneapolis-area coach, Whitey Johnson of Robbinsdale, 
remembers the first time Seeman nailed one of his basketball players for a 
minor infraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a mother scolding a child," Johnson said. " 'Jimmy, don't do that 
anymore.' He was so precise and emphatic that the message was clear: 'You made 
a mistake, young man.' 
</P>
<P>
"We learned soon enough that (Seeman) is like that all the time. He demands 
respect -- but it is obvious that he also respects athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Seeman's precision, often cited, is no doubt a byproduct of his math training. 
He has a master's degree in mathematics. But it is his high energy level that 
brought him into officiating. 
</P>
<P>
As did most referees, he began as a coach. As a college junior, he was the 
varsity quarterback and also the coach of the freshman football team at Winona 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Then as a high school math teacher doubling as an assistant coach in both 
football and basketball, he found himself with so much time on his hands that 
he started officiating nights. 
</P>
<P>
Discovering that he liked officiating better than either math or coaching, 
Seeman set two goals for himself, the Big Ten and the NFL, and moved swiftly up 
the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I believe in the strongest, besides knowing the rules, is preventive 
officiating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent NFL game refereed by Seeman, an all-pro pass rusher who was racing 
at the quarterback pulled up just as the ball was thrown -- brushing against 
the passer, but not quite knocking him down. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice job, Smith, very nice," Seeman told the defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining afterward, he said: "I want the tough guys to know I'm watching." 
</P>
<P>
On another pass play a week later, when Seeman penalized a fullback for an 
illegal block, the player swore at him angrily, calling him a colorful if 
indecent name. 
</P>
<P>
That is a 15-yard foul, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Taking an official timeout, Seeman walked up to the fullback, who is 
approximately twice his size, and, his voice rising, asked: "What did you say 
to me?" 
</P>
<P>
The player, thinking faster than usual, mumbled: "Damn good call." 
</P>
<P>
And that was "the end of that," said Seeman, who often seems to be smiling when 
he announces his calls on television. "I don't want to throw anybody out. I 
don't want to penalize anybody. I just want a good, clean game." 
</P>
<P>
According to his old high school coach, Jerry Eckstein, who still lives in 
Plainview, Minn., Seeman remains among the town's favorite players. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the smallest guy on our basketball team," Eckstein said. "But one year 
he averaged 18 points a game." 
</P>
<P>
That reminded the retired Plainview coach that although his team was taught to 
congratulate the other team's players after each game, win or lose, Seeman 
almost never participated. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Eckstein said, "The other coaches used to mosey over after the game 
and look Jerry up -- and talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it for a while. Then I told myself, 'This guy has 
something. He will go a long way.' "

PACKERS RALLY FOR VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: MAJKOWSKI THROWS THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES, DIRECTS TWO FOURTH-QUARTER 
SCORING DRIVES TO LEAD GREEN BAY PAST DETROIT.

Don Majkowski appears to have regained his form. 
</P>
<P>
After missing all of training camp in a contract dispute, the Green Bay 
Packers' all-pro quarterback finally found his rhythm Sunday against the 
Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski completed 28 of 46 passes for 289 yards and three touchdowns as the 
Packers came from behind to defeat the Lions, 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an all-pro," Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said of Majkowski. "He makes $1 
million, and some of the guys covering make $65,000. He's a great quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski also was the Packers' leading rusher with 88 yards in eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to come through to get some confidence back in the team and in 
myself," said Majkowski, who has averaged nearly 400 yards total offense in the 
five games he's started against Detroit. "I think now we'll really start to 
come together." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski connected with Ed West on a three-yard touchdown pass play, with 
Michael Haddix on a four-yarder and with Jeff Query from 26 yards out with 55 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"The final drive really reminded me of last year," said Majkowski, who helped 
Green Bay win seven games by four points or less as the Packers compiled a 10-6 
record in 1989. "We were relaxed and confident because we had been there before 
in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
While Majkowski was enjoying one of his better days, Detroit kicker Eddie 
Murray turned in one of his worst, missing four field-goal attempts -- 
including a 44-yarder with three seconds left that would have tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse for the misses," Murray said. "I let a lot of people down, 
and it's tough to swallow right now, but I'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will be the worst day I ever have." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Peete completed 17 of 34 for 200 yards and one touchdown for Detroit 
(1-3). He also scored one on a seven-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions had a 21-10 lead when Majkowski found his touch late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
First, Majkowski capped a 61-yard drive with the touchdown pass to Haddix with 
11:01 left that brought the Packers to within 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
After Murray missed field-goal attempts from 50 and 51 yards, Majkowski drove 
the Packers 66 yards in nine plays, hitting Query for the go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit then drove to the 26, where Murray was wide-left on his 44-yard attempt 
with three seconds left.

BUCS' CHRISTIE MAKES COACH LOOK GOOD; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: HE KICKS GAME-WINNING FIELD GOAL IN OVERTIME AFTER THE MAN HE BEAT FOR THE

Steve Christie made Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins look like a genius when he 
kicked a 36-yard field goal 9:11 into sudden-death overtime to give the 
Buccaneers a 23-20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins was criticized for selecting Christie, a free-agent kicker, over Donald 
Igwebuike, an established NFL veteran, during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an idea that, with Iggy and myself in this game, it might come down to 
field goals," said Christie. 
</P>
<P>
It did. Christie was perfect on three field goals and two extra points while 
Igwebuike had two of each. But Igwebuike missed one that could have won it for 
the Vikings from 48 yards just 3:53 before Christie won the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for him," said Christie. "He could have made it as easily as he missed 
it. I thought he'd make it because I know how good he is." 
</P>
<P>
The trajectory on Igwebuike's attempt was low and tipped by Tampa Bay's Paul 
Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think he'd make it," said Perkins. "I told our guys that he wouldn't 
make it. It was too far out for him. He missed one last year against the 
Vikings from that same distance." 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (3-1) is off to its best start since going 4-0 in 1979, when it won 
the NFC Central title. Minnesota is 1-3 for the first time since 1972 and saw a 
13-game home winning streak snapped. The Vikings hadn't lost at home since Oct. 
16, 1988, to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike blamed himself for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to get back at anybody," he said. "I'm not worried about 
Tampa. I lost the game. All the guys busted their (behinds) for 60-something 
minutes, then I come in for a few seconds and couldn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Christie's winning kick was set up by Wayne Haddix, who intercepted Rich 
Gannon's pass at Minnesota's 26. Gannon, making his first start at quarterback 
after three years as a third stringer, played well in place of injured Wade 
Wilson. He completed 19 of 36 passes for 253 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucs trailed 20-13 before Vinny Testaverde passed for all 74 yards on the 
tying drive, capped by his 11-yard touchdown pass to Bruce Hill with 24 seconds 
left. Testaverde, who had only 88 yards passing before the drive, said the 
huddle was unusually quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say anything. I looked at them and they looked at me like, 'We're 
ready,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gannon threw two touchdown passes in a 3:06 span late in the fourth quarter, 
rallying the Vikings to a 20-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucs controlled the first 3 1/2 quarters and led 13-6 midway through the 
fourth when Reggie Cobb broke loose for a 17-yard run into Minnesota territory. 
But he fumbled when hit by Joey Browner, and Mike Merriweather recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Gannon's seven-yard touchdown pass to Carter tied the score at 13 with 4:35 to 
go. After the Vikings' defense forced a punt, Gannon threw a 41-yard scoring 
pass to Hassan Jones.

</P>
<P>
AFC: O'BRIEN PASSES FOR 282 YARDS TO LEAD THE JETS TO 37-13 VICTORY OVER A TEAM 
TRYING BLOCK OUT THE TURMOIL OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES.

The black cloud over the New England Patriots got even darker Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A 37-13 rout by the New York Jets was piled on the turmoil over a female 
reporter's claim she was sexually harassed by several Patriots players and 
speculation that owner Victor Kiam was planning major management changes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to block it out," New England wide receiver Sammy Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
But there was one bizarre bright spot for the Patriots: fewer than one-third of 
the 36,724 spectators who filed into the stadium were still there to see the 
dismal ending. 
</P>
<P>
For the Jets, Ken O'Brien completed 19 of 29 passes for 282 yards and a 
touchdown, Brad Baxter rushed for two touchdowns, Blair Thomas had his first 
100-yard game, and Rob Moore caught nine passes for 175 yards, including a 
69-yard score. Pat Leahy added field goals of 18, 24 and 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy for the Jets (2-2) to forget last Monday night's 30-7 loss to 
Buffalo. It was impossible for the Patriots (1-3) to forget the uproar stemming 
from the incident 13 days earlier involving Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson. 
</P>
<P>
The woes of New England mounted early as the Jets scored on their first 
possession. Baxter's one-yard run capped an 11-play, 54-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter added a 28-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, making the score 
31-6 after Michael Mayes' first NFL interception. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays after Kyle Clifton intercepted a pass, Leahy kicked his 18-yard 
field goal, increasing the margin to 34-6 with 1:36 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After the first of Jason Staurovsky's two field goals, a 46-yarder, cut New 
York's lead to 7-3, O'Brien and Moore hooked up on the 69-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
Staurovsky's 40-yard field goal made the score 14-6 with 5:48 left in the 
second quarter. Leahy answered that with a 24-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets got the ball back 1:22 before halftime. O'Brien threw a 36-yard 
completion to Moore, taking the ball to the Patriots' 11. Three plays later, 
Freeman McNeil's four-yard scoring run built the halftime lead to 24-6.

RAIDERS FIND GAULT TO BE GOOD CATCH; 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE: FORMER BEAR HAS OUTSTANDING GAME AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAMMATES, WHO 
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Wide receiver Willie Gault of the Raiders dropped what would have been a 
60-yard touchdown pass on the first play of an exhibition game against the 
Chicago Bears six weeks ago at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
But Gault didn't drop any passes Sunday when the Raiders beat the Bears, 24-10, 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Gault, who had just five receptions for 105 yards in his first three games this 
season, nearly matched those number Sunday, catching four passes for 103 yards 
against the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity was there for Gault and I thought he did an outstanding job," 
Raider Coach Art Shell said. "Every week one of those receivers steps forward 
and does the job for us." 
</P>
<P>
Gault beat Chicago cornerback Lemuel Stinson on a 59-yard post pattern, which 
set up the Raiders' first touchdown, Marcus Allen's one-yard run. Gault also 
beat Stinson on a 27-yard reception on a look-in pattern that set up Jeff 
Jaeger's 27-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Was it difficult for Stinson to cover Gault? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not tough at all," Stinson said. "He just played well. I'm not scared of 
him. He's not God. He played well and he caught two passes against me, but he's 
not the Man upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
How did Gault beat Stinson on the 59-yard reception? 
</P>
<P>
"He was running away from me," Stinson said. "He wasn't running up the field, 
he was running away from me. The only thing I've got to say is that he didn't 
score." 
</P>
<P>
But Allen was able to score two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Traded to the Raiders by Chicago in 1988, Gault had his best game of the season 
against his old team. Did playing the Bears inspire him? 
</P>
<P>
"These were my old buddies, but you've got to play the game on the field and 
not in the papers," Gault said. "It didn't feel any different to beat them. It 
was just the fourth game. It feels good to win because we're 4-0 and it gives 
us a little more confidence because the Bears are a quality team." 
</P>
<P>
Did Gault have an advantage playing against the Bears because he played for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been three years," Gault said. "I really don't know what they're doing 
there. I really didn't know exactly what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by injuries in 1988, his first season with the Raiders, Gault caught 
just 16 passes for 392 yards and two touchdowns, his least productive season in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Although he averaged 24.6 yards per catch last season, best in Raider history, 
and had 28 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns, Gault was overshadowed 
by teammate Mervyn Fernandez, who caught 57 passes for 1,069 yards and nine 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez had been the Raiders' primary target again this season, catching 
seven passes for 130 yards and one touchdown in the first three games. It 
seemed as if Gault had been forgotten in the Raider passing scheme. Gault 
didn't catch a pass in last week's 20-3 victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
But Gault stepped forward Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a selfish player," Gault said. "As long as we win the games it doesn't 
matter who gets the passes or the accolades because I think there's enough for 
everyone. It doesn't matter to me if I never caught another pass. But if we win 
and I can do something to contribute, whether it's clearing someone out or 
making a big block, then that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
After playing conservatively in their first three games, with quarterback Jay 
Schroeder throwing just two touchdown passes, the Raiders opened up their 
offense against the Bears, with Gault running deep patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie played exceptional today," Schroeder said. "Every time you play a team 
that you used to play with I think you're excited about playing and Willie was 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
Gault praised Schroeder for throwing accurate passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along that Jay's been throwing the ball well," Gault said. "He 
did a great job today." 
</P>
<P>
Did the Raiders plan to throw deep against the Bears, who had the NFC's second 
best defense? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come in to the game thinking we could throw deep right away," 
Schroeder said. "But the coaches upstairs saw that the safety (rookie Mark 
Carrier of USC) wasn't getting back. He's a young kid and he'll learn a lesson. 
If you don't back up right at the snap of the ball with Willie Gault he's going 
to run by you and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' long strike passing game was particularly effective because the 
Bear defensive secondary overplays against the run. 
</P>
<P>
"They had had a lot of success playing that kind of defense against Green Bay 
and Minnesota and I didn't expect them to change their whole defense because we 
had a couple guys who could run," Gault said. "You just can't run the ball down 
the Bears' throat all the time because they're really strong up front." 
</P>
<P>
With Gault stretching the Bears' defense, Fernandez ran short routes and caught 
three passes for 57 yards, including a diving 21-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
Gault, Fernandez and Tim Brown give the Raiders the depth at wide receiver 
necessary to play the deep passing game fancied by Raider owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"With Willie, you've got to be aware of the deep pass because he's going get 
deep on you no matter what and consequently it opens things up for Mervyn on 
the outside," Brown said. "Everybody knows Willie's going deep but no one can 
stop him." 
</P>
<P>
And the Bears couldn't stop Gault either.

BASEBALL: KELLY, WIFE OF JACK HOWELL, SAYS BEING A COMEDIAN HELPS FAMILY COPE 
WITH THE ANGEL THIRD BASEMAN'S WORST SEASON.

It is almost a joke in itself: Jack Howell -- somber-faced, earnest, 
cordial-but-decidedly-serious Jack Howell -- married to a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Ba-dum-bump. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to pray he would hit a home run," Kelly Howell said. "Then I hoped for 
a single. Now I just hope he'll get hit by a pitch, so he can remember what it 
feels like to be on first base." 
</P>
<P>
Ba-dum-bump. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen his nose? It's huge. The doctor said I had to have our kids 
(by) Caesarean (section) because of that nose." 
</P>
<P>
Heartless? Nah, Kelly says. 
</P>
<P>
"With his baseball, it kind of helps when I joke, especially this season," 
Kelly said. "What else can you do when the guy's batting .217 (actually .226)? 
He's given me a lot of material." 
</P>
<P>
The Angel third baseman is in the final days of the worst season of his career. 
Entering the season's final series against the Athletics in Oakland, Jack is 
hitting .226 with seven home runs and 30 runs batted in, all career lows since 
1987, his first full season with the Angels. He has committed 16 errors, a 
career high. 
</P>
<P>
Does Jack laugh? Well, no, but that's no indication. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell her that when I don't laugh, that means it's funny," deadpanned Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Surely a wry and dry wit lurks beneath that stoic surface. Or does it? He can't 
be completely humorless. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly says he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He will argue till the day he dies," she said. "The bottom line, you heard it 
from me, is he has no sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly might have drawn on Jack's dismal season to flesh out her routine. 
Strains of Stand-up by Your Man? 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she put her own fledgling career on hold when Jack was sent to the 
minor leagues July 28 for a month. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, 26, began her career as a comic three years ago, when she started going 
to open-mike nights at comedy clubs. Later, she got some stand-up work at 
Laffs, a Tucson comedy club. And just before Jack was sent down to triple-A 
Edmonton, she auditioned for the Orange County Crazies, a local comedy troupe, 
and made it. 
</P>
<P>
Then Jack was sent down and she quit. 
</P>
<P>
The Howells weren't sure when Jack would make it back to Anaheim, and with the 
school year drawing near, Kelly took their children, Joshua, 6, and Dallas, 
almost 3, home to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't going to have my family spread out all across the country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with Jack back with the Angels and a live-in baby-sitter in Tucson, 
Kelly has joined an improvisation troupe, Group Therapy, that works occasional 
nights in front of the college crowd at Laffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a baseball player's wife helped me get my foot in the door," Kelly said. 
"But since I've been with this group, nobody in the audience knows who the heck 
I am. It's kind of nice, because they like me without knowing about Jack." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, after this season . . . "Now you say you're Jack Howell's wife, and 
people say, 'So what?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who admires such comics as Louie Anderson, Paula Poundstone and Bette 
Midler, says her goal is to be on a sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be absolutely wonderful," she said. "But then I think, 'You're in 
Tucson.' " 
</P>
<P>
She would also like to do commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're well-written and humorous," she said. "Some of them, come on, let's 
face it. . . . 'Come on over to City of Cars?' But you can't say, 'I'm just too 
big for this now.' Really, just doing what I'm doing, I love it. I'm not super 
goal-oriented with the kids the age they are." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Jack started dating when she was a freshman and he was a senior at 
Palo Verde High School in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly says she was "like a pork chop." And what did she see in Jack? 
</P>
<P>
"Potential," she cracked. "What can you say? He was 5-7, 130 pounds, with 
braces and a permanent in his hair." 
</P>
<P>
Major league potential, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," Kelly said. "This guy, he was terrible. He would play the last couple 
of innings. He was never a great baseball player in high school. At Arizona, he 
led the team in errors, all-time, ever-ever." 
</P>
<P>
Jack committed 25 errors at Arizona in 1983, but did not set a record for 
errors in a season. 
</P>
<P>
But he improved, and eventually made a major league baseball player's wife out 
of Kelly. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"A baseball player's wife who does something other than shop," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the baseball player's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly thinks the world of some of them as individuals. But as a group, baseball 
wives are fodder, just like Jack. 
</P>
<P>
"They're soooo perfect!" Kelly said. "Their clothes, their hair. The first time 
I went to a game I asked one of the wives where they were going out afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere. Kelly withered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting there in jeans and a T-shirt with mustard on it." 
</P>
<P>
And of course, there are the groupies. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to sit behind them," Kelly said. "At Anaheim Stadium I sat behind some 
girls who were commenting on the players. Jack gets up and they say, 'Ooooh, 
look at his arms!' " 
</P>
<P>
Kelly tapped one on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I slept with that guy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't!" they squealed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had his child." 
</P>
<P>
"Ooh!" 
</P>
<P>
Jack is about to get a welcome respite from baseball after a miserable year. 
And Kelly will keep plugging at her career, in this club or that. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this other place," she said. "Tequila Mockingbird." 
</P>
<P>
Tequila Mockingbird? 
</P>
<P>
Kelly laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack went through the minors, and I have to start with this."

CLEMENTS ON TOP OF GAME AFTER INJURY; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: THREE-YEAR STARTER HAS HELPED LA HABRA GIRLS' TEAM WIN COUNTY 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND TAKE NO. 1 SPOT IN COACHES' POLL.

LA HABRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Missy Clements didn't stick around to help the La Habra High School girls' 
volleyball team win its first Division II state championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Highlanders' standout middle blocker was in the locker room 
watching her left knee swell to the size of a grapefruit. She had separated her 
kneecap while spiking the ball in the first game of the match against 
Campolindo, a school in Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went up to hit the ball it was set near my left shoulder," Clements 
said. "When I came down, I landed on my left knee and I heard my kneecap go 
'pop' and I said, 'See you later.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a disappointing finish for Clements, who was enjoying her best season. 
</P>
<P>
Before the injury, she had averaged 24 kills per match and led the Highlanders 
to a 21-1 record and the Southern Section 3-A championship. She was named the 
3-A co-player of the year with Christy Janssen of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so frustrated because I wanted to play in the (state) finals so bad," 
Clements said. "My physical therapist (Steve Nicholas of Fullerton) came down 
from the stands and we tried to tape it up, but I couldn't even walk on it." 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly a year since Clements injured her knee, and she's hoping her 
senior season will wipe away the memories of her injury. 
</P>
<P>
So far, she has no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders (6-0) are ranked No. 1 in the state and 11th nationally by 
Volleyball Monthly magazine. They enjoyed one of the biggest victories in 
school history when they won the Orange County championships two weeks ago, 
upsetting 5-A powerhouses Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Clements has been recruited by more than 20 colleges, ranging from Washington 
to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the memory of leaving the state finals on crutches last season still 
lingers. 
</P>
<P>
Clements doesn't need to look any farther than her dresser drawer to find a 
picture of her swollen knee. She keeps it as a reminder of her pain and 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"When it happened, I told my mom, 'I want a picture because this is never going 
to happen to me again,' " Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
Her knee was in a brace for six weeks to give it a chance to heal. It was the 
second time in a year the kneecap had popped while she was playing volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
When the brace was removed in January, Clements didn't like what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked skinny and flimsy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her rehabilitation, which included weight training, stretching and other forms 
of boring, painful exercise, meant daily trips to Nicholas' physical therapy 
office. 
</P>
<P>
But Clements saw quick results. She was back playing club volleyball in a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really worried about her," said Sandy Blumenthal, who is in her 20th 
year coaching volleyball at La Habra. "But when she came back this year, her 
knee seemed to be stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal didn't have time to bring Clements and the Highlanders along slowly 
this season. Two weeks ago, she entered her team in the top division at the 
Orange County championships. 
</P>
<P>
That meant the Highlanders would play some of the county's top 5-A teams, such 
as Corona del Mar, Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor. No more beating up on 
lesser teams such as La Mirada and Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
And, to the surprise of nearly everyone but Clements, her teammates and coach, 
the Highlanders won it all. 
</P>
<P>
Clements, a three-year starter, had 25 kills in a five-game victory over Laguna 
Beach in the finals and was named the tournament's most valuable player. The 
victory boosted the Highlanders from third to first in the Orange County 
coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since my freshman year, I wanted to play the 5-A teams and show we could 
be competitive with the top schools in the nation," Clements said. "For me, 
winning that tournament was more important than winning the state finals." 
</P>
<P>
The victory also helped the north county school gain respect in a sport 
dominated by south county teams. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people looked at us and didn't give us a chance," Clements said. 
"That's fine with me, as long as we go out and kick some butt like we did." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most rewarding moments of the tournament for La Habra was a 
five-game victory over Corona del Mar in the semifinals. The Sea Kings were 
ranked second in the nation and No. 1 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I had played against a lot of the Corona del Mar girls in club volleyball and 
they always beat us," Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
After the semifinal match, Clements and her teammates looked at the tournament 
bracket posted on the door of the Edison High gym. 
</P>
<P>
Someone already had written in Corona del Mar as the winner of the match. 
</P>
<P>
After some quick editing, the bracket read: La Habra, 11-15, 17-15, 6-15, 
20-18, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the grueling-type matches that we had against Corona del Mar," Clements 
said. "Then we go back to the 3-A level and play Los Altos and Esperanza, and 
it's a big drop." 
</P>
<P>
La Habra features one of the tallest lineups in the county with Zrinka Kristich 
(6 feet 5), Ana Kristich (6-1), Clements (5-10), Lisa Ferguson (6-1) and 
Stefanie Bakke (5-8). Setter Lisa Almanza (5-1) often feels as if she's playing 
in the land of the giants. 
</P>
<P>
"We come across as being scary," Clements said. "Even when we first walk in the 
door of the gym." 
</P>
<P>
Said Blumenthal: "We're really balanced this year. We have so many people who 
can put the ball away and that really benefits Missy. If they (opponents) key 
on her, we can set the ball somewhere else, then bring her back up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Clements has helped the La Habra program grow over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is right up here," she said, pointing to her head. "We all have it 
in our mind that we refuse to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Many young La Habra players ask Clements for advice on spiking technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when people come and ask me things," Clements said. "It makes me 
think I actually know something." 
</P>
<P>
Players also ask her for advice on injuries, such as how to tape a knee, ankle 
or an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about going into physical therapy (in college)," Clements said. 
"I already know so much about taking care of knees."

ANN CONWAY: MONDAVI LIFTS GLASS TO POE; 
</P>
<P>
'PRICE, PINOT AND POE' TO SALUTE THE ACTOR, THE AUTHOR, THE WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Why don't they just let him be crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
Actor Vincent Price is sitting in the sun-filled living room of his Beverly 
Hills bungalow, sipping pinot and talking about Edgar Allan Poe. Art crowds the 
walls of the room and treasures from all over the world jam every available 
table surface. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to prove he wasn't crazy," Price continues, shaking his head. 
"He was the greatest American writer. He invented the romantic lyric song poem, 
the Gothic tale, the detective story. Why don't they just leave him alone?" 
</P>
<P>
The moment becomes a preview of sorts. On Oct. 25, Price will visit the Robert 
Mondavi Wine and Food Center in Costa Mesa to appear at a dinner dubbed "Price, 
Pinot and Poe." 
</P>
<P>
The actor is delighted about the chance to visit Orange County to sample pinot 
noir, dine (on "pumpkin, pigeon and pears," says an organizer) and entertain 
more than 100 guests with poetry by Poe. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a lot of movie roles based on Poe," Price says. " 'The Tell-Tale 
Heart,' 'The Masque of the Red Death,' 'The Pit and the Pendulum,' 'The Cask of 
Amontillado.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing then that intrigued me most about Poe was that he is the 
kind of author -- there's one for every country -- that kids think they have to 
read. They forget he is the greatest writer of his kind in the world, that his 
influence on art is incredible. Everybody thinks of Poe as the bogeyman." 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for Price to recite the macabre at the Mondavi. "I hope to bring 
some of Poe's romantic works to the dinner," Price says. "About 65 percent of 
his pieces are very sophisticated and romantic, very unlike the others." 
</P>
<P>
Price's love affair with wine began "years ago in St. Louis, Mo. -- where I was 
brought up," he says. "Where we just had grapes. You know, wine started with 
grapes; there weren't always these fancy names and things. It was wonderful 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in wine. I worked with the Wine Institute before 
it was called the Wine Institute. I was always trying to get people to learn 
about wine. It could be pretty terrible in those days unless you knew which 
wine to drink." 
</P>
<P>
Price's knowledge of the grape is what led Eric Hansen, director of the Mondavi 
Center, to ask the legendary actor to come to Costa Mesa. Last year, Hansen 
invited Price to speak about food and wine at the Kapalua Bay Club on Maui, 
Hawaii, at an annual wine symposium. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Price was wonderful," Hansen says. (Included in the witty actor's speech 
was a recipe for dishwasher trout that he'd whipped up for Johnny Carson on 
"The Tonight Show": "Tightly wrap trout in foil with lemon, wine, parsley, salt 
and pepper. Put it through the whole cycle. No soap!") Also appearing at the 
symposium was "Jeopardy" game show host Alex Trebek. ("I hope to have Trebek -- 
a great cook -- appear at the Mondavi one of these days soon," Hansen says.) 
</P>
<P>
"At the Mondavi Center we like to associate wine with the arts," Hansen 
explains. "And when I came to the idea that it would be great to have poetry, I 
thought of Mr. Price. Let's just say we're elevating Poe and pinot to very good 
company." 
</P>
<P>
When it came time for Price to have his picture taken for this story, he donned 
a straw hat and strolled slowly into his garden -- as packed with flowering 
plants and statuary as his house is with art and souvenir treasures. 
</P>
<P>
"I love hats," says the suave veteran of such film classics as "Laura" with 
Gene Tierney and "Victoria Regina" with Helen Hayes. "Do you think I should 
have dressed up more? When you look at the French magazines you always see 
people drinking wine casually. It doesn't always have to be a dress-up kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cooking up gourmet fare for the event will be Gary Jenanyan, head chef of the 
"Great Chefs Program" for the Robert Mondavi winery in Napa Valley, and Rosanne 
Ruiz, formerly of the Sorrento Grill in Laguna Beach and now in-house chef for 
the local Mondavi Center. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the guest list for "Price, Pinot and Poe" is film producer Tony 
Bill, owner with Liza Minelli and Dudley Moore of the 72nd Market Street 
restaurant in Los Angeles.

A ROAD NOT TAKEN BY ELLA FITZGERALD; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: SHE COULD HAVE BECOME A DANCER ON A FATEFUL DAY IN 1934. OPTING TO SING 
INSTEAD, SHE'S CLUNG TO HER ROOTS AND KEPT A YOUTHFUL OUTLOOK. SHE PERFORMS IN 
COSTA MESA TONIGHT.

<P>
In an interview before their appearance this past August at the Hollywood Bowl, 
83-year-old saxophonist Benny Carter talked about the first time he saw Ella 
Fitzgerald sing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 1934, and she was doing the amateur show at the Apollo Theatre in New 
York," Carter said of the now-legendary night when a 15-year-old Fitzgerald, 
worried that her legs were too skinny, made an instant career change. "She was 
going to enter a dance contest there and something happened that changed her 
mind and she sang instead. And that was the beginning of history." 
</P>
<P>
Is that really the way it happened? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes," Fitzgerald, who appears tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, said recently in a phone conversation from her home in Beverly Hills. 
"I went on stage to dance. I had made a bet with a girlfriend of mine. We had 
signed up for the amateur hour, and she told me I would be chicken if I didn't 
go out and do it. And of all the times for it to happen, I was the first 
amateur they called out. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw all those people, I lost my nerve. And the man said, 'You're out 
here, you have to do something.' So I tried to do a song that my mother was 
madly in love with that was sung by Miss Conee Boswell -- she played that 
record all the time. So I started to sing and won first prize. But there was no 
way in the world that I was going out there to dance." 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist was so impressed with the singer's Apollo Theatre performance 
that he took her to meet bandleader Fletcher Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"But he didn't want a girl singer at the time," Fitzgerald recalls. "He told 
me, 'Don't call me, I'll call you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The turndown from Henderson was only a brief pause in the singer's rise to 
stardom. Fitzgerald was soon recording with drummer Chick Webb's band, and, by 
1937, she won the first of many Down Beat magazine polls, an honor she shared 
that year with Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who's worked on and off with Fitzgerald in the last 55 years and 
appears on her most recent album, "All That Jazz," recorded in 1989, still has 
high praise for the singer. "Ella's singing is indescribable," he said. "She's 
a creator who uses her instrument just as the guy who blows into his saxophone. 
She has such acute hearing that she can hear the changes that are being played 
and create accordingly. She's a great talent." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald credits her mother with developing the aspiring singer's musical 
taste. "She listened to records all the time. Conee Boswell was one of her 
favorites -- that's how I started to sing "Object of My Affection" and "Judy" 
-- and so was Bessie Smith. The Mills Brothers had just become popular, and she 
liked them." 
</P>
<P>
"I love to sing and I love people and that has been what's got me through," she 
says of her success. Fitzgerald's incalculable popularity has come from her 
willingness to embrace a number of song styles and not just limit herself to 
jazz. She constructed her most recognizable hit, "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," in 1938 
from the well-known children's rhyme, with help from arranger Van Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
"The first place we played it," she says, "was Boston, Mass., and it was an 
overnight sensation, I think because people remembered the game. I never get 
tired of performing that one." 
</P>
<P>
Her audience widened considerably beginning in 1956 when producer Norman Granz 
enlisted the singer to do a number of recordings with music from various 
composers. The first of these, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song 
Book," became an immediate sensation. Collections from Rodgers and Hart, George 
and Ira Gershwin, Duke Ellington and Harold Arlen soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I was with (Granz's) Jazz at the Philharmonic, and he thought a 
lot of the jazz clubs were closing and that it was time to do something 
different. And the songbook went over so well, we just continued doing that 
kind of thing. I'm very grateful to him for that because it was like opening up 
a new thing for me, a new beginning. I not only had my jazz fans, I had people 
who like the pretty tunes. . . .

"In music, it's good to try a little of everything. That way, I feel like what 
I'm doing is trying to satisfy the whole audience. There's always somebody who 
comes up and says, 'You didn't do my song.' So we try to do a little something 
from all the composers. When I don't remember the words, I make up my own." 
</P>
<P>
Despite health problems in the last few years -- she had quintuple heart bypass 
surgery in 1986, and a severe virus caused her to cancel some of her 
engagements this summer -- Fitzgerald maintains the optimism and youthful 
outlook that has separated her from singers like Billie Holiday. This outlook 
is reflected in her aspiration to do a video that would recall her roots as a 
young dancer and singer, one that would embrace her fondness of children. "I'd 
love to do that. And I would love to do something that would give inspiration 
to the young ones, the little children. I'd like to do some songs like 'Muffin 
Man,' 'A-Tisket, A-Tasket' and a couple of things that are popular that the 
kids would like and let them dance. And I'd do a little dance." 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to study Spanish and do an album in the language someday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to the market, I sing a couple little songs in Spanish for the kids 
there. They like it, so I thought I might like to do an album -- I've done one 
in Portuguese. Those are the things that keep you going, when each day you're 
learning something. It might sound corny, but that's what I believe."

PROMOTER BEGINS TRIAL ON CHARGE OF OBSTRUCTION;

<P>
Four months after Huntington Beach police shut down a Dr. Dream Records 
LP-release party for noise allegations, a publicist for the label who was 
arrested during the incident continues kicking up his own ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Nociar, the Orange-based label's radio promotion director, was taken 
into custody on May 24 after persistently questioning police as to why they 
were breaking up the house party promoting the label's release of the Swamp 
Zombies' album, "Scratch and Sniff Car Crash." He was arrested on a charge of 
obstructing or delaying a police officer in his duties. 
</P>
<P>
Nociar, after rejecting a plea-bargain offer, is now on trial at West Orange 
County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the court offered to drop the charge if Nociar would pay $50. But he 
turned down the proposal, insisting that he is innocent and vowing to fight 
against what he considers police harassment and infringement upon his 
free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Nociar faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to intimidate me," Nociar said last week, while waiting 
outside the courtroom for the trial to begin. "Their point is an absurd one. 
The bottom line is, why should I have to pay $50, or have anything on my 
record, for one of their officer's (mistakes)?" 
</P>
<P>
Opening statements in his case are scheduled today, and attorneys in the case 
expect a verdict by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
Nociar was arrested at the party at the Huntington Beach home of Sam Lanni, 
formerly the owner of the defunct Safari Sam's nightclub and a friend of the 
Swamp Zombies. The band had played an acoustic concert at the party, which they 
concluded about 10 p.m., according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers showed up about 30 minutes later, ordering the party be 
ended immediately. Police said the party was loud enough to warrant breaking it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Nociar, as the record label's representative, intervened to ask officers why 
they were breaking up the party and inquire about their normal procedure for 
taking such measures. He says the party had quieted down by the time police 
arrived, so there was no reason to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, angered by his questioning, placed him under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nociar, he remained calm during the entire incident, while an 
officer belligerently ordered him to disperse the guests at once. 
</P>
<P>
Police have not accused Nociar of being verbally abusive or violent, but say 
his questioning of their orders amounted to an obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they saying I don't have a right to ask them why they came into the place 
and broke (the party) up?" Nociar asked last week. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who were present during the incident, including other Dr. Dream 
employees and a journalist, have been subpoenaed as witnesses in the case. 
However, Nociar's attorney, public defender Cynthia M. Moreno, said she doubts 
that any witnesses will be called. 
</P>
<P>
"There doesn't seem to be much question about the facts in the incident. It's 
just a matter of whether (jurors) believe (Nociar) had a right" to query the 
officers, Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection began Thursday. Both attorneys expect it to conclude today.

OBSTACLES TRIP UP CONNIE FRANCIS; 
</P>
<P>
THE 1950S AND '60S SINGING STAR MAKES THE MOST OF HER TALENT AT THE CELEBRITY 
THEATRE. BUT ATROCIOUS SOUND MIX AND STAGING MAKE IT AN UNCOMFORTABLE WALK DOWN 
MEMORY LANE.

"You really don't know what you have until you lose it," Connie Francis told 
her audience at the Celebrity Theatre Saturday evening, referring to the years 
when she lost her voice after a traumatic 1974 rape and other personal 
tragedies. She has been actively singing again since 1981, and her 100-minute 
performance Saturday showed that the 52-year-old vocalist is making the most of 
her gift. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that can't be said of her show's accompaniment or staging. Her 
sound mix was atrocious, with her voice run through a shrill, 
unnatural-sounding electronic reverb. It had a distancing effect on the 
humanity of her voice, and, combined with her purse-lipped style of singing, 
the echo almost gave the impression at times that she was lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
Her rhythm section and the hired pit band often seemed hopelessly 
under-rehearsed and out of sync, improving only when her pianist conducted the 
band. An amateurishly produced film montage of her career further distracted 
from her singing. 
</P>
<P>
These debits were sufficient to overwhelm the first half of Francis' show. 
While there were a couple of gems -- including her rendition of the standard 
"Maybe This Time" and Francis' immortal movie theme "Where the Boys Are" -- it 
mainly showcased her chirpy, barely rocking hits of the late '50s and early 
'60s such as "Stupid Cupid" and "Lipstick on Your Collar." Whatever their 
nostalgic value, those songs didn't give her voice much to work with. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Francis' performances have reportedly come off as seeming stiff and 
uncomfortable. That's understandable considering the difficulties in her life, 
which have included hospitalizations for a manic-depressive condition. She 
seemed at ease Saturday, though, even joking about her restrictive father who 
had chased away her teen-age suitors at gunpoint: "That's just the way it was 
when you were an Italian girl with a father who was living. Sorry Madonna, but 
'Like a Virgin' should have been my song. I earned it." 
</P>
<P>
She recalled one date she'd had with a young Tony Perkins, when the couple were 
accompanied by agents, publicists and her father. She said, "The date lasted 12 
minutes. The next time I saw Tony was in 'Psycho.' " 
</P>
<P>
The second half of Francis' show -- thankfully minus the movie screens -- 
allowed the quality and emotion of her voice to shine through. She drew on her 
heritage for an Italian-language tune and the emotion-drenched "For Mama," 
while "Malaguena" soared with melismatic Moorish vocal touches. Her pain-edged 
voice dug deeply into a Judy Garland medley, and Francis even claimed a piece 
of the Sinatra signature tune "My Way," earning two standing ovations.

AMERICAN ALBUM: ATLANTA HOPES TO SPRUCE UP PEACHTREE STREET; 
</P>
<P>
A CIVIC GROUP WANTS TO REFURBISH RUNDOWN PORTIONS OF THE FAMOUS ROAD IN TIME 
FOR THE OLYMPICS.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Atlanta won the 1996 Summer Olympics, it guaranteed itself a massive face 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
For parts of Peachtree Street, the lift can't come too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Peachtree is Georgia's most famous thoroughfare, and one of the best known in 
America. While it sparkles around the downtown area where developer John 
Portman's creations soar, the street sinks to tawdriness only a few blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists can spend big money in the hotel district, with its upscale shops, 
stores and restaurants. But if they venture a little to the north on Peachtree, 
they run into empty buildings with dirty windows and homeless men sleeping in 
doorways. They also see the Imperial Hotel, an eight-story wreck of a historic 
building owned by the financially squeezed Portman. It is a stark contrast to 
the nearby Hyatt Regency and its airy atrium, which made him famous. 
</P>
<P>
Such contrast is common in the downtown areas of most American cities. The 
glitter often has grime as its backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
But here, people seem more embarrassed by that than in most places. Atlanta 
prides itself on its newness, a pride that has in the past gone so far that 
beautiful old buildings were razed in favor of ugly modern boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Olympics are raising hopes of a building boom and cash bonanza. 
Coincidentally, a civic group launched a competition for architectural and 
urban design plans to refurbish a four-mile stretch of Peachtree and an 
intersecting street, Auburn Avenue, the city's longstanding black commercial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kelman, vice president of the civic group, Central Atlanta Progress, said 
the Olympics victory "couldn't have come at a better time" because it will 
attract creative entries and help ensure the plans get off the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the city will be motivated to see the project through by the time the 
Olympics get here," Kelman said. 
</P>
<P>
In the blush of victory, all problems seem soluble, but like the challenge of 
funding and building the Olympic facilities, sprucing up Peachtree will not be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Wade DuBose Burns is an Atlanta architect whose projects include remodeling and 
rebuilding the 28-acre town square in Greenwood, S.C., a project on which $100 
million has been spent so far. He said planners here must overcome the problem 
of "disjointed real estate, where there isn't a continual flow of activity." He 
said property owners and public officials must be convinced of how important 
the street is to visitors, who are the lifeblood of Atlanta's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Visitors are out on the street," he said. "They want that street to . . . 
entertain them." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the politicians and property owners agree on the need to cater to 
tourists, there is no guarantee they will agree with Central Atlanta Progress 
on how to improve the street and how to pay for it, Olympics profits 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Several owners of what one real estate broker called "Grade-B" properties 
complained that they are reluctant to invest money to upgrade the properties 
because the area is thick with street people. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shair, president of a real estate brokerage that handles properties on 
Peachtree, said tenants "put benches out, and you got bums sleeping on them." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Boyd, a Peachtree property owner, said he tried to beautify his property by 
putting a $1,000 planter on the sidewalk. It soon "looked like a trash dump," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelman said the designs for upgrading Peachtree will focus mostly on the public 
right-of-way, including sidewalks and "street furniture," such as trash 
containers and lights. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that some property owners may balk at paying for the 
improvements, but he said his group is considering several financing plans, 
including the creation of special tax districts that would cover Peachtree 
properties. He also said congregations of several churches, which are 
tax-exempt, might be persuaded to help finance the refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
Several Peachtree occupants said they supported the idea of making the street 
look better, agreeing that the timing is right because of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta is destined to be a great international city," Boyd said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Is he willing to invest to improve Peachtree? "I can give you a definite 
maybe."

500 WEARY SOLDIERS GET FIRST REAL TASTE OF R&amp;R; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THEY ENJOY HAMBURGERS BY POOLSIDE AND OTHER DIVERSIONS AS SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT DROPS OPPOSITION TO PLAN.

<P>
About 500 desert-weary American soldiers Sunday stripped off gritty fatigues, 
basked in the sun by poolside and tasted their first hamburgers since leaving 
home after the government here quietly dropped its opposition to a U.S. plan to 
provide them rest and relaxation in a deluxe Saudi compound. 
</P>
<P>
A vanguard detachment from the 82nd Airborne Division found water-skiing, 
bowling, unlimited supplies of free ice cream and, for female soldiers, the 
chance to wear "American-size bathing suits" in a day of the good life. A 
senior military official described it as recreation "without restriction." 
</P>
<P>
"There will even be American music we can blast," said an exultant Maj. Gen. 
William G. Pagonis, the top U.S. logistics commander here, in an interview 
Sunday. "It's in the middle of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
However, with alcohol still strictly off-limits, with the respite limited to 
just 12 hours, and in light of predictions that it could be two months before 
each soldier gets a turn, officials acknowledged that the facility does not 
entirely solve a long-term need to provide more unfettered leave. 
</P>
<P>
But the opening of the compound nevertheless represents significant progress in 
a theater in which, until Sunday, combat soldiers had no place to fully retreat 
from the rigors of the front line -- in large part because of Saudi legal and 
cultural strictures. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi approval for the mixed-sex facility represents an anomaly in a nation 
where women are banned even from the pools of deluxe hotels. And in voicing 
enthusiasm about the facility, U.S. military officials expressed some concern 
about a possible conservative backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need Saudi religious leaders thinking that someone has sold them out 
and given us this facility," one senior commander said. While no dress code 
will be enforced, he said, only "conservative" bathing suits will be available 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Citing such sensitivities, military officials refused to permit reporters to 
visit the compound. The officials said that they are also concerned that 
extensive attention might jeopardize the facility's security. 
</P>
<P>
But commanders who visited the compound as the first contingent of troops 
arrived there by bus early Sunday morning said that the soldiers were "totally 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, from the 82nd Airborne Division, were among the first U.S. troops 
to arrive in Saudi Arabia. They have for the most part been living in hot tents 
and eating unappetizing rations known as "meals ready to eat." 
</P>
<P>
In providing access to the facility, commanders said, priority is to be given 
to the 82nd and to other front-line troops whose living conditions are the 
worst. At a rate of 500 a day, officials said, it could be as long as two 
months before all combat soldiers get their day at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The massive compound, built by a South Korean contractor and normally open to 
the Saudi public, offers an outdoor swimming pool, water skiing, sailing and 
tennis, and indoor bowling, soccer, basketball and a full-size cinema. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it in the United States," Pagonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Under American supervision, the facility will also offer a post office, 
chaplains, a medical clinic and what the general described as "unlimited 
American-style food." 
</P>
<P>
"The troops want hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken," Pagonis said, "and I'm 
looking for pizza." But in keeping with Saudi law, he added: "There will be no 
alcoholic beverages, period." 
</P>
<P>
There are no overnight facilities at the compound, and visits are to be limited 
to a single day. Nevertheless, Pagonis said, "This is going to immediately let 
the troops know they're being taken care of."

Iraq said Sunday that it wants the massive multinational military force to 
withdraw from the Persian Gulf region immediately because it is concerned about 
the effects of warships and weapons on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency said the country's Council for the Protection 
and Improvement of the Environment had concluded that the force is a direct 
threat to the region's plants, animals and marine life. 
</P>
<P>
INA said council Chairman Abdussalam Mohammed Saed sent a message warning of 
the danger to several international health organizations, including the U.N. 
environment program. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of countries deployed warships, military aircraft, tanks and troops to 
the gulf following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he would welcome dialogue if it replaces 
"threats" and "military buildups" but once again linked negotiations to a 
comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. He said Iraq would not 
compromise on its demand for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the gulf and 
the end of the economic blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd appealed for a peaceful end to the gulf 
crisis, saying Iraq could still "overcome the barriers" and help find a 
negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Syria is ready to send more troops to face Iraq and could do so without 
jeopardizing its defenses against "the Israeli enemy," Vice President 
Abdel-Halim Khaddam said. Syria has deployed about 4,000 troops, and promised 
11,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 troops of France's Foreign Legion arrived in Saudi Arabia. 
About 3,000 more are expected to arrive today, raising the total French troop 
presence to about 9,000. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium said it would increase its participation only as part of a U.N. force. 
The nation, which has two minesweepers, a support ship and two transport planes 
in the region, is also sending a frigate and four other transport planes. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Observer newspaper reported that British forces will retaliate 
with battlefield nuclear weapons if Iraqi troops attack them with chemical gas. 
The source was identified as a senior officer in the 7th Armored Brigade, which 
is on its way to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
China denied a British newspaper report that it had sold Iraq a large amount of 
a chemical used to make nuclear weapons and missile fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Refugee Front: 
</P>
<P>
Jordan threatened to restrict the flow of foreigners fleeing Iraq into Jordan 
unless it got more international aid. More than 600,000 people have poured into 
Jordan from Iraq since the invasion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisis Indicators: 
</P>
<P>
Allied forces in the Persian Gulf as of Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
* Britain: 5,000 troops 
</P>

The new budget accord may be just what the doctor ordered for the nation's 
ailing economy but the patient is likely to get a lot worse before it gets 
better, government and private analysts said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although almost every economist has long prescribed a reduction in federal 
borrowing, several expressed fears that the short-run impact will be negative, 
nudging the economy ever closer to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is so weak right now that the last thing you want to do is hit it 
over the head with a massive dose of fiscal restraint -- but that's what 
they've done," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover 
Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be honest and admit there will be a modest short-term 
contractionary effect," Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist who has long 
been a fervent proponent of cutting the deficit, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that higher taxes and lower spending affect the economy 
immediately, while lower interest rates take time to boost economic 
investment," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the immediate damage to the economy, however, budget negotiators here 
believed that they had no choice but to forge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are hoping that their resolve -- which could easily have been 
diverted by arguments that the Persian Gulf crisis should let them off the hook 
once again -- will assuage financial markets that have long urged Washington to 
produce a credible long-run deficit-reduction pact. 
</P>
<P>
They also are hoping that the increased leeway on the budget will prompt 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to ease interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a phony smoke-and-mirrors program," said Senate Finance Committee 
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.). "It ought to signal the Federal Reserve to 
ease up in interest rates and start stimulating the economy." 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed, which appears to be more worried about reviving inflation, is 
likely to move cautiously as long as the dollar remains weak and oil prices 
remain high. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, budget negotiators did not overlook the possibility that the harsh 
medicine contained in the budget agreement might prove risky. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) conceded Sunday that the new budget accord "has 
a lot of pain in it," but insisted that "the result is good for the country." 
</P>
<P>
"While things may not tomorrow morning get better," Domenici added, "this 
package is ultimately healthy for the American economy. . . . I'm convinced, 
having worked on this kind of thing, that we'd better do it because we won't 
get another chance." 
</P>
<P>
The economic forecast that the budget negotiators published Sunday shows 
precisely this sort of pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Economic officials now expect the U.S. economy to eke out a bare 0.7% gain in 
1990 -- essentially an acknowledgement that a recession is possible in the 
months ahead -- before slowly recovering at a 1.3% pace in 1991 and 3.8% in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
They also show the inflation rate -- expected to reach 5.21% in 1990 -- slowing 
to 4.6% in 1991 and 3.4% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
If the projections prove accurate, President Bush should benefit from the 
visibly improved economic situation in time for his reelection campaign in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
But a lot of conservatives are convinced that Bush is making a fatal error in 
signing a deficit-reduction pact that does not contain his long-sought capital 
gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bad deal for the economy," said Jude Wanniski, known for his early 
advocacy of former President Ronald Reagan's "supply-side" tax program. 
"Getting the capital gains rate reduced and indexed is the only way of pulling 
the economy out of its slump." 
</P>
<P>
Many Republican lawmakers echoed Wanniski's views. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) termed the package "a road map to recession" and added: "It's a 
cave-in to the Democratic big spenders. . . . It's ridiculous. The system's 
broken down." 
</P>
<P>
Most economists, however, said that the true test of the deficit accord will 
come soon on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
If investors think the budget agreement will substantially reduce the federal 
government's long-term borrowing needs, opening up fresh credit for private 
investment, they could drive interest rates down in the bond market this week. 
</P>
<P>
That will provide a glimmer of hope as Congress debates whether to approve the 
budget measure. 
</P>
<P>
"If financial markets believe this will put the government on the track of 
smaller deficits in the future, they could provide a lot of latitude for the 
Fed to ease," said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bank in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT THE ACCORD CONTAINS 
</P>
<P>
Here are the major elements of the five-year, $500-billion budget deficit 
reduction accord that President Bush and key congressional leaders announced on 
Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
Savings from domestic benefit programs: $119 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Requires 33 million Medicare recipients to pay more for health coverage. The 
$28.60 doctor's care premium, which currently covers 25% of the cost, would 
increase by $5.70 per month next year, and rise in steps for five years until 
it covers 30% of the cost. The yearly deductible for hospital costs doubles to 
$150. Saves $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Imposes new Medicare cost-cutting requirements on doctors and hospitals to 
save $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Limits subsidies to farmers to save $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminates civil service lump sum retirement payments for $8.1 billion in 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
* Reforms student loan program to save $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Requires Postal Service to cut $4.2 billion from costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Delays unemployment insurance payments for 2 weeks, saving $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Reforms federal housing programs to cut costs by $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Tax changes: $133.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Raises the gasoline tax to 19 cents a gallon from 9 cents in two 
5-cent-per-gallon jumps. 
</P>
<P>
* Adds a new tax on petroleum of 2 cents per gallon, which in turn affects 
gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
* Increases tobacco taxes from 16 cents to 20 cents next year; 24 cents in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
* Raises levies on alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
* Boosts airline ticket tax from 8% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
* Imposes a new luxury tax on purchases of expensive autos, furs, jewelry, 
private airplanes and boats. 
</P>
<P>
* Boosts salary cap on payroll taxes (1.45% out of total 7.65% Social Security 
tax) from $51,300 to $73,000 to help cover Medicare costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Limits itemized deductions for those with incomes above $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Requires insurance companies to pay an extra $2 billion a year in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
* Requires state and local employees to start paying Medicare taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic programs: Capped. 
</P>
<P>
Non-military programs subject to annual appropriations would be held to the 
projected rate of inflation. Any new programs must be introduced on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
Savings on interest due to lower borrowing needs would total an estimated $64.8 
billion over the five-year period.

BUSH'S POPULARITY FAILED TO PROVIDE CLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT WAS FORCED TO MAKE COMPROMISES DESPITE HIS HIGH 
APPROVAL RATING. HE COULD ALSO FACE A BACKLASH FROM GOP CONSERVATIVES.

<P>
With his approval rating topping 70% and the nation rallying around his Persian 
Gulf policy, President Bush seems at the apex of his popularity. But to reach 
an agreement on the federal budget, he was forced to make major concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush dropped his insistence on "no new taxes" just to get the budget 
negotiations started, and he was forced to abandon his plan to reduce taxes on 
capital gains to bring them to a close. 
</P>
<P>
In-between, he also gave in to Democratic demands for some $33 billion in 
increased taxes on upper-income taxpayers, including a complicated limit on tax 
deductions, increased luxury taxes and an increase in tax charges for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
The result illustrates the limits on how far a President can translate 
popularity in foreign affairs into political clout at home. And it also 
demonstrates the marked difference between Bush and his predecessor, Ronald 
Reagan, who refused opportunities to take a similar deal to reduce the deficit 
because of his insistent opposition to higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also faced limits on their power. As Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) noted, it remains unclear whether leaders of either party will 
be able to get their followers to ratify the politically unpopular compromises 
that the budget deal comprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Now comes the hard part," Mitchell said as the budget agreement was announced 
in the White House Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Less than four weeks ago, when he spoke to a joint session of Congress, Bush 
tried to use support for his Persian Gulf policy to leverage votes for his 
position on the budget. Strength abroad required strength at home, he told 
members of Congress. And strength at home, he said, would require a budget plan 
along the lines he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The gambit was chancy. Past presidents had "never been able to translate 
support for foreign policy into support for a domestic agenda," conservative 
political analyst Kevin Phillips pointed out at the time. President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, for example, was forced to give up much of his New Deal program 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Bush fared no better. During his speech, as on numerous occasions before and 
since, Bush specifically said that a budget agreement would have to include a 
capital gains tax cut -- an issue he had advocated during his 1988 presidential 
campaign and one that he had pressed ever since. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush could not budge Democratic leaders, who resisted on grounds that 
cutting the capital gains taxes favored the rich. In the end, over the last 
week, key Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), 
abandoned him as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you just don't get it just the way you want," Bush said as he 
announced the budget deal. "This is such a time for me." 
</P>
<P>
Bush did obtain some items that he and his advisers wanted. The agreement 
includes new tax breaks for the oil industry, an issue for former oilman Bush, 
and new tax credits for research and development, which Bush and his aides 
believe will increase economic productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also provides an enforceable limit on spending for domestic programs 
-- a step that will require congressional Democrats to make difficult choices 
over the next several years as constituencies clamor for more federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is the deal itself, which will substantially reduce the 
federal budget deficit and which, at least for now, would break the deadlock 
over fiscal policy that had threatened to paralyze federal decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that getting the deal, in the end, did come before everything else 
underlines a central element of the Bush presidency. Unlike Reagan, who had a 
set of issues in which he believed strongly and on which he was unwilling to 
compromise, Bush, as his aides say, is basically interested in "process," not 
ideology. There are few specific things the President will not sacrifice to 
achieve a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
That approach makes it far easier to reach deals. But Bush's style has costs as 
well. More ideological members of his own party already are angry at the 
President for giving up on causes they believe in. And the compromise on taxes 
-- which remains one of the most potent political issues of the era -- will 
deprive Republicans of a potent weapon as the fall congressional campaigns head 
into their final five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One indication of the problems Bush may face was the conspicuous absence of 
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a leader of conservatives in the House, as the 
budget agreement was unveiled Sunday afternoon. Without the support of Gingrich 
and his followers, Bush will have to rely ever more heavily on the majority 
Democrats -- a source of support that could prove increasingly shaky if Bush's 
overall popularity slips.

HEALTH: THE PLAN CALLS FOR RAISING DEDUCTIBLES, PREMIUMS. BENEFICIARIES ARE 
AMONG THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VOTERS.

<P>
The budget deal may have bipartisan support in Congress, but it seems certain 
to generate intense anger and a political backlash among one of the most 
influential and vociferous groups of voters -- the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Congress could face a replay of the 1989 battle over catastrophic care. Last 
year, elderly voters forced repeal of the biggest increase in Medicare benefits 
since the program started in 1965 after they learned that the more affluent 
among them would have to pay for the benefits. The catastrophic-care program 
would have provided unlimited days of hospital care and prescription drug 
coverage with financing coming from the 40% of persons over 65 who pay federal 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the President and congressional leaders decided again that the 
elderly should pay more but this time without even compensating them with 
increased benefits. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress adopts the package proposed on Sunday, the 34 million Medicare 
beneficiaries would be forced to pay significantly more for the Part B coverage 
that helps pay doctor bills. The annual deductible, now $75, would climb to 
$100 next year, and level off at $150 in 1993 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
The Medicare insurance premiums, now $28.60 a month, would rise to about $33.50 
next year and reach $54.30 by 1995, according to estimates by the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
Beneficiaries now pay 25% of the total cost of Medicare's Part B, which helps 
cover doctor bills. General tax revenues pay for the rest. Under the budget 
agreement, the beneficiaries' share would rise to 30% of the program's cost. 
This could mean a significant increase in monthly premiums each year, because 
inflation in doctor bills has been racing at double-digit levels. 
</P>
<P>
Advocacy groups for the elderly offered quick opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the level of cuts in Medicare," said Horace Deets, 
executive director of the AARP. "We urge Congress to seek ways to ameliorate 
the effects . . . on those for whom any increase in health care costs is 
unaffordable. We further urge Congress to ensure that any cuts in Medicare do 
not impede the access of older and disabled persons to quality health care." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to work strongly against this package to see that more fairness is 
put in it," said Bill Ritz, a spokesman for the National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare. "Let's share some of the pain with the wealthy -- 
those who had the greatest gain during the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
And congressional opposition began stirring Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
One of the congressional leaders on health care issues, Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), said he would vote against the budget agreement when it 
reaches the House floor. "What troubles me about the budget is that it asks the 
elderly in this country to take a very hard hit," Waxman said. "It doesn't 
distinguish between those who can afford it and those who can't. Many of the 
elderly will have to make a choice between paying for health care and rent." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Aging Committee 
and one of the more influential senior Democrats, said he will vote against the 
budget because of the impact on the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.) called the increase in payments by Medicare 
beneficiaries "a major negative" in the budget package. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare covers persons over 65 and disabled people of all ages. Part A covers 
hospital bills, and Part B deals with payments to physicians.

<P>
The budget agreement aims for savings of $60 billion in Medicare outlays over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Half would come from reduced payments to doctors and hospitals, both of whom 
are already complaining that reimbursement levels are too low. About $30 
billion in budget savings would come directly from the pockets of the 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reduced spending by the government would result in higher costs to 
patients under 65 who are not covered by Medicare, because doctors and 
hospitals are likely to increase their charges to make up for the Medicare 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the annual deductible would cost beneficiaries $6 billion. For 
the first time, they would pay 20% of the cost of clinical laboratory fees, 
spending $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest item, by far, is the boost in premiums to cover 30% of the 
fast-growing program. This would cost beneficiaries $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Americans over 65 already spend about 18% of their income on health and 
long-term care, according to a study by the House Aging Committee. The proposed 
increases would "aggravate an already unacceptable burden on elderly 
Americans," according to Roybal. 
</P>
<P>
The Part B Medicare premiums are automatically deducted from monthly Social 
Security checks. The average Social Security check this year is $594 a month, 
with a Medicare premium of $28.60. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the average Social Security check will climb to $713 monthly, but 
Medicare, rising much faster, will be $54.30 a month.

Here is the timetable that Congress has set for itself in carrying out the new 
deficit reduction accord: 
</P>
<P>
Sunday: Congress votes on a stopgap resolution to continue funding for current 
programs and delay automatic spending cuts that would have been mandated under 
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
Friday: The two houses must pass a formal budget resolution for fiscal 1991, 
which begins today, with detailed spending instructions that parallel the 
targets set down in Sunday's accord. 
</P>
<P>
Once such a resolution has been approved, the lawmakers must pass another 
stopgap resolution to keep the government running until the next benchmark, 
Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 12: Congressional committees must complete work on all authorizing 
legislation needed to carry out the budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 19: Congress must pass final legislation to carry out the budget accord -- 
along with the 13 separate appropriations bills needed to finance government 
operations during fiscal 1991.

OJAI YOUTH, FRIEND HURT IN MIDNIGHT BEACH ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A CROWD SAID GANG NAMES WHILE BEATING AND STABBING THE TWO VICTIMS. THE 
15-YEAR-OLD IS IN INTENSIVE CARE.

<P>
An Ojai teen-ager was in the intensive care unit and his companion was also 
hospitalized after they were beaten with sticks and stabbed repeatedly by 15 to 
20 people near the Ventura Harbor about 12:10 a.m. Sunday, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparently unprovoked attack left 15-year-old David Foyle of Ojai in 
serious condition in intensive care at Ventura County Medical Center. Brady 
Sabat, 19, of Oak View was in good condition with 13 minor stab wounds and 
other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped two cars shortly after the attack and confiscated two knives and 
a bloodstained jacket. Six people were arrested and released pending the 
results of laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
Sabat said he and David had been to the movies with a friend earlier in the 
evening. The friend dropped them off at the beach across from the harbor while 
he took his girlfriend home and was to return to pick them up, Sabat said. 
</P>
<P>
As the two walked toward the beach, they saw a group sitting around a bonfire. 
Sabat said about 20 people from the group, some carrying sticks, came toward 
them. He and David ran, but the group caught them and began kicking, beating 
and stabbing them, Sabat said. 
</P>
<P>
"They caught me several times, but I just kept getting up and running again," 
Sabat said. "Finally I got away, but I was pretty worked over by then. I'm not 
in that bad a shape today, but my friend is." 
</P>
<P>
Sabat ran to Hornblower's Restaurant at the harbor, where an off-duty Santa 
Monica police officer calmed him and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
David was found bleeding in the beach parking lot by a Ventura man who had been 
with friends at the beach. The man carried him to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't walk by somebody and leave him there when you think he might be 
bleeding to death," said the man, who asked not to be identified for fear of 
retribution from the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped two cars near Johnson Drive and Telephone Road shortly after the 
attack and arrested five men and a juvenile on suspicion of attempted murder. 
All six were released pending results of laboratory tests for blood residue on 
the knives, said Ventura Police Sgt. Gary Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously they didn't have enough evidence to keep them or they would have 
booked them," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabat told police he heard his assailants use the words "Warlords" and 
"Haoles," names of Ventura-area gangs, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore said it was unclear whether the incident was gang-related. The beach, 
also known as the South Jetty, is a traditional gathering place for young 
people, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Lying in his hospital bed Sunday, Sabat said he does not know what prompted the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked about five feet from their bonfire and the next thing we knew, they 
were attacking us," he said. "I don't belong to any gangs. . . . We're both 
from Ojai."

RACE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS SOURS OLD FRIENDSHIP

What started out as a friendly rivalry between Simi Valley City Council members 
Bill Davis and Vicky Howard, both candidates for county supervisor in the 4th 
District, has turned into a bitter battle of words between unlikely enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a damn war," Davis said recently when asked to assess the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It was not supposed to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis are old friends who have lived next door to each other for 
more than 10 years. Davis said before the June primary election, which resulted 
in a runoff between the two candidates, that he met with Howard and both 
pledged to run clean campaigns that focused on the issues rather than 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the two have accused each other of reneging on the promise and of 
running unethical campaigns. And as the Nov. 6 election draws nearer, the 
finger-pointing and verbal attacks from both camps have grown more intense. 
</P>
<P>
When a newspaper recently revealed that a group of Southern California 
developers, one with a project pending before the Simi Valley City Council, had 
donated $3,600 toward a campaign mailer that included a quote and a photograph 
of Howard, Davis was quick to question Howard's ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Davis issued a statement saying that Howard, who has since disavowed the 
mailer, should have done so when the four-page brochure was mailed out in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethics and public trust are the question," Davis said in his statement. "If 
Vicky Howard knew nothing about the mailer, she should have said so four months 
ago when the mailer was received by voters and not waited until the question 
was raised in the press. I can only assume that nothing was said because the 
mailer was favorable to her candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
Howard denied giving permission to use her name and picture in the mailer, 
which was paid for and distributed by a group called Maximum Voter 
Participation, a Los Angeles-based independent expenditure committee. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Poe Development Co., one of the developers that contributed money to the 
group as well as to Howard's campaign, is planning to build a housing 
development in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project has already been approved, the developer is scheduled to 
go before the council Monday to lobby, along with six other contractors, for 
favored status to receive its building permits. A limited number of permits are 
issued every three months under the city's slow-growth ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said that she never spoke to anyone with Maximum Voter Participation and 
that the mailer was sent out without her knowledge. She said she never bothered 
to check into the matter before because she was preoccupied with her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"What was I supposed to do, find out how it happened?" Howard asked. "I was 
very, very busy." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that even if Howard did not know about the mailer, someone in her 
campaign must have been aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly have my doubts that the piece was put together without someone on 
her campaign staff knowing about it," Davis said. "How did they get the 
pictures?" 
</P>
<P>
Howard fired back. She said that Davis, a Democrat, allowed a slate mailer 
targeted at Republicans to go out during the primary election that listed 
Davis' name alongside Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Assemblywoman 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). The mailer, which resembles a post-card, read: 
"Republicans! Vote June 5." It did not mention that Davis or gubernatorial 
candidate Don Bullock, also listed on the mailer, are registered Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's complaining, how come he didn't disavow the mailings?" Howard said. 
"He knows he's not a Republican. He knew they were going out to Republican 
voters and he let it go." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he never saw the official mailer and did not know it was 
specifically aimed at Republican voters. The mailer was paid for and 
distributed by the Simi Valley Freedom Foundation, a community group whose 
primary concern is protecting citizens' right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Davis said that Howard paid to have her name on a similar slate 
mailer targeted at Democrats that also went out during the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Schmidt, a Howard campaign official, said Howard "paid for a nonpartisan 
slate mailer that covered both parties. We also paid for a Republican slate 
mailer." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt said Simi Valley developer Tom Mackel, a Davis supporter and campaign 
contributor, had contributed money to the Freedom Foundation to help pay for 
the mailer with Davis' name on it and as a result may have violated campaign 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to file a complaint with the district attorney's office and the Fair 
Political Practices Commission if we determine there were any legal 
violations," Schmidt said. "If Bill Davis is going to make charges, then he 
better make damn certain that he's not guilty of the same charges. I can assure 
you we are not going to stand by and let him make false accusations without 
responding to them." 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, an official with the FPPC, said that independent expenditure 
committees -- such as Maximum Voter Participation and the Freedom Foundation -- 
have no expense limit and can solicit donations from any source so long as that 
source is not working for a single candidate's campaign. Both Maximum Voter 
Participation and the Freedom Foundation are nonpartisan groups. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that even if Mackel contributed money to the Freedom Foundation, he 
may have done so with the intent of supporting one or more of the 11 other 
candidates on the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only one of 12 candidates on there," said Davis, whose campaign 
headquarters is in a Mackel-owned building. "He could have been contributing to 
Elton Gallegly or Cathie Wright." 
</P>
<P>
It was Howard who recommended Davis for a position on the Planning Commission 
in 1985. A year later she helped him get appointed to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The two have proved to be strong leaders who are equally popular with their 
constituents and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 62, has been endorsed by the Ventura County Firefighters Assn. and the 
Ventura County Public Employees Assn. Howard, 55, is backed by Ventura County 
Sheriff John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the Deputy Sheriffs 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the candidates' political agendas are essentially the same. Both 
advocate more affordable housing, controlled growth as well as improved 
emergency services, traffic reduction measures and better air quality in the 
4th District, which includes Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates said early on that they would not let the race hamper their 
friendship and now express surprise at the ugly tone the campaign has taken. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really disappointed," Howard said. "I shook hands with him and vowed to 
run a clean campaign. Now he's going out and making all these charges." 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she would like to see the campaign focus back on the issues instead 
of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's up to Mr. Davis," Howard said. "He's the one who has slipped into 
the mud. I'm trying very hard to keep it at a higher plane instead of what it's 
sinking into." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said he has twice made offers to the Howard camp to meet and resolve 
their differences, and has been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be glad to deal with nothing but the issues," Davis said. "I'm not out 
to destroy people. But I'm not going to sit back and take this kind of beating 
without hitting back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a boxer in the ring. When he gets hit, he hits back. And eventually 
somebody's going to get knocked down." 
</P>
<P>
While they remain neighbors, the campaign appears to have put a strain on the 
candidates' friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she doesn't simply invite Davis over to her house as she did before 
the campaign started to talk about their differences, Howard said she simply is 
not up to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at this point I need to settle down a bit," Howard said. "I'm very 
irate." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he did not know if it was possible for the two to repair the damage 
to their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it'll ever happen," Davis said. "I don't think it will ever be 
back the way it was."

LACQUER FUMES EXPLODE IN HOUSE, INJURING 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man spraying lacquer in a Thousand Oaks kitchen was seriously burned Sunday 
when the fumes, ignited by an oven pilot light, exploded in a fireball that 
wrecked the house and rattled the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The blast caused an estimated $180,000 damage and sent two residents of the 
house at 2885 Marietta Circle to the hospital with less severe burn wounds, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to be a helluva fireball," said Peter Cronk, an investigator for the 
Ventura County Fire Department. "It moved down a hallway and out the window 
with so much force it bent the window-screen frames." 
</P>
<P>
The painter, Allan Parfitt, 29, of La Puente, was in serious condition Sunday 
evening in the acute burn unit at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, with second- 
and third-degree burns over 40% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Ashford, 37, was in fair condition in the hospital's intermediate burn 
unit with second- and third-degree burns on her hands and forearms. Her son, 
Timothy, 11, was treated for minor burns at Los Robles Regional Medical Center 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Parfitt works with Ashford and had come over to do the 
painting Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ashford's husband, Tom, was outside and escaped injury. Knowing the 
flammability of the fumes, he had stepped out before lighting a cigarette, 
Cronk said. 
</P>
<P>
Another son, Ryan, 14, said he was watching a football game on television in 
his parents' bedroom when the explosion occurred at 10:26 a.m. The force blew 
the glass and blinds out of the bedroom windows, he said, but he was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Dashing into the smoke-filled hallway, Ryan saw the silhouettes of two people 
fleeing the house, he said. He said he ran back into the bedroom, dialed the 
911 emergency number and fled as smoke began to overwhelm him. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Melissa Nolan and her mother were in their kitchen when the 
blast rattled windows throughout the house. "My mother thought my little 
brother had run into the glass door," Melissa, 15, said. 
</P>
<P>
They saw flames shooting from the Ashfords' windows and ran outside, where they 
found Timothy collapsed on the lawn and the other burn victims lying nearby. 
Melissa and her mother ran back into their house and got wet towels to drape 
over the burns. 
</P>
<P>
County fire officials said the explosion occurred because Parfitt did not 
adequately ventilate the room while applying the highly combustible lacquer to 
kitchen cabinets. The fumes were concentrated because of a plastic tarpaulin in 
the doorway between the kitchen and the family room. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Ashford said the fireball melted the tarp and blew the hot plastic into 
the family room and onto his mother and brother, causing some of their burns. 
</P>
<P>
The fire took about 50 minutes to bring under control and was extinguished 
within 90 minutes, Battalion Chief Frank Tinsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the roof remained intact, but the interior of the house was gutted, 
Cronk said. "The painter was lucky to get out of there in the shape he did."

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed second-story addition to a commercial building in the Ojai Arcade 
will undergo review today by the Ojai Historical Preservation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The newly renovated arcade -- the arched walkway that fronts 13 single-story 
buildings along Ojai Avenue -- is on the commission's list for designation as a 
historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1917, the arcade was reinforced last year to meet earthquake safety 
standards at a cost of $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has been asked to review how the proposed retail and office 
construction might affect the arcade before the project goes to the Ojai 
Planning Commission for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the city's Redevelopment Commission have expressed concern that the 
rear and sides of the upper story will be visible from behind the Arcade. 
Developer Larry Wilde has assured officials that it will not be visible from 
the front. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants are also worried that the second floor will block their views of 
the four-story post office bell tower on Ojai Avenue. THIA BELL

GEOTHERMAL FIRM GOING FULL STEAM 
</P>

<P>
As recently as 1987, the geothermal brines that flowed in superheated, 
subterranean rivers coursing beneath this Imperial Valley agricultural hub were 
thought to be commercially unsuitable for power generation. 
</P>
<P>
Several power developers tried and failed with geothermal projects in the 
Salton Sea area 120 miles east of San Diego, including a San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric-led group that closed a $188-million experimental plant in 1987 after 
two years of effort. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the geothermal resource -- a liquid of up to 600 degrees 
Fahrenheit that is found between 3,000 and 9,000 feet beneath the earth's 
surface -- contained too many dissolved solids. The salts, silica and other 
particles tended to clog pipes and confound the chemical engineers who tried to 
separate out the power-giving steam. 
</P>
<P>
Magma Power Co. seems to have solved the riddle of dealing with Imperial Valley 
brine, thanks in large part to technological and financial assistance from Dow 
Chemical Co., which owns 42% of the company's publicly traded stock. 
</P>
<P>
Magma Power, based in San Diego, has put three new geothermal plants totaling 
126 megawatts of power on line since January, 1989. Except for a two-week 
period in June when hurricane-force winds toppled power transmission lines, all 
three have been operating at or near maximum capacity, except for scheduled 
maintenance. That performance has earned Magma Power a reputation as one of the 
most technologically advanced geothermal companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Magma has been able to use geothermal resources that most everyone else 
thought were unusable," said Claude Harvey, senior vice president of Pacific 
Energy, a power-generating subsidiary of Commerce-based Pacific Enterprises 
that operates geothermal plants in the Mammoth Lakes area. 
</P>
<P>
Magma Power's quadrupling of its power-generation capacity and ability to 
deliver it profitably to its sole customer, SCE Corp.'s Southern California 
Edison power utility unit, has made it one of the fastest-growing publicly 
owned companies in California -- in terms of sales, profit growth and stock 
value. The company's financial performance has been enhanced by royalties from 
its vast geothermal rights leases, which cover 48,000 acres in California and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
But just as Magma Power and other geothermal producers appear to be finding 
their way on the new geothermal frontier, and as the specter of war and 
disrupted oil supplies in the Middle East seem to suggest that nonfossil-fuel 
energy may become more attractive, the market for geothermal energy is in flux. 
</P>
<P>
The federal and state programs that in the early 1980s provided incentives to 
alternative energy producers such as Magma Power have lapsed and not been 
replaced. Moreover, most California utilities now say they have all the 
generating capacity they need for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Even if utilities were in a mode to buy more capacity, geothermal producers 
would have to supply it at prices comparable with natural gas, the utilities' 
lowest-cost source of energy. Geothermal companies say they cannot match that 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Magma Power highlights the importance of state and federal 
incentives to alternative power producers. A 1983 federal law forced utilities 
to sign power purchase contracts with independent alternative power producers, 
including Magma Power, at fixed, escalating rates. The program was designed to 
help wean U.S. utilities from their dependence on imported petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of those power sales agreements with Edison, Magma Power was able to 
secure $210 million in financing from J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. for construction 
of the three new geothermal plants. Morgan was also influenced by a $24-million 
guarantee from Dow to help Magma Power finance construction of 65 miles of 
power transmission lines and by Dow's long-term technology agreement with Magma 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
A geothermal plant, with current technology, is three times as expensive to 
build as a natural gas plant. 
</P>
<P>
Magma Power took a $210-million gamble that it could build and operate the 
costly plants according to schedule and provide power profitably to Edison 
according to the terms of its sales contract -- while breaking new ground in 
geothermal technology. 
</P>
<P>
The gamble seems to be paying off. Magma Power reported a 1989 profit of $22.3 
million on revenue of $63.1 million, up from a 1988 profit of $9.3 million on 
revenue of $26 million. The successful construction of the plants has boosted 
the company's stock value to more than $750 million from $30 million in 1981, 
when Magma Power was formed. 
</P>
<P>
Magma Power's explosive rate of growth will level off after fiscal 1990, the 
first full on-line year of its fourth geothermal plant, because no new 
generating plants are in the works. But analysts are optimistic about the 
company's prospects for continued growth at more modest rates because of 
escalation clauses that provide for a 7.5% annual increase in the price Edison 
pays for its power. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its growth, the company does little to publicize itself and until 
recently declined to give interviews. In that sense, Magma Power is a 
reflection of its chief executive, Arnold L. Johnson. He took the helm in 1987 
after retiring as treasurer of Dow Chemical USA following 30 years with the 
chemical giant. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a no-nonsense, no-glitz executive who moved the company's 
headquarters from Los Angeles to San Diego's Rancho Bernardo suburb in 1987 to 
be closer to the Imperial Valley. Johnson is one of four ex-Dow executives now 
at Magma Power. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson arrived, the company was in sad financial shape. Magma Power owned 
widespread, lucrative mineral rights that had been secured by company founder 
and geothermal pioneer B. C. McCabe, who helped develop the Geysers geothermal 
area north of San Francisco. But Magma was losing money on its two geothermal 
power plants in the Imperial Valley, one of which subsequently was sold. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had been a Magma Power director since 1984, took the chief 
executive job only after he received commitments from Dow for technical and 
financial assistance. Johnson saw the enormous profit potential in the power 
sales contracts but knew that Dow chemical-process technology was essential to 
dealing with the problem of treating Imperial Valley brine. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Chemical, which has been a venture capital investor in Magma since the 
early 1970s, not only agreed to give additional financial backing but also 
technological assistance in exchange for stock. Both companies agreed that all 
geothermal technology developed would become the property of Magma Power. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew (Dow) had the technology," Johnson said. "At Dow, there's this 
confidence that they are able to run any kind of a chemical-process plant. You 
change this, observe that, tweak the process a little and see what happens."

Fortunately, Quills Are Out 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, recycled paper is no longer enough. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentally correct printed matter comes with the news that it's made with 
Earth-friendly, soy-based inks. 
</P>
<P>
The new inks substitute oil from cheap, renewable soybeans for up to 80% of 
traditional petrochemical-based printing oils, which can release harmful vapors 
as they evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
The American Newspaper Publishers Assn. first developed the new inks for 
newspapers in 1985, after the second worldwide oil crunch. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times has used soy ink for color printing since it was 
introduced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are versions for non-newspaper print jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was the first small publication to use it," says Debra Lynn Dadd, 
editor and publisher of The Earthwise Consumer, a Forest Knolls, Calif.-based 
newsletter she started a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress, Sobriety Take a Toll 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night was the very last last call at Corky's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the once-popular newspaper bar and grill closed. Located on 
Eleventh Street downtown across from the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner 
building, Corky's was the place to find Herald editors and scribes after hours 
-- and sometimes during hours as well. Many was the time that a phone call 
would roust journalists from a corner booth to cover a breaking story. Corky's 
number was written on every wall of the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
Corky's fate was sealed last November when the Herald closed after years of 
declining circulation and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Corky's owner for the last five years, Betty Fukuchi, said she plans to take a 
vacation and think about opening another bar, perhaps near a newspaper. "I like 
newspaper people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper bars are a dying breed, and not just because many major papers have 
closed in the last decade. Philadelphia's Pen &amp; Pencil Club, which expired 
in February, was a victim of another trend: sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
As a writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer was quoted as saying on closing day, 
"Journalists don't drink anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Dial or Not to Dial . . . 
</P>
<P>
Calling all thespians. Or, more accurately, desperate thespians can try calling 
1-900-454-3266, a new casting hot line started by a couple of Los Angeles 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Apple and David Brein, former film and TV executives, launched 
Casting/Crew InfoLine for actors and actresses to hear listings from casting 
agents. Until now, that kind of information was available only from trade 
magazines or eavesdropping on brunch conversations at Patrick's Roadhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Calls are 95 cents a minute but, mindful that struggling actors and actresses 
are usually impecunious, unlimited calls are available for $79.95 a month.

BUDGET INCLUDES SOME BREAKS FOR SMALL BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE TAX DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS, WHICH WILL AMOUNT TO $25 BILLION OVER 
FIVE YEARS, ARE AIMED AT FOSTERING GROWTH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small and medium-sized businesses -- and their investors -- will reap some 
unexpected benefits if Sunday's last-minute budget agreement is approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush abandoned his long-sought goal of cutting capital gains taxes, 
but he insisted on some pro-growth measures that would give small business a 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
The deal struck Sunday between the White House and congressional leaders 
includes a cornucopia of benefits for firms with less than $50 million in 
equity -- a combination of paid-in capital and retained earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The tax deductions and credits total $25 billion over five years -- a drop in 
the bucket in a $500-billion budget package but a big boost for some 
modest-sized businesses and the people who buy their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a triple sweetener, quite a deal," said a congressional staff aide. "The 
companies themselves receive breaks, and the people who buy the stock get 
helped both when they buy and when they unload for profits." 
</P>
<P>
The investor gets a 25% income tax deduction for stock purchased in one of 
these firms. If he buys $100,000 in stock, for example, he can deduct $25,000. 
The maximum allowable deduction is $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes on capital gains from stock sales by small companies would be linked to 
inflation. If the consumer price level has risen 10% during the time the 
investor holds the stock, then 90% of the profit on the stock sale would be 
subject to taxes. This technique is called indexing for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax break is targeted to individuals to get them to invest in these 
companies. The theory is that the economy is better off if we plow money into 
the smaller businesses," said another congressional aide. 
</P>
<P>
For the company, the budget agreement offers an array of economic goodies. 
</P>
<P>
The research and development tax credit, now 20%, would be boosted to 30%. A 
separate credit to encourage experimentation, due to expire, would be extended 
through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Expensing, which allows deduction of the full price of some equipment in the 
year it is purchased, would be expanded to include two years. 
</P>
<P>
Companies also could get a rapid write-off for additional purchases of 
scientific equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new tax breaks apply only to companies in business for at least 
five years. And the firm must have a trade or business producing a tangible 
product. Banks, real estate agencies and other financial services firms don't 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
The budget conferees also agreed to have Congress adopt an additional $600 
million in unspecified "growth incentives." 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise zones, an effort to bring business back to economically devastated 
neighborhoods, also would receive recognition under the budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of luring business back to the depressed inner-city is a favorite 
theme of the White House, but has never been embraced by Congress. Sunday's 
agreement represents another effort to win legislative approval. 
</P>
<P>
The government would issue a list of areas qualifying as enterprise zones. A 
business operating in the area -- with a factory, distribution center or other 
job-creating activity -- would enjoy two tax breaks. The investment would 
qualify for very fast depreciation under the tax laws, and the company could 
claim tax credits for a portion of the salaries for all workers in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
The search for oil and gas also would get a boost if Congress approves the 
budget package. It includes a variety of technical but important tax changes. 
</P>
<P>
Tax credits would be increased for expenditures on exploratory drilling. 
Capital spending for special techniques to recover the remnants of oil in 
existing fields would receive expanded tax credits. And taxes on investors in 
some of these energy-related projects would be eased slightly. 
</P>
<P>
The energy tax breaks, which might have drawn strong opposition earlier from a 
Democratic-controlled Congress, have a much better chance of approval now 
because of the surge in oil prices resulting from the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The President wanted something he could call a growth package, even though he 
lost the battle on capital gains," a congressional aide said of the agreement 
between the White House and congressional leaders. "This deal represented the 
best he could do, and it should be attractive to the conservative Republicans 
who are always talking about helping entrepreneurs."

FDIC Sues Economist Laffer: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued economist 
Arthur Laffer, seeking more than $45,800 in fees he collected from the 
now-defunct Commonwealth Bank as part of a three-year contract to serve as one 
of the bank's directors. 
</P>
<P>
The federal lawsuit maintains that Laffer was advanced $75,000 for the 
three-year term in 1983, but worked only about one year and has refused to 
repay the fee for the two years he is alleged not to have served. The bank was 
put into receivership in September, 1987, then taken over by Capital Bank.

Sallie Mae Will Take Over Loan Program: The U.S. Department of Education said 
it plans to turn over the $9-billion portfolio of a financially troubled 
student-loan guarantee agency to Sallie Mae, the Student Loan Marketing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Sallie Mae will handle the portfolio of the Higher Education Assistance 
Foundation, or HEAF, one of the largest guarantee agencies in the Guaranteed 
Student Loan program, officials said. HEAF is in financial difficulty because 
of a portfolio that included a high percentage of loans to vocational schools, 
whose students defaulted in large numbers. Officials said the amount in default 
was about $3 billion.

EX-ENTREPRENEUR PARLAYS EXPERTISE ON ASIAN BUSINESS INTO A TV SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: YUE-SAI KAN SAYS PATIENCE AND KNOWING THE CUSTOMS ARE CRITICAL. SHE 
LEARNED THOSE LESSONS FIRSTHAND BEFORE BECOMING A BROADCASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With viewership as large as 400 million, you might think American broadcaster 
Yue-Sai Kan would be content with the size of her television audience. 
</P>
<P>
However, that audience lives in mainland China, and although Kan appreciates 
the viewer support, she also has been thinking about an audience closer to 
home. Kan is happy about the popularity of her commercially sponsored series on 
the Chinese government network, a broadcast monopoly that had not previously 
allowed ads. But she has long wanted a chance to make a splash on American 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
That opportunity has come. Kan is producer and on-camera host of "Doing 
Business in Asia," a four-part series airing this fall on America's Public 
Broadcasting Service. The woman who brought commercial-sponsored television to 
China is beginning to bring Asian capitalism to non-commercial television in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The series is designed to help American business people succeed in four Asian 
markets: Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Out of it comes a message 
that stems from Kan's experience in Asia: take time to learn more about local 
customs and potential contacts and customers before pursuing a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Each half-hour program discusses the etiquette and social customs particular to 
each of the Asian locations. The weekly segments explore the historical factors 
affecting business practices, the cultural psychology involved in business 
conduct and the language problems. Beginning this week, KCET-TV will broadcast 
the series locally at 2:30 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Shot on location, each program presents case studies of Western companies and 
entrepreneurs who are succeeding in Japan, South Korea and the capitalist 
enclaves of Taiwan and Hong Kong. Subjects range from corporate giants such as 
Estee Lauder, Citibank, Coca-Cola and International Business Machines to small 
providers of services to American importers with Asian operations. 
</P>
<P>
The series expands Kan's presence. Her company, the New York-based Yue-Sai Kan 
Inc., has published guidebooks and textbooks and produced television specials 
related to China for Western audiences. Kan is now offering instructional books 
and videotapes of her "Doing Business in Asia" series to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Kan, ebullient in manner and speech, said she has tried to bring to the series 
insight from her years in trade and television production. For example, it's 
important to develop strong relationships with potential customers in Asia, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a personal touch on a face-to-face level is very important because 
(Asians) need to feel that they can trust you," Kan said. "The more you get to 
know someone, the better the business prospects." 
</P>
<P>
Kan's business contacts in Asia and her reputation as a producer of documentary 
series were selling points when she approached Seattle public television 
station KCTS-TV about co-producing the programs, said Jessica McCann, a 
spokeswoman for the station. KCTS, a leading producer of programs on Asian 
life, wanted an opportunity to present Kan to a wider American audience, McCann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ideal offer because Yue-Sai is an Asian expert, and she's done so 
many programs in the past," McCann said. "She's also dynamic, and that's 
important because it's hard to keep this kind of series entertaining and 
intelligent simultaneously. She brings a freshness to the subject of doing 
business in Asia." 
</P>
<P>
Kan's route to business and the West was circuitous. Born in Guilin, China, in 
1948, she was raised in Hong Kong after her parents fled the mainland during 
the Communist revolution. She later moved to the United States -- first to 
study music in Hawaii, then to New York in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Kan and her sister Vickie took the entrepreneurial plunge in 1976, launching an 
import-export company in New York. They dealt consumer products like typewriter 
ribbons, clothing, pillowcases and hardware to customers in Asia. By 
cultivating contacts, Kan and her sister quickly turned their fledgling firm 
into a multimillion-dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
While the business grew, so did Kan's interest in television. Her involvement 
began when she accepted a position as television news anchor on a Manhattan 
cable program in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling that she could be more successful in television, she sold her interest 
in the trading company in 1980 and invested $500,000 in a television production 
company. The company's "Looking East," a 1981 series on Asian culture, is now 
in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Kan's big break came in 1984, shortly after the Public Broadcasting System 
agreed to broadcast two hours of live satellite feed from Beijing of events 
commemorating the 35th anniversary of China's revolution. PBS discovered just 
two days before the broadcast that the satellite relay would include no English 
translations. PBS searched for someone who could translate and explain the 
nuances of Chinese culture. They found Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese government officials were so impressed with the broadcast that they 
awarded Kan a contract for a series on Western life. The series, "One World," 
was the first program produced by a foreigner for China's government-run 
network. The programs and commercial messages from sponsors like Proctor &amp; 
Gamble, General Foods and Gillette have been broadcast in uncensored form since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of "One World," Kan collected enough Chinese government guanxi -- 
"connections" -- to secure approval for a number of projects. Recently, for 
example, she produced a syndicated special called "Journey Through a Changing 
China." Kan's ABC-TV network special, "China: Walls and Bridges," won an Emmy 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"From my television production, I learn that you need to get in touch with 
high-level people (in Asia) to get things done," Kan said. "It's important to 
find someone reputable to introduce you, because this person becomes your 
guarantor." 
</P>
<P>
Building trust takes time in Japan and South Korea, Kan said, adding: "If you 
expect to . . . do business on your first trip, don't go to Japan or Korea -- 
because it just won't work." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, patience is one of the five keys to success in Japan -- keys that Kan 
dubs the "five Ps." The kind of product exposure she calls "presence" is a 
second. Strategy or "preparation" is a third. Quality of the "product" is the 
fourth and observing "protocol" the fifth, Kan observes in one series segment. 
</P>
<P>
Kan has produced a separate program on each of the four Asian markets because 
protocol and business cultures vary. For example, deals can be consummated 
relatively quickly in Taiwan because the overwhelming number of businesses are 
small and entrepreneurial. However, Japan is dominated by big firms that 
require managers at various levels to sign off on a deal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be sensitive to local customs and 'do as the Romans do,' " Kan 
said. "For expansion into Asia and (financial) globalization, you need 
localization. You must localize your thinking, localize your product and 
localize your strategy."

AUSTRALIAN BEER BARON FINDS EMPIRE AWASH IN TROUBLE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Elliott, who turned a small fruit and jam canner into the world's 
fourth-largest brewer, has become another swashbuckling Australian tycoon whose 
corporate ship has run aground. 
</P>
<P>
Just 12 months ago, Elliott, head of the Elders IXL brewing, agriculture and 
finance group, said he was putting together a rescue plan for embattled 
businessman Alan Bond, who resigned last week as chairman of debt-laden Bond 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Now Elliott has had to erect a safety net of his own. 
</P>
<P>
His holding company has arranged to sell a 19.9% stake in Elders to Japan's 
Asahi Breweries Ltd. for $797 million. 
</P>
<P>
The linkup gives one of Japan's largest brewers a foothold in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The investment came not a moment too soon for Elders. The maker of Fosters 
lager announced last week that it has suffered the largest annual loss in 
Australian corporate history -- $1 billion. That far eclipsed the $650 million 
lost by Bond Corp. in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Elders' shares have sunk. From a high of $2.03 this year, they fell to $1.14 
last week -- their lowest since the 1987 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of similarities between Alan Bond and his would-be savior, 
Elliott. The two gained control of more than 85% of Australia's beer market, 
became household names through a string of aggressive takeovers and were well 
known for their sporting interests -- in Bond's case, yachting; in Elliott's, 
Australian Rules football. 
</P>
<P>
High debts in the aftermath of the 1987 market crash were their undoing. Months 
after Bond rejected Elliott's helping hand, Elliott's empire began to wobble. 
In May he stepped down as chief executive of Elders. 
</P>
<P>
As his corporate problems mounted, his political career also deteriorated. 
President of the opposition Liberal party, Elliott had differences with party 
leaders in the months before the March election. He said he would not seek the 
presidency a second term, effectively ending his political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's rise began 17 years ago. Henry Jones IXL was a run-down company when 
Elliott, fresh from five years with the McKinsey &amp; Co. management 
consulting group, took it over in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Within eight years, the hefty Elliott -- a cartoonist's delight with his large 
nose -- had raised its profit 20 times over with a series of takeovers bearing 
his trademark of speed and surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Henry Jones took over one of Australia's oldest companies, Elder Smith 
Goldsbrough Mort, to become Elders IXL. The growth continued, Elliott claiming 
that he would "Fosterize" the world. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds of his demise were sown in the late 1980s, when Harlin, a private 
firm run by Elliott and other Elders directors, raised its stake in Elders 
above Australia's 20% takeover threshold. They were forced to launch a full bid 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The offering price had to match what Harlin paid for its initial stake -- well 
above the prevailing market level. The bid valued Elders at $4.6 billion, 
making it the biggest management buyout in Australian history. 
</P>
<P>
Harlin, which got its only income from Elders dividends, secured 55% of Elders 
shares when the offer closed in September, 1989. It financed the buyout through 
massive borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
When Elders posted a 46% fall in net profit in February of this year, doubts 
about Harlin's ability to service its debts multiplied, and Elders shares began 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Elliott, the 48-year-old son of a Melbourne bank employee, announced 
a restructuring of the Elders group. He said he would sell financial assets, 
spin off agribusiness operations and take over the brewing business of 
Britain's Grand Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
In April, for the third time in four years, British regulatory authorities 
moved to block Elliott's expansion into British brewing, referring the Grand 
Met deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission is expected 
to rule in the next few weeks on whether the deal can go through. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's resignation in May was seen as an attempt to mollify shareholders and 
creditors, but he remains non-executive chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Harlin, desperate to raise cash to calm bankers, agreed to 
sell a stake in Elders to Asahi Breweries. The move halved Harlin's debt to 
around $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
But doubts over Harlin's ability to service its debt persists, and many 
analysts believe that Asahi will be asked to bite off another chunk of Elders 
in the near future.

ASSETT ALLOCATORS' QUEST: RIGHT INVESTMENT MIX; 
</P>
<P>
EQUITIES: THESE FINANCIAL PROS SUGGEST THE PROPER PACKAGE OF STOCKS, BONDS, 
OTHER INSTRUMENTS AND CASH FOR THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Looking for a way to reallocate your assets now that oil prices have hit $40 a 
barrel and recession seems to be looming even larger than a few months ago? You 
are not alone. That's what the pros are doing. 
</P>
<P>
Asset allocators analyze the economy, world events and the stock and bond 
markets to determine whether you should own stocks at all -- and in what 
amounts -- as well as what amounts of bonds, cash and possibly gold or real 
estate you might hold. 
</P>
<P>
Asset allocation is not merely the technique of not putting all your eggs in 
one basket, but also the art of knowing what basket to put which eggs in, and 
when. The "when" is important because events change perceptions, and 
perceptions as well as (and sometimes instead of) the numbers tend to drive 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
So on Aug. 4, there was a change in the way that Morton Silverman, managing 
director of portfolio strategy for Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis, 
looked at his investments. "After the Iraqi invasion, we redid the (computer) 
model, trying to find a previous period in crisis -- and because of the event 
risk, the portfolio model went tilt," Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
Money in equities was reduced sharply. Investments in U.S. stocks went to 20% 
from 35% and in international mutual funds to 15% from 20%. Cash doubled to 20% 
and fixed-income investments increased to 35% from 30%. Inflation hedges like 
natural resources went up to 15% from 10%. Real estate investment declined. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman said the so-called equilibrium model -- used when the world is calm 
and the economy stable -- calls for 20% in each asset category. The allocations 
he is calling for now, less in stocks and more in bonds, is defensive and 
reflects the Persian Gulf crisis and doubts about the economy. Other portfolio 
managers and financial planners are into the same strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our portfolio went from neutral, which was 30% stocks, 40% bonds and 30% cash, 
to 30% equities, 50% bonds and 20% cash," said Robert Beckwitt, manager of 
Fidelity's Asset Management Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The heavier weighting of the bond portion of portfolios is based on the 
expectation of a sharp economic downturn. "We see a recession," said Art 
Steinmetz, co-manager of Oppenheimer's Asset Allocation Fund, who said he had 
increased the amount of money going into bonds to 45% from 35%, mostly in 
short- and middle-term issues. "We think the yields will come down and the 
prices (of bonds) will go up." 
</P>
<P>
"If you are getting a 9% return on long-term government bonds, and yields (on 
new bonds) drop, the value of your bonds can go up 10%. That's a 37% return 
over three years," Beckwitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Financial planner Joseph Clinard Jr. said that while he had not changed his 
basic allocation, he was more defensive. "New money is being held in cash," he 
said. "We are not buying new stocks yet but will be soon because we are looking 
for a bottom." 
</P>
<P>
What don't money managers want now? Transportation, basic-materials stocks and 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
"We reduced the real estate portion of our portfolio and increased the 
fixed-income portion because of the likelihood of recession," said Mark Snyder, 
a financial planner. "Where we had 15% to 20% in real estate, that is down to 
5% to 10%." 
</P>
<P>
When will stocks come back? "When the (Federal Reserve Board) eases up interest 
rates, stocks do well. If the Iraqi situation were to end soon, and the Fed 
eased aggressively, that would be great for stocks," Beckwitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Few managers consider the recent rise in oil prices to be permanent, and they 
all said they expect prices to drop. The stock market, they said, has already 
reacted to events, dropping from close to 3,000 on the Dow Jones industrial 
average to below 2,500 before creeping up a little. 
</P>
<P>
"I think oil will sustain itself in the $20-a-barrel range, but there might be 
a lot of volatility," Beckwitt said. "But I don't think even if there is a 
shooting war, that the stock market will drop another 500 points."

DEALS: MARKET WATCH;

<P>
MACY'S MAY NEED THE HELP OF KRIS KRINGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a master merchant trying to sell goods that are a little tattered, 
what do you do? Just what Edward Finkelstein, the master merchant who runs R. 
H. Macy &amp; Co., is trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
You mark the merchandise up sharply, act as if you're selling the crown jewels, 
then wait for buyers to break down the door. Maybe even lower the ridiculously 
high price a bit to make a buyer happy. Only Finkelstein isn't peddling 
sweaters or upscale kitchen utensils. Instead, he's selling Macy's itself. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's, you see, could really use some new capital to help pay down some of the 
debt it incurred when it went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986 and when it 
bought part of Federated Department Stores in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's asking price -- $15 million for each 1%, which values the company's 
stock at $1.5 billion -- is such a joke that it's amazing that the company can 
quote it with a straight face. That's five times the value placed on Macy's 
three months ago by Michael Price, one of its directors, who has a legal 
obligation to value the stock fairly. 
</P>
<P>
If Finkelstein can pull off this sale at his price, he will be enshrined in the 
Merchants Hall of Fame. If he can't, Macy's will continue to limp along 
financially -- if things go well. If things go badly -- if, say, this year's 
Christmas selling season is as bad as last year's -- look out below. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to Macy's is important. It's one of the world's leading retailers, 
whose properties besides the flagship chain include the Bullock's and I. Magnin 
department stores and the Aeropostale, Charter Club and Fantasies by Morgan 
Taylor specialty chains. If Macy's goes under, it will make an already gloomy 
retail climate even gloomier. 
</P>
<P>
Selling new shares, as Macy's hopes to do, would reduce the percentage of the 
company held by current stockholders but would greatly increase the value (if 
any) of their shares. The $285 million that Finkelstein is asking for a 19% 
stake in Macy's would give the company enough money to buy up about $700 
million of its junk bonds, which are trading at far below face value. Getting 
rid of those bonds would cut Macy's interest payments enough to give the 
company breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market, though, is acting as if Macy's is a goner. The bonds 
trade at prices that are usually seen only for securities of companies that 
have a good chance of going bankrupt and reneging on their debts. For instance, 
Macy's senior bonds were trading at about 52% of face value late last week. The 
junior bonds traded for less than 25% of their adjusted face value. And that 
was before the chaotic pounding they took Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If you bought the senior bonds at Thursday's price, and they continue to pay 
interest and Macy's actually pays them off when they mature, you would make a 
hefty 31% a year on your money. Or, as the bond boys say, you would get a 31% 
yield to maturity. The intermediate bonds were trading at an astronomical 42% 
yield to maturity and the junior bonds a loan-sharkish 84% yield. By contrast, 
a U.S. Treasury bond yields about 9% and an AT&amp;T bond about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Even Macy's bank debt, which ranks ahead of the bonds when it comes to getting 
paid, is distressed. Loan Pricing Corp., a New York-based financial news and 
data company, says Macy's bank debt would fetch less than 85% of face value if 
buyers could be found and would have a yield to maturity "in the 20s." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the junk bond market is more than a tad irrational these days, as 
Myron (Mike) Ullman III, Macy's chief financial officer, points out, these 
prices are scary. Very scary. The kind usually seen when a company is about to 
renege on its debts -- which Ullman insists is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
If the bond prices are even remotely rational, Macy's stock -- for which 
investors paid $300 million when the company went private in 1986 -- is worth 
little or nothing. Closer to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
So how can Macy's say that its stock is worth $1.5 billion -- five times the 
1986 price? Ullman says that's based on today's value of the cash that Macy's 
will generate in the future. The only problem, of course, is that no one knows 
how Macy's will fare this Christmas, let alone how it will do years from now. 
</P>
<P>
If you take the $1.5 billion seriously, I've got a bridge to sell you. 
</P>
<P>
Ullman says the $1.5-billion valuation is shared by a sophisticated buyer, 
Corporate Properties Inc., which paid $15 million for a 1% stake in August. CPI 
happens to be one of Macy's landlords. I don't know what CPI was up to -- CPI 
won't talk -- but I'll bet it had more to do with enhancing a relationship with 
Macy's than with looking for the best use for $15 million. When Macy's bonds 
are yielding up to 84% and have a far better claim on the company's assets than 
the stock does, the bonds are a far more rational investment than the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's stock doesn't trade, so there is no price quote on it. But the 
aforementioned Michael Price manages mutual funds -- the best known of which is 
Mutual Shares -- that own Macy's Acquiring Corp. stock. Price has a legal 
obligation to make his best estimate of Macy's value, because investors in his 
funds buy stock at the funds' net asset value and redeem at net asset value. To 
be fair to everyone, he has to value the funds' assets as accurately as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what? Price has been marking down his Macy's stock. Sharply. He's dropped 
it from three times his cost, as of June 30, 1989, to a mere one time his cost 
as of June 30, 1990. In other words, Price values Macy's stock at its original 
$300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Price's June 30 valuation just one-fifth of Macy's number? Has he marked 
the stock down lower now than it was on June 30? Ask him. He wouldn't take my 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Price is only one of a number of sophisticated investors -- GE Capital Corp., 
Laurence Tisch's Loews Corp., Michigan shopping center mogul A. Alfred Taubman 
are among the others -- that invested in the Macy's LBO. The idea was to have 
merchant Finkelstein run the show, with more than 300 Macy's employees getting 
a chance to buy into the company. 
</P>
<P>
But there was just too much debt. The But there was just too much debt. The 
company isn't doing badly; it's just not doing well enough to climb out of the 
hole that it dug itself into. If Finkelstein can get his $285 million, things 
will probably be OK. If he doesn't get it, Macy's may need another "Miracle on 
34th Street."

ON STAGE DOWNTOWN; 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES THEATRE CENTER CELEBRATES FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF SERVING A DIVERSE 
AUDIENCE AT SPRING STREET LOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At this gala, the location was a statement. For five years, Los Angeles Theatre 
Center has survived as a sort of Ft. Apache of the Arts on crime-ridden Spring 
Street. So when it came time for its first black-tie gala, it was only natural 
it be held on LATC's turf -- downtown at night. 
</P>
<P>
"The culture of LATC is multicultural contemporaneity," said artistic director 
Bill Bushnell before Thursday night's party at the Biltmore Hotel. "And to be 
in the center of that you have to be downtown." 
</P>
<P>
"This theater reflects something about the city and the country," said Tyne 
Daly. "It reflects the human condition which includes folk of all sorts -- not 
just whites, not just guys." 
</P>
<P>
For Elizabeth Montgomery, the group "epitomizes what theater can be: generous, 
innovative, fun, exiting and something for everyone. No one is excluded from 
LATC. It's a totally unselfish place." 
</P>
<P>
Among those included in the gala, chaired by Shelby Kaplan Sloan and Bobbie 
Liebenbaum, were actors Buck Henry, Carol Kane, Robert Foxworth, Mary Woronov, 
Esai Morales, Madge Sinclair, and Ron Leibman with Jessica Walter. LATC trustee 
William Devine represented AT&amp;T, which underwrote the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Honored were Lod Cook, CEO of Arco, and Jim Wood, chairman of the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. The CRA and LATC have a complex relationship, 
which Wood described as his organization being the theater group's "rich 
uncle." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that the theater has to acquire other patrons." Wood said. 
"They're doing that, but they need to do it more. Tonight is an example of 
precisely what has to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Some of it did happen. The evening netted $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wood also said of the center, "It's doing what we want it to do for people 
downtown at night." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the LATC's other rich relations, the Los Angeles City Council, 
who were all listed as members of the dinner committee, were represented by 
only two council members, both from the San Fernando Valley -- Joy Picus and 
Hal Bernson. It was explained that this was because the council is in recess 
and the members might be traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley, who was honorary chairman, was in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
What they missed, besides a live auction and dinner of beef and lamb chops, was 
a musical performance from the upcoming productions "Blues in the Night" and 
"The Joni Mitchell Project."

GIRDING FOR MOVIE GRIDLOCK;

<P>
FILM: IN A CROWDED MARKETPLACE, STUDIO EXECUTIVES LOOK FOR AN EDGE AS THEY 
POSITION CHRISTMAS SEASON RELEASES. ELBOWING FOR A PIECE OF THE HOLIDAY PIE CAN 
GET ROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halloween may be a month away, but in Hollywood it's beginning to look a lot 
like Christmas, as the studios rush to lock their end-of-the-year films into 
holiday play dates. 
</P>
<P>
The latest spate of jockeying took place following recent announcements that 
Paramount had pushed back the opening date of Francis Coppola's "The Godfather 
Part III" from Nov. 21 to Christmas Day and that Disney had pushed forward the 
date of "Three Men and a Little Lady" from Christmas to Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was waiting to see what (Paramount) was going to do with ('Godfather 
III')," said an executive at a competing studio. "No one wants to have to go 
against 'The Godfather' unless their film is directed at a completely different 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
If "The Godfather III" is the film event of the year, there are plenty of other 
contenders for box-office dollars. More than two dozen major titles, up about 
20% from last year, are scheduled to open over a seven-week period from early 
November through Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Included are a dozen or more prestige titles that are considered, within the 
industry, to be candidates for Academy Award attention. Among them: "Godfather 
III," Sydney Pollack's "Havana," Brian De Palma's "Bonfire of the Vanities," 
Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Sheltering Sky," James Ivory's "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" 
and Penny Marshall's "Awakenings." 
</P>
<P>
The list of those films that would seem to have purely commercial ambitions 
includes "Kindergarten Cop," with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood's "The 
Rookie," and the sequels "Rocky V," "Three Men and a Little Lady" and "Look 
Who's Talking Too." 
</P>
<P>
As one studio publicity chief put it, "It's more than competitive -- it's going 
to be murder." 
</P>
<P>
At theaters, it may be more a case of gridlock. Although there are about 24,000 
screens in the United States and Canada, the glut of movies will be hard to 
accommodate. Films aimed at broad audiences usually open with between 800 and 
2,500 prints; simple math dictates that some titles will be squeezed out. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's got to give," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations. 
Krier predicted that some films scheduled for release this year will be held 
back. "It's a case of who's going to give in first." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, distributors are standing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first Christmas I can remember where nobody wants to move, 
nobody's flinching," said Tom Sherak, executive vice president at 20th Century 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that everybody believes in their product," Sherak continued. 
"And given what's out there, if you don't have the goods, you've got to get out 
of the way, because it's going to be tough. It's going to look like a Pac-Man 
game. You know how that little yellow guy goes around and eats everything in 
his way?" 
</P>
<P>
The key to finding the power pill and avoiding being swallowed up? 
</P>
<P>
"You avoid head-to-head competition," said Si Kornblit, executive vice 
president of worldwide marketing for Universal Pictures. "This year, everyone 
sort of looked at everyone else, and then dropped their movies on the schedule. 
You won't find similar movies going against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Tri-Star is tentatively booking its baby movie -- "Look Who's Talking 
Too" -- for Dec. 7, 17 days after Disney's "Three Men and a Little Lady" opens. 
Warner Bros.' animated version of "The Nutcracker" is scheduled to open Dec. 
19, more than a month after Disney's animated "The Rescuers Down Under." Fox's 
macho action film "Predator II" follows MGM/UA's "Rocky V" by a week ("I'll be 
happy to get all the people who go to see 'Rocky V' come see our movie the next 
weekend," said Fox's Sherak).

The positioning of certain movies is crucial not only to the holiday grosses, 
but for the overall release strategy of the movies. Some films are, by the 
nature of their subjects, slow starters and don't figure to hit their stride 
until critics and Oscar campaigns weigh in. 
</P>
<P>
The boasting -- or bluffing -- has already begun. Disney executives say they 
moved "Three Men and a Little Lady" up a month because preview audiences were 
nuts about it. Fox officials claim that "Home Alone," a John Hughes-produced 
comedy, will be "the sleeper hit of the season." Columbia is spreading the word 
that Rob Reiner's "Misery" is the one that will leap out of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
More than bragging rights are at stake. The long hot summer is Hollywood's Big 
Season, accounting for about 40% of a year's overall receipts, but the 10-day, 
year-end holiday often sees the most intense moviegoing all year. In 1987, 
ticket sales during that period totaled about $160 million, or 3.76% of the 
year's gross. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a very large pie, and everybody wants to have a piece of 
it," said David Forbes, Orion's president of domestic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the beginning of the Christmas season has steadily moved 
forward and post time now comes before Thanksgiving. This season, Orion will 
get off first with "Dances With Wolves," a three-hour Western directed by and 
starring Kevin Costner. Orion is hoping that, like its "Platoon" of a few years 
back, "Dances With Wolves" will gain steam after a limited early release and 
perform all the way through Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to build an awareness, and a want-to-see factor," said Orion's 
Forbes, adding, "However you release your pictures, your goal is for them to 
have legs." 
</P>
<P>
Following is a tentative -- accent on tentative -- schedule of the 1990

</P>

"Dances With Wolves" (Orion), Nov. 9. Limited.

ARGENTINE COMPOSER TO OPEN MUSEUM SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE UBIQUITOUS ALICIA TERZIAN AND HER GROUP WILL PRESENT LATIN-AMERICAN 
ART MUSIC AT LACMA AND CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE. 
</P>

Forget the unequal opportunities of women. Forget the recognized obstacles to 
popularizing serious new music. 
</P>
<P>
Neither applies to composer Alicia Terzian, who -- with her Grupo Encuentros de 
Musica Contemporanea -- flies in from Buenos Aires to open the 52nd Monday 
Evening Concert season at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
This particular dynamo manages to pretend that she is promoting such widely 
appealing music as the Beatles, rather than the atonal avant-garde variety of 
which she is an exponent. 
</P>
<P>
"And why not?" asks the artist-impresaria by phone in Argentina. "After working 
in this field for 22 years I should have something to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
That she does. Much more than other practitioners, especially those "excellent 
(new music) specialists in Los Angeles who are amazingly unknown to their 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Since founding her 15-member ensemble in 1978, Terzian has gained the 
sponsorship of Buenos Aires' biggest newspaper, El Chronista Comercial, which 
also owns a cable-TV channel and radio station. She feels particularly grateful 
for the support "because my country is so poor." 
</P>
<P>
She has made two recordings, appeared in 70 festivals throughout Europe, the 
Soviet Union, China and the Americas, and been awarded France's Academie de 
Palmes, among other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year one of her concerts in Buenos Aires drew more than 1,000 people, 
although average attendance is roughly 300. 
</P>
<P>
But it is her all-embracing approach, as opposed to the small-cult identity 
many new-music composers take, that has proven so successful. 
</P>
<P>
"My Encounters Group is not a thing unto itself," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I invite philosophers, painters and poets for big discussions on the culture 
of our time. As a result, we attract the most intelligent audiences -- a public 
made up of young people, university students. And even if they do not come 
primarily for the music, we are able to do our proselytizing." 
</P>
<P>
Terzian, who teaches at three conservatories in addition to finding time to 
compose, rehearse, hold office in various international music societies and do 
the necessary public relations for expanding her horizons, sees herself as "the 
mother of them all." 
</P>
<P>
She has scheduled one of her own pieces tonight, along with entries by fellow 
Argentines. She will present another concert of Latin-American art music in 
Campus Theater at Cal State Northridge at 8 p.m. Thursday. Both concerts will 
present work by Aurelio de la Vega, a Cuban-American resident of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I re-encountered Alicia on a trip to Buenos Aires," says the veteran, 
Northridge-based composer, "and found her truly amazing. To think that she has 
radio programs, teaches all those students, prepares concerts, holds office and 
composes makes one think of Wonder Woman. She has done for Latin-American art 
music what no one else could." 
</P>
<P>
Once the favored student of Alberto Ginastera, she wrote a violin concerto in 
her second year under his tutelage and she says she has composed no fewer than 
49 other works. 
</P>
<P>
"Independence was one of the things he admired in me," she says. "I did not 
copy him and I encourage my students to find their own voice, their own 
expression. That's the heart of any creative pursuit as I see it and especially 
of music." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain where all her drive and optimism come from, Terzian doesn't 
have a simple answer. 
</P>
<P>
"But the quest for personal expression is very powerful in me, and I hope it's 
contagious for others. . . ."

L.A. PHILHARMONIC FACES THE CRITICS IN NEW YORK; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: PERFORMANCES OPENING CARNEGIE HALL'S CENTENNIAL SEASON ARE PRAISED AND 
PANNED. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Incandescent," "unpressed grandeur and heart-tugging eloquence," "sonically 
ravishing." 
</P>
<P>
Those are a few of the glowing adjectives you may see quoted by the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic publicity office to represent the New York reception given the 
orchestra for its pair of concerts that opened Carnegie Hall's centennial 
season last week. 
</P>
<P>
The ones you won't see are: "dragging," "lugubrious," "occasionally untidy" or 
"prevailingly tame." 
</P>
<P>
New York is, as you have no doubt been hearing lately, a contentious, dangerous 
city, with even the safest-seeming places fraught with peril for a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Philharmonic is, of course, no stranger to New York, performing here 
fairly regularly. But last week's concerts brought an unusual amount of 
critical scrutiny. Typically, the orchestra's New York appearances tend to be 
in late spring as part of a national tour after the regular Los Angeles season. 
By then most of the great orchestras in the world have already passed through 
town, and the Los Angeles orchestra just isn't news. 
</P>
<P>
But this year it was. The Philharmonic happened to have been invited by 
Carnegie to open is most gala season ever, and it was flown out, at Carnegie's 
expense, for the honor. That alone -- since neither the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic nor its former music director, Andre Previn, are considered 
exactly gala names in New York -- was enough to make some observers suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Donal Henahan, the crusty chief critic of the New York Times, from whom all the 
above negatives were quoted, found nothing in the playing distinguishable from 
"what might be encountered from a visiting orchestra on almost any night during 
an ordinary Carnegie season." 
</P>
<P>
Complaining even more about the program -- which contained two major American 
works, Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto and William Schuman's Third Symphony -- 
than the performances, Henahan summed it up as "a puzzling evening Toscanini 
himself might have had trouble delivering the audience from somnolence." 
</P>
<P>
While consensus is an unknown concept in New York, others did find that the 
Philharmonic -- which played, many felt, better than it ever has in New York -- 
and Previn both came away with their reputations considerably enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for Newsday, Tim Page noted that "the Los Angeles Philharmonic has 
grown into an excellent ensemble." Bill Zakariasen, who was responsible for all 
the raves above, wrote in the Daily News that "the orchestral playing was 
superb." The third New York tabloid, the Post, concurred, Susan Elliott finding 
the orchestra to be "in top form, playing with a richly hued string sound and a 
solid sense of ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
What really seemed to win over New York audiences and critics alike was the 
second program, which Previn ended with a deeply felt and gorgeously played 
performance of Vaughan Williams' Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Goodman, writing in Newsday, said that Previn gave the Vaughan Williams 
work a "depth, confidence and patient sense that, come what may, this world 
will survive." Allan Kozinn, in the New York Times, praised the playing for a 
sound that was "smooth and focused, and admirably precise." And for Zakariasen 
the performance reached "unforgettable moments in the beatific slow movement." 
</P>
<P>
Also unanimously enjoyed was a masterly account of Beethoven's Third Piano 
Concerto, with Emanuel Ax as soloist. But New Yorkers always need something to 
fight over, and the premiere of Los Angeles Philharmonic composer-in-residence 
Steven Stucky's "Angelus" -- the first of a series of new works Carnegie has 
commissioned to celebrate its anniversary year -- provided it. 
</P>
<P>
A piece of otherwise innocuous tintinnabulation, it ends in a spectacular blast 
of sound that left some complaining of aural pain and others exhilarated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to dislike," enthused Zakariasen, "and at 12 minutes, doesn't 
wear out its welcome." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, Goodman, complained that Stucky "strikes at Carnegie's 
greatest acoustical weakness since its renovation. There's nothing like nine 
minutes of nonstop, virtually undifferentiated, high-pitched ringing to 
emphasize the bright, hard sound that can now be induced in Carnegie Hall under 
certain circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The piece lasted, by the way, a little over 10 minutes.

Greyhound -- An Aug. 26 article on the Greyhound bus strike said the National 
Labor Relations Board had charged the company with bargaining in bad faith in 
negotiations with the union representing Greyhound's drivers and maintenance 
and clerical workers. The NLRB did file an unfair-labor-practices complaint 
against the company, but the complaint did not include a bad-faith-bargaining 
allegation. The complaint is awaiting a hearing before an administrative law 
judge.

<P>
A judge in Santa Monica today delayed a decision on whether the murder trial of 
Marlon Brando's son will begin as scheduled Oct. 9 despite prosecution requests 
for postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas scheduled another hearing for Thursday to 
rule on whether prosecutors can have additional time to seek the return of 
Cheyenne Brando from Tahiti to testify against her half brother Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando is charged with murdering Cheyenne's lover, Dag Drollet, at 
the actor's hilltop mansion last May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando, 20, left the United States in June and returned to her native 
Tahiti, where she gave birth to a boy, the son of Drollet. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne was later hospitalized in a sanitarium in Tahiti. Marlon Brando said 
last week that his daughter has had psychiatric problems in the wake of the 
killing.

Two gunmen in a car opened fire on a car stopped in the middle of a Highland 
Park street, killing a 16-year-old and wounding four others, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between the two carloads of gang members in the middle of 
Avenue 50 Sunday night was one of five fatal attacks linked to gang activity 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the Highland Park incident occurred after the two 
cars, one with eight youths inside and the other carrying two, passed each 
other and then stopped when they recognized rivals, Detective Ron Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"They started yelling gang slogans and throwing gang signs at each other until 
two (Latino) males left one car and walked over to the other," Whitt said.

HIGH COURT OPENS WITH FLURRY, AWAITING SOUTER

The Supreme Court opened its new term today by agreeing to review its recent 
decisions barring sentencing juries from considering the character of the 
defendant's victim or the grief of the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
There were only eight justices on the bench as the court issued a flurry of 
about 1,000 orders after returning from a three-month summer recess. It denied 
review in the vast majority of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Souter is expected to receive Senate confirmation Tuesday as the 
nation's 105th justice of the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
In the sentencing case, the court agreed to consider reinstating an Ohio man's 
death penalty for a love-triangle murder. 
</P>
<P>
Ediberto Huertas fatally stabbed Ralph Harris Jr. in Lorain, Ohio, on June 7, 
1986. He now is serving a life prison term for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
On leave from the Air Force, Harris was spending the night with Elba Ortiz. 
Huertas, who had fathered two children with Ortiz, allegedly warned Harris he 
would "waste him" if he continued to see the woman. 
</P>
<P>
A state jury imposed the death sentence after hearing evidence that Harris' 
parents wanted Huertas to die for his crime. Elizabeth Harris, the victim's 
mother, also testified emotionally that she was proud of her churchgoing son 
and that his death had devastated his son. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that such "victim-impact" evidence should not 
be considered by sentencing juries. And last year, the justices voted 5 to 4 
that a jury generally may not be told about the victim's character. 
</P>
<P>
The court said a South Carolina murderer unfairly was sentenced to die because 
the jury heard such testimony. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling was written by Justice William J. Brennan, who has since retired. 
</P>
<P>
The four justices who dissented from last year's decision said then that they 
were ready to overturn the 1987 ruling and permit victim-impact testimony in 
criminal sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio Supreme Court relied on both U.S. Supreme Court rulings when last May 
it reduced Huertas' death sentence to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to decide whether lawyers in non-criminal cases may bar potential 
jurors because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
* Permitted the random drug testing of New York City's 10,000 jail guards. 
</P>
<P>
* Let stand a ruling that church-run schools must pay employees the federal 
minimum wage and may not pay women teachers less than men. 
</P>
<P>
* Rejected the appeal of three white men from New York City convicted in the 
Howard Beach incident of 1986, a racially motivated attack in which a black man 
died. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to consider letting states outlaw all barroom-style nude dancing as it 
voted to hear an effort to reinstate such an Indiana law.

Minority Serbs in Croatia today proclaimed autonomy within the republic, 
sealing off roads and railways in defiance of Croatian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Serbian people must use all means to resist the terror of the fascist 
(Croatian) government and to protect its human dignity and civil and national 
rights," the Serbian National Council said in a statement carried by Tanjug 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The council, an unofficial body claiming to represent Serbs in Croatia, said 
the declaration was based on the results of an August referendum that showed an 
almost unanimous vote for limited self-government. Croatian authorities 
declared the referendum illegal, but it was held anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Belgrade radio reported barricades were set up early today across roads and 
railway lines to Knin, a Serbian-dominated city of 10,000 people near the 
Adriatic coast.

Negotiators in Washington state reached a tentative agreement today in the 
longest teachers' strike, and New York City's 85,000-member union, the nation's 
largest, averted a walkout just hours after its contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
In Everett, Wash., negotiators sat down at 1 p.m. Sunday and met through the 
night with three state mediators until reaching an agreement at 8:30 a.m. 
today, said Washington Education Assn. spokesman John Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was to be brought before teachers in the Mukilteo School District

the agreement. The Mukilteo strike began Aug. 30 and classes were to start 
Sept. 5.

In New York, the city and its teachers' union reached tentative agreement today

The announcement's wording sought to allay any public fear. 
</P>
<P>
"The distribution of gas masks in no way whatsoever constitutes a change in the 
emergency status," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The distribution of the masks follows months of heated debate in which the 
public -- and some officials -- have said it was foolish to delay giving out 
the protective equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Until today, officials had maintained that an immediate distribution of gas 
masks could panic the Israeli public or send Iraq an incorrect message that 
Israel was planning an attack. 
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai said distribution of the sealed gas mask 
kits "will take several weeks. . . . We will start in the city sector . . . and 
gradually get to rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
"Defense authorities have sufficient kits for all citizens of Israel," the army 
announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
It added that the government also has begun purchasing gas masks for the 1.7 
million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shai, in answering questions on the distribution on Israel television, 
maintained that the plan for supplying gas masks was developed long before the 
gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
While the government has been debating, civil defense officials have several 
times spoken on the radio on "home remedies" against gas attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The home remedies include sealing windows with tape and soaking towels in 
baking soda and water for a homemade gas mask.

INDIA'S HIGH COURT CALLS HALT TO JOB QUOTA PLAN

India's Supreme Court today ordered the government to halt its job quota 
program. The court said it hopes its temporary injunction will stop a wave of 
student protests and suicides. 
</P>
<P>
The five-judge panel also advanced the date for hearing arguments on the 
legality of the program by two weeks, to Oct. 25, Press Trust of India 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the government could continue preparations for carrying out the 
plan, which reserves 27% of federal jobs for low-caste Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
The government is assembling a list of thousands of castes that will qualify 
for preference in job applications. Another 22% already are set aside for the 
lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of Indian society -- tribespeople and the 
so-called untouchables. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Chief Justice Ranganath Mishra said he hopes peace will be restored 
while the issue is being studied by the court. 
</P>
<P>
In the northern town of Jammu, 17-year-old student Sandeep Sharma set himself 
on fire today in the latest suicide bid to protest the job quotas. He suffered 
third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
At least 70 persons have died in demonstrations against the plan. About 20 were 
upper-caste students who committed suicide by self-immolation or poisoning 
after claiming they were victimized by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister V. P. Singh announced the policy Aug. 7 to increase the quota 
for low-caste Indians in government jobs to 49%, saying he was seeking social 
justice for Indians discriminated against because of the social station of 
their birth.

The Soviet Union will need at least $12 billion in aid to fill empty store 
shelves with imports and get a free market started, President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's personal economic adviser said in an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot begin the transition to the market (economy) with empty shops. . . 
. To start up the market, we need a massive injection of all sorts of consumer 
goods," Nikolai Petrakov told the French business daily Tribune de l'Expansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign companies, banks and governments have already offered such 
credits, and he estimated that "a minimum $10 billion to $12 billion" will be 
needed.

IRS DISPUTE WITH S&amp;LS TO BE HEARD; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: THE JUSTICES WILL DECIDE ON TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR 'RECIPROCAL 
SALES' OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

<P>
The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether savings and loan associations 
and other financial institutions may claim tax deductions for "reciprocal 
sales" of mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
With a reported $419-million-plus interest at stake, the court said it will 
hear Internal Revenue Service arguments against allowing such deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Two federal appeals courts have ruled against the IRS and one has ruled for the 
tax agency. The justices' decision, expected by July, will resolve the 
conflicting rulings. 
</P>
<P>
An IRS victory would mean more bad news for some struggling S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
In the lead case granted review today, Centennial Savings Bank of Greenville, 
Tex., a savings and loan, challenged an IRS refusal to treat the sale of its 
old mortgage loans to another S&amp;L as a transaction that generated a loss 
for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
After the IRS ruled that Centennial could not claim a tax deduction for the 
transaction, the savings and loan paid its assessed taxes and sued for a 
refund. A federal judge ruled for the government, but the New Orleans-based 
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals last November reversed the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In other action today, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Left intact a ruling that USX Corp. illegally discriminated against blacks at 
a Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that a federal appeals court 
"flagrantly disregarded" a 1989 Supreme Court decision in ruling against the 
giant manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia-based U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that USX, 
formerly known as U.S. Steel Corp., discriminated against blacks who applied 
for non-skilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to resolve a dispute from Arkansas over the power of states to tax 
cable television companies and subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it will review a ruling that Arkansas may tax cable TV as long 
as it also imposes the levy on similar communication services, such as the 
unscrambling of satellite signals. 
</P>
<P>
With millions of dollars in tax revenue at stake, the ruling was challenged in 
separate appeals by both the state and cable operators and subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
* Said it will decide whether Oklahoma may collect a sales tax on cigarettes 
and other items sold at a Shawnee convenience store owned and run by an Indian 
tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said they will review a ruling that would bar the imposition of 
such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for its views, the Bush Administration advised the justices to send the 
case back to a federal appeals court for further study. The justices ignored 
that advice. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to use a dispute over the settlement of a strike by Continental 
Airlines pilots to set new guidelines on the duties of unions to represent 
their members. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit against the Air Line Pilots 
Assn. by striking pilots who said the union denied them fair representation.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING HOLDS STEADY IN AUGUST 
</P>

<P>
Construction spending was unchanged in August after posting its first gain in 
four months in July, the government said today. Government spending offset 
declines in residential and non-residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $442.5 billion, after a 
revised 0.3% increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
July's advance originally was reported to have been 0.4% and was the first 
since a 0.4% gain in March. Spending fell 2.8% in April, 0.2% in May and 0.6% 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed the general weakness in the construction industry to 
high interest rates, tight lending requirements, consumer caution over the 
state of the economy and the Persian Gulf crisis and, in some areas, 
overbuilding that has resulted in lofty vacancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
The weakness has been illustrated in recent Labor Department reports showing 
the loss of nearly 100,000 construction jobs in the past three months. This 
included 40,000 jobs, after a seasonal adjustment, in August, the sixth 
consecutive monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
Construction spending in August was 2% above the $433.9 billion in the same 
month of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Residential spending in August fell 1.2%, to $186.9 billion, after a 0.2% 
decline in July. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family spending was down 1.3%, to $108.5 billion, after a 1.2% loss a 
month earlier. Apartment construction was up 1.1%, to $19 billion, after a 0.5% 
gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
Non-residential spending fell 4.3%, to $104.8 billion, erasing a 4.2% advance 
the previous month. Industrial spending, which jumped 16.2% in July, slipped 
back 12.7% in August. 
</P>
<P>
Government spending rose 6.1%, to $115.1 billion, after a 2.7% decline the 
previous month. Spending on highways and streets led the advance with a 9% 
gain.

BYU FALLS OUT OF TOP 10 IN AP POLL; GA. TECH GAINS FIRST RANKING IN 6 YEARS

<P>
Florida cracked the Top 10, Brigham Young dropped out of the elite group and 
Georgia Tech gained its first ranking in six years today in the Associated 
Press college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
Florida, which can't go to a bowl game because of NCAA violations, rose seven 
spots to No. 10 after beating Mississippi State 34-21 and improving its record 
to 4-0. It's the first Top 10 appearance for the Gators since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
BYU fell seven places to No. 11 after losing its first game of the season 32-16 
to Oregon. The victory boosted Oregon into the rankings at No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
USC's storm-shortened 35-26 victory over Ohio State lifted the Trojans three 
notches to 15th and dropped the Buckeyes five slots to 20th. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's 27-6 victory over South Carolina moved the undefeated Yellow 
Jackets up to 23rd in the nationwide poll of sports writers and broadcasters. 
Tech hadn't been ranked since 1984, when it got as high as 12th. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped South Carolina, which was 25th last week, out of the rankings. 
Arizona State, 21st last week, also fell out of the Top 25 after a 30-9 loss to 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and Florida State remained 1-2 and combined to get all but one of 
the 60 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, who beat Purdue 37-11, received 49 first-place votes and 
1,489 points. Florida State got 10 first-place votes and 1,420 points after 
rallying to beat Virginia Tech 39-28. 
</P>
<P>
While the top two spots remained unchanged, there was movement elsewhere in the 
Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which lost its opener to Notre Dame, jumped three spots to No. 3 
after downing Maryland 45-17. Virginia rose three places to No. 4 and gained 
one first-place vote following a 63-35 victory over William &amp; Mary. It is 
the highest ranking ever for the Cavaliers, who were never better than ninth 
prior to this season. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn and Tennessee both dropped after battling to a 26-26 tie. Auburn fell 
two places to No. 5 and Tennessee went down a notch to No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma jumped two spots to seventh after clipping Kansas 31-17, Nebraska 
stayed No. 8 after stopping Oregon State 31-7 and Miami rose one place to No. 9 
with a 48-21 win over Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado made the biggest jump, eight spots to No. 12, after handing Washington 
its first loss, 20-14. The Huskies fell five places to No. 17.

STOCK CAR RACE ROOKIE DIES IN HIGHWAY CRASH

<P>
Stock car driver Robert James Moroso, a leading candidate for Winston Cup 
Rookie of the Year honors, died in a wreck on a state highway Sunday, just 
hours after finishing 21st in a NASCAR Winston Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
Moroso, 22, of Terrell, N.C., was the 1989 Busch Grand National champion. 
</P>
<P>
Moroso had driven the No. 20 Oldsmobile in Sunday's Holly Farms 400 in North 
Wilkesboro, N.C., and was driving an Olds Cutlass on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going west on N.C. 150, started into a curve, lost control and slid 
sideways," Trooper Roger Smith said. Another car eastbound on the highway 
struck his car at the driver's door. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Williams, 27, of China Grove, N.C., the driver of the other car, was also 
killed, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened around midnight just west of Mooresville. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he was traveling at a high rate of speed," Smith said. "He lost 
control and went sideways and evidently he couldn't correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Smith of Matthews, Moroso's 26-year-old girlfriend, was injured in the 
accident. She was being treated at Carolinas Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Moroso, who drove for his father, Dick, won his first professional race before 
he was old enough to drink the sponsor's beer. He won his first series 
championship before he had become a household word anywhere but his hometown of 
Madison, Conn.

GANSLER RETAINED TO COACH U.S. NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM

<P>
Bob Gansler will be retained as coach of the U.S. national soccer team, the new 
president of the U.S. Soccer Federation said today. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, who replaced Werner Fricker as head of the USSF after the 
World Cup, said he anticipated that Gansler would remain as coach through the 
1994 World Cup, the first to be played in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rothenberg refused to guarantee that Gansler would remain four more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's there, and the expectation is he'll see us through until 1994," 
Rothenberg said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler took over the team in January, 1989, and led the United States to its 
first World Cup berth since 1950. However, the team lost three straight games 
at the World Cup and finished 23rd among 24 nations. Overall, the United States 
is 7-11 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I have no reason to make a change," said Rothenberg, a Los 
Angeles lawyer who was commissioner of soccer at the 1984 Olympics. "It's a 
dual thing, evaluating his performance and evaluating what the alternatives 
are. We want him to continue, and nobody has dropped on our lap that will be a 
superman. There's no reason to make a change." 
</P>
<P>
The USSF made overtures to Franz Beckenbauer, who retired as West German coach 
after his team won the World Cup. Beckenbauer then signed as technical director 
of Olympique Marseilles in France.

EX-PITCHER BOUTON STRIKES OUT IN COURT

<P>
The Supreme Court today burst former major leaguer Jim Bouton's hopes of 
winning a big-stakes contract battle over a baseball bubble gum product that 
resembles chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
Bouton, a former pitcher and best-selling author, lost an appeal to revive a 
$1-million damage award. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the award 
against a subsidiary of the Wrigley chewing gum company. 
</P>
<P>
Bouton, whose best pitching days were in the 1960s with the New York Yankees, 
was with a minor league team in Portland, Ore., in 1977, when he and Coach Rob 
Nelson came up with the idea that led to Big League Chew, shredded bubble gum 
in a pouch. 
</P>
<P>
The novelty was a bonanza that launched Bouton's business career. Sales were 
$18 million in 1981 after Bouton and Nelson teamed up with Amurol Products Co. 
of Naperville, Ill., a Wrigley subsidiary, to market the bubble gum. 
</P>
<P>
Bouton got into a dispute with Amurol in 1984 over an advertising campaign for 
the bubble gum. That led to a mailgram the company sent to Bouton agreeing to 
new contract terms. The mailgram became the focus of the court dispute.

A second fire at Freestate Raceway has been classified as arson, the state fire 
marshal said today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy State Fire Marshal Bob Thomas said the fire early this morning caused 
$30,000 in damage and destroyed a two-story wood building that was used as a 
lounge for jockeys and employees. 
</P>
<P>
An arson fire at the harness track Saturday afternoon heavily damaged the 
grandstand building, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were seeking two youngsters who were seen running from the track 
after the first fire. 
</P>
<P>
The race track has been closed for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The track was closed after it was sold to the Washington-based Cafritz Group, a 
real estate and development firm. Racing dates at the track had been leased to 
Mark Vogel, who is charged in Virginia with cocaine possession.

INJURY KEEPS HOUSEBUSTER OUT OF BREEDERS' CUP

<P>
Housebuster, the magnificent sprinter and winner of nine graded stakes this 
year, will miss the Breeders' Cup due to an injury, ending any chance he had of 
winning Horse of the Year or the 3-year-old championship. 
</P>
<P>
An outsider for those two honors anyway, any hopes his handlers had of winning 
them disappeared on Saturday in the Vosburgh at Belmont, when Housebuster 
sustained injuries that will keep him out of action until next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll skip the Breeders' Cup. It's tough. He's been a good horse all year. 
He's run his heart out, and then this happens. But you've got to look after 
your horse," trainer Jimmy Croll said by telephone from his New Jersey home. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster sustained several cuts on his legs during the race, in which he 
finished fifth, 15 lengths behind winner Sewickley. 
</P>
<P>
"He rapped himself pretty hard," Croll said. "He cut his hind leg, and just all 
in all, he needs some time. We don't figure he could get back for the Breeders' 
Cup in a proper way." 
</P>
<P>
Croll said Housebuster also strained an ankle ligament. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster was ranked fourth in the latest National Thoroughbred Poll with 
rankings based on the votes of 37 sports and Thoroughbred racing media 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup is scheduled for Oct. 27 at Belmont. Housebuster would have 
been entered in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster won 9 of 11 races this year, none longer than a mile and most at 
six or seven furlongs. He beat Preakness winner Summer Squall in the Swale last 
March at seven furlongs, and he won the Jerome at a mile on Sept. 3 at Belmont 
just before his start in the seven-furlong Vosburgh. He has won $693,716 
lifetime for owner Robert P. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 With no single 3-year-old or older horse standing alone this season, 
Housebuster was given an outside shot at one of those two titles, although no 
sprinter ever has won either of them. Now, while he still could be sprint 
champion, he has no chance at either of the two more prestigious titles. 
</P>
<P>
"We were well aware of that," Croll said. "It's unfortunate, but it did happen, 
and we don't figure we can take a chance on jeopardizing him. It's a tough pill 
to swallow, but we had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Croll said Housebuster would be shipped to Gulfstream Park in Florida to rest 
and resume racing in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll run as a 4-year-old," Croll said. "But we won't make him any worse off 
this year."

MOVIES: 'GHOST,' THIRD PLACE IN TICKET SALES, SHOWS NO SIGNS OF DYING.

<P>
The Yuppie thriller "Pacific Heights" claimed the No. 1 spot during its opening 
weekend at the box office, with ticket sales of approximately $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine as landlords who wind up wishing 
they hadn't rented their San Francisco apartment to a cunningly deranged 
Michael Keaton, the 20th Century Fox film -- directed by John Schlesinger -- 
opened at 1,284 theaters for a per-screen average of approximately $5,529. 
</P>
<P>
With ticket sales of about $6 million, the gangster epic "GoodFellas" slid to 
second place -- but it dropped just 6% from the film's previous opening 
weekend. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and 
Ray Liotta, the film had a per-screen average of about $4,647 on 1,291 screens. 
</P>
<P>
In third place, with no sign of dying, was Paramount Pictures' "Ghost." Indeed, 
ticket sales of $5.4 million -- during the film's 12th weekend -- were up 8% 
over the previous week, with the film averaging a sturdy $3,057 on 1,766 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Columbia Pictures' "Postcards From the Edge" earned 
approximately $4.1 million in its third week, and averaged $3,099 on 1,323 
screens, for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-ranked film was Tri-Star Pictures' thriller, "Narrow Margin," which 
had ticket sales of some $2.1 million -- a downward spiral of more than 40% 
from the previous weekend. At 1,253 screen, it averaged just $1,675 per-screen. 
</P>
<P>
Among the weekend openers, Epic/Triumph's science-fiction thriller "I Come in 
Peace," starring Dolph Lundgren as a detective on the trail of a murderous 
alien, had ticket sales of about $1.9 million on 1,073 screens, for an average 
of $1,770 and seventh place. And Peter Bogdanovich's heavily promoted 
"Texasville" had ticket sales of about $900,000 on 354 screens -- for a poor 
average of $2,542 -- and 11th place. From Columbia, it is the sequel to his 
1971 landmark, "The Last Picture Show." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the weekend's top 10, in approximate figures, were: MGM/UA's 
"Death Warrant," sixth place, with ticket sales of $1.9 million; Paramount's 
"Funny About Love," eighth, $1.6 million; Columbia's "Flatliners," ninth, $1.6 
million; Warner Bros.' "Presumed Innocent," 10th, $1.3 million.

'JESSE JACKSON' GIVING VOICE TO THE VOICELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson is better at using the camera than talking to it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his new weekly series airing at 5 p.m. Sundays on KCAL Channel 9 -- and 
named, of all things, "Jesse Jackson" -- ranks among the most important 
additions to television in years. 
</P>
<P>
Not because Jackson has sharpened his enunciation. On the contrary, for someone 
known for swaying crowds with fiery oratory, he often slurs his words so badly 
that it takes all your concentration just to understand what he's saying. 
</P>
<P>
Not because he's skilled at interviewing and leading panel discussions. He 
isn't, evidenced by Sunday's taped premiere, which focused almost entirely on 
the status of Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Not because his syndicated series is silky smooth. It has kinks galore, 
including an eclectic audience that did not participate in Sunday's show or 
even make a sound. It was nothing more than a multiracial backdrop, a prop. 
</P>
<P>
Not because he totally sheds his self-serving, personal-puffery cloak. He said 
Sunday that those Mohawks protesting plans for building a golf course on their 
ancient burial grounds in Oka, Quebec, "invited us there to hear their story." 
So . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Jackson being refused entry to the area by Canadian troops. Cut to 
Jackson holding an impromptu press conference there. Cut to Jackson visiting a 
Mohawk "survivor school." Cut to Jackson receiving a sweat shirt from the 
Mohawks. Cut to Jackson making a speech to them. Cut to Jackson with Canada's 
Indian minister, who tells Jackson that he warned the local mayor "not to go 
ahead with the golf course." Was the story the Mohawks' protest . . . or 
Jackson's? 
</P>
<P>
What gives "Jesse Jackson" so much promise is obviously none of the above. What 
you love about it are its fresh eyes. 
</P>
<P>
It's Jackson the reformer, not Jackson the performer, who stars here. Thanks to 
him, this show swims against the TV mainstream by giving voice to the voiceless 
in a medium known for its narrow range of opinion in news and public affairs 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Just think about it. Rarely do Native Americans get more than sound bites. But 
on Sunday, they got almost the entire hour, including a 15-minute package in 
which American Indian activist Russell Means (who led the Wounded Knee uprising 
in South Dakota in 1973) visited three reservations where Native Americans in 
the United States were said to be facing problems similar to those in Oka. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the Earth described by Native Americans as "our mother" puts many of 
their conflicts with whites in context, and these visual essays with Means were 
an eloquent expression of the Native American outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Jackson leading a panel discussion participated in by a treaties 
attorney, Means and two other Native American leaders. The Bureau of Indian 
Affairs declined to participate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this, and the discussion's strong tilt, Jackson should have been a 
better devil's advocate. Yet "Jesse Jackson" is intended to have a point of 
view, and the Native American views expressed here -- charges ranging from 
whites trampling on Indian rights to institutionalized stereotyping -- are 
valid ones generally excluded from TV. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its flaws, "Jesse Jackson" promises to be strikingly distinctive and 
valuable, affirming this time that there's more than one civil rights struggle 
in the U.S.

CHILD ABUSE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Social Services Agency records incidents of child abuse each 
month. The agency reports the number of families involved and children at risk. 
This does not reflect the total number of children who are actual victims of 
abuse, but, rather, the number of children in the household -- the total number 
who are in danger of being abused. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the first eight months of the year (the most recent period for 
which information is available) on a city-by-city basis. The cities are listed 
in terms of rate per thousand residents.

IF FORCED TO RAISE TAXES, THIS IS WHAT I'D DO; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST WE MUST HAVE BUDGET REFORM. NEW TAXES WOULD BE A LAST RESORT BUT I WOULD 
BACK USER FEES SIMILAR TO PROP. 111.

<TEXT>
<P>
California's budget process is a disaster. It ensures unfairness because it 
ensures that the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. 
</P>
<P>
That is why my first act as governor-elect will be to start the process 
required to produce desperately needed budget reform. 
</P>
<P>
If the process is not changed, it will guarantee continued shortchanging of 
mental health, public safety and other vital state activities whose shrinking 
share of the budget is not keeping pace with their rising costs. I want to 
maintain healthy spending for education -- perhaps even greater than the 
constitutional guarantee, but within the governor's and Legislature's ability 
to set priorities for that spending. 
</P>
<P>
New taxes, without budget reform, will not produce equity. I will not entertain 
talk of new taxes until we have first guaranteed the changes required to bring 
fairness to the budget and to prevent recurrence of the process that produced 
the present unfair mess. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, there were no automatic inflation adjustments for state 
benefit programs. Today there are dozens of annual formula increases, totaling 
more than $1.6 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, nobody thought to use the ballot initiative as a tool for 
allocating the budget for special purposes. But in just the last two years, 
there have been five initiatives to spend state funds, and there are eight on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, state and federal courts did not order hundreds of millions 
in spending by creating entitlements for certain benefits outside the control 
of the governor and Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
These piecemeal court decisions, statutory entitlements and manipulations of 
the initiative process have earmarked tax money in one year for one special 
interest and in the next year for another. The result has been to create a 
"preferred claimant status" for some state functions while starving other 
critically needed services. 
</P>
<P>
Is the solution to raise taxes, as the Democratic majority in the Legislature 
is so eager to do? Not as long as the automatic spending increases guaranteed 
the preferred claimants rise faster than the ability to generate tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
At worst, increasing taxes could sabotage any prospect of maintaining our 
recent record of unprecedented economic growth. The primary job generators of 
our economic engine during the past seven years have been small businesses. 
Increasing taxes could so threaten their small profit margin that it could be 
the difference between keeping their doors open or closed, between prosperity 
or recession. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true for taxes on income, which is why I oppose any 
increases, whether by boosting rates or changing the benefits of indexing. The 
state Senate Office of Research just concluded that California's income tax is 
the most steeply progressive in the country. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, when some services of government directly benefit users, I 
would not oppose users fees that are adequate to maintain that service. For 
example, I supported Proposition 111 last June to ensure that gas tax revenues 
are adequate to maintain transportation services. 
</P>
<P>
Any consideration of taxes would be my very last resort. I offer the record of 
no new taxes and an almost 10% cut in the per capita tax burden during my 
11-year tenure as mayor of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
What are the elements of budget reform? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flexibility. Elected officials must have the ability to review and change 
all budget allocations in light of changing economic circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring I proposed a "mini-Gramm-Rudman" mechanism for the state budget to 
reconcile spending with available revenues and cut spending proposals that 
exceed revenues. I am pleased that the governor was able to win from the 
Legislature such a partial trigger in this year's negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Equity. Billions of dollars in state funds are tied up even before a budget 
is proposed. No program or function should be automatically advantaged or 
disadvantaged when it comes to budget allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accountability. Priorities must be set on an annual basis by the elected 
representatives of the people. We are paid to make the tough decisions every 
year, not to let our predecessors place the budget on autopilot and increase it 
without regard to changing times, changing needs and changing resources. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Local responsibility. I will veto any unfunded legislative mandate on local 
governments. And I will work with city and county officials to roll back 
currently mandated programs to provide more discretionary revenues for local 
functions such as police, fire protection and sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
California has a long agenda of challenges that I am eager to address. But 
before any meaningful progress can be made on this agenda, we must put our 
fiscal house in order.

COUNTERPUNCH: EDITING A CLASSIC TEXT -- AN ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GLORE, Glore is literary manager of South Coast Repertory Theatre in 
Costa Mesa, where Shaw's Man and Superman plays through Oct. 11, and runs 3 1/4 
hours. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of George Bernard Shaw's "Man and Superman" at South Coast 
Repertory, Don Shirley takes exception to the way in which the play has been 
edited. In doing so, he attributes SCR's playing version of the text to Amlin 
Gray, a mistake which must be corrected at the outset. Although Martin Benson, 
the director of SCR's production, did refer to a version prepared by Gray for 
Berkeley Rep, along with versions from San Diego's Old Globe and Washington's 
Arena Stage, none of these is being used as the performance text for SCR's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Benson and I (as the dramaturge for the SCR production) prepared our own 
version, which was then further refined through Benson's work with his actors. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it should be. To appropriate someone else's edition 
</P>
<P>
of a play in toto is to shirk a primary responsibility. The SCR text is of 
necessity a product of SCR's own artistic collaboration: Its editing choices 
were made with our production approach in mind and were tested and validated 
through six weeks of rehearsal and a week of preview performances. 
</P>
<P>
While I find arguable Shirley's specific opinions (Sept. 10) about the cuts we 
made for our production, I won't argue with them here. I do feel, however, that 
it would be worthwhile to clarify how and why we went about the process of 
trimming Shaw's mammoth work down to playable size. 
</P>
<P>
SCR values the text as the center of the theatrical event and our primary 
objective is always to realize the writer's vision. Nevertheless, very few 
classic plays are performed in their entirety any more, at SCR or any other 
theater in America; not, as Shirley suggests, because actors can't memorize all 
those lines (they can), but because audiences won't sit still for them. Prior 
to the modern age, theatergoers had no qualms about sitting for four hours or 
more to take in a play. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the collective attention span has dwindled, perhaps because 
movies and television have instilled in us a different sense of rhythm and 
pace. In today's theater, three hours' duration seems to be the outer limit, 
excepting those rare shows such as "Nicholas Nickleby" or "The Mahabharata," 
whose extraordinary length becomes a crucial aspect of the theatrical 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
So the contemporary producer of such classics as "Hamlet" (four hours plus), 
"Peer Gynt" (six to seven hours) or Goethe's "Faust" (off the chart) faces a 
thorny task. How to keep such plays in the repertory without putting people to 
sleep or sending them to their cars at intermission? 
</P>
<P>
For "Man and Superman," which has been known to clock in at five hours, the 
common solution (endorsed even by Shaw himself) is to eliminate the hourlong 
"Don Juan in Hell" dream scene or to perform it separately. Yet as Shirley 
observes the remaining portion of the play, the romantic comedy, seems 
"surprisingly trivial" and "conventional" by itself. Hence our decision to 
retain the dream, which serves up the philosophical meat of the play and 
provides an intellectual context for the otherwise frivolous romance. 
</P>
<P>
We wanted our audience to hear Shaw's ruminations on the Life Force in the 
dream scene, thereby to appreciate the comic love story of Jack and Ann as a 
lighthearted example of the Life Force in action. 
</P>
<P>
This meant that we had to look for other, less convenient ways to condense the 
play. We aimed for no arbitrary time limit and were prepared to accept as long 
an evening as would be necessary to do the play justice. As we investigated, 
each proposed cut was debated, its merits weighed against its faults; 
ultimately we removed only material which seemed redundant or unhelpfully 
tangential or, in a few cases, hopelessly obscure. 
</P>
<P>
No cut was made casually. Take, for example, the first-act conversation between 
Jack and Ann about their shared childhood. Shirley cites this as an example of 
our infelicitous editing, implying that we dismissed the scene as mere 
"entertaining repartee." He argues that our version obscures an audience's 
understanding of Jack and Ann's obsession with one another and the 
inevitability of their final embrace. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that we have preserved enough of the scene to make clear Jack and 
Ann's deep and longstanding connection. More importantly, the fact that these 
two have known each other since childhood matters very little in the scheme of 
the play: as Shaw's Don Juan tells us, "In the sex relation the pair may be 
utter strangers to one another, but the Life Force throws them into one 
another's arms at the exchange of a glance." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Ann and Jack's final embrace is inevitable because that's the 
way the Life Force wants it. All else is beside the point. Such analysis, 
supported by careful experimentation during rehearsal, led to our decision to 
eliminate some of the exposition in this scene while preserving its spirit and 
emotional subtext. 
</P>
<P>
In capable hands, the process of editing a classic text is never a desperate 
effort to force a Size 9 play into a Size 6 show. It becomes an artistic 
endeavor whose objective is to hone and polish and streamline the play for 
contemporary sensibilities -- and to do so without damaging the play or 
reducing the audience's experience of it. In my opinion, the version of Shaw's 
play which we have prepared is, for this day and age and with respect to the 
goals of our production, considerably better than the one he prepared himself. 
After all, he anticipated that it would never be staged at all.
