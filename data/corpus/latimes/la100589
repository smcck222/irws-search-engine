CITY WILL PAY $9 MILLION IN FLOODING SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego, settling another liability case that will further strain 
city finances, Wednesday agreed to pay $9 million to 17 families whose homes 
were flooded by rainwater that poured out of a city catch basin during a severe 
storm last year. 
</P>
<P>
The out-of-court settlement, reached in a conference before Superior Court 
Judge Judith McConnell, calls for the city to pay the 62 plaintiffs within 60 
days. The timetable will prompt budget juggling because the city fund 
designated for lawsuit payoffs, which started the fiscal year July 1 with $12 
million, now contains only about $4 million, City Manager John Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's $9 million out of city funds, and that means other things are going to 
have to be deferred," Lockwood said. He said he will propose budget amendments, 
including the possibility of deferring capital improvement projects in next 
year's budget, to the San Diego City Council at its Oct. 16 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We've Got No Choice' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real problem," said Councilman Bob Filner, who represents the area. 
"We're going to have to postpone some projects to do it. Nobody wants to, but 
we've got no choice." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement comes just two weeks after the city agreed to a record 
$9.5-million payment to a woman who left brain damaged and quadriplegic after 
her car was struck by a speeding police cruiser on New Year's Day, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of that judgment, the city arranged to pay $6.3 million 
during fiscal 1991, giving financial staffers the ability to budget that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wednesday's settlement, the city will purchase 15 flood-damaged homes on 
Lauriston, Paxton and Elrose drives in south San Diego, valued at slightly more 
than $2 million, said Chief Deputy City Atty. Alan Sumption. The rest of the 
settlement is for personal property loss and emotional distress suffered by the 
plaintiffs -- 17 families and a corporation that had stored fabric in a garage 
at a home. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs will split the funds in an undisclosed arrangement, said Gary 
Elster, attorney for the plaintiffs. One more family not represented by Elster 
has a pending claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs "suffered very bad emotional distress," Elster said. "Their 
children had developed an intense fear of water. They were afraid every time it 
rained." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catch Basin Was a Parking Lot 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury last month ruled that the city was liable for the flood 
damage because it had leased the catch basin as a parking lot to a trucking 
company, Elster said. 
</P>
<P>
When a severe rainstorm hit on Feb. 2, 1988, water swept the trucks off the 
basin floor and truck parts clogged the basin drains and spillway, sending the 
overflow downhill toward the homes, Elster said. 
</P>
<P>
The city had contended that the storm was a freak occurrence that only happens 
every 200 to 500 years and claimed it should not be held responsible for a 
deluge it could not have guarded against. City attorneys did not, however, 
defend the city property department's decision to lease the huge basin as a 
parking lot to bring in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the liability phase of the trial, the city settled out of court 
rather than face a second jury that would have determined the penalty, Sumption 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's judgment is not the first against the city involving the area. In 
1983, some of the same families won a $1.4-million out-of-court settlement of a 
lawsuit that contended that construction upstream of the South San Diego 
Industrial Park contributed to flooding of their homes. The same claim was made 
in the current lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said he has repeatedly called for construction of flood controls 
throughout the neighborhood, a low-lying area along a creek. Filner predicted 
further flooding if the city does not make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do it, because otherwise we're going to have these big 
settlements every month," Filner said.

SOVIET DEFENSE CHIEF SCORES A GOOD-WILL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After viewing a daylong display of American power, pride and pageantry, Soviet 
Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov chatted with Marines, handed out enameled pins 
and joked with generals during his first visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on a good-will tour," the cordial and grandfatherly Yazov said 
Wednesday. "We have come to show the American people that we have sincere and 
friendly feelings towards the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
High-ranking U.S. and Soviet officials heralded Yazov's visit, touting it as 
glasnost trickling down to each nation's stronghold, the military forces. He is 
the highest ranking Soviet military official to visit California. 
</P>
<P>
After viewing North Island and shaking hands with F-14 Tomcat jet fighter 
crewmen, Yazov took a helicopter to an amphibious assault ship and then a 
Hovercraft to Red Beach at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Yazov had taken his seat on a bluff overlooking the sandy dunes, 
rubber boats and amphibious assault craft zipped through the water, depositing 
men on shore. Marines stormed the beach, and planes roared overhead, dropping 
simulated bombs. The ground shook, officials covered their ears, and the 
Marines surged forward, each toting about 70 pounds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
A watchful Soviet Adm. Vladimir Z. Khuzhokov, a member of Yazov's entourage, 
said, "It's good. Your boys are just like our boys. Just the same boys." 
</P>
<P>
Dust swirled, engines roared and yellow smoke bombs clouded the simulated 
combat area. An announcer, first in English and then in Russian, told the 
assembled dignitaries about the attributes of each craft. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the back, a row of Marines gathered. And, as the announcer described the 
capabilities of the CH-46 Sea Knight transport helicopter, one Marine pilot 
groaned. "Oh, no, don't tell the Russians about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For him and others, the new, friendly light cast upon the Soviet was 
unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
"Here come the Russians. I've been trained to hate Russians," said Rear Adm. 
John W. Adams. "It's kind of odd. Now, I'm welcoming them. It's an initiative 
that can do nothing but help the entire world. Ultimately, if it's successful, 
it would cost me my job -- I think that would be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Marines seemed pleased with the pat on the shoulder that Yazov gave 
as he walked down the line chatting with the men who had stormed the beach. 
Others showed off the Soviet enamel pin he'd placed in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he hoped we are the best for our service, like his men are for his," 
said Cpl. Robert Denully of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked about our camouflage and wished me success," said Lance Cpl. Robert 
Wargo of Waterbury, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
As the day wound down at Camp Pendleton, one Soviet military official turned to 
a flight crewman and wished him the best: "May you have the same number of 
takeoffs as you do landings." 
</P>
<P>
The equipment shown to the Soviet contingency violated no security 
restrictions. And officials and experts agreed that it was probably all 
hardware that the Soviet military already knew about. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ripening of Detente' 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly both sides know everything there is without visiting the sites," 
said Leon Aron, an expert on Soviet affairs studies with the Heritage 
Foundation in Washington. "But this is public diplomacy. We'll see more of 
these visits. The military is always the last to jump on the bandwagon of 
detente because they are the people responsible for the security of nations. 
The visits by military show the maturity in the ripening of detente." 
</P>
<P>
Talking about his Monday meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at the 
Pentagon, Yazov, through and interpreter, said, "We talked about . . . 
opportunities for contact. Those might be visits between warships. Those might 
be exchanges between scientists, air force elements, military bands and just 
exchanges between parties of soldiers and enlisted men." 
</P>
<P>
Yazov, who joined the Soviet Army in 1941, was first appointed Soviet defense 
chief in June, 1987. He replaced 75-year-old Marshal Sergei L. Sokolov, who was 
fired after a West German teen-ager flew a single-engine Cessna from Finland 
more than 400 miles over Soviet territory and landed in Moscow's Red Square, 
next to the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov's six-day trip to the United States reciprocates the August, 1988, visit 
to the Soviet Union by then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov is scheduled to travel to Phoenix today for a tour of Luke Air Force Base 
before continuing to North Carolina to see Ft. Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he will return to Washington, where he will host a reception before 
his departure that night.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RALLY LAUNCHES AIDS AWARENESS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles political leaders and activists have kicked off AIDS Awareness 
Month by calling on area residents to become better educated about the deadly 
disease and more supportive of those affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
"We must realize our best defense is education," Mayor Tom Bradley told about 
200 people at a rally at the Civic Center Mall on Monday. "We must call on the 
entire community to help us generate enthusiasm in fighting the lack of 
information, in fighting the tragedy of this disease." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Bennet, executive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, said he felt 
that he was "preaching to the saved here." 
</P>
<P>
"If we were educating, I feel the mall should be filled with 10,000 people and 
we should be storming buildings," he said. "I feel very frustrated. . . . I 
feel the people who need to be educated are not just in the high-risk 
population, but are elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Davis, program director of the National Organization of Black County 
Officials, said the norms and values of communities need to be changed for AIDS 
education to be effective.

RITES SCHEDULED FOR WRITER RUSSELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Wednesday for Hortense Lion Russell, 
a novelist and magazine writer, who died last Thursday of natural causes at 
Chateau La Jolla, a retirement home. She was 92. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, Russell moved from New York City to San Diego. Four years later she 
moved to La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Russell wrote articles for Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines, short stories 
and three novels: "Mill Stream," "Second Love" and "The Grass Grows Green," 
which was on the New York Times best seller list in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Institute of Continued Learning at UC San Diego, she often 
lectured on short stories. "She was a real optimist. She always said no matter 
how dark things were, they would always work out," said her son, Richard 
Russell. "Since she lived through two world wars and the Great Depression, she 
knew what she was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Russell is survived by her son, Richard of La Jolla; a daughter, Kate Bobker of 
New Rochelle, N.Y.; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's service will be at Richard Russell's home in La Jolla. Anyone 
wishing to attend may call 454-0481.

ARIAS SEES DEMOCRACY PREVAILING IN PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize 
for his successful sponsorship of a regional peace plan in Central America, 
predicted Wednesday that democracy will ultimately prevail in turbulent Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, the Panamanian government has to find a democratic path," 
Arias said during a visit to San Diego. "Otherwise, the instability will 
continue for many years in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Arias, in town to receive an award from the Institute of the Americas, a policy 
research group based at UC San Diego, told a news conference that he believes 
the days of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's rule in Panama are numbered. But he 
expressed his opposition to any military action against that regime, which 
Washington has denounced as criminal -- an allegation that has sparked 
countercharges of U.S. interference by Noriega and his allies. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never be in favor of military pressure," Arias said, clearly alluding 
to suggestions that the U.S. armed forces take a more active role in 
undermining Noriega's rule. 
</P>
<P>
His comments reflect a widespread fear in Latin America and elsewhere that 
direct U.S. military action in Panama could backfire, casting Noriega in the 
role of a victim of U.S. aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Arias came a day after an attempted military coup in Panama 
City collapsed, leaving Noriega in power. 
</P>
<P>
True democracy, Arias said, is the only antidote for the cycle of warfare and 
repression that grips much of Central America. He expressed considerable 
optimism about elections scheduled for February in Nicaragua -- elections that 
he assisted in bringing about -- but he acknowledged feeling "saddened" by the 
continuing violence in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peace With Democracy 
</P>
<P>
"There will never be peace if there is not democracy" in Central America, said 
the president of Costa Rica, which is often cited as a singular example of 
stability in a tumultuous region. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, who addressed the United Nations in New York on Tuesday, stopped in San 
Diego to receive the second Award for Democracy and Peace given out by the 
institute, which is officially nonpartisan and is funded through grants and 
contributions. In 1987, Raul Alfonsin, then president of Argentina, won the 
first award, for his contribution to the restoration of democracy and respect 
for human rights there.

DRIVE ON TO SAVE SMALL ANIMALS WHEN PONDS GO DRY

When Redondo Beach empties two park ponds as part of a reconstruction project, 
John Oliver will make sure that a large population of marine life doesn't go 
down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, Redondo Beach's city clerk, and about 40 other users of Hopkins 
Wilderness Park plan to save the ponds' critters by placing them in a large 
wading pool until workers have finished putting in new cement bottoms in the 
ponds. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of pulling the plug on them and killing them, we're going to save 
them," said Oliver, who is a member of the Friends of the Wilderness Park 
organization. "Our No. 1 concern is to save the animals. You hate to see 
anything like that die." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver was among scores of residents who were alarmed to learn that city 
officials had ordered 83 ducks and geese at Manhattan Beach's Polliwog Park 
killed Sept. 7 as workers were rebuilding the pond. 
</P>
<P>
The waterfowl had been removed from the pond in preparation for the 
improvements, and destroyed because city officials feared they carried disease. 
</P>
<P>
Crayfish, mosquito fish, frogs, turtles, salamanders and even fresh-water 
shrimp are believed to inhabit the two ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said they hope a company will donate a large wading pool or sell one for 
about $300. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be rigged up where we can keep people from terrorizing them," 
Oliver said of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-acre park at Knob Hill Avenue and Camino Real is valued by Redondo Beach 
officials for its camping and nature study facilities among trees, meadows, 
streams and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, which had used the site for the Nike missile 
radar-tracking system, gave Redondo Beach title to the area in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the city planted about 1,000 trees, including eucalyptus, sycamore, 
gumwood, pine, ash, elm and California redwood. 
</P>
<P>
Pumps were installed to feed water into two streams that flow into the ponds, 
which were built with a sand and porous clay bottom. Since then, mud has 
collected on the bottom and has blocked inlets. When the water is drained, the 
mud will be scraped out and workers will build concrete bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said the project, which was to have begun about two years ago, was 
delayed by budget problems. The animals were to have been transferred to 
another body of water. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans were scrapped when it was found that many of the animals might be 
carrying spores from duckweed, a lime-green plant that spreads across the water 
surface. But officials feared that the duckweed would be spread throughout 
another body of water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a Catch-22," Oliver said. "If you want to kill the weed, you have 
to kill the animal." 
</P>
<P>
So the organization has proposed putting the animals in the wading pool. 
</P>
<P>
On the park's largest pond, called Green Swamp, the duckweed has spread so much 
that signs were put up to warn visitors, especially children, not to try to 
walk in the water, said Bob Atkinson, the city's director of parks and 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
At Manhattan Beach's Polliwog Park, much of the marine life was lost recently 
when the city started work on a pond to improve its water quality. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real active community here," Oliver said. "It's too bad that they 
couldn't get something going on it."

MAN'S FAILURE TO APPEAR FOR SENTENCING IN SEX CASE ANGERS JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Normand, the man accused of sexual misconduct by two teen-age girls, 
raised a judge's ire Wednesday when he failed to show up for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Grimes, Normand's attorney, argued that, since his client pleaded no 
contest to only one misdemeanor count of having unlawful sex with a minor, he 
was not required to be present for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not anticipate I would be sentencing in absentia. I do not intend to do 
so," said Superior Court Judge Andrew G. Wagner, who appeared irritated by 
Normand's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner then issued a bench warrant for Normand, 37, but ordered it held when he 
rescheduled sentencing for Tuesday. The judge also revoked Normand's $50,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Normand's absence also angered Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain, who complained 
that "it appears that Mr. Normand is playing games again." McClain reminded the 
judge that the charges against Normand were originally filed as felonies, until 
both sides plea-bargained to a single misdemeanor count. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes argued that the law did not require Normand to appear for sentencing if 
he were convicted on a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing games. When he wants to show up, he shows up. When he doesn't 
want to show up, he doesn't," McClain said after the hearing. "He wants to go 
back and tell people that he is in control and doesn't have to come to court if 
he doesn't want to. He's wrong. The court has ultimate control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrest Warrant Issued 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was learned Wednesday that Ohio officials have issued an arrest 
warrant for Normand, a Canadian. Earlier this year, officials from the Ohio 
Department of Commerce said that Normand was under investigation for selling 
unregulated and unlicensed securities in Ohio. Normand is charged with bilking 
10 investors of at least $300,000 there. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego vice officers began investigating Normand in April, 1988, when they 
received complaints from parents and young women. Police investigators were 
told that Normand was recruiting young women to appear in a movie that he was 
supposedly producing. In an interview last year, Normand said the movie was 
going to be "a cross between a James Bond thriller and Raiders of the Lost 
Ark." 
</P>
<P>
However, in August, 1988, an 18-year-old San Carlos woman charged that Normand 
lied about the movie. The woman obtained a restraining order against Normand, 
and in court documents alleged that "he used lies and deception to have sex 
with me." However, no charges were brought against him in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, criminal charges were brought against Normand by a Michigan 
teen-ager who was 17 when Normand invited her to San Diego to appear in a 
movie. She told authorities that Normand also promised her modeling jobs. The 
young woman eventually moved in with Normand and had sex with him on numerous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The charge of unlawful sex with a minor was brought against Normand because the 
Michigan teen-ager was a minor at the time, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rhetorical Question' 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Judge Wagner asked "a rhetorical question" about the plea bargain 
worked out between prosecutors and Normand's attorney. "Am I not legally 
permitted to reject the plea bargain and make it a felony if I choose?" asked 
Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor McClain agreed with Wagner, but Grimes said that, if Wagner rejected 
the plea bargain, Normand would have to withdraw his plea to the misdemeanor 
count. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Wagner displayed a stack of papers he received from the 
Michigan woman and her father. Wagner informed both sides that he "read all of 
them," but did not say whether he will be influenced by them in sentencing 
Normand.

MINORITIES AND PRIVATIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column "Privatization Is a Blunt Weapon Against Minorities" by Henry McGee 
and Manuel Pastor (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 21) is obvious propaganda for those who 
see the government as the be-all and end-all of human existence. They see the 
"privatization" of public services as a threat to the ability of minority 
groups to hold well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
If we wish to see the most economical and efficient enterprises in this 
nation's economy, we must look to the private sector. Virtually any service 
currently provided by government agencies can be more efficiently and 
economically provided by competition in the free market. By free market I do 
not mean the granting of a monopoly franchise to one company, but true 
competition among any number of firms. 
</P>
<P>
Why should the government run garbage collection, or fire protection, or waste 
water treatment, or any of the dozens of departments they have created to boost 
the clout of politicians and bureaucrats? There are plenty of examples in this 
country and in others of successful private handling of these functions. 
</P>
<P>
McGee and Pastor appear to argue that the taxpayers should be soaked for any 
amount government bureaucrats seek to take from them, just so blacks and 
Latinos can have well-paying jobs. Are they implying that no one else will hire 
these people? If so, then are they qualified to do the jobs they are doing now? 
The authors seem to forget that many of the same jobs would exist with private 
companies. If the applicants with experience in public agencies are qualified, 
then they will be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the authors use the unfortunate example of a woman prisoner being 
raped by guards from a private extradition service. They obviously trust that 
guards employed by the state of California would never think of abusing 
prisoners in any way! Come on! Privatization does not mean abuse and 
inefficiency. Give us the free market for awhile and just see the change for 
the better.

ADDICTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Stanley Korenman's commentary (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 7) on drug addiction 
naively asserts that animal experiments hold the key to this difficult problem. 
The idea is that if we learn the biochemical basis for addiction and then 
develop medicines that block the craving for recreational drugs, addicts will 
forget the high they get from drugs. As a doctor who treats scores of addicts, 
I find that scenario all too simplistic. All the animal experiments Korenman's 
colleagues can devise will not change the fundamental social problem of drug 
abuse and addiction. Addicts whose cravings are attenuated by medications can 
easily stop taking them to once again experience the high and the 
anxiety-reducing effects of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that the medications used to treat alcoholism pale in 
comparison to the power of Alcoholics Anonymous. These are social problems 
which are not solved by simplistic chemical answers. Rather than spending 
millions on futile animal experiments, we should invest in making the 
treatments we have more widely available, the greatest of which are 
detoxification and social supports.

CHAOTIC INDIVIDUALISM OF CONGRESS IS NO PLACE FOR LAYING DOWN PARTY LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker teaches political science at Rutgers 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To hear some Democrats describe it, last week's vote on capital gains in the 
House was a kind of political Armageddon, with dabs of Thermopylae, Dunkirk and 
Gettysburg thrown in. It was seen as a weighing of souls and a time to sort out 
the true Democrats from the crypto-Republicans, Quislings and neo-Boll Weevils. 
Democratic National Chairman Ronald H. Brown referred portentously to the 
capital gains issue as "one we ought to have a line drawn in the sand about." 
</P>
<P>
But for all of this apocalyptic rhetoric, there is an eternal and underlying 
truth that the Democratic soothsayers missed: Congress is no place to argue 
over the fate of a political party or to winnow out renegades from true 
believers. Now, having painted the issue of capital gains in such dramatic 
colors, Democratic leaders have unnecessarily weakened their position by giving 
President Bush a more conspicuous victory than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Congress, that citadel of rampant individualism and the every-man-for-himself 
ethic, is just no place to hold referendums on party philosophy. You can debate 
them in closed party caucuses, but resorting to party-line votes to test 
partisan fidelity can blow up in leaders' faces. Recent victims have been 
Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It is worth recalling the darkest days for Democrats, back in the spring of 
1981, when Ronald Reagan, brandishing an electoral mandate, pressed Congress 
for massive budget and tax cuts. The prospects for such fiscal restructuring 
seemed problematic because the Democrats still controlled the House, even if by 
a diminished margin. Reagan was in good shape in the GOP-controlled Senate, but 
House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. was mustering his beleaguered troops 
for an epic struggle over issues that many saw as litmus tests of party 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
But the leadership for Reagan's major initiatives came from O'Neill's own 
ranks. The huge budget cut was authored by Texas Democrat Phil Gramm. The 
massive tax cuts in the House were co-sponsored by another Texas Democrat, Kent 
Hance. And a group of Sunbelt Democrats, known as the Boll Weevils, was the 
deciding factor in Reagan's victory on both issues in the House. 
</P>
<P>
The Boll Weevils defected to the Republicans for a variety of reasons. Some, 
like Gramm, were basically hostile to the liberal economic policies of the 
Carter Administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress. Most were 
simply responding to those voices that always have the greatest resonance for 
members of Congress, their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
So it was last week in the House, when 64 Democrats jumped ship to vote for a 
cut in the capital gains tax rate. Led by Democrat Ed Jenkins of Georgia, who 
engineered a revolt on the Ways and Means Committee against Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski, many Democrats -- and not all of them from the South and West -- 
hearkened more to the messages coming from the voters and interest groups in 
their congressional districts than to the partisan urgings of Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley and Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was cleverly crafted by the White House to peel off many Democrats by 
providing special side payments to their constituents. Democrats from 
timber-producing states were the first to succumb to the special preference 
given to the sale of lumber and pulp from their wood lots. Others from areas 
with high-tech companies were pulled from the Democratic herd with arguments 
that the tax cut would have salutary effects on venture capital. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the struggle, even Democrats who had been favored by their 
leadership with prestigious assignments had joined the defectors. One vignette 
that underscored the rift among top Democrats was Gephardt's trip to the 
Harriman Media Center on Capitol Hill to make a videotape denouncing the 
capital gains cut. The center is run by Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of 
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a tax-cut supporter. 
</P>
<P>
There will be cries among those Democrats who supported the leadership on 
capital-gains reduction for the scalps of those who voted with the Republicans, 
but little will come of it. There were similar calls in 1981, and the only 
Democrat to suffer punishment was Gramm, who was stripped of his seat on the 
powerful Budget Committee. Gramm promptly resigned, went back to Texas, ran as 
a Republican for his old seat and won. He now sits as a Republican senator from 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress, with its parochial pulls on members, is not the place for the 
great debates and showdowns over the soul of a party, where should such a grand 
catharsis occur? The most appropriate forum is the Democratic presidential 
primary and the general election that follows. Only presidential candidates can 
frame issues with sufficient breadth to avoid the special pleading and 
particularistic bargaining that takes place in Congress. New party leaders such 
as Foley and Gephardt lacked the visibility to take on the President, and they 
erred in making their fight on a turf dominated by parochial loyalties and 
special interests.

COLD SHOULDER FROM A BROTHER HURTS; 
</P>
<P>
FILIPINOS SEE US AS KIN, PART OF A VERY EXTENDED FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. STEINBERG, David J. Steinberg is president of Long Island 
University and author of The Philippines: A Singular and a Plural Place 
(Westview Press, 1982 and 1990). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ninety years ago the United States had conquered the Philippines and Rudyard 
Kipling urged us to "take up the White man's burden . . . . " But commentator 
Peter Finley Dunne's caustic pundit, Mr. Dooley, drolly observed, " 'Tis not 
more thin two months since ye larned whether they were islands or canned 
goods." Whether it was "the voice of God" that was intoning Manifest Destiny, 
or, in Richard Hofstadter's phrase, "the carnal larynx of Theodore Roosevelt," 
Americans embraced "benevolent assimilation" of the Philippines, forcing a 
highly articulate, mature nationalist movement to surrender its dream. The 
Filipinos were told by President William Howard Taft that henceforth they would 
be our "little brown brothers." 
</P>
<P>
After 50 years of colonial rule, followed by the Japanese invasion and the 
Bataan death march, Douglas MacArthur, Carlos Romulo, the Hukbalahap, Ramon 
Magsaysay, martial law and Imelda's shoes, we in the United States still have 
only a hazy sense of the Philippine archipelago and our "special relationship" 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
During the remarkable days of Ferdinand Marcos' fall from power, when Corazon 
Aquino and Cardinal Jaime Sin mobilized non-violent "people power," Americans 
briefly grew fascinated, turning history into a daily sitcom, a real-life 
version of the Passion Play with elements of "Macbeth" and "The Picture of 
Dorian Gray." Then our attention drifted away until, a few days ago, Ferdinand 
Marcos died, having lived far longer than anyone would have diagnosed possible. 
(Benigno Aquino returned to Manila -- and his assassination -- in 1983 because, 
he told me, he was sure Ferdinand Marcos was dying of kidney failure.) 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle was in Manila last week, urging that negotiations 
begin by December to resolve the fate of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval 
Base, which are home to about 40,000 American servicemen and women and their 
dependents. These bases, the largest maintained by the United States abroad, 
are the second-largest employer in the Philippines. While Quayle was in Manila, 
the Communist New Peoples Army killed two American military technicians, a 
gruesome reminder of an insurgency that flourished under Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
In a month, President Aquino will come to Washington on a state visit, an honor 
refused her by Ronald Reagan. George Bush, who foolishly toasted Marcos in 
1981, saying, "We love your adherence to democratic principles -- and to the 
democratic processes," will try to make amends to Aquino and her nation. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the Philippines, something we have never, as a nation, succeeded 
in doing, we must understand the centrality of kinship. It explains much, not 
only about how Philippine society itself functions, but also how Filipinos view 
their relationship to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Filipino knows far more about his extended family than does his American 
counterpart. There is no way that a Filipino child can ever repay his 
obligation to his parents. Extending beyond the family are bonds that tie an 
individual to others from the same town and province, linguistic group and 
geographic area. Classmates and fellow alumni are halfway to kin. The 
patron-client relationships that link a tenant to a landlord, a ward politician 
to a regional office holder, a local store owner to a distributor in Manila 
define the reciprocal obligations of social hierarchies, joining the 
personalism of a pre-industrial land with the modern network of 20th-Century 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever President Taft originally meant by "our little brown brothers," the 
Filipinos have embraced the fictive kinship implicit in the phrase, translating 
imperialism from its distant condescension into a domesticated context. America 
justified imperialism as altruism, bestowing education and other social 
benefits as a way of assuaging a lingering guilt over the initial imperial 
decision. From the earliest days of the American interregnum, the political 
question was when the "little" Filipinos would be mature enough in their 
democracy to achieve their own independence. 
</P>
<P>
It is the kinship bond that remains vitally important to them, if not to us. 
From the Filipinos' perspective, they are still our kin, even though they 
reached their own maturity decades ago. They love us and hate us, just as a kid 
brother reacts to the older sibling. The Filipinos are now the second largest 
Asian-American community in the United States; Philippine society continues to 
be attracted to anything stateside. 
</P>
<P>
But American society, which puts its parents into old-age homes, is 
uncomfortable with those emotional ties so vital to Filipinos. Even worse than 
when a big brother is angry at his young sibling is when he ignores him. That 
is what Americans have more or less done to the Filipinos for almost a century.

LENDERS MUST THINK 'GREEN' IN THIRD WORLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Third World scientists meeting in India early this year concluded that 
developing countries -- highly dependent on natural resources and ill-equipped 
to adapt to a rapidly changing climate -- will experience particular strain 
from warming driven by the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
Developing nations currently contribute about one-third of total greenhouse gas 
emissions. By the middle of the next century they will be releasing the 
preponderance of these gases, most importantly carbon dioxide (CO2). Ways must 
be found to help them moderate unnecessary growth in these emissions while 
simultaneously furthering larger development objectives. 
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse effect also adds considerably greater urgency to policies -- 
energy efficiency, forest conservation and elimination of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) -- that make sense for other economic and environmental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Development assistance from the World Bank could accomplish these goals. 
</P>
<P>
Energy is essential to economic development, and Third World countries must 
increase power-generating capacity to satisfy their needs. But fossil fuels are 
the primary source of CO2. There is a way out of this double bind. According to 
respected Third World energy specialists, by the year 2020 the world can 
achieve an acceptable standard of living without increasing global energy 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean limiting access to the energy services necessary for 
development. Rather, Brazil, India, Costa Rica and other developing countries 
can cut the need for growth in power-generating capacity by up to 30% or more 
through investment in state-of-the-art energy-saving industrial equipment, 
lighting systems, air conditioners and other appliances, realizing considerable 
monetary savings in the bargain. Regrettably, the bank -- the planet's biggest 
development assistance institution and the Third World's largest single source 
of foreign exchange for energy investments -- has devoted at most 4% of its 
energy and industrial-sector lending to these "end-use" energy efficiency 
improvements over the last decade. Economically viable technologies exist, and 
the World Bank should help deploy them. 
</P>
<P>
Although World Bank President Barber Conable pledged last week at the annual 
meetings of the bank and the International Monetary Fund to make Third World 
environmental problems a priority for the 1990s, the director of the bank's 
Industry and Energy Department has publicly expressed doubt that bank loans to 
improve end-use energy efficiency are even necessary. Another bank staffer said 
that he can count the number of staff with experience in end-use efficiency on 
one hand. "And I still have fingers left over!" he added. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical deforestation is the leading source of Third World greenhouse gas 
emissions, accounting for 10% to 30% of global CO2 emissions and 10% to 20% of 
methane emissions. If the trend continues, tropical forests could be wiped out 
during the next century. Through forest conservation and tree planting, 
developing countries could instead create a living repository for excess 
carbon. Studies have demonstrated that well-managed, intact forests have 
substantial economic as well as environmental value. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a World Bank draft greenhouse paper, which dismisses forests as 
"less important" than energy, devotes only a few sentences to this crucial 
issue. While the bank has paid lip service to the need for tropical-forest 
conservation, and Conable has pledged to triple lending in this area, the 
bank's forestry projects continue to generate substantial criticism. Logging 
and plantation projects designed with inadequate input from the affected people 
have been unresponsive to their needs and on occasion have triggered strenuous 
opposition from the local populace. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank can play a major role in disseminating substitutes for CFCs, 
which are responsible for 10% to 25% of the overall global warming threat. 
These chemicals, the principal culprits in depletion of the stratospheric ozone 
layer, will very likely be outlawed by international measures now under 
negotiation. But instead of emphasizing the necessity for the bank to seize 
leadership in helping developing countries accomplish this transition, the 
bank's draft greenhouse policy characterizes deployment of alternative 
chemicals as no more than an "insurance option" in which the bank will be 
relegated to at most a passive "monitoring role." 
</P>
<P>
This situation is symptomatic of the bank's continuing failure to integrate 
development goals with environmental imperatives. In June, the U.S. Agency for 
International Development published a list of $3 billion in environmentally 
questionable investments proposed for bank financing through 29 loans in 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Conable has now joined the growing club of world leaders calculatedly reaping 
substantial political benefits from disingenuous "greenspeak" -- talking a good 
line on the environment without closing the gap between rhetoric and policy. 
</P>
<P>
Business as usual puts the future of our planet at risk. There is no excuse for 
foot-dragging on the national and international level on the greenhouse issue 
by the industrialized world. But neither is there justification for 
half-hearted consideration by the World Bank of a wider variety of development 
alternatives that are in the interest of both developing nations and, for that 
matter, the entire world.

LOCAL SCHOOL CONTROL HOLDS PROMISE; CUTTING UP THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD M. BRITTON, Leonard M. Britton is superintendent of the Los Angeles 
schools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, suggestions are being made to reorganize the Los Angeles Unified 
School District or divide it into smaller districts. These proposals are made 
with the hope of improving the achievement of the district's students. 
Unfortunately, they offer no assurance of success. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to the district little more than two years ago, I have become well 
aware of periodic studies to determine if a different structure might be more 
effective, while still maintaining the benefits of the district as currently 
constituted. Time and again, the findings have indicated no overriding 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, change must be achieved to address the challenges and problems of 
low achievement and high dropout rates common to many districts of all sizes 
throughout the nation. Reform is possible without the disruption, expense and 
possible legal issues that would arise in dismantling the district. 
</P>
<P>
The current endeavor that I find particularly promising is the district's 
implementation of school-based management. This process will provide the 
benefits of local governance by educators, parents and the community while 
retaining the economies of scale that are a distinct advantage of the current 
structure of the district. Indeed, the size of the district came about not 
because of expansionist ambitions but because of the economic advantage to 
other smaller districts whose needs could best be met by annexing to the Los 
Angeles system. 
</P>
<P>
With school-based management, I am confident that each local community will be 
able to decide what is best for the students served in its schools. Critical to 
any such effort is the ability to attract and retain good teachers and the 
assurance of adequate financial resources. Neither of these factors stands to 
be improved by a breakup of the district. In fact, we currently are finding an 
unprecedented increase in well-qualified candidates for teaching positions. 
This bodes well for our future instructional efforts. 
</P>
<P>
As for any potential savings in salaries, it is simplistic to presume that a 
breakup of the district would result in a reduction in the number of 
administrators. Glance at the structure of any school district, regardless of 
size. Personnel must still be assigned to manage coordination of the 
instructional program, construction and maintenance of facilities, 
transportation, purchasing, insurance, collective bargaining and the other 
functions required by law. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, according to the latest statistics available from the Los Angeles 
County superintendent of schools, the Los Angeles school district spends a 
smaller percentage of its education expenditures on central administration than 
40 of the other 41 unified school districts in this county. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, however, is the consideration of what is at stake and whether 
there are advantages to breaking up the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
Our students excel in a variety of competitions on the local, state and 
national levels. Visits to our schools reveal the enthusiasm and optimism 
shared by so many of our students and staff. The size and diversity of the 
district allow for many educational opportunities that would no longer be 
possible if the district were broken up. And there would be no assurance of any 
improvement in achievement. Numerous programs to address students' unique needs 
are possible only because of the aggregate number of such students in this 
district.

<P>
Finally, it is tempting to infer circumstances and arrive at generalizations to 
support a proposal that may have no realistic connection with the problem or 
its solution. 
</P>
<P>
Local community support of school efforts -- in which parents are active 
participants -- will provide the most effective means of turning around the 
schools in need of improvement, encouraging those that are accomplishing their 
goals and achieving the success we know our young people are capable of 
attaining.

SUNSHINE DUMP OPERATOR ASKED FOR ALTERNATIVE EXPANSION PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY PLANNERS WANT TREES IN CANYON PROTECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the first public hearing for a proposal to expand the Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill, Los Angeles County planners asked the dump's owner Wednesday to come 
up with alternative plans to preserve a rare blend of trees in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Regional Planning Commission made no decision on the proposal by 
Browning-Ferris Industries to expand the existing 230-acre dump into 542 acres 
of unincorporated county territory north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But the preliminary recommendations Wednesday by the county's planning staff 
foreshadowed the possibility that BFI may not receive all of what it is seeking 
from the commission, despite the county's pressing shortage of dump space. 
</P>
<P>
To give the commission "a fuller range of alternative project options to 
consider," senior planner Richard Frazier asked BFI to explore landfill designs 
that would do less damage to a rare mix of oak trees, big-cone spruce and 
Douglas fir trees in the upper portion of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Trash Dumping 
</P>
<P>
Frazier asked for alternative designs that provide for less trash dumping. He 
also asked for BFI's response to a suggestion from a county advisory committee 
and the state Department of Fish and Game that the firm donate for park use a 
separate, undeveloped 524-acre canyon it owns west of the proposed expansion 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of oak, spruce and fir trees once dominated the San Gabriel 
Mountains, but fires, floods and development have left "very few" such blends 
in Los Angeles County canyons, said Michael Wilkinson, a deputy county 
forester. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier also asked BFI why it is proposing the dump expansion in county 
territory only, instead of starting with its unused land in the city of Los 
Angeles between the existing dump, which is in the city, and the county line. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they have an explanation for it, but I feel it ought to be on the 
record," Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
John C. (Chris) Funk, an attorney for BFI, told the commission he would respond 
in detail within a month. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Funk said the canyon's topography and drainage conditions make 
it necessary to start the expansion in the county. He said the firm eventually 
plans to apply for additional landfill space in city territory, but BFI has a 
staunch opponent there in Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Serious Look' 
</P>
<P>
Funk said BFI is "taking a very serious look" at the proposal that the firm be 
required to donate the 524-acre East Canyon, which contains much the same mix 
of trees as Sunshine Canyon, for park use. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunshine Canyon expansion involves removing an estimated 8,613 oaks, which 
Funk told the commission Wednesday is "clearly the most significant and 
important impact issue." 
</P>
<P>
BFI has promised to replace the trees with more than 17,000 new oaks, a program 
the state Department of Fish and Game has labeled "vague and inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
The North Valley Coalition, a Granada Hills residents' group opposed to the 
expansion, is urging rejection of the project so that Sunshine Canyon may be 
incorporated into a proposed state park. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition representatives and other members of the public are expected to 
testify Nov. 2, when the commission is scheduled to hold a second hearing at 4 
p.m. at John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying on Wednesday were BFI representatives and officials of several 
public agencies, including the county Sanitation Districts and the Los Angeles 
City Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen R. Maguin, head of the solid waste management department of the county 
Sanitation Districts, told the commission of the county's urgent need for 
landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunshine Canyon dispute is part of a regional controversy over landfills. 
Bernson, who represents the residents of Granada Hills, favors the use of 
Elsmere Canyon to the north as a dump. But Santa Clarita Valley residents 
oppose the Elsmere Canyon proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Elsmere Canyon is among six new landfill sites the county Sanitation Districts 
is reviewing, with the view that the only long-term solution to the trash 
crisis is "substantial new landfill capacity," Maguin said. 
</P>
<P>
Maguin told the commission that the county is expected to run out of landfill 
space in 1991. Even if Sunshine Canyon and other existing landfills are 
expanded, and even if recycling, composting and trash recovery programs are 
implemented to the fullest, dump space will be exhausted by 1995, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Parker Jr., a Los Angeles city zoning administrator, testified that 
even if the county approves BFI's landfill expansion, the firm would need a 
city zoning variance to use the dump's access road across city territory. 
</P>
<P>
Funk disagreed, saying the city would not have the power to thwart a land use 
approved in county territory. He doubted that the access road issue would be an 
obstacle if the county approves the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly think the city of Los Angeles would take a forthright attitude 
toward granting us a variance," Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernson said in an interview Wednesday he would "absolutely oppose" such a 
variance. Earlier this year, the City Council allowed BFI to continue operating 
the existing Sunshine Canyon Landfill until the end of this year, despite 
several zoning violations found by Parker after an investigation was initiated 
by Bernson.

CARD CLUB OWNERS GIVE HIGH PRAISE TO COURT'S LOW BALL POKER RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court ruling that prohibits the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department from enforcing a proposed ban on low ball jackpot poker is a total 
victory for club owners, an attorney for two card clubs said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to come down on us after eight years (of offering the game), 
without us having our day in court," said Alexander Pope, an attorney for the 
Bell Gardens Bicycle Club and the California Commerce Club in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In low ball jackpot, a form of draw poker, the one with the numerically 
second-lowest hand wins. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary injunction, issued Monday by Judge Miriam A. Vogel, prohibits 
sheriff's deputies from enforcing a ban proposed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp. In an opinion issued in August, the attorney general's office said 
jackpot poker is a form of illegal lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club and the Commerce Club joined owners of two card clubs in 
Gardena, the Normandie Casino and the Eldorado Club, in seeking an injunction 
to block the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling will allow the clubs to continue to offer the poker game while 
they go to trial to defend it, card club attorneys said. Proponents contend it 
is a legal form of draw poker, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Likely 
</P>
<P>
Mike Broderick, manager of the state Gaming Registration Program in Sacramento, 
said the state would probably appeal Vogel's ruling, which applies only to card 
clubs in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Another hearing was scheduled for Oct. 30 to determine whether other variations 
of jackpot poker, including seven-card stud and Texas hold 'em, should be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
At the Normandie Casino in Gardena, spokesman Blaine Nicholson said all forms 
of jackpot poker were still being offered -- at least until the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to play the games until Nov. 1," Nicholson said. After that, 
he said, depending on the judge's decision on whether seven-card stud and Texas 
hold 'em should also be included, "we will continue to play until such time as 
it goes to trial." 
</P>
<P>
Jackpot poker is illegal, according to Van de Kamp's opinion, because it meets 
the three elements of the state's definition of a lottery: It involves a prize, 
chance predominates over skill, and players must pay to play. 
</P>
<P>
Card club owners, however, contend that the game is merely a variation of poker 
and, like other forms of the game, is legal under state law. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office defines jackpot poker as any form of poker where 
players contribute to a second pot, separate from the pot played for each hand. 
The second pot grows over a period of days or weeks, club owners said. Jackpots 
average from $6,000 to $10,000, but can grow to $30,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
The player holding a low ball jackpot hand wins only when another player holds 
a winning hand that adds up to a lower sum. The lowest possible hand, called a 
"wheel" and also known as a straight, occurs when a player holds an ace, 2, 3, 
4 and 5. The second-lowest, called a "six-four" or "sixty-four," occurs when a 
player holds an ace, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The cards need not be of the same suit. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel, in issuing the ruling, questioned whether a second pot changed the legal 
game of low ball poker to an illegal form of lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the existence of a second pot and the fact that there's a second 
chance of winning changes the game to a lottery," Vogel said. Despite the 
second pot, she said, a player "still has to know which cards to discard, when 
to stand pat, when to draw. . . . It's not just dumb luck; it's not like 
drawing a lottery ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said no law has been passed to ban the game. Instead, the state attorney 
general found it illegal by interpreting an 1872 statute, she said, and he 
would be responsible for enforcing it through the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, which is under his jurisdiction. There is no case law on whether 
jackpot poker is a lottery, she said, and the issue deserves to be decided in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Roy Preminger argued that, although knowledge of rules is 
required to play jackpot poker, chance is the decisive factor in winning the 
jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"You can exercise all kinds of skill," Preminger said, "but no matter how 
skillful a player you are, you can't control the cards in another player's 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When to Hold or Fold 
</P>
<P>
In regular poker, Preminger said, a skillful player can win, even with a bad 
hand, by knowing how to bet, when to draw and when to bluff. But the goal in 
low ball jackpot poker of trying to get the second-lowest hand at the same time 
another player has the lowest hand changes the game, he said, by adding an 
element of chance over which players have no control. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes a lottery," Preminger said. "Chance." 
</P>
<P>
But Vogel sided with card club owners, saying the game has been allowed for at 
least eight years in Los Angeles County and longer across the state. "It's hard 
for a judge to see the merits of changing it now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens City Atty. Peter Wallen attended the hearing on behalf of Bell 
Gardens, which is one of several cities sponsoring a bill to overhaul the 
section of the state penal code dealing with gambling. The section, first 
enacted in 1872, defines forms of gambling allowed under state law. Critics say 
the law is hopelessly outdated, thus forcing law enforcement officials to make 
a judgment about which new games are legal. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation would name those games that are permitted and those 
that are outlawed. It would also deal with a host of Asian card and tile games, 
whose legality has caused disputes between police and card clubs. Jackpot poker 
would be prohibited, Wallen said. The bill, introduced by Sen. Robert Beverly 
(R-Manhattan Beach), is scheduled for consideration in 1990, Wallen said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the attorney general's office sent cease-and-desist letters to 
335 card clubs statewide, advising them of the attorney general's opinion and 
giving club operators until Nov. 1 to halt jackpot poker. The ban is still 
scheduled to go into effect for card clubs outside Los Angeles County, said 
Broderick of the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned," Broderick said Tuesday, "the letters have been sent 
out. Those letters still stand until there's a change in policy by this 
department."

EMOTIONAL HEARING ENDS IN PRISON TERM FOR DRUNK DRIVER WHO KILLED GIRL, 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In a hearing that a prosecutor characterized as the most emotional he had ever 
seen, a 62-year-old Sepulveda man was sentenced Wednesday to two years in 
prison for striking and killing an 8-year-old girl while driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother, Claudia Morales, gave defendant Thomas Michael Murray a 
Bible before he was sentenced for killing Jessica Morales on July 25 in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the most emotionally draining hearings I've ever been at because 
the loss was so great -- an 8-year-old daughter -- and yet the victim's parents 
were such compassionate people," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver, who 
prosecuted the case. "And the defendant was not a horrible or a bad person but 
a man with a serious drinking problem who acted incredibly irresponsibly." 
</P>
<P>
Murray was driving east on Victory Boulevard when he swerved his vehicle across 
three lanes of traffic, drove onto the sidewalk and struck the girl. She was 
thrown about 60 feet and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting to talk through tears, Claudia Morales of North Hollywood told Murray 
that she does not hate him for killing her daughter. But she said she hoped 
that he would be punished because he had caused herself and her family so much 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who according to a probation report has not held a steady job in 
several years, pleaded guilty before his preliminary hearing Aug. 18 to one 
count of vehicular manslaughter in the death. No special sentencing favors were 
promised in exchange for the plea, Dver said. 
</P>
<P>
Dver characterized Murray as "extremely remorseful about what he had done." The 
probation report quoted Murray as saying he feels intense guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's attorney, Robert Crider, asked the court to give Murray probation and 
sentence him to an alcohol treatment program. But Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Kathryne A. Stoltz said she believed that the seriousness of the crime mandated 
a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who has two prior drunk-driving convictions in another state, could 
have received a maximum sentence of four years in prison, but Stoltz said she 
balanced aggravating and mitigating factors in determining the sentence. The 
aggravating factors were the two earlier convictions and that Murray was 
driving without a license and was an alcoholic. Mitigating factors were 
Murray's remorse, his age and the lack of a criminal record other than the two 
drunk-driving convictions.

CAR VANDAL HITS, RUNS TO ENFORCE PARKING RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of a Simi Valley residential complex who do not strictly conform to 
the parking regulations of their planned development have been finding their 
cars vandalized, apparently by a townhouse vigilante with a relish for rules 
who issues written warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is supposed to be nice and pretty. Now there's tires being 
slashed," said Debbie LaScala, 31, whose Ford Fiesta was splattered with an 
acid-like liquid, as were the cars of her parents and brother. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley police say similar acts of vandalism within the Oak Tree townhouse 
development have been occurring since at least March 7, the date of the 
earliest reported incident. Some drivers have been victimized more than once. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Note 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, residents said they found warning notes taped to their doors and 
mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Simi Valley Police Sgt. Kenneth Tacke, chief of detectives, the 
notes read: 
</P>
<P>
"If your vehicle is seen parked outside your garage for any unreasonable length 
of time, your vehicle will be added to the hit list." 
</P>
<P>
LaScala said the note also boasted of an ability to "slash four tires within 25 
seconds, day or night, and I will do it." 
</P>
<P>
Tacke, who said similar notes have appeared in some earlier cases, said police 
have 16 reports of car vandalism involving an estimated $12,000 in damages. 
LaScala claimed that the damage has been greater, that as many as 80% of the 
cars in the 95-unit complex have been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Police are centering their investigation on the development of detached 
two-story houses, which are virtually identical and connected by small gardens. 
The development lies off the 5400 block of Cochran Street near the Simi Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems apparent at this point that the suspect is probably someone who lives 
in the complex. At least, that's the tone of the notes that have been 
received," Tacke said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been some finger-pointing, but until we confirm it one way or the 
other, I don't want to release any names." 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism came up at the Aug. 31 meeting of the Oak Tree homeowners 
association and is expected to be raised again at the Oct. 16 meeting. But the 
development's management company, Dahl Davis Inc. of Westlake Village, has 
advised the board of directors to leave the matter to police, association 
manager Janice Needham said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the development's regulations, aimed at preventing cars from being 
blocked in place, residents are required to park in their two-car garages and 
avoid using the shared lots reserved mainly for visitors. One vehicle per 
residence may park in the guest lots, if it is driven off the site on a daily 
basis. Also, residents may not park outside their garages -- most of which open 
directly onto the courtyard-like, shared parking lots -- unless they live in 
one of the few houses with a driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree resident Brian Lipe has so far avoided vandalism and generally parks 
both his car and his wife's in their garage. But he confessed that he sometimes 
leaves one of the cars out of the garage when he takes his motorcycle for a 
spin. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody cooperates, it's OK," he said, and if someone is blocked in "you 
can go ask your neighbor to move his car." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lipe said the vandalism attacks concern him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary that someone would decide to take matters like this into their own 
hands," he said. "It's just not what America's about. I think the guy should go 
live in a cave."

11 SDG&amp;E WORKERS ARE QUESTIONED AFTER YEARLONG DRUG PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven employees of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric were questioned Wednesday by 
company officials after a yearlong undercover investigation into the use and 
sale of illegal drugs, SDG&amp;E announced. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the investigation, carried out by a local security firm, 
centered on four regular employees and seven temporary employees who work in 
the customer information center on Ash Street. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Dave Smith said the investigation was carried out with the knowledge 
and backing of the San Diego Police Department, although no local police 
participated. Smith said the employees under surveillance work primarily on the 
telephone and don't come in contact with natural gas or "sensitive" equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"They have little face-to-face contact with the public," Smith said. "If you're 
moving, or leaving town, or terminating your service, they are some of the 
people you might talk to on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Firm's Probe 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the 11 were investigated by Narcorp, a local security firm that 
specializes in undercover surveillance for corporations that suspect employees 
of drug use. Narcorp officials were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Narcorp gathered material for a year, "developing evidence that 
could lead to the firing or even the arrest of one or more employees." The 
company will evaluate its findings in tandem with local police to determine "a 
course of action." 
</P>
<P>
Officials would not specify what drugs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
"What these people say on the phone can affect the health and well-being of 
customers," Smith said. "Some of our customers are on life-support systems. You 
wouldn't want somebody like that to have their service cut off by an employee 
who might be high on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're an employee -- say, a worker on the line -- and you know drug abuse 
is tolerated by the company, that sends a message we don't want to send. It's a 
tone as much as anything we'd like to establish: We will not tolerate drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the company was "not on shaky legal ground" in investigating 
employees undercover. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attorneys are fully aware of everything's that happened," he said.

COUNCIL CURBS APARTMENTS ON SAN PEDRO'S PACIFIC AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two years after San Pedro residents first expressed concern about 
apartment development along Pacific Avenue, the Los Angeles City Council has 
enacted an ordinance intended to curb such growth and promote commercial 
revitalization along a 26-block stretch of the street. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Avenue interim control ordinance, adopted Wednesday by a 12-0 vote, 
is a temporary measure that will place restrictions on development for the next 
year, while city planners draft permanent controls. It is retroactive to April 
20, the date it was adopted by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, developers will be permitted to build only one apartment 
unit per 1,000 square feet of lot space, a much stiffer restriction than the 
current rule of one unit per 400 square feet of lot space. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mario Juravich, aide to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores, that provision will reduce the potential residential density of Pacific 
Avenue by 60%. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance requires landscaping and setbacks, and it attempts to ensure 
architectural diversity by mandating that the front wall of new buildings be 
composed of more than one plane. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill Lusby, a San Pedro architect who served on a task force that helped 
draft the interim controls: "I think it's going to help quite a bit. . . . If 
(developers) want to go ahead with residential, at least they'll have to go and 
design it rather than put up any old thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encouraging Mixed Uses 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the temporary law bans residential uses on the first floor of 
buildings between Oliver and 13th streets and between 21st and 23rd streets, a 
provision that is intended to encourage commercial growth while permitting 
residential development. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Pacific Avenue was the main commercial thoroughfare in San Pedro. 
But as many businesses moved out to Western Avenue, Pacific Avenue declined. By 
1987, with the cost of land in San Pedro skyrocketing, developers discovered it 
was profitable to build apartments in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But residents, as well as Flores, were disturbed by the high density of the 
developments, which were allowed under Pacific Avenue's commercial zoning. In 
addition, the councilwoman did not like the building trend, with its boxy 
design and lack of landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, Flores introduced a motion recommending 15-foot setbacks for 
all residential developments on Pacific Avenue, from Oliver Street to Hamilton 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
That measure was never enacted, but the councilwoman did appoint a citizens 
task force to study development along Pacific Avenue. The task force came up 
with its recommendations in June, 1988, but it was not until April of this year 
that the Planning Commission approved its proposed interim control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Juravich said that, after the Planning Commission action, the measure became 
tied up in the city attorney's office, as lawyers drafted the precise language 
of the law.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING CURBS OKD FOR PANORAMA CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Development in central Panorama City will be restricted for at least a year 
following Los Angeles City Council approval Wednesday of an ordinance aimed at 
preventing oversized office buildings and residences. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary ordinance limits the height of buildings to six stories and calls 
for extra review of proposals for buildings that mix residential and commercial 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Councilman Ernani Bernardi, the ordinance will give the city 
Planning Department time to prepare a permanent version. It includes a 
provision for two 180-day extensions. 
</P>
<P>
The area included in the ordinance is bounded by Parthenia Street, Willis and 
Lennox avenues, and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi asked planners to draft the ordinance after discovering that some of 
the central area was zoned for buildings as tall as 30 stories or more, 
following a city-center concept that caught on in Woodland Hills but not in 
Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to build mixed residential and commercial buildings also seemed out 
of place in central Panorama City, Bernardi said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESEDA BOY, 15, DIED IN CRASH OF CAR HE STOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The victim of a fatal car accident in Calabasas Tuesday was a 15-year-old boy 
who had stolen the car from a Reseda residence a short time earlier, the 
California Highway Patrol said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Reseda youth was killed Tuesday on the Ventura Freeway when the stolen 
Peugeot he was driving struck a freeway center divider and flipped several 
times, striking two other vehicles, authorities said. He was thrown from the 
car, which crushed him as it flipped, Sgt. Daniel Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no other injuries, Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy stole the car after its owner left the vehicle outside his house 
Tuesday afternoon, Officer Rick Carter said. The owner attempted to chase the 
car on a bicycle the boy had been riding before he stole the car, Carter said.

TORRANCE REJECTS GATED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer's plan to create a privately gated, 19-unit town home community in 
the shadow of the San Diego Freeway was narrowly rejected Tuesday by the 
Torrance City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Citing traffic concerns and excessive noise from the freeway, which lies about 
55 feet from the 2.43-acre Yukon Street site, City Council Members Tim Mock, 
Mark Wirth and Dee Hardison and Mayor Katy Geissert said the ISCO Industries 
plan would not be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said they would prefer to see an office building at the 
site, which is zoned "residential professional," a rare zoning designation that 
allows houses, apartments, condominiums or professional offices but requires 
city review of any construction. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the intersection of Yukon and 182nd Street is already too 
crowded.

$90,000 GRANT ADDED FOR LANDSLIDE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes will receive an additional $90,000 in federal funds to 
expand a study intended to find ways to stabilize the coastline at the toe of 
the Portuguese Bend landslide. City officials said the money is being included 
in the 1989-90 federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Abbott, a city public works consultant who is in charge of the 
landslide project, said the $90,000 will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers 
specifically to study of the effect of the landslide on marine life. 
</P>
<P>
The corps is in the midst of a $250,000 study of four landslides that have hit 
Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills. Begun a year ago, it focuses on what 
causes the slides and how stopping shoreline erosion might affect them. Later 
phases of the study may include devising a plan to protect the coastline.

CHEAPER LAND, COSTS LURE BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being in Monterey Park for 20 years, Robert Cope's computer services 
business was bursting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Auto-Graphics' cramped quarters in the 700 block of Monterey Pass Road was half 
the space that the $10-million-a-year business needed, Cope said, and, besides, 
it was too far away from Ontario International Airport, which he preferred over 
Los Angeles International to ship products. 
</P>
<P>
The move east to a business park in Pomona was "110% positive," Cope said, 
especially because it meant half as long a commute, against traffic, for his 
150 employees, most of whom live in the eastern San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For Philip Vaughan, a manufacturer of drafting equipment, available, cheap 
property lured him to San Dimas from Pasadena, where there is almost no vacant 
industrial land and where construction costs are among the highest in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way you can go if you have to move," he said. "There's no 
contest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bargain Rates 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the east San Gabriel Valley is becoming a mecca for businesses 
suffocated by the squeeze of development on the west. To some, moving to the 
east means bargain rates for large tracts of industrial and office space. To 
others, it simply means following upscale residential growth that's taking 
place in the bedroom communities of Walnut, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, 
Rowland Heights and Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments predicts that by the year 2010, 
the number of jobs and people in the east valley, from the San Gabriel River 
Freeway east to the Los Angeles County line, will have grown more than twice as 
much over 25 years than in the west valley. 
</P>
<P>
According to a SCAG forecast to be released this month, areas likely to witness 
the most development are San Dimas, where SCAG predicts that the population 
will grow 103% between 1984 and 2010 and where 55% more jobs will be created in 
the same time period; La Verne, where the population and employment will 
increase by 79% and 39%, respectively, and Walnut, where the population will 
grow 250% and jobs 32%. People are already inching their way eastward. Between 
1980 and 1988, population in the east valley grew almost twice as fast when 
compared to the west; in the east, it climbed from 688,055 to 825,900, a 20% 
increase, while in the west it grew 11.5%, according to figures from the Los 
Angeles County Department of Regional Planning. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Center, a senior marketing consultant at the financial consulting firm 
Grubb &amp; Ellis, said that as land in Pasadena, Monterey Park and Alhambra 
becomes more scarce, the area east of the San Gabriel River Freeway will become 
the focal point of business activity in the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hub of the Wheel' 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel River and Pomona freeways "are like the hub of the wheel, with 
downtown as the west rim and Ontario being the east rim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Griffin, an industrial broker specializing in sales transactions west of 
the Orange Freeway for Coldwell Banker, said eastward drift is "a natural 
course of business. Since there is a limited industrial base west of the 605 
Freeway, most new developments are in Walnut, San Dimas, Glendora. In essence 
there's a greater selection in the east San Gabriel Valley because it's the 
most recent area to be developed." 
</P>
<P>
There are those on the west who insist that it's not a mass exodus, and the 
trickle isn't anything to be alarmed about. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to leave Pasadena," said Bruce Ackerman, executive vice president 
of Pasadena's Chamber of Commerce. "It's not a burning desire to get out of 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Although traditional industrial users may be moving east, "there's no reason 
for the commercial to go out east," said Alhambra Redevelopment Agency 
Executive Director Michael Martin, arguing that successful businesses that can 
afford the higher land prices tend to stay in the west. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Willing to Spend' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the advantages of being in an urbanized area is that most retailers 
looking for quality commercial space like it here because people here are 
willing to spend money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin added that an eastward drift of industrial companies hasn't hurt 
Alhambra's economy because for every business that moves from Alhambra to 
Glendora, there's another moving from downtown Los Angeles to Alhambra, which 
is still relatively inexpensive compared with downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the trend worries cities that are losing the businesses. In 
Pasadena, for example, officials feared that auto dealers, one of the largest 
generators of sales tax revenue, would be lured eastward to Duarte, Monrovia 
and Glendora, which boast shiny new auto malls close to the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
To entice dealers to stay on Colorado Boulevard, the Pasadena Board of 
Directors is offering sales tax rebates of up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope that the incentive will reverse a steady decline in sales 
tax revenue from auto dealers at the same time that the total sales tax revenue 
has gone up. Auto sales tax revenue in Pasadena slipped from $3.03 million in 
fiscal 1986-87 to $2.81 million in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generous Support 
</P>
<P>
In the east, cities are providing their own strong incentives. San Dimas' 
Redevelopment Agency has given generous financial support to businesses moving 
to the city. Recent help included issuing tens of millions of dollars in bonds 
for the construction and acquisition of buildings for an engineering firm and 
the Bushnell Division of Bausch &amp; Lomb, the nation's leading manufacturer 
of sports optics. 
</P>
<P>
The upper-middle-class bedroom community of Walnut, although zoned 95% 
residential, is trying to attract businesses to match its burgeoning 
population, which more than doubled between 1980 and 1988. The City Council 
recently created an ad-hoc economic development committee to study ways to 
strengthen the city's commercial base. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora has been slower to attract residents; its population increased by 
22.8% in the same period. But City Manager Arthur Cook said that after a brief 
spurt of growth during the 1960s, followed by a prolonged lull, "the second 
wave of it is coming now, especially with the population growth in the east 
valley. Retail is following that growth." 
</P>
<P>
With construction under way of an auto mall on Allen Avenue for which seven 
dealers have signed contracts, the city anticipates annual sales tax revenues 
to skyrocket $2 million once all nine spaces are filled. 
</P>
<P>
That promise of growth has already brought corporations from Pasadena and El 
Monte to Glendora in search of economic opportunities, Cook said. Caltrol, an 
El Monte-based manufacturer of control devices, is moving its entire operation 
to Glendora, where commercial land, at $15 to $18 a square foot, is half what 
it would be on the west, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Market Is Here' 
</P>
<P>
"The land is cheaper, the rent is cheaper, the market is here, the purchasing 
power is in this area," Cook said. "The economic level of Glendora is higher 
than other areas, but commercial land isn't as expensive as other areas that 
are fully developed." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some in the east say the eastward drift is blowing right 
past them into San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
While Pomona has found a niche in the marketplace for small manufacturing 
facilities of less than 25,000 square feet, larger developers have passed it 
over when looking for places to set up heavy industrial firms, known as "big 
boxes." Retail development is similarly scarce, so that Pomona residents 
typically drive across the county line into Ontario and Montclair to shop for 
clothing and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"Those stores don't exist here," said Ray Bragg, interim operations manager for 
Pomona's Redevelopment Department. "The downtown Pomona area wasn't able to 
keep up with other communities. The buying public goes for the new and the 
flashy. When Montclair Plaza was built, we sort of lost out to the glitz and 
the flash." 
</P>
<P>
But Pomona, too, is trying to fill the gap in its economic base with more 
retail outlets. Through the efforts of the Redevelopment Agency and the Pomona 
Economic Development Corp., West Holt Avenue is being transformed from a 
run-down, underdeveloped stretch of land into a revitalized light-industrial 
center. Commercial retail centers are sprouting up too, but are mostly 
concentrated near the higher-scale residential areas of Phillips Ranch and 
Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the trickle eastward can best be explained by a combination of factors. 
First of all, houses are popping up fast in the east, whether it's in Walnut 
and Diamond Bar, where the average house costs $300,000, or in Fontana and 
Ontario, where houses are more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobs Follow Housing 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, jobs are following the housing tract boom. Although it's San 
Bernardino County that's witnessing the most rapid growth in the nation, 
according to a recent U. S. Census Bureau report on metropolitan growth, east 
valley businesses are drawing on the neighboring county's expanding employee 
base, according to Center of Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, there's a dearth of higher-skilled jobs in the Inland Empire, 
and mid-income-level residents in the Inland Empire are finding more employment 
in the east San Gabriel Valley's more diversified economy. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices and office rental rates may not be as cheap as in the Inland 
Empire, yet are still considerably lower than anything to the west. And the 
area east of the San Gabriel River Freeway is a safe distance from gridlock on 
the Foothill and Ventura freeways, yet isn't too far away for businesses that 
need access to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Randy Hoffman, former president of Bushnell, was able to sell his 
old building in Pasadena for $22 a square foot and buy space in a San Dimas 
business park for $8 a square foot. On top of that, the city's Redevelopment 
Agency issued $5 million to $6 million in bonds to finance the purchase. 
Hoffman originally wanted to stay in Pasadena, but there wasn't any room along 
Foothill Boulevard to expand and the city couldn't find another site that 
permitted 18-wheel trucks easy access to a distribution facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Good Deal' 
</P>
<P>
So Hoffman decided to move east. "We got a real good deal," he said, adding 
that he would have saved even more money if he went farther east into San 
Bernardino County but would have lost too many of his employees, most of whom 
live in San Dimas, Glendora and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to be out in the middle of nowhere," he said. "We drew a circle 
and said we'd stay somewhere within a 10-mile radius. It was a balance between 
costs and services. We wanted to be within a few minutes of restaurants and had 
to be able to draw on local vendors and printing shops, office supply places 
and banks." 
</P>
<P>
Although the move wasn't a great financial loss to Pasadena -- Bushnell handles 
only a limited volume of retail sales -- it underscored a dilemma facing cities 
on the west that have almost reached the saturation point in development, yet 
aren't able to retain rapidly growing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine percent of the developable land in Pasadena and San Gabriel is used 
up. Ninety-seven percent of West Covina is built on. And only 4% of Monterey 
Park and 2% of Alhambra is undeveloped. In contrast, Pomona is 10% vacant, 
Walnut is 21% vacant and in San Bernardino County, Rancho Cucamonga and Ontario 
are 39% and 26% vacant, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of land in Pasadena is exacerbated by a growth-control ordinance 
limiting future commercial development in the city to a total of 250,000 square 
feet a year for projects of more than 25,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees Higher 
</P>
<P>
In addition, building permit fees in Pasadena are substantially higher than 
neighboring cities for all types of projects. In Monterey Park and San Gabriel, 
temporary building moratoriums have put a hold on residential projects, which 
city officials acknowledge may indirectly slow commercial growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we're concerned when businesses leave Pasadena, especially 
businesses that generate substantial sales tax revenue or provide employment 
opportunities, that are out migrating to areas in the immediate region," said 
Bill Reynolds, Pasadena's director of development. "But when a city's as fully 
developed as Pasadena, we don't have the luxury of having cheap land that is 
readily available and vacant to offer."

MORNING BRIEFING: WITH HELP FROM FRIENDS, HE HITS JACKPOT, BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Pringle had the winning numbers Saturday, including the one on the back of 
his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's 213 all-purpose yards in Cal State Fullerton's 34-20 victory over 
Nevada Las Vegas returned him to the national lead in all-purpose running, even 
though his game average dropped five yards to 234.8. 
</P>
<P>
But his numbers really came up later on, in the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said he bought two Lotto 6/49 tickets after the game, and picked the 
same two sets of numbers he does every Wednesday and Saturday. Five of six came 
up on one ticket, and Pringle won $3,616. Three came up on the other ticket, 
and he won $5 more. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's $3,616 numbers: 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The jersey number of Washington State receiver Tim Stallworth, a friend of 
Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
15 -- Chosen in memory of his best friend's brother, Tracy Anderson, who died 
last year. Anderson wore number 51 as a Cal State Northridge player. Since 
there is no 51 on lottery cards, Pringle simply transposed the digits. 
</P>
<P>
27 -- This one is simple. "Me," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
28 -- The number worn by Chris Richards, a friend of Pringle who played at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
31 -- The number of Washington State running back Steve Broussard, another 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
34 -- Pringle's number at Granada Hills Kennedy High School and for two seasons 
at Washington State before he transferred. This was the one number, excluding 
the bonus, that didn't come up. The number that did was 35. 
</P>
<P>
One of Pringle's other good numbers: 118. That is his rushing average, the best 
in the Big West Conference and the 10th-best in the country among Division I 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Little wheat, much chaff: Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson described the 
last days of the season to USA Today: "I make two decisions this time of year: 
The people who can play I don't worry about. But I decide about those who can't 
-- the ones I never want to see again, and I decide which ones we'll keep if we 
can't find something better." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which three major league teams have never played in a divisional 
championship series? 
</P>
<P>
All-around performer: From Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun: "Ernest Givins 
of the Houston Oilers made all the highlight shows with his end-zone flip 
during Week 3, but he didn't mean to do it. He tried to dive over Chris Hale of 
the Buffalo Bills, but Hale's helmet caught Givins on the thigh and he flipped. 
Givens suffered a deep thigh bruise on the play and was fortunate the injury 
wasn't worse. 
</P>

SIMI VALLEY'S KATHY GRAY EARNS WINGS AS ONLY WOMAN IN U. S. TO RACE FORMULA ONE 
MIDGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene is inside the cockpit of a midget airplane that's traveling more than 
200 m. p. h. around a three-mile race course: Throttle open, Kathy Gray is 
redlining the little 100-horsepower engine, banking past a pylon at full bore. 
Without warning, a jolt on the starboard wing -- a blow so sharp that it 
literally knocks out her contact lenses -- sends the plane lurching out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground, her mechanic, George Kirstner, has seen what happened: There was 
a mid-air collision, another plane clipping her right wing. Now, Kirstner 
watches Gray's tiny plane "do wild gyrations and then dive toward the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Gray managed to regain control and -- after coolly locating her contacts and 
placing them back in her eyes -- she landed the plane. When Kirstner got to 
her, she dismissed her brush with disaster. So what if she'd been half-blind in 
a careening aircraft at low altitude? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty hairy situation," Kirstner says of the incident two years ago 
in Pueblo, Colo. "But she seemed to think it was nothing. That's Kathy, though. 
She never gets shook up." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, 38, is so cool she even lives on Nonchalant Drive in Simi Valley. And 
when she flies -- besides racing, she ferries planes all over the world for a 
living -- Gray takes a casual, fatalistic approach to danger. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a structural failure, you have to accept the fact that you 
probably won't survive," she says. "But I've come to terms with that. You have 
to take every precaution, but if it happens, it happens. At least it will be 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
Barely 5 foot, Gray doesn't look like a character from a Hemingway novel, but 
she has led a globe-trotting life of adventure. A professional flier for 15 
years, Gray is one of a handful of women pilots in the profession and is the 
only woman in the country who races Formula One midgets. She recently finished 
second in the silver division at the National Air Races in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing is something I wanted to do since I started flying," Gray says. "The 
midgets really appealed to me because they're the only plane designed to race 
and nothing else. To me, that's the ultimate." 
</P>
<P>
Air races are just like auto races, only higher. They take place around pylons, 
with as many as eight midgets -- each 600 pounds, with 16-foot wingspans -- 
taking part, often flying only 15 feet off the ground during the eight-lap 
race. Some midgets generate speeds approaching 300 m. p. h. on straightaways, 
and death is always the co-pilot. At the Reno races, a midget pilot was killed 
when his plane got caught in a dust devil and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
The sport has not attracted many women. There are believed to have been only 
three others besides Gray. One was killed and the other two dropped out, 
Kirstner says. One of them, JoAnn Alfred, retired and sold Gray her plane, 
named Pogo. Gray bought it in 1987 for $10,000, and "it needed a lot of work," 
Gray says. With the help of Kirstner, who works for Marple Aviation at Santa 
Paula Airport, she rebuilt the engine and replaced the chassis fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be nowhere without someone to work on the plane," she says. Kirstner works 
without pay and travels to air shows with Gray, splitting her winnings. At 
Reno, she won $2,600, a tidy sum, but air races don't occur often enough -- 
there won't be another until next spring -- to pay their expenses and overhead. 
Gray enters only three or four races a year and has earned $5,000-$6,000 each 
year she has raced, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Gray finds her thrills between races by flying planes -- monster-sized Soviet 
Ilyushins to little Cessnas -- across oceans to their new owners. In a good 
year, she averages two solo trips to Africa every month, each trip taking five 
or six days, with long hours spent crossing great expanses of ocean. Then, when 
she lands, she has to deal with Third World red tape, bureaucrats on the take 
and language barriers. Once, in Nigeria, she was placed under house arrest 
after making an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
"What you don't do in Africa is pop in unannounced without clearance," she 
says. "That was a bit tricky. I had to do a lot of fast talking." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, she was delivering a five-seat Cessna when an electrical fire 
sizzled in the cockpit during a rainstorm over Mali. It happened on automatic 
pilot when she was back checking the extra fuel tanks. With the cabin filling 
with smoke, she groped forward and sat in the pilot's seat. Bad idea. The 
shorted wires were under the seat. Her jeans began to smolder. Communication 
and navigation systems went out, but she flew into Mali by dead reckoning, 
"fixed the plane, put on a pair of new pants and went on," she says 
matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who grew up in Vermont, wanted to be a jockey -- she once worked as an 
exercise girl -- but discovered flying in the early '70s. Her brother went to a 
local airport to take flying lessons and Gray "trailed along," she says. The 
brother never went up; she did. A couple of years later, she moved to Los 
Angeles and got a job teaching aerobatics at Santa Paula Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying is like horse racing," she says. "I just liked it. And I fancied I 
could make a living at it." 
</P>
<P>
After working as a DC-3 cargo pilot, Gray was employed in 1987 by Southern 
Cross Aviation, a Camarillo-based worldwide aircraft delivery company. "It's my 
favorite job," she says. "I see a lot of the world, but I'm also on my own. I 
take off on my own and land on my own. I have to use ingenuity and I never know 
what I'm going to run into or what problems with clearances I'm going to have." 
</P>
<P>
And how do people react when the hatch opens on their brand new expensive 
airplane and a tiny woman steps out to greet them? "I get some raised eyebrows, 
especially in places like Japan and the Philippines," she says. "But for the 
most part, people don't care who's flying as long as their plane gets there in 
one piece." 
</P>
<P>
The midget racing fraternity also accepts her, she says. "I'm the source of 
their jokes, but the men have been fabulous. Their love for racing transcends 
(the sexes). When I first started, there were guys who were skeptical, but they 
gave me a chance to prove myself. On the whole, they've been very helpful and 
appreciative to have a woman flying. It gives racing another dimension." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the omnipresent danger, "Once a race starts, I get a wonderful feeling 
-- I love passing people," Gray says. "The joyful part is when I land and share 
the experience with the people I've raced with." 
</P>
<P>
Gray and Kirstner are in the process of building a new plane that is expected 
to reach lap speeds of 280 m. p. h. "We're convinced it will be an unbeatable 
plane," she says. Gray's diminutive size is an advantage in midget racing. Her 
new plane will be custom-built for her, meaning that it will have a smaller 
fuselage and be more aerodynamically efficient than the competition's craft. 
</P>
<P>
"I can build it around me," she says. "It will be a teenie-weenie airplane."

TRYING TO MAKE CENTS FROM A RACKET; 
</P>
<P>
CALABASAS' STEVE WIERE LEAVES COLLEGE A YEAR EARLY TO GIVE PROFESSIONAL TENNIS 
A TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single notion occupies the thoughts and influences the actions of Steve 
Wiere. It's one that made him leave college after three years and the same one 
that sends him through rigorous five-hour workouts every day. 
</P>
<P>
Wiere is pursuing a professional tennis career. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I was 12 that playing tennis was the only thing I wanted to do," 
said Wiere, a 21-year-old from Calabasas who previously competed in soccer, 
track, swimming and gymnastics as well as tennis. 
</P>
<P>
For Wiere, success came quickly and now his early ambitions may be a step 
closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, Wiere was ranked in the top 20 in his age division in California. As a 
14-year-old, he was ranked 18th in the state and 22nd in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In his sophomore year at Calabasas High in 1984, Wiere teamed with Steve 
Oliver, another sophomore, to become the youngest doubles team in 52 years to 
win a Southern Section individual championship. 
</P>
<P>
Wiere led the Coyotes to four consecutive Frontier League and Southern Section 
3-A titles and, as a senior, he was runner-up in the individual Southern 
Section state singles competition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being recruited by UC Irvine, Cal State Long Beach and Arizona, Wiere 
chose to take his talents to the Midwest to compete for Carl Neufeld at 
Northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld, who recently was appointed as an assistant at USC, saw Wiere playing 
at a tournament in Indiana as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of recruited him personally," he recalled. " I saw a lot of potential 
and just kept in contact with him. He was a good student and I was recruiting 
academics. That was most important." 
</P>
<P>
Some people thought that Wiere had lost his mind when he headed east to the 
rarely defrosted DeKalb campus, located 60 miles west of Chicago. But Neufeld 
eased Wiere's worries about freezing to death by inviting him to visit the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to see this place in the winter," Neufeld said. "I wanted him to 
see that it wasn't 80 degrees below zero and that we don't walk around in space 
suits." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the concerns, Wiere was happy with his choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a change. It gets boring living in perfect weather all the time," 
Wiere said. "I visited the school and talked to the players. I just fell in 
love with the area." 
</P>
<P>
His opponents, though, might have wished Wiere stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
As the Huskies' No. 1 player, Wiere has compiled a three-year record of 90-25, 
including a visit to the NCAA tennis tournament in singles competition as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Wiere, a sports business major, has decided to forgo his final 
year at Northern Illinois. He believes that he is ready to take the plunge into 
the professional tennis world. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked it over with my dad and I just thought that the time was right. He's 
kind of disappointed that I didn't finish my degree, but he's given me his full 
support," Wiere said. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Peter, acknowledged that support: "He's done well in college and it 
seems logical for him to give (professional tennis) a try. He's starting to get 
results and I like to see him reach his potential. I think he has the 
capability to be ranked among the top 100 in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld would have preferred to see Wiere graduate before tackling the pros, 
but the coach believes in his protege's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really progressed since he's been here and has done just about everything 
he could do. There was little more to prove. He was one of the top players in 
the Midwest," Neufeld said. "I have no doubt he has the potential to be a pro 
player. My recommendation to him was to just try it and see how he does." 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld said that it wouldn't hurt Wiere to take a year off from school to 
pursue tennis. He would still retain a year of eligibility to compete 
collegiately with the exception of NCAA tournament play. 
</P>
<P>
Wiere, however, is rather unconcerned about returning to the university level, 
saying, "I have confidence I can make it in the pros. If I didn't, I wouldn't 
have made the decision. I really don't see myself playing any more college 
tennis." 
</P>
<P>
If early results are an indication, Wiere might know what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
He made a surprising showing in last month's Los Angeles Volvo Tennis Wild-Card 
tournament, which served as a qualifier for the actual qualifying for the 
event. Wiere, who was unseeded, raised some eyebrows when he advanced to the 
final round of the 200-player tournament before losing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a major breakthrough for me," Wiere said. "Deep inside, I was hoping I 
could make it to Volvo. But to get as close as I did really boosted my 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Then, fresh off his performance at the Volvo tournament, Wiere reached the 
final of the Long Beach Open two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
The seeding committee, obviously impressed by his play two weeks earlier, made 
Wiere the third-seeded player in the 258-player tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving Northern Illinois in June, Wiere has compiled a record of 42-6 in 
nine tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-1, 180 pounds, Wiere looks more like a football defensive back than a 
tennis player. Yet Wiere, who works out three to five hours a day incorporating 
running, biking and swimming into his training regimen, says that his size is 
an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot bigger than most players, but I think I'm a lot stronger. My 
conditioning and especially my endurance also plays a big part and helps a lot 
toward the end of matches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld added: "Steve's a pretty big guy, but quick for his size. He plays a 
very aggressive game. He's got a real big serve and it's going to get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
What will it take for Wiere to make it in pro tennis? To reach that place among 
the top 100 or so pros? 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld says that Wiere needs to work on his play at the net. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked very hard on his serve-and-volley game and it's improved, but how 
much it improves will determine how far he can go," Neufeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve's like a skyrocket," said Mark Winters, a regular observer of the pro 
tennis scene and public-relations director at the L.A. Tennis Center. "He can 
be really hot or cold at times. But if he holds it together for an entire 
match, he's really tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Wiere is preparing to compete in the ATP Nissan/Hawaiian circuit tour later 
this month before leaving for South America in January to play in four 
tournaments in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. "After that, I should have a good 
idea of how well I stack up," he said.

LAVERDE SCORES DECISIVE GOAL FOR CSUN, 2-1

<TEXT>
<P>
Midfielder German Laverde scored an unassisted goal with two minutes remaining 
Wednesday to lift visiting Cal State Northridge to a 2-1 win over Cal Poly 
Pomona in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. match. 
</P>
<P>
Laverde, a sophomore making his first start for the Matadors, stole the ball 
from a defender, dribbled to the left of the goal and fired a 23-yard shot with 
his left foot for his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a rocket shot," Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad said. "German is known 
for having a very strong shot. He's really playing well." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (5-2-2, 2-0 in conference play) took a 1-0 lead 30 minutes into the 
match when Jim Hofferber scored his team-high fifth goal on an assist from 
Scott Piri. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona (0-2 in conference play) evened the score with 20 minutes left in the 
match.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
HOST OF RECEIVERS FLOOD HART'S PASSING LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best defense, the saying goes, is a good offense. How true at Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
No more trying to pick up the blitz with that extra back, or tight ends trying 
to hold off surging linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
For all its complexity in the past, the Indians' passing attack has assumed a 
schoolyard quality. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, you two guys go long, you two guys square out and you cut across 
the middle. Ready, BREAK! 
</P>
<P>
 And it works. Quarterback Rob Westervelt passed for 215 yards and four 
touchdowns -- exclusively in the first half -- as Hart battered Saugus, 56-14, 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier, Westervelt was flattened by Crespi's blitz in a 21-13 loss. 
Last week, the Indians barely held off Palmdale, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
So, against Saugus, every available receiver was sent on pass errands, leaving 
Westervelt with only five blockers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are five people in the pattern," Coach Mike Herrington said. "We figured 
we weren't being successful keeping guys back to block, so we might as well try 
and find the guy they're not covering." 
</P>
<P>
Merry-go-round: Running back Kris Kirksey is out for the season. Fullback Greg 
Exler has missed the past 2 1/2 games. Running back Brian Vellmure sat out the 
second half last week and will not play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the state of Camarillo's backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, who injured his knee last season, will not be back. Exler, who 
sprained his ankle, likely will start Friday against Royal. And Vellmure, the 
junior who has stepped in and rushed for 297 yards, sprained his ankle against 
Westlake. His absence also hurts the Scorpions on defense, where he is the 
starting free safety. 
</P>
<P>
Add injuries: Moorpark tailback Tony Upshaw, the Valley area's leading scorer 
with 12 touchdowns, might miss Friday's game at Santa Paula because of a 
sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Streak ends: Canyon center Lenny Grimaldo and kicker-wide receiver Steve Mann 
both went down with knee injuries last week. Although Coach Harry Welch is 
uncertain how long either player will be out, he said that both injuries appear 
to be ligament damage and "don't look good." 
</P>
<P>
For Grimaldo, the injury ended a streak of 17 consecutive games as Canyon's 
starting center. Grimaldo's brother, Rudy, started at center for Canyon in 28 
consecutive games in 1983 and '84, Southern Section title years for the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Closed door: What does a coach do when his team has squandered 11 opportunities 
inside the opponents' 10-yard line? Burroughs has totaled 1,004 yards in 
offense, yet has scored just 54 points in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a hard time," McElwee said. "We have miscommunication. We call 
sweep right, and when it gets into the huddle it's sweep left. And we only run 
the sweep one way." 
</P>
<P>
Last week against Glendale, Burroughs failed to score from the one-yard line on 
two occasions. 
</P>

PAIN IS PLAINLY NOT ON THE WANE FOR MCMAHON

Is Jim McMahon hurting, or isn't he? If he is hurting, how badly? 
</P>
<P>
These questions refuse to go away, and they received another airing Wednesday 
when the Chargers began preparations for Sunday's game against the Broncos in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of confusion began when the Chargers listed McMahon as 
questionable on their injury report because of a sore back. This meant -- on 
the surface at least -- that they felt the veteran quarterback had only a 50-50 
chance to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Since McMahon had gone all the way against the Phoenix Cardinals last Sunday, 
his entry on the injury report was a surprise on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon has had sore ribs since the season opener, but the problem obviously 
hasn't been serious. Also, the Chargers reported after the Phoenix game that he 
had a stiff neck. They didn't mention anything about his back. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery deepened when McMahon took his full complement of snaps in 
Wednesday's practice session. And, predictably, both he and Coach Dan Henning 
said afterward that he definitely would play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
When McMahon was approached on the matter, he said, "It's just the same old 
nagging thing I've had all year." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had been listed as questionable, he said, "Ask them. I didn't say 
anything. I've played for three weeks with it, so why would there be any 
question about playing this week?" 
</P>
<P>
McMahon added that he wasn't happy about the way the offense had functioned in 
the workout. 
</P>
<P>
"If we play like we practiced on offense today, we're not going to do a hell of 
a lot," he said. "Maybe it was just a bad day, but we didn't do much." 
</P>
<P>
Good day or bad, the question at hand was McMahon's physical condition, and 
this was how Henning dealt with it in his meeting with reporters: 
</P>
<P>
Question: McMahon was listed as questionable, yet he worked out. Why 
questionable? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: He strained his neck in the Phoenix game. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But now they say it's his back that hurts? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, it's the back of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But why questionable? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't make up the list. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any question that he will play? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, he's just questionable. But he practiced and didn't show any ill 
effects. He's been taking treatments. It's a nagging-type thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is he listed as questionable this week when he wasn't last week? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. Does it make any difference? It's probably because we're 
pressed to make up the report before practice each Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Then is there any doubt that McMahon will play Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the guy will play. 
</P>
<P>
That settles it, then. McMahon is still sore, be it in the ribs, neck or back, 
but you can count on his presence at quarterback in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the Chargers' injury front, Henning said that offensive tackle Joel 
Patten (knee) probably would miss Sunday's game and that wide receiver Quinn 
Early (knee) and cornerback Sammy Seale (shoulder) wouldn't play unless they 
healed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Patten just doesn't figure to be ready," Henning said. "Early is between 
doubtful and questionable. He says he'll be ready, but being a receiver, he has 
to have his normal speed, and I don't know if he will. Seale can't do any 
hitting right now, so I'd call him questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Patten was listed as doubtful, and Henning said he planned to start Joey Howard 
in his place. Howard, 6-5 and 305 (two pounds lighter than Patten), was the 
Chargers' ninth-round draft choice last year but spent the season on injured 
reserve with a bad knee. He didn't play at all this season until Patten got 
hurt in the third quarter in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Patten didn't practice, and Larry Beightol, offensive coordinator and offensive 
line coach, said, "I have a rule that if a guy can't practice one of the two 
work days (Wednesday and Thursday), he can't start. Right now, Howard is the 
starter." 
</P>
<P>
Told of this, Howard said, "I'm looking forward to the opportunity, but it's so 
far off. This is only Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Five Chargers listed as questionable are expected to play Sunday. They are 
running back Marion Butts (sternum), wide receiver Anthony Miller (back), wide 
receiver Darryl Usher (hamstring), strong safety Martin Bayless (quadriceps) 
and H-back Rod Bernstine (knee). . . . Listed as probable are center Courtney 
Hall (ankle), defensive end Burt Grossman (wrist), defensive end Lee Williams 
(back), cornerback Gill Byrd (ankle), linebacker Gary Plummer (shoulder) and 
offensive tackle Brett Miller (knee). . . . The Broncos have a brief injury 
report. Nose tackle Greg Kragen (knee) is out and center Keith Kartz (ear), an 
alumnus of San Dieguito High School, is probable.

SDSU SOCCER: MORE THAN KICKS; 
</P>
<P>
WORKING OVERTIME JUST PART OF JOB FOR AZTEC COACHES 
</P>

<P>
He tries to do everything and usually is successful. But sometimes even Chuck 
Clegg realizes that everything is just too much for one person. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg is coach of men's and women's soccer at San Diego State. He is 
responsible for 56 athletes, twice as many as last year. When the 
track-and-field program was dropped during the summer for budget reasons, SDSU 
upgraded women's soccer from club to varsity status to maintain the NCAA 
minimum Division I requirement of seven women's sports. Track has since raised 
enough money to operate, but women's soccer remains, and Clegg is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
So this is what it's like to carry on a conversation with Clegg these days. 
</P>
<P>
He talks soccer for a minute. The phone rings. He picks it up, answers a 
question, hangs up and continues to talk. 
</P>
<P>
A minute later, the phone rings again. He solves a problem and hangs up. 
</P>
<P>
Another minute of soccer talk. Another ring. The question answered and 
interruption complete, Clegg decides enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
He unplugs the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"See," he says, holding up the disconnected cord and smiling. "It won't ring 
now." 
</P>
<P>
A rare moment of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg works 15 or 16 hours a day. He probably could get away with less but is 
committed to keeping Aztec soccer competitive on a national level, though his 
budget is mere pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
So Clegg shows up at the 7 a.m. women's practice with a large cup of coffee, 
gets his lunch at the drive-through, digs up enough energy to participate in 
drills with the men's team in the late afternoon and stays in his office until 
past 11 p.m. making recruiting calls and finishing paper work. And the next 
day, he gets up and does it again. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be done right," he says. "I refuse to let it be done in a 
second-class way." 
</P>
<P>
Clegg has a record of 106-41-17 in eight seasons coaching the Aztec men. After 
a rocky start this season, the men's team is 6-3-1 including a recent victory 
over Southern Methodist, then ranked No. 8 in the country. The women are 2-3 
after losing to UCLA Wednesday, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
In its 21 years, the SDSU men's team has never had a losing season. Clegg plans 
to start a similar streak this year with the women and appears to be on the 
right track. He has given the women reason to take pride in their program. 
</P>
<P>
At times, he has had to remind them they are now in the big leagues and should 
act accordingly. Before traveling to the first away game, many of the women 
players showed up wearing T-shirts and thongs. That was standard attire last 
year. Clegg put a stop to that. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scolded," senior B.J. Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The women were told to dress for success. So this has become a team that 
dresses, practices and plays like a varsity team. The atmosphere is much 
different than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all pretty excited," senior Kristine Hicks said. "It's a big 
difference. In club you can just kind of miss practice. It isn't that 
important. Just the name NCAA makes it mean so much more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "There's a lot more discipline. In club, we could basically show up 
any time we wanted to. With Chuck, we're there on time, or we're running." 
</P>
<P>
If Clegg is ever tired from his busy schedule, it doesn't seem to zap his 
enthusiasm on the field. But, by his estimation, the actual coaching is only 
15% of the job. The rest is ordering equipment, making travel arrangements, 
answering recruiting letters . . .. 
</P>
<P>
His only help is Chris Keenan -- a former player Clegg has hired as a graduate 
assistant for $5,000 a year -- and Clegg's wife, Donna, who travels with the 
team as a volunteer coach. Clegg pieces together the men's team with five 
scholarships and an expense budget of $12,250, which he estimates is in the 
lowest 10% of any program in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while, there is a little indication that this is simply too 
much work for one man. For instance, the team will show up at the airport, on 
time, with all the travel arrangements in perfect order, and Clegg will reach 
in his back pocket and discover he has forgotten his wallet. The little things. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes little details slip through the cracks because you're so pressed for 
time," he said. "If you're not organized, you'll get crucified in this job." 
</P>
<P>
So the question is, when will Clegg get some help? And the answer is . . . 
probably not soon enough. The big bread-winner for the Aztec athletic 
department is the football team, which drew exactly 15,721 fans to the last 
home game, the lowest attendance in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, money is scarce. "We're not entering an era of rampant 
spending," said Jim Herrick, SDSU associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one person who will tell you just how hard Clegg's job is, it is 
Keenan, who has been ready to blow his stack a few times since taking the 
graduate assistant position. He's away from home so much that he mails his 
bills from his hotel room. He does his laundry on the road. He had so much on 
his mind that he forgot to bring the soccer balls to one game. He once was so 
tired that he fell asleep eating lunch and was two hours late to practice. 
</P>
<P>
All this makes him marvel at what Clegg is able to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can keep this up," he says. "You can do it for a season, but you've got 
to have a life apart from soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Clegg finds satisfaction in the time he does spend on the 
field, teaching skills, running drills and being a coach rather than an 
administrator. That somehow makes the rest of it seem worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy myself greatly when I'm on the field," he said. "There's nothing like 
the roller coaster of coaching."

PERSONALITY: NEW CHIEF AT S.D. UNITED WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry (Hayes) Riggins has been appointed executive vice president and chief 
operating officer of United Way of San Diego County. She is responsible for all 
internal agency operations including fund raising, fund distribution and 
service programs. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, a native of Seattle, joined United Way of San Diego County in 1984 as 
associate executive director for planning, allocations and agency relations. In 
January, 1988, she was promoted to executive vice president of marketing and 
strategic planning and assumed her new post in September. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Riggins worked for the state of Washington as a regional planner 
with the Department of Social and Health Services. She earned a bachelor's 
degree in sociology and a masters in social work, with an emphasis on planning 
and community organization, from the University of Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, 42, first became involved with United Way as a volunteer 15 years ago. 
She rose to the head of planning, allocations and community relations for the 
United Way in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like being able to respond to the changes and needs in a community," 
Riggins said. "And that's what the United Way does, through fund raising and 
service programs." 
</P>
<P>
In her new position, Riggins said, she is devoting much of her time to a 
three-year fund-raising and marketing campaign called Can-Do. United Way hopes 
to raise $34 million by 1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying new initiatives, reaching out to the new business sectors in the 
San Diego economy," Riggins said. "We're also working on other ways, through 
new leadership giving and doing a better job with our existing donors." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins lives with her husband in Tustin, about 80 miles north of San Diego. 
She says she doesn't mind the daily three-hour round-trip commute because it 
allows her to stay in San Diego with the job she loves. CAROLINE LEMKE

MAGAZINES: WIGWAG: A FRESH TAKE ON THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For one of the most soft-spoken magazines to come around in decades, this one's 
sure causing a clamor. 
</P>
<P>
With a dollop of the New Yorker's sophistication, a dash of Spy's 
unpredictability and a spritz of water from Lake Wobegon, Wigwag wants to be, 
and may well be, the magazine that defines the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But only if the '90s are the long-awaited era in which celebrity becomes 
declasse and glitz goes the way of Tony Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burned Out on Coolness 
</P>
<P>
A post-post modernist publication, Wigwag -- the first issue of which hit news 
racks last week -- is for folks who burned out on cool back when their college 
roommate bought his sixth pair of shades, but still try to stay awake for David 
Letterman. It's for folks who sneer at folks who sneer at folks who don't live 
and die to vogue, but listen to the Cowboy Junkies on the way to Neighborhood 
Watch meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the magazine began percolating in the mind of 29-year-old editor 
Alexander Kaplen three years ago, while he was staring out the window during 
classes at Yale Law School. To escape the monotonous din of legalese, Kaplen 
would pick up a couple magazines each night at a newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me that general-interest publications fell into one of two 
categories," he said. "One was high-pitched, cynical, star-struck . . . the 
other was very formidable, serious." 
</P>
<P>
He sensed a niche to be filled. Many people were growing weary of the irony and 
cynicism pervading the culture, he decided. Perhaps the time was ripe for a 
magazine that valued old fashioned storytelling, accepted that things could be 
appreciated directly and didn't roll its editorial eyes at the notion of values 
"that really matter." 
</P>
<P>
Gathering some younger editors with whom he had worked at the New Yorker ("not 
senior people by any stretch of the imagination"), Kaplen went about concocting 
a magazine he hoped would be distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the first issue, he succeeded. The New Yorker influence on the 
pacing and design is obvious, but spread so evenly throughout the publication 
that the total impact is subtle. It's also clear that the editors read Spy, but 
that magazine's snide sensibility seems almost to have been sublimated. The 
magazine refrains from devastating irony but knows better than to slip into 
schmaltz or self righteousness. And rather than ridiculing the famous, it 
simply ignores them. 
</P>
<P>
As Kaplen sees it, Wigwag, like Spy, has an edge. "But a lot less edge." And 
Wigwag, he added, is also flavored with equal parts of "sweetness." 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the publication, he believes, will be determined by the stable of 
writers the editors are putting together. The voice will be "idiosyncratic, not 
a neutral beige voice." But it will have a unifying quality. 
</P>
<P>
"Wigwag," the magazine's premier editorial reports, is an American word meaning 
"to signal someone home." As the magazine's editorial statement explains: 
"Tired of the cynicism that has long dominated American life, our generation is 
once again thinking about home and community -- that sense of place our parents 
and grandparents took for granted." 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping that the magazine, as well as talking about home, would be home, 
a place to slow down in for a few minutes or hours each month," Kaplen said. 
</P>
<P>
So. Does it work? 
</P>
<P>
Not entirely. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
But many readers will find it worth exploring, from the beautiful, 
quasi-nostalgic cover to the last page, if only for the light it sheds on the 
dreary sameness of most other publications. Even the ideas that fall short are 
neat ideas. There's none of the same old stuff, which means none of the same 
old infatuation with what is new in the most shallow sense. 
</P>
<P>
The design is engaging and the graphics are quirky and lively, with cartoonish 
splotches of art that keep jumping out and biting the reader on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's most standard feature each month will simply be called "the 
feature." In the initial effort, journalist Garry Wills interviews and profiles 
Dan and Marilyn Quayle's odd preacher, Robert B. Thieme Jr. 
</P>
<P>
This piece should receive mainstream play for the light it sheds on an 
influential theology. For instance: "The woman should wear on her head the sign 
of subjection to man's authority . . . longer hair." It may make some readers 
wish astrologers again were the main spiritual influence in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of the other regular features and departments in the first 
issue: 
</P>
<P>
"The History of the United States": This item "tells the story of a particular 
place through the development of certain things in that place." (In this case, 
the United States through men's hats ties and shoes). 
</P>
<P>
"A Letter From Springfield": The magazine is sending black Angolan writer Sousa 
Jamba off to report on all the Springfields in America (there are 49 of them). 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Desk": John Lahr writes an engagingly cheeky piece about Arthur 
Miller's efforts to fortify American Studies programs -- his own in particular 
-- in Great Britain, where they have suffered under the Thatcher regime. 
</P>
<P>
"Social Studies": Suzanne Ruta writes one of the most successful pieces in the 
magazine, a look at how her daughter, born in 1971, became a political 
activist, and her own shifting views of that as they both attend a 
demonstration against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Original Species": The magazine's environmental column. Not standard issue 
environmentalism by any means, it will present each month a threatened animal 
with the genetically engineered features it would require to survive in the 
modern world. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Dougal Dixon describes the "betterotterotter," a sea otter with a 
long snoot for breathing through oil spills. ("In these days of the Muppets, 
E.T. , and Alf, no species will be seen by the public as worth protecting 
unless it has some anthropomorphic feature, or is cuddlesome. . . . Public 
relations will be an important selective pressure in survival and evolution 
from now on.") 
</P>
<P>
"Letters From Home": This is, really, the core of the magazine, the section 
that will link in print the global village that Marshall McLuhan thought would 
be linked by video. It's Talk of the Town with edge. 
</P>
<P>
"The Monthly Bedtime Story": What better way to make certain a magazine nestles 
itself into the family than to include each month an original children's story? 
The first effort, "When Sophie Stayed for Dinner," is a simple blend of 
slightly oddball humor and unsanctimonious values. In a test read to a 
5-year-old and a 2 1/2-year-old, it came away with rave reviews. When little 
Sophie, visiting her friend for dinner, dips spaghetti into her milk and 
shouts, 'Worms in my mulk! worms in my mulk!' " the children yelped and 
sputtered with laughter, even after repeated command performance re-readings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, readers will appreciate the Saab ad on the last page, which, like most 
of the ads here, is geared to the Y-audience segment of the New Yorker. And 
thank goodness for New Yorker style ads for booze, computers, Adirondack 
chairs, Swedish clogs, and $185 children's wagons. They may keep the magazine 
alive long enough to reach its potential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After Rice 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers to the now defunct Rice magazine, a publication for the Asian 
American community, have received in the mail a copy of Asian Week, a weekly 
San Francisco-based tabloid that has been reporting on the Asian American 
community for 10 years. Through a deal struck with Rice management, former 
subscribers to that publication will receive Asian Week for the duration of 
their subscription to Rice, said Patrick Andersen, Asian Week's managing 
editor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gilding Diplomas 
</P>
<P>
Come on down, to education town! Have we got a college degree for you! For only 
$18,000 a year, you get shiny glass student union buildings! You get superstar 
professors! You get flashy Ivy League diplomas! And much, much more! 
</P>
<P>
What many colleges don't have to offer is a an education commensurate with the 
cost of tuition, according to an intriguing article in the Autumn, 1989, issue 
of The American Scholar, the Washington-based Phi Beta Kappa Society's 
periodical. 
</P>
<P>
With college tuition increasing at more than twice the rate of inflation, with 
the 10 most expensive schools in the country all costing more than $18,000 a 
year, with higher education a $124-billion-a-year industry in 1987-88, studies 
show that "half of the college graduates aged 21 to 25 performed below 
acceptable standards on literacy scales." 
</P>
<P>
According to a National Assessment of Educational Progress report, half of 
college graduates don't have the skills to calculate a tip in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
A big part of the problem, as author Jay Amberg sees it, is that colleges have 
become, to use the words of another educational analyst: "Club Med With Books." 
</P>
<P>
Amberg argues that schools spend too much on student recruitment and enrollment 
(as much as $2,500 per entering freshman at one school; $1,500 at Pomona's 
Harvey Mudd, Amberg reports), too much on nonacademic buildings, too much on 
sappy fringe classes. And far too little on improving the quality of 
instruction. Amberg also argues that many professors are underworked and 
overpaid, and spend less and less time actually teaching. 
</P>
<P>
But these problems aren't readily apparent, because "colleges and universities 
spend a great deal of time and money measuring students' learning before their 
arrival on campus but do almost nothing to measure whether they learn anything 
more before they graduate." 
</P>
<P>
He concludes that "many American colleges are becoming little more than posh 
credentialing agencies" and that students are paying "14-carat prices for what 
is too often a gilded education."

 DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: NEW IDEA WILL HELP CITY HALL SHED OLD LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost anyone who has tried to find San Diego's City Hall for the first time 
can tell you a story about searching for the anonymous, faceless 13-story 
building on C Street. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, the city moved to this undertakers' paradise of poorly lit spaces from 
the stately quarters it shared with the county in what is now the County 
Administration Center on Pacific Highway. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cause for civic pride in the present city headquarters. Realizing 
this, the city has ambitious plans to open a signature civic center by 1995 on 
four city blocks east of 12th Avenue and Broadway downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The man charged with delivering a first-class, world-class project is Portland, 
Ore., architect Donald Stastny. 
</P>
<P>
Stastny was chosen by city officials because of his experience with design 
competitions and because he wants to use a competition process called 
"design/develop," thought by many to be the ultimate marriage of good design, 
feasible construction, and quality and cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
By selecting a group of potential architects first, then asking developers to 
team up with them, design is given the priority it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
Although various incarnations of the design/develop approach have been used in 
the past, the San Diego civic center will be an extremely refined version. This 
competition could well become a model for major public building competitions 
for years to come, according to Stastny. 
</P>
<P>
Among the building designs resulting from competitions run by Stastny are the 
Beverly Hills Civic Center, designed by Urban Innovations Group with Charles 
Moore; the Domaine Clos Pegase winery in Northern California designed by 
Michael Graves; and a planned Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, designed 
by architect Frank Gehry. (Stastny has also designed and planned a number of 
large projects.) 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Stastny isn't known for producing middle-of-the-road architecture. He 
likes innovation, and hires world-class juries to sort through proposals from 
internationally known architects such as Graves, the leading postmodernist, and 
Gehry, the architect and artist whose bizarre combinations of forms and 
materials have inspired a whole generation of cutting-edge Southern California 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other consultants who place design decisions in the hands of juries 
composed of city officials and assorted civic leaders, Stastny believes that 
only those trained in design should judge the merits of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
A jury including a prominent architect, landscape architect, urban planner, 
developer and outside city official who has been through a competition will 
ensure that good architecture doesn't take a back seat to economics, as it can 
in projects of this magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of merely selecting a design based on a ballpark construction cost, 
then hiring a contractor to build it, Stastny's design/develop approach 
combines top architects with developers who will commit, in writing, to 
bringing the 1-million-square-foot project in on budget, in this case $242.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Materials and construction guidelines will be prepared so that finalists meet 
quality standards. That, it is hoped, will minimize developer bidding wars and 
encourage design competition. 
</P>
<P>
Because of high construction costs and tight budgets, many cities are trying to 
"privatize" the development of public buildings, according to Stastny, and the 
design/develop method is one way to do this. Teams including experts in design, 
budgeting and project management should minimize city staff costs. 
</P>
<P>
Stastny outlined the process. 
</P>
<P>
In a month or two, the city will issue a "request for qualifications" through 
word of mouth, direct mailings and architectural publications, inviting 
architects to apply for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants will have to supply not just resumes, but one art board (30-by-40 
inches),giving some idea of their intended designs. Younger, less-known firms 
may want to catch the jury's attention with actual preliminary design 
proposals, Stastny said, whereas older firms might submit only a site plan or 
art work from earlier projects. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will narrow the field to 20 or 30 architects. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a second request for qualifications will go out to developers, asking 
them to approach the architects and form "design/develop" teams including 
contractors and other professional consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Several teams will be interviewed by the jury, and three to five candidates 
will be chosen to compete for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Finalists will each receive $100,000 to develop their proposals. The city 
should choose a winning proposal by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The design/develop process has drawbacks. Developers may be reluctant to team 
up with less-known architects. The odds against a small firm winning are 
probably substantial. 
</P>
<P>
So there's a chance San Diego will miss out on some great designs. For example, 
the excellent new Escondido City Hall was designed by Pacific Associates 
Planners Architects from San Diego; in 1985, when they were selected from an 
international field of more than 100, they had no experience doing large public 
buildings. Yet, probably because their thinking was unjaded by years of 
experience, they produced the freshest design. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stastny, young architects won't necessarily be out of the picture. 
They can team up with architects who specialize in project management and the 
production of construction drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion will be important, Stastny said. Public meetings, mailed 
questionnaires and phone polls can all be valuable tools. There will be at 
least one public display of designs before final selection. 
</P>
<P>
Stastny realizes that the civic center could be the key to a successful urban 
center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
With the civic center at the east edge of downtown, and the Navy's planned 
complex on the waterfront, Broadway will assume its natural role as the primary 
downtown street. This will be a shift, since most key streets -- 5th Avenue, 
1st Avenue and others -- run north and south, not east and west. 
</P>
<P>
A well-designed civic center will help people adjust to the change. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics have grumbled that the significant project cost is unjustified, that 
existing city buildings on C Street and nearby could be altered or expanded to 
do the job. Stastny doesn't agree, for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling among citizens of every city that city officials and 
employees should not work in luxurious surroundings," he said. "The reality is 
that what we need in city government is efficiency. A workplace that is equal 
in quality to the private sector will give us better service. 
</P>
<P>
"A city hall also needs to be accessible. Anyone held up on the elevator trying 
to get to the council chamber on the 12th floor of the existing City Hall knows 
that the current configuration doesn't lead to accessible government. 
</P>

 DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: LESSON SHARED ON HELPING YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Banker Gordon Luce and ninth-grader LaRon Snelling shared the stage at the San 
Diego Omni last Thursday as a symbol of an unusual pact formed between a group 
of the city's leaders and some of its less-advantaged but ambitious youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Snelling led his audience of 250 in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance 
that opened the third annual Project I Believe benefit dinner, which Luce 
chaired. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily underwritten event was expected to add more than $50,000 to the 
Project I Believe scholarship fund, a program created in 1987 by former City 
Councilman William Jones that guarantees a college or vocational school 
education to any of the 68 members of the 1987 graduation class of John F. 
Kennedy Elementary School who complete high school and earn the grades 
necessary to enter higher education. To date, all but one of the students have 
maintained contact with Project I Believe and participate in its required 
activities; before the establishment of this special program, it was projected 
that 40% of them would not earn a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earning an Education 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who earned a masters degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Business 
earlier this year and now is investment manager and assistant to the chairman 
of Prudential Realty Group in Newark, N.J., flew in to applaud the youths, 
parents, volunteer role models and civic leaders who work together in Project I 
Believe. 
</P>
<P>
"I want all the students to feel encouraged that they can succeed, because 
they're in those difficult, tender years right now," said Jones. "I remember 
how I felt when I was in the ninth grade. If these kids earn the right to go to 
USD or UCLA or any other college or vocational school, they will go. None of 
them will be denied an education for lack of money." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow board trustees Larry Cushman, Patrick Kruer and Glen Roberts joined 
Jones at the dinner. "This is a great program that not only gives these kids a 
chance, but lets them be examples to their peers," said Cushman. "Most of us 
feel this a real hands-on project." 
</P>
<P>
Several well-behaved, well-scrubbed students attended to give presentations of 
their Project I Believe experiences and seemed confident and self-assured, if a 
little awed by the surroundings and crowd. As the crowd sat down to dinner, 
Luce gestured at a group of students seated quietly nearby and said, "They're 
our future, you know, and that's why this program is so important to the 
community. I believe in it, and I hear so many good stories about it. Getting 
kids to study is the answer to all the problems in this country." 
</P>
<P>
The meal of chicken in raspberry sauce and bananas Foster provided a respite 
from a long round of introductions and speeches, but the audience gave its full 
attention when students Irma Gomez, Marlon McWilson and Charoun Soukhaseum rose 
to describe the lessons learned from Project I Believe. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included organization board directors Steven Paull, Sister Sally 
Furay, Barry Schultz, Mary Powers, Steven Kuhn and William Hill; the Rev. 
George Stevens; Norma and Dr. Sam Assam; Dr. Rodney Hood, president of the 
National Medical Assn.; Gladys and Tip Calvin; Barbara Hartung; fish taco czar 
Ralph Rubio; Councilman-elect John Hartley, and role model Jaime Mercado, a 
one-time dropout from Mar Vista High School who now is principal there. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Angel O'Brien dreamed of becoming the first woman to play 
professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien instead grew up to sing rock 'n' roll with the ever-hot Mar Dels, but 
she proved that she can still slug a mean ball at "Be a Kid Again," the Sept. 
26 benefit given at the Clairemont Mesa Family Fun Center by the Tuesday Club 
auxiliary to the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation. CAPF will share the 
proceeds of about $10,000 with Oceanside's Casa de Amparo crisis shelter for 
abused children. 
</P>
<P>
The point of "Be a Kid Again" was to allow supporters in their mid-30s and 
above to make a brief return to childhood, and O'Brien took a break from the 
Mar Dels' stage show to slam 60-m.p.h. fastballs at the batting cages. Some of 
the male party-goers, who themselves had taken a whirl in the cages, stood by 
with jaws agape as O'Brien, dressed in a short black cocktail dress and spike 
heels, calmly nailed pitch after pitch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Childhood Fantasies 
</P>
<P>
Those whose childhood fantasies extended beyond baseball battled in the bumper 
boats, toured the three miniature golf courses and dropped tokens in the video 
games before heading up to dance to the Mar Dels and feast on burgers, pizza, 
popcorn and other youth fare. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be an adult tonight but remember the days when you were growing up," 
said chairman Sharon Wilson. "The best part is that the funds we raise will 
allow today's children to enjoy their childhoods now." 
</P>
<P>
The Family Fun Center, which operates until midnight every day of the year, 
closed to the public for the first time in its 20-year history to accommodate 
the 300 guests. "This is definitely a different evening for us," said amusement 
park spokesman Ken Kobane. "Normally, we provide clean-cut fun for kids and 
grandparents, but tonight we've got a full house of big kids. It's worth it for 
the cause." 
</P>
<P>
The committee included Bonnie Garrett, Suzanne Willert, Drew Robinson, Kyle 
Ciani, Tom Goode, Bob Purvin, Barbara Owen, Vicki McNutt, Elaine Goldstein, 
Paul D'Heilly, Mark McDonald, Diana Nadel and Joanna Cunningham.

JACK SMITH: WHITE HOUSE VISIT: IT'S NOW OR NEVER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reviewing things I haven't done (most of which I don't want to do), I 
mentioned that I had never been invited to the White House by a President. 
</P>
<P>
I had no thought of provoking such an invitation. I was sure the President 
would never be aware of my availability. I certainly did not intend to write 
and invite myself. 
</P>
<P>
But at least two readers have interceded. Elizabeth Dobbs, a bright young woman 
whom I have quoted here before, has indeed written to President Bush, imploring 
him to invite me and my wife to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Smith wants to go to Washington," her letter began. "I have enclosed his 
article . . . which lists the things he has not done in his life. Heading the 
list is an invitation to the White House from a President. Because of Jack 
Smith's age and general health, chances are only you can rectify this omission 
in his life. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dobbs gives weight to her plea by suggesting that "millions of readers" 
will experience the visit vicariously through my column. That is an obvious 
exaggeration, but no more so, I hope, than Mrs. Dobbs' ominous suggestion that 
I will not live through Bush's Administration to see another President in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
When she wrote me, Mrs. Dobbs had not yet received an answer from the White 
House. However, the White House staff was more expeditious in responding to a 
similar request from Donald M. Levenson of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Hoping that both you and President Bush are forgiving of my temerity," he 
writes, "I subsequently dropped a note to that Power-That-Is, detailing your 
credentials and asking the boon that your wish be granted. The enclosed letter 
was the reply, not exactly opening the door, but not closing it either." It was 
on White House stationery: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Mr. Levenson: 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the President, I would like to thank you for your letter 
recommending that Mr. Jack Smith be invited to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"It is President and Mrs. Bush's hope to include as many people as possible in 
their official functions. However, space is extremely limited and often 
precludes us from including all who may wish to come. We so appreciate your 
thoughtful suggestion and are happy to keep Mr. Smith in mind for future 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
"Please accept our appreciation for your interest along with our best wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sincerely, LAURIE FIRESTONE 
</P>
<P>
"Social Secretary to the White House 
</P>
<P>
I consider that a very courteous and adequate response, considering the 
circumstances. After all, I would certainly not have expected a personal note 
from the President. I think Mr. Levenson should feel gratified to have heard 
from the President's social secretary, rather than from one of her assistants. 
</P>
<P>
So there we are. We're on the list. Lightning may strike any day. The 
President, or at least his social secretary, is thinking of us. I am glad that 
Mrs. Dobbs asked the President to include my wife in his invitation. I never 
accept social invitations that do not include her. I left her alone too many 
times in my youth while I was out carousing with my colleagues. (I'll bet the 
President can identify with that.) 
</P>
<P>
I hope no other readers write the White House urging the President to invite 
us. I'm afraid he will begin to suspect some sinister political motive. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it won't be cheap. My wife will certainly have to have a new dress. 
Money would be no object. Who knows -- someday it might hang in the Smithsonian 
Institution. I know she examines every dress Mrs. Bush wears, and I trust she 
would be careful not to wear anything that went beyond the First Lady's sense 
of propriety. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we will have to pay for round-trip air fare, and for a hotel room in 
Washington, unless, of course, the President sends Air Force One for us and 
invites us to spend the night in the White House. I wonder if there'd be any 
chance of sleeping in Lincoln's bed. 
</P>
<P>
I do hope that if anyone else writes the President in my behalf they do not 
tell him that I voted for Dukakis. After all, as a survivor of the Japanese 
attack on Hawaii, how could I have voted for a man who thought Pearl Harbor Day 
was Sept. 7?

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: COMIC BOOKS ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Big bucks are being paid for comic books. I've been enthusiastically 
collecting comic books for a number of years and have noticed, more and more, 
that some of the more expensive books are not in their original condition, but 
have been restored. 
</P>
<P>
How important is it to the collector to be aware of restoration in the 
framework of getting a fair price? -- M.H. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Awareness of restoration is very important in determining a comic 
book's collectible price. 
</P>

Here's what Robert M. Overstreet has to say about restoration in "The Official 
Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide ($12.95, paperback, 520 pages, House of 
Collectibles, Ballantine Books): 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the rare and expensive key books are being upgraded from lower grades 
to fine or very fine condition through restoration. It has been brought to our 
attention that some dealers have been selling these books to unsuspecting 
collectors/investors -- not telling them of the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases these restored books are being priced the same as unrestored 
books. 
</P>
<P>
"Very important: Examine books very closely for repairing or restoration before 
purchase. The more expensive the book, the greater the likelihood of 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"Major things to look for are: bleaching, whitening, trimming, interior spine 
and tear reinforcement, gluing, restapling, missing pieces replaced, wrinkles 
pressed out of covers, recoloring and reglossing covers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealers should state that a book has been restored and not expect to get as 
much as a book unrestored in that condition would bring." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that -- unlike some other categories of collectibles, such 
as an expertly overhauled firearm -- a restored comic book undoubtedly is not 
viewed by veteran collectors as being as valuable as one in its original, 
unrestored condition. To spot restoration marks will take some work and 
experience on the part of the collector. 
</P>

Smoking pipe expert and collector Rick Hacker has just completed the second 
edition of his "The Ultimate Pipe Book" (Autumngold Publishing, P.O. Box 634, 
Beverly Hills 90213; 330 pages, hardcover, bibliography, $19.95 at tobacconists 
or by mail). 
</P>
<P>
"You will notice that this new book is considerably thicker than the previous 
edition, and Chapters 9 and 10 now contain information on virtually any pipe 
the new and even the most advanced collector is likely to find," Hacker wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker adds that he has more than 2,000 pipes in his personal collection, 
"ranging from the 1600s up through the most modern of offerings . . . even a 
space shuttle pipe made by Dunhill."

For M.J. Sturges, who wanted bowls for false teeth with names on them, we have 
only one true source. M.S. Samuel of Chatsworth says that the Walter Drake

she should make a beeline for. A reader sent us a newspaper ad by Thrifty drugs 
that showed the entire Physicians Formula line was on sale a few weeks ago. The 
sale is over, of course, but at least Passy knows now where to go for refills. 
And if for any reason Thrifty can't help, Lois Leuch of San Dimas says that 
Physicians Formula, which is in the City of Industry, at one time helped her

Pauline's Girdle &amp; Lingerie Shop, 8815 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 
275-1557, says she still carries all of the Poirette line that is being made 
and also has several other garments Philbin might be interested in. And Nadine

YOUR WHEELS: ALCOHOL BOOSTS THE OCTANE RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I understand that under the law, oil companies are allowed to add up 
to 20% alcohol to gasoline that they sell. My mechanic told me that such 
alcohol content damages fuel injectors and cautioned me against one particular 
brand. I have been unsuccessfully trying to determine which brands of gasoline 
contain alcohol. How can I find out which fuels to avoid? -- E.W.J. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Under federal rules imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, 
refiners are permitted to add up to 10% ethanol or 5% methanol, the two most 
common alcohols used as fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Few refiners add alcohol to their fuel, however, because alcohol is more costly 
than gasoline. The federal government subsidizes ethanol by waiving 6 cents of 
the 9-cent federal excise tax. But that hardly offsets the higher cost. Ethanol 
costs about $1.20 per gallon at wholesale, far higher than the wholesale cost 
of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The key reason refiners add the alcohol is that it boosts the octane rating of 
the fuel. A 10% ethanol blend adds two to three points to the octane rating of 
gasoline, but the same octane benefit can be achieved more cheaply through 
refining methods. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, several thousand gasoline retailers nationwide were selling 
alcohol blends. Since then, however, the number is believed to have declined. 
Under California state law, gasoline retailers are supposed to disclose whether 
their gasoline contains alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
As for potential damage to your engine, some alcohol blends are safe to use, 
but others may not be safe. Most of the major auto manufacturers recommend that 
up to a 10% blend of ethanol is acceptable. Some manufacturers recommend 
against using any methanol blends, but others say a 5% methanol blend is 
acceptable. Methanol in high concentration can damage ordinary fuel tanks and 
other fuel system parts. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I purchased a very expensive two-volume service manual with my 1986 
Oldsmobile, intending to do my own diagnosis and repairs. But to diagnose a 
problem, you must be able to read the codes that are generated by the car's 
computer. The manual does not tell how to extract the codes, and I don't want 
to buy the expensive adapter that the dealer mechanics use. How can I learn the 
computer codes? -- R.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: General Motors cars are equipped with an on-board computer that detects a 
wide variety of problems in the fuel system, ignition system, transmission, 
brakes and a variety of other parts. 
</P>
<P>
When a problem is detected, the computer alerts the driver by flashing a "check 
engine" light on the dashboard. A dealership mechanic can determine the 
specific problem from the computer memory with the adapter that you mention. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, though, to obtain the trouble codes without the adapter, 
according to GM technical experts. Under the dashboard, directly behind the 
steering wheel, there is a multi-pin connector. On this connector, you will 
find a terminal labeled B. If you ground terminal B with the ignition on, the 
"check engine" light should flash once, pause and then flash twice. That 
signals a Code 12, which tells you that the diagnostics are working properly. 
Then, it should signal any other codes stored in the computer memory. After 
these codes are signaled, the "check engine" light will flash another Code 12 
to end the sequence. 
</P>
<P>
After you obtain the trouble code, you can determine what problem it relates to 
by checking the emissions section of your shop manual.

LEGAL VIEW: CAN LANDLORD KEEP SECURITY DEPOSIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Some time last year, I entered into a month-to-month rent contract 
for a two-bedroom apartment at $600 per month with one month rent in advance 
and a deposit of $1,000. I moved in, paid a month's rent of $600 plus a deposit 
of $500, the balance of $500 to be paid the next month. 
</P>
<P>
However, once I was in the apartment I noticed several defects -- broken 
louvers in all windows, leaking water in the bathroom, defective heater, broken 
garbage disposal in the kitchen sink, defective gas stove that wouldn't light 
without a match -- so I decided to move out the next month after staying for 
only 28 days. 
</P>
<P>
I demanded a refund of my deposit, but the landlord came back with a reply 
containing phony charges of damage that she alleged I did to her apartment in 
the 28 days I was there. Obviously, she wanted to justify her withholding my 
deposit money. 
</P>
<P>
Has the landlord the right to hold the security deposit of $500? If not, how 
could I get my money back? -- A.F.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: This is one of the most common legal problems between landlords and 
tenants -- the security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Your landlord does have the right to keep that portion of the security deposit 
reasonably needed to repair any damage to the premises that you caused. So even 
if the bathroom faucet was leaking when you moved in, if the kitchen sink is 
now leaking, the deposit may be used to repair the sink. However, the money is 
not supposed to be deducted for ordinary wear and tear -- although it sometimes 
requires a small claims court judge to decide what is ordinary and what is not. 
The deposit can also be used to pay for necessary cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
You are not required to pay for damage caused by a previous tenant. So all the 
defects you noticed when you moved in should not be the basis for any repair 
deductions. The trick, of course, in a dispute such as this -- when it will 
probably be your word against the landlord's -- is to have handy some helpful 
evidence, like a picture of the premises including all the broken louvres. 
(Although I don't know how you'd get a picture of a leaky faucet or a broken 
garbage disposal.) 
</P>
<P>
It's not a bad idea, generally, whenever you move into a rental property to 
take some photographs so you'll have a record of the condition in which you 
found the place. And try to have the photos developed by a shop that date 
stamps them on the back, to help prove when they were taken. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to try to get your money back, first try to be reasonable. Send the 
landlord a carefully written letter explaining your position, demanding the 
return of your deposit, and threatening to take your case to small claims court 
if she isn't reasonable. And be willing to compromise. If you can get back 
$300, I would take it. (Small claims court judges often compromise too, so 
going to court may not get you much more and will take a lot of time and 
energy.) 
</P>
<P>
If you want to be technical (and sound like you know what you're talking about) 
refer to Civil Code Section 1950.5 as the basis for your complaint. Of course, 
first you should read it -- try your local law library. The section defines the 
applicable law, but good luck trying to understand it. In the words of one 
judge, it "teeters on the brink of unintelligibility." 
</P>
<P>
But the landlord may have another claim on your money. The security deposit can 
also be used to cover unpaid rent. You were renting on a month-to-month 
tenancy, and it sounds as if you didn't give 30 days notice, so the landlord 
may claim that the deposit was used to cover the rent that was due for the last 
30 days. The landlord has a duty to mitigate the loss -- and try to find 
another tenant quickly, but you may have an uphill battle proving that another 
tenant could have been found and moved in within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, if you decide to go to small claims court, let me know how you 
do.

WHOSE ABUSE IS IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the article, "Toll-Free Line Seeks to Curb Animal Abuse" (by 
Michael Quintanilla, Oct. 2), the case of a dog poisoning is mentioned as 
animal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
This is not as serious a crime, in my opinion, as letting a dog run 
uncontrolled. I have small children. I would hate to have my child poisoned by 
someone else's trash. I don't think that is a high probability. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the chances of some "kind, gentle, wonderful" person's dog 
biting me or my children are high. And the chances that I will find my little 
ones eating dog doodoo left on my yard are very high. I love dogs too much to 
own one myself, but I can understand why other people hold them in captivity. 
Protection of human rights is paramount, however. The owners who let their dogs 
run loose, get into other persons' trash, and defecate on other persons' yards 
are, in my opinion, guilty of child abuse.

DRIVEN TO THE BOOB TUBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Is the Sky Really Falling? Two USC Professors Claim Complexity of Life 
Drives Us to the Boob Tube" (by Kathleen Hendrix, Sept. 25): TV is certainly 
less addicting than crack. Like wine, food, shopping, work, gambling or sex, it 
can be enjoyable in moderation but lethal in excess. 
</P>
<P>
But TV is not the culprit, any more than clothing manufacturers, ice cream 
makers or vineyards are. Addiction is the real, underlying problem in the 
United States today. 
</P>
<P>
Some behavioral science experts believe that we as a nation are displaying many 
of the classic symptoms typical of an alcoholic or addict. Our productivity is 
suffering. We're in debt. Our children are neglected. We don't fulfill our 
responsibilities to our loved ones and communities. Our minds are dulled. Our 
health is deteriorating. Our lives are becoming unmanageable. 
</P>
<P>
Until we learn to cope with reality "clean and sober," we'll fall further and 
further behind other, healthier nations in our ability to face up to tomorrow's 
challenges and create the wholesome, productive, creative and enjoyable life 
style we all seek.

COUNTERPOINT TO 'A CASE STUDY IN RACIAL IRONIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The irony in Karen Grigsby Bates' article about View Park ("A Case Study in 
Racial Ironies," Sept. 18) was not lost on me. 
</P>
<P>
I am white and grew up in View Park during the late '50s when the 
neighborhood's first black families moved in. I recall the panic and stampede 
of white longtime residents that left streets literally lined with For Sale 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
A multiracial group of idealistic residents -- my parents among them -- formed 
Crenshaw Neighbors. The group's purpose was to preserve the community's 
increasingly fragile racial balance by combatting local real estate brokers' 
attempts to prevent blacks from moving in, as well as to try and stem the white 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
The fragility of the balance was psychological as well as demographic; the '60s 
brought about a black consciousness that frightened whites and raised powerful 
identity questions for many blacks. But for those of us growing up together in 
View Park, our multiethnic childhood provided a unique social education that 
continues to enrich many of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, however, multiethnicity became homogeneity. The white families that 
had resisted "white flight" until the Watts Riots moved out after 1968, 
creating today's black suburb. 
</P>
<P>
I understand and deeply respect the unease expressed by View Park residents as 
whites begin to return to the area. These black families have certainly more 
than earned the right to a refuge from "ethnically diverse" professional and 
educational worlds in which they are often the token. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears that today's white return is as inevitable as white flight had 
been. I can only hope that the dream of a truly multiethnic upper-middle-class 
suburb that grew in the time of Martin Luther King can finally be realized by a 
wiser, more courageous group of residents than those who left 30 years ago.

THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE TO A BUNCH OF ACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was -- as benefit softball games go -- not a big draw for the Hollywood 
Allstars. Only some 50 people paid $5 a head to watch Mark Harmon -- People 
magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive" a couple of years ago -- and a handful of soap 
stars take on Burbank's Bluebirds at Valley Park. 
</P>
<P>
This was a far cry from the 12,000 who showed up for the Allstars' previous 
game, which took place in August at Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Allstars have been playing charity games for a decade. At Fenway, they were 
matched against a team of famous former athletes. At Valley Park two weeks ago, 
they were playing a team of local seniors (ages 55 to 62). 
</P>
<P>
Why the big turnout in Boston and the paltry one in Burbank? Louis Odell of 
Burbank thinks that he knows. Bostonians, and most everybody east of Pasadena, 
are notoriously celebrity-starved and hungry for anything Hollywood, "but 
around here, we're pretty blase," said Odell, a retired newspaper carrier. It's 
hard to get excited over celebrities when on any given day you can always find 
one in the produce section at Ralphs, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We're too close to the Hollywood scene," Odell theorized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bluebirds Supporters 
</P>
<P>
Odell was sitting in the bleachers at Valley Park with a friend, waiting for 
the game to begin. He was there, as were most of the people, to support the 
Bluebirds. 
</P>
<P>
The game served two purposes. First, proceeds helped send the Burbank-based 
team to the Seniors Slow-Pitch World Series in Greensboro, N. C. (where the 
team finished in a tie for fifth last weekend). Second, it gave the Bluebirds a 
pre-series warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
So, unlike the Allstars, who goofed around before the game, the Bluebirds were 
taking it seriously. They all were top athletes in their day -- a lot of them 
played minor league baseball -- and the last thing they wanted was to get blown 
out by a bunch of actors. Their pregame drills were organized and snappy, and 
their manager, former minor leaguer Bill Burton, even laid blue shag carpeting 
on the dugout bench for them to sit on. 
</P>
<P>
The Allstars seemed to take as much delight in needling their manager, Russ 
Gill, as in drilling practice balls off the high chain-link fence in left. 
"Hey, Russ, that rash disappear yet?" cracked Tony (Madman) Longo, a big, beefy 
character actor who looks like a grizzly on steroids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harmon Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
Gill was trying to put together the lineup without Harmon. The word was that 
Harmon was in San Diego filming "Cold Heaven" and might be able to make it, but 
the odds were that he would opt to spend the day with wife Pam Dawber instead 
of traipsing to the San Fernando Valley to get dirty on a softball field. 
Gregory Harrison, another Allstars member, had already decided to skip the game

"I never know who's going to be available and who's going to be off working 
somewhere," Gill said.

But a few minutes before the game, Harmon made a dramatic entrance. Carrying 
his gear in a maroon gym bag, he walked into the park and hurriedly changed 
into his uniform. But he wasn't able to get in any practice and nearly missed 
the introductions. Announcer Joe Rico had to assure the crowd that Harmon would 
make an appearance on the field "once he puts his pants on." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Allstars whipped the pants off the old guys, 19-6. The 
Bluebirds trailed by only 6-5 after four innings but withered under a 
relentless battering by stronger, younger arms and legs. 
</P>

'Just Got Blitzed' 
</P>
<P>
"Youth just killed us," said Burton, sports director of the Burbank Parks and 
Recreation Department. "We just got blitzed." 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody was disappointed. Priscilla Reyes had traveled all the way 
from Carson to see her favorite soap star, Drake Hogestyn, who plays a cop 
named Roman on "Days of Our Lives." Reyes is coordinator of Hogestyn's fan club 
and when he hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning, she couldn't have been 
happier if Roman had nailed a homicidal maniac. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, who made a few acrobatic plays at shortstop, was the center of 
attention for the shutterbugs after the game, and he willingly posed with fans. 
Unlike celebs who play in the ShowBiz Softball League -- where cameras and pens 
are barred and publicists roam the sidelines keeping the media away -- the 
Allstars encourage interaction with their fans, and they don't have to beat the 
other team to sleep well that night. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be better for what this team is all about if we lose rather than win," 
Harmon said. "But none of us goes out there to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Even with only 50 witnesses.

Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science by Royston M. Roberts (John 
Wiley &amp; Sons: $18.95; $12.95, paperback; 288 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The future, it is said, always comes from around a corner where you weren't 
looking. 
</P>
<P>
This fact has been observed for centuries and stated in many ways. It is true 
of professional life and personal life and may be truest of all in the area of 
scientific research, where myriad discoveries have been made essentially by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Serendipity" by Royston M. Roberts is the story of several dozen of such 
discoveries -- ones you know about, like penicillin, and ones that are less 
well known, like electromagnetism. In each case, researchers were looking for 
one thing and discovered another. Or perhaps they were looking for nothing in 
particular but noticed something unusual and pursued it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference in Discovery 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, a professor of chemistry at the University of Texas, distinguishes 
between what he calls "true serendipity" -- a completely accidental discovery 
that no one was looking for -- and "pseudo-serendipity" -- an accidental 
discovery of something that someone was looking for. Here's the difference: 
</P>
<P>
"Charles Goodyear discovered the vulcanization process for rubber when he 
accidentally dropped a piece of rubber mixed with sulfur onto a hot stove. For 
many years Goodyear had been obsessed with finding a way to make rubber useful. 
Because it was an accident that led to the successful process so diligently 
sought for, I call this a pseudo-serendipitous discovery. In contrast, George 
deMestral had no intention of inventing a fastener (Velcro) when he looked to 
see why some burs stuck tightly to his clothing." 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting and useful distinction, which, like many distinctions, 
tends to blur at the meeting point. But the fact that the categories are not 
completely distinct does not deprive them of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overflowing Bath 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the history of science contains many completely accidental (truly 
serendipitous) discoveries -- such as the discovery of oral contraceptives -- 
as well as many that were only pseudo-serendipitous -- such as Archimedes' 
discovery of how to measure the volume of an irregular object, which came to 
him while sitting in the bath. 
</P>
<P>
Archimedes had been thinking about the problem, and realized the solution when 
he saw water overflowing from his tub. By contrast, the discoverers of oral 
contraceptives, Russell Marker and Carl Djerassi, weren't looking for oral 
contraceptives at all. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, someone making an accidental discovery has to be alert to it. 
As Louis Pasteur said, "Chance favors the prepared mind." If Alexander Fleming 
had discarded the contaminated petri dish in his laboratory (as many researcher 
undoubtedly would have done), penicillin would not have been discovered -- at 
least not then and not by him. 
</P>
<P>
That's one important difference between a truly serendipitous and a merely 
pseudo-serendipitous discovery. If a would-be truly serendipitous discovery 
passes unnoticed, it is gone. But if a researcher fails to notice a would-be 
pseudo-serendipitous discovery, there's always a chance that he may come upon 
it again. At least he's working on that problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Science 
</P>
<P>
"Serendipity" is a straightforward history of science, told in an anecdotal, 
personal style. There does not appear to be much original research here. 
Roberts has collected his stories from existing works and sometimes quotes from 
published accounts by the scientists who made the discoveries. For the 
discovery of LSD, for example, we have the laboratory notebook of Albert 
Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who accidentally made some in 1938 and then ingested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' book has the tone of the histories of science we used to read in high 
school. Paul de Kruif's "Microbe Hunters" comes to mind. It's the textbook 
story of science: researchers in their laboratories motivated by the quest for 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
That is certainly the story scientists like to tell about themselves and their 
work, and it is certainly part of the picture. (As many other authors have told 
us in recent decades, it is not the whole picture of how science operates.) 
</P>
<P>
But these stories may help inspire young people to pursue careers in scientific 
research. There is a great thrill in finding things out, which Roberts' book 
makes clear. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes clear that you don't always discover what you were trying to and 
that you must be constantly alert to new paths and new possibilities as they 
arise. That lesson extends far beyond science.

BANK PRESIDENT LUCE IS 1 OF 9 TO RECEIVE ARTS AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Gordon C. Luce, president of Great American Bank in San Diego, is among nine 
California artists, arts patrons and community leaders who will be honored for 
significant contributions to the arts with the first Governor's Awards for the 
Arts, the California Arts Council announced Wednesday. The annual awards, 
sponsored by the council, will be presented by Gov. George Deukmejian and Mrs. 
Deukmejian at a black-tie fund-raiser Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The artists chosen are painter Richard Diebenkorn, visual artist; 
musician/producer Quincy Jones, entertainment industry; choreographer Bella 
Lewitzky, artist, and author Maxine Hong-Kingston, literary artist. 
</P>
<P>
The awards will also honor individuals and organizations involved in arts 
education and those that have provided financial support to the California arts 
community. In addition to Luce, who is being honored as a community cultural 
leader, recipients are: California State University Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, 
arts in education (individual); Phyllis Wattis of San Francisco, individual 
patron; Times Mirror (Los Angeles headquarters), corporate patron, and the Los 
Angeles Music Center Education Division, arts in education. 
</P>
<P>
"By honoring these outstanding individuals and organizations," Deukmejian said 
in a prepared statement, "we also acknowledge the enormous artistic resources 
of our state. California is a giant in its creative talent." 
</P>
<P>
The awards, which consist of a certificate from the governor and an artwork 
being created by sculptor DeWain Valentine, are the brainchild of Joyce 
Pollack, member of the California Arts Council and chair of the statewide 
awards program. Pollack said the official awards are welcome recognition that 
is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor agreed to establish the award at the urging of the California 
Arts Council," Pollack said, "the main reason being that California is one of 
the few states in the Union not to have an official awards program honoring 
arts people." 
</P>
<P>
The awards ceremony Nov. 2 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel will benefit the 
California State Summer School for the Arts Foundation, a five-week program for 
talented high school students aspiring to careers in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Deukmejian will present "The First Lady Award," to a young artist from 
the summer-school program. MARY HELEN BERG

'LONDON' IS A LITTLE BIT UNDERDEVELOPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Company production of "The Mikado" may 
have closed less than two weeks ago, but the play's "Three Little Maids From 
School" are still singing at the Casa del Prado Theatre in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Except that now, instead of being portrayed by tittering females with names 
such as Yum-Yum, Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo, the parts are being sung by actors 
playing the parts of Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Alexander Woolcott in "London 
Is a Little Bit of All Right!" 
</P>
<P>
"Three Little Maids" is one of more than 30 songs of the Gilbert and Sullivan 
era, compiled in revue format by J. Sherwood Montgomery, by about a dozen 
composers on both sides of the Atlantic. The production runs through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery, who also directed, designed the set and is featured in the 
five-person ensemble, tosses intriguing snippets of trivia into the mix. For 
example, the fact that Woolcott, Lunt and Coward actually did sing "Three 
Little Maids" in a command performance for the king of England. 
</P>
<P>
But, although it is amusing to see Montgomery (as Woolcott), Leon Natker (as 
Coward) and Jeffrey Rockwell (as Lunt) fluttering their fans as they sing, the 
effect is about as amusing as can be expected of an inside joke about a handful 
of people who are no longer household names. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, the framework of "London" is a theater tour by the flamboyant 
critic Woolcott, lasting from 1919 to 1939 and taking place on both sides of 
the Atlantic. But little witty cocktail exchanges and snippets from famous 
reviews do not really tell us who these people were. 
</P>
<P>
We never get more than a fleeting sense of what London and New York were like 
back then between the two World Wars or what it meant to be members of the 
"Algonquin Group" and the "Savoy Hotel Grille Group." 
</P>
<P>
It does open a window of understanding slightly just to hear more than 30 songs 
from the period, both from the still-famous -- Coward, Irving Berlin, Gilbert 
&amp; Sullivan, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and George and Ira Gershwin -- and 
from lesser-known figures such as Douglas Furber and Philip Braham, Andy Razaf, 
Dion Titheridge and Ivor Novello, and Arthur Le Clerq. 
</P>
<P>
But it makes one long for a better tour guide to explain who listened to whom 
and who was affected by whom, and how these songs fared against the desperately 
gay background of a barely recovered world that was about to fall apart again. 
</P>
<P>
The problems with the show are partly a case of revues working better in 
settings more intimate than the broad Casa del Prado stage, or as tributes to a 
single composer or performer. If you're going to span the music of a period, it 
helps to have a better sense of the period that produced the work. 
</P>
<P>
The material is aided by a spirited and skillful cast, from the graceful Patti 
Goodwin, who injects great fun into the part of the glitteringly funny Gertrude 
Lawrence, to Montgomery, at his best with wry gems such as Coward's "Don't Put 
Your Daughter on the Stage, Mrs. Worthington" and John Wharton's "The Tale of 
the Oyster" (who dreams of being eaten at a sophisticated cocktail party). 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell brings style and assurance to his more romantic numbers, "Gershwin's 
"A Foggy Day" and Coward's "Sail Away" and "If Love Were All." 
</P>
<P>
Natker, who plays a dapper Coward, gets to go all out in Cole Porter's "In the 
Still of the Night," which is, unfortunately, arranged a bit too briskly for 
such a romantic melody by Hollace Koman (who shares the piano duties on stage 
with Rockwell). 
</P>
<P>
But the real weak link is Dee Ann Johnston, whose performance Sunday would have 
been vastly improved by an understudy, or perhaps a dose of cold medicine. 
</P>
<P>
All the efforts add up to a show that is pleasant, even delightful in parts, 
but decidedly uneven and lacking in anything akin to historical, sociological 
or dramatic momentum. This show is a reworking of the "London Is a Little Bit 
of All Right!" that the San Diego Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Company debuted last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next year, if the company goes for further revisions, it will be more 
than a little bit of all right. Right now, it is decidedly less. 
</P>
<P>
"LONDON IS A LITTLE BIT OF ALL RIGHT!" 
</P>
<P>
Written and compiled by J. Sherwood Montgomery. Direction and set design by J. 
Sherwood Montgomery. Musical director is Hollace Koman. Lighting by Ron 
Vodicka. With Patti Goodwin, J. Sherwood Montgomery, Dee Ann Johnston, Leon 
Natker, Hollace Koman and Jeffrey Rockwell. At 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, with 
a Sunday matinee at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $10-16. At the Casa del Prado 
Theatre, Balboa Park. (619) 231-5714.

Twenty years ago tonight, "Monty Python's Flying Circus" first aired in a 
late-night slot on the British Broadcasting Corp. Some claim the BBC hoped no 
one would notice the show, replete as it was with lampoons of old ladies and 
politicians, gags, bizarre animation and naughty British humor. But, of course, 
its audience soared and "Monty Python" went on to attract an international 
following. The "Python" actors planned to get together for a 20th anniversary 
reunion Wednesday in London, but canceled the party because one of the group, 
Graham Chapman, is recovering from cancer treatments. ALEENE MacMINN

"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," a sleeper box-office hit that grossed $39 
million, has duplicated this success on home video, inching up one notch into 
the coveted Top Five circle -- No. 5 on the Billboard rental chart. The Tom 
Selleck caper comedy, "Her Alibi," is doing better-than-expected rental 
business, jumping to No. 8 in its second chart week. "Skin Deep," the raunchy 
John Ritter comedy, cracked the Top 10, landing at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
* The consensus was that "Fletch Lives," the further adventures of Chevy 
Chase's popular movie character, was just a mildly funny sequel. Still, it was 
a decent box-office draw ($32 million gross) and, at No. 13 in its second week 
on the rental chart, is certain to break into the Top 10.

Former President Reagan has narrated a half-hour documentary called "The Voice 
of Hope" about Project Hope's programs around the world. The film, shot on 
location in China, Swaziland, Brazil and Grenada, tells about the nonprofit 
organization's dedication to improving the health of the world's poor. The film 
will be released in late October to cable, network affiliates and civic 
organizations around the United States. Reagan showed he was an old pro at 
narration -- it took him only one read-through. ALEENE MacMINN

EURYTHMEUM STUTTGART'S CLASSICAL EXERCISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a sight to behold: 
</P>
<P>
The noble, statuesque figures swathed in ankle-length tunics with flowing silk 
scarfs draped over their arms looked nothing like dancers we know today. They 
wore little or no makeup. The women's hair, gently pinned back, even predated 
the small sleek chignons emblematic of '40s modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
And when -- under plain, bright lights Tuesday at the Wadsworth Theater -- 
members of the Eurythmeum Stuttgart began to move, they resembled a dancing ode 
to a Grecian urn, antiquity and classicism extolled. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom, in these days of the global village, does an art form manage to stay 
preserved against instantly conveyed happenings, modes and fads. But the 
Stuttgarters, for better or worse, are parochial as an institution. They 
consciously resist outside influences. Their obeisance is to the metaphysics of 
movement and so an aura of ritual obtains. 
</P>
<P>
The steps are nothing elaborate -- they consist of walking and running -- and 
the choreographic patterns, courtesy of 82-year-old director Else Klink, could 
pass for slightly ordered free form. But the arms and hands mirror the music, 
much as do an orchestra conductor's. Trilled notes, for example, produce 
fingers aflutter in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Musical mood is the key, of course: A largo signals solemnity, the lights dim 
and the costumes become dark shrouds. An allegro inspires quick movement and 
brightness. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all its literalism one can admire the plastique and eloquence that the 
best of these eurythmists can offer. Some, among the 16 touring members, are 
better than others and not all conform to established standards regarding 
technique, age and body proportions. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate these obsolete pioneers over their two-and-a-half-hour program, 
however, requires a special sensibility. Partly it depends on how long one can 
be fascinated by something so simplistic. And if one wanted to draw the 
toughest comparison it would be to "interpretive" dancing -- the sort of thing 
children might naturally do on hearing music. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, several little girls in the sparse audience (a strictly non-dance 
crowd) got the point: They waved their arms about in imitation of the on-stage 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Most engaging, although over-long, was the "Peer Gynt" entry. Because it 
employed two exceptionally skilled narrators, Annika Jaensch and Martin 
Porteous, who could convincingly portray all the characters, interest flagged 
only somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
But the pattern of mime visualizing spoken text (Ibsen) and movement 
representing music (Grieg) -- provided by pianists Julian Clarke and Nancy 
Ruczynski, cellist Lucas Fels -- bogged down in routine alternation. And in an 
unfortunate bit of casting Benedikt Zweifel, as Peer, looked twice the age of 
Christa Maria Schmidt, his mother. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission came Shostakovich's Cello Sonata in D minor and here any 
merit the Stuttgarters might have broke down -- especially for those who do not 
care to see every note or phrase physicalized by movement. Lacking real 
choreographic ideas, the exercise became an intrusion on the music. 
</P>
<P>
The next items, billed as "Light Pieces For Luck and Laughter," took the 
dancers out of their Grecian tunics and consisted in an assortment of clowns, 
ducks and bumblebees -- fare more appropriate for a nursery school than an 
adult audience. The program ended, and not a moment too soon, with a Brahms 
Hungarian Dance.

LUFT MELDS GARLAND TOUCHES INTO OWN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorna Luft's return engagement at the Cinegrill in Hollywood was billed -- with 
classic hyperbole -- as a triumphant return. One suspects that the 
hard-working, ever-practical Luft may have blanched somewhat when she saw the 
marquee's overblown announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Her performance Tuesday night, however, was somewhat less triumphant than it 
was reminiscent. Singing with a far more relaxed and assured manner than had 
been the case with her earlier Cinegrill engagement, Luft looked and sounded 
strikingly like her mother, Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
The similarity seemed especially fascinating in the light of a recent 
performance by Jim Bailey at the Cinegrill in which he devoted an entire 
evening to a Judy Garland "illusion." But Luft's appearance was the real stuff. 
Her moves, her manner, even the occasional crack in her voice, were the very 
essence of Garland. 
</P>
<P>
To her credit, Luft has molded this natural resource into a variation which is, 
despite the familiarity of its source, uniquely her own. On songs like "Who 
Will Buy" and "Right as the Rain," her warm, jazz-like phrasing and powerful 
ability to tell a story begged comparison with no one. A medley of "I'm 
Nobody's Baby" and "My Buddy" -- a familiar item in her show -- was once again 
a highlight. 
</P>
<P>
Luft's only problem was an occasional tendency to overestimate the dimensions 
of the room. Too many numbers climaxed in brassy, oversized endings that were 
appropriate enough for a Las Vegas venue, but far too large for the intimate 
confines of the Cinegrill. 
</P>
<P>
Luft continues at the Cinegrill tonight through Saturday. She returns next 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Oct. 14.DON HECKMAN

OFF-THE-WALL HOUR OF WOODY ALLEN'S 'DEATH' IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great Woody Allen obsesses on a lot of things, but, as every fan knows, his 
favorite misery is dwelling on death. 
</P>
<P>
His comic ruminations on the big sleep show up in most of his movies, many of 
his short stories and plenty of his plays. He even wrote a one-act, named 
simply and appropriately "Death." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton College theater arts department has taken this goofy, neurotic, 
boisterous one-hour-long number and run with it -- Tuesday's opening night had 
the right pace (quick) and the right attitude (off-the-wall). 
</P>
<P>
"Death" loosely follows Kleinman, a typically compulsive Allen anti-hero, all 
worry and hesitation, as he gets entangled in a vigilante group's crazed 
efforts to track down a homicidal maniac who's running amok in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman, like the doomed character in Kafka's "The Trial," is wrested from his 
bed and tossed into the fray, never knowing exactly what the whole deal is 
about. First he's a suspect, then he's an important part of the posse, then 
he's a suspect again. Finally, he's a victim. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he runs into an insane doctor, an insane hooker (get a look at 
Traci McWain's incredible hat) and, eventually, the insane murderer. All the 
while, he nervously gabs about this and that, especially death. As Kleinman 
mutters at one point, "It's not that I'm afraid to die, I just don't want to be 
there when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Director Brian Kojac apparently feels that no actor but Woody Allen could do 
justice to Kleinman, so he has Joey Napoli play him like a Woody clone. That's 
OK, though -- Napoli does a pretty decent impression; it's an amusing, if not 
always original, performance from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast also adds to the fun, although the roles don't require 
much more than going to the brink. These are exaggerated portrayals for 
exaggerated characters. 
</P>
<P>
There are some clever turns from Kojac. The first scenes, of the 
power-tool-carrying vigilantes massed together and moving crab-like across the 
stage, is accompanied by the Talking Heads' "Psycho Killer." We get a 
counterpoint to that at play's end when everybody gathers around the body of 
Kleinman and croons "The Lion Sleeps Tonight." Manhattan may be a jungle, but 
Kleinman was no lion. 
</P>
<P>
The program opens with a 20-minute adaptation of Allen's short story "The Whore 
of Mensa," now entitled "Street Smart." This is just a trifle, sort of a 
prolonged gag that has a few sharp lines but doesn't march anywhere. The joke 
centers on buying prostitutes for their pretentious intellectual capacity 
instead of their physical gifts. 
</P>
<P>
In it, a private eye named Arrow (Thomas M. Nealeigh) goes undercover to ferret 
out Flossie's (Karl Schott's) ring of "Moby Dick"-spouting girls. Arrow is 
hard-boiled and Flossie is funny as a guy in drag "with Brenda Vaccaro's 
voice." The bit may be worth it just to see Laura Lynn Orlow fake a good orgasm 
while babbling smart stuff. 
</P>
<P>
'DEATH,' 'STREET SMART'

MOSCOW VIRTUOSI, SPIVAKOV RETURN TO ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moscow Virtuosi gave its first Southern California performance two years 
ago on the night of the stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
No such excitement colored the first concert of the Soviet troupe's return 
visit Tuesday night, back in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center -- and again sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
(The ensemble was scheduled to move on to Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on 
Wednesday night.) 
</P>
<P>
But there were thrills enough, as violinist-conductor Vladimir Spivakov led his 
chamber orchestra -- including oboes and horns and now numbering 26 players -- 
on a jolly romp through standard works by Bach, Stravinsky and Haydn and one 
novelty, Penderecki's Capriccio for oboe and 11 strings (1965). 
</P>
<P>
As before, the all-male orchestra demonstrated polished technical 
accomplishment and high spirits, a modicum of interest in matters of style -- 
its use of harpsichord turned out to be arbitrary and sometimes inaudible, for 
instance -- and a palpable wish to please. Such a wish seemed to be expressed 
in three audience-courting encores after the program proper: the Waltz from 
Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings; Bartok's Romanian Folk Dances, and the 
Polka from Shostakovich's ballet, "L'Age d'Or." 
</P>
<P>
But top-drawer -- a word one learned, lest we forget, from Virgil Thomson -- 
performances characterized this entire event. At the beginning, when Spivakov 
and first violinist Arkady Futer became soloists in Bach's familiar D-minor 
Concerto for two violins, there may not have been a lot of Baroque definition, 
and not even very much transparency in the string playing, but the solidity, 
directness and scrubbed nature of the reading still left little to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
And Stravinsky's Concerto in D for strings elicited the best kind of 
Russian-style pungency with lushness, in an immaculate account marked by a 
tight blend of urgency and relaxation. Spivakov may look like a fussy conductor 
-- he often seems to be making twice as many gestures as he needs -- but the 
sound-results usually contradict that impression. 
</P>
<P>
In the brief Penderecki piece, in which Alexei Utkin was the resourceful and 
witty soloist -- it is an amusing little essay full of emotional twists as well 
as insect imitations -- Spivakov &amp; Co. seemed to find all the nuances of 
color and contrast the composer may have envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Best came last, in a full-throated but style-conscious performance of Haydn's 
ever-wondrous "Farewell" Symphony, a work of many facets and moods, as well as 
changing textures. With 30% less string vibrato and 25% more instrumental 
transparency, it would probably have approached perfection.

ABOUT WINE: A FOUNDING FATHER'S THEORY AND DREAM OF A WINE COUNTRY IN VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Jefferson was right, but it took two centuries to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's most aristocratic president and a wine lover of monumental 
proportions attempted to grow grapevines and make wine at his Virginia 
plantation for decades. All efforts failed, but Jefferson continued to believe 
Virginia could make fine wine. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to solve the mysteries of Virginia's soil and climate, Jefferson 
imported grapevines from Chateau d'Yquem in Bordeaux, as well as vines from 
Burgundy and Tuscany, to see how they would grow. Despite regular failure (due 
largely to the harsh winter climate), he tried for more than 40 years to prove 
his theory right. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all his failures, the message he left -- that Virginia could become 
hospitable for fine wine grapes -- was not ignored, and today an energetic wine 
industry is thriving in Virginia. Some 40 Virginia wineries produce more than 
80,000 cases of wine, host 100,000 visitors on tours every year, and the 
governor of Virginia has officially recognized the strides made by today's 
Virginia farmers and wine makers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Served at Official Functions 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Gov. Gerald L. Baliles serves Virginia wine proudly at major state 
functions, and he helped coalesce the state's budding wine industry in a 
memorable speech on Sept. 28, 1988, when he called for a unified effort to make 
and market Virginia wine. Baliles also pledged assistance from the state to see 
that it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an important event for all of us," said Shep Rouse, wine maker at 
Montdomaine Cellars, a winery located near the site of the old Monticello 
property Jefferson once farmed. "The governor brought a lot of folks together." 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, at the awards dinner for the 1989 Governor's Cup Wine 
Competition in historic Williamsburg, Baliles spoke of the strides made in the 
12 months since his pledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that an old industry was in the process of being revived by Virginia's 
wine-growing pioneers, and I felt that the state government could draw them 
together," he said. "Wine growing in America was born in Virginia, and when it 
comes to selling it, the state and the winegrowers can work together . . . to 
increase the visibility of Virginia's newest old industry. 
</P>
<P>
"When history is written, I would hope that the 1990s will be seen as the 
golden age of Virginia wine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than Mere Local Pride 
</P>
<P>
Tasting the wines indicates that something more than local pride is at play 
here. The wines are quite good. The Governor's Cup-winning wine, 1988 
Williamsburg Winery Chardonnay, is a stylish, elegant wine with superb fruit. 
It is a bit soft, but impeccably made by Fresno State graduate Steve Warner. 
</P>
<P>
The white wines of Virginia at present show greater potential than the reds, 
partly because red wine grapes often need a longer growing season, and this 
southeastern area of Virginia can experience some warm, humid days late in a 
growing season. The only other gold medal wine at the event, 1988 Rapidan Dry 
Riesling, is a delightful wine of floral nuances and richness. 
</P>
<P>
However, superb Merlots from Montdomaine and Accomack, and excellent Cabernets 
from Linden and Montdomaine show that red wine is possible here too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Colonial Life 
</P>
<P>
Wine consumption in pre-Revolutionary times was a daily occurrence so ingrained 
in the upper classes that "no one thought to write about it, it was so widely 
accepted as part of life," said Betsi Drumbore, a tour guide with Colonial 
Williamsburg, the agency that preserves the history of this region. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging look at the wine and food of the colonies in the two 
centuries following the 1607 founding of Jamestown, Drumbore and historical 
archeologist William Pittman said wine was an integral part of the lives of the 
colonists. 
</P>
<P>
The typical midday meal, which often started about 2 p.m. and lasted until as 
late as 5, was heavily oriented toward meats -- beef, smoked pork, rabbit and 
other game. "The poor people ate vegetables," said Drumbore. 
</P>
<P>
On a sideboard in a typical dining room was wine, generally imported, served 
from decanters filled from the cask or, in some cases, from bottles. 
Occasionally, wine was served from a punch bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The supper meal, which started late in the evening, was light, but also 
accompanied by wine, and occasionally finished with a glass of sack (Sherry) 
with a dessert that included wine in the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Dry wine from France and Madeira were both popular with meals, said Pittman 
(Madeira matched with sweetmeats), and there was no known opposition to wine 
consumption by any organized group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Real Force 
</P>
<P>
"We see no broadsides against the consumption of alcohol at all until you get 
to the gin age, when Queen Anne took over in England in 1704," said Pittman. 
Until then, wine was the primary beverage in the Colonies; distilled spirits 
played a far less important role. 
</P>
<P>
But English gin became a force in the Colonies after 1651 when Parliament, 
attempting to control trade with the Colonies, passed the infamous Navigation 
Acts, Pittman said. He said the British government wanted to discourage the use 
of foreign (French, primarily) wine because of a trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
He said excise taxes on wine drove their price up, and that led to greater use 
of gin (which was an English product and which had a lower tax). 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson opposed what he called "ardent spirits," and actively promoted wine 
as a beverage that, in moderation, enhanced life style and health. 
</P>
<P>
"Good wine is a necessity of life for me," said Jefferson in one of a series of 
oft-quoted lines from his writings. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson liked wine so much that he became the first American wine connoisseur 
and educator, teaching the joys and benefits of fine wine to others, said John 
Hailman. 
</P>
<P>
Hailman, syndicated wine columnist with Gannett News Service who lives in 
Oxford, Miss., has spent more than 15 years working on a book tentatively 
called "The Wines of Thomas Jefferson." 
</P>
<P>
His 850-page unpublished manuscript speaks of Jefferson's efforts to grow wine 
in Virginia, not only for reasons of local pride, but because if it could be 
produced in the Colonies, it would not be subjected to higher taxation as were 
imported wines. And he felt that wine was a beverage usually consumed 
moderately with meals, unlike higher-proof products. 
</P>
<P>
"Jefferson had many disappointments trying to grow grapes to make wine," said 
Hailman. "Even in his last plantings in 1811, he felt that Virginia could 
become a great wine region because of the soil, and he really thought the 
climate was not too severe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tragic Winter Frost 
</P>
<P>
However, said Hailman, those vines planted in 1811 were nearly wiped out by a 
winter frost and that broke Jefferson's spirit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even at age 82 in 1825, the year before he died, Jefferson wrote letters to 
others who sought to make wine, trying to encourage them to keep trying, said 
Hailman. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson believed firmly in the healthful benefits of consuming moderate 
amounts of wine, and conversely he was adamant that stronger drinks were 
dangerous to society. 
</P>
<P>
Hailman says tavern lists of the revolutionary period refer to a drink called 
Termo, which was white Lisbon wine (shipped from Portugal, but whose prior 
lineage was often unknown) with brandy added. He said Jefferson decried Termo 
because of its higher alcoholic content. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such high-proof aberrations, Jefferson imported his own wines from 
Bordeaux, Burgundy and elsewhere on the Continent, even though they were 
subject to high import duties, and were threatened with local taxation after 
the Colonies won their independence from Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"I rejoice as a moralist at the prospect of a reduction of the duties on wine 
by our national legislature," he once wrote to a colleague. "No nation is 
drunken where wine is cheap, and none sober where the dearness of wine 
substitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage . . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Who Will Not Prefer It?' 
</P>
<P>
"Fix but the duty . . . and we can drink wine here as cheap as we do grog, and 
who will not prefer it? Its extended use will carry health and comfort to a 
much enlarged circle." 
</P>
<P>
Hailman said much of the wine sold in Colonial Williamsburg was perishable and 
was meant to be consumed rapidly. As the wine (shipped in cask) sat around, it 
deteriorated. Yet Pittman showed examples of wine bottles shipped to the 
Colonies that contained finer wine. These were often found in archeological 
digs around the former homes of the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Tavern wine was, however, variable. In some taverns in Williamsburg, the same 
wine often was quoted at two prices, "straight" at a lower price and with a 
lump of sugar for a higher price. The sugar was presumably to make palatable a 
spoiled wine. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some wine often ended up in cocktails, which Pittman said were blends 
of various wines made by gentlemen for gentlemen (they were not for ladies). 
This may have been done to salvage bad wine by adding something good to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Educational Effort 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson, meanwhile, did his best to educate the American aristocracy of the 
greatness of wine with meals. Hailman says Jefferson often gave George 
Washington and John Adams bottles of the wines he imported. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington was a big claret drinker," said Hailman, "and he introduced (James) 
Madison and (James) Monroe to wine, and he taught John Quincy Adams about wine, 
and how to drink it and serve it." 
</P>
<P>
Wine also was used in cooking: sack was used to flavor carrot pudding; other 
products were pickled in a combination of wine and vinegar; bread fritters were 
like today's French toast, but made with wine-based batter (and no dairy 
products), and a dessert called syllabub is a concoction of eggs, cream and 
wine that separates into two layers and is served like a pudding. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson's legacy has not been forgotten and the wines now being made, 160 
years after his death from the same soil he tilled, pay homage to an American 
all wine lovers should toast. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Beringer Gamay Beaujolais ($6) -- Lovely deep fruit that 
hints at cranberries and blackberries and a slight jam quality make the aroma 
most appealing. The taste is soft and ripe, and the wine takes a chilling, 
which helps it match with lighter foods, even some seafood.

MICROWAVE . . . : ELECTRONIC SHORTCUTS TO THE COOK'S RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the microwave oven's hidden bonuses is that it simplifies so many 
once-tedious meal preparation and cooking jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The clearing of murky honey, for example. The last-minute ripening of green 
avocados. The flaming of spirits. And these are just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
With a microwave, you can increase the amount of juice in lemons and limes, 
oranges and grapefruits so that you get more per squeeze. You can even simplify 
the shelling of nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Clear Crystallized Honey or Preserves: Uncap jar and if it's more than half 
full -- or if honey or preserves are in plastic container -- empty into bowl 
twice its volume. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power), allowing one to 1 
1/2 minutes per cup and stirring or rotating container 180 degrees when half of 
time time has elapsed until all sugar crystals are dissolved. Cool and use 
within one to two days. 
</P>
<P>
Warm Pancake Syrup: Place one-half cup syrup or honey in microwave-safe, 
one-cup measure or jar and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 30 seconds. For one 
cup syrup, use two-cup measure and microwave 45 to 55 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Melt Semisweet Chocolate Bits: Arrange one to two cups chocolate bits 
doughnut-fashion in microwave-safe 9-inch pie plate and microwave, uncovered, 
on MEDIUM (50% power), allowing two to 2 1/2 minutes for one cup and three to 
four minutes for two cups until bits are glossy (they'll hold their shape). Let 
stand, uncovered, one minute, then stir. 
</P>
<P>
Shell Nuts: Place one pound unshelled almonds, Brazil nuts, filberts, pecans or 
walnuts in three-quart, microwave-safe casserole. Add two cups hot water, cover 
with lid or vented plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH four to five minutes 
until boiling. Let stand, covered, one minute. Drain, dry on paper towels, cool 
and crack -- nuts will be easy to extract. Shell nuts over bowl as some may 
contain water. Spread shelled nuts on paper towel and dry overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Butter-Brown Nuts: Place one tablespoon butter or margarine on 
wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe 9-inch pie plate and microwave on HIGH 25 to 
30 seconds. Stir in one-half cup nuts and toast as directed above. For one cup 
nuts, use larger pie plate, two tablespoons butter and microwave 35 to 45 
seconds to melt. For two cups nuts, use four tablespoons butter and microwave 
55 to 65 seconds to melt. 
</P>
<P>
Increase Juice of Citrus Fruits: Microwave whole refrigerator-cold fruit, 
uncovered, on HIGH just until warm, allowing 40 seconds for one fruit, 60 
seconds for two and 1 1/2 to two minutes for four. Halve times for 
room-temperature fruit. Roll fruit on counter with palm, then cut and squeeze. 
This technique also makes citrus fruits easier to peel. 
</P>
<P>
Thaw Frozen Fruit Juice Concentrates: Remove one end of can and microwave, 
uncovered, on MEDIUM, allowing two to 2 1/2 minutes for six-ounce can, four to 
4 1/2 minutes for 12-ounce can. Stir well. Juice liquefies but doesn't heat. 
</P>
<P>
Plump Dried Fruits: Spread one pound dried fruit in microwave-safe pie plate 
and sprinkle with three tablespoons water. Cover with vented plastic wrap and 
microwave on HIGH 2 1/2 to three minutes, stirring at half time. Let stand, 
covered, two minutes to plump fully. Drain or not as recipe directs. 
</P>
<P>
Plump Raisins and Dried Currants: Spread one pound seedless raisins or currants 
in microwave-safe casserole at least 10 inches across. Sprinkle with two 
tablespoons water, fruit juice, brandy or rum. Cover with vented plastic wrap 
and microwave on HIGH two to 2 1/2 minutes. Let stand, covered, two minutes to 
plump fully. Drain before using in baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
Macerate Candied Fruit: Microwave one-quarter cup brandy, Grand Marnier or 
other fruit liqueur in uncovered one-quart microwave-safe bowl 30 seconds on 
HIGH. Stir in one cup finely diced candied fruit, dried currants or raisins and 
microwave, uncovered, on HIGH two minutes. Let stand, uncovered, until all 
liquid is absorbed. Use as directed in fruit cakes or steamed puddings. 
</P>
<P>
Soften Under-Ripe Avocados: Pierce avocado once or twice, place on upside-down 
saucer and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 30 to 60 seconds, turning over and 
rotating 180 degrees at half time, until warm. Cool and peel. 
</P>
<P>
Flame Liquor: Microwave one-quarter cup brandy, Cognac, light or dark rum in 
uncovered one-cup measure on HIGH 15 to 20 seconds until warm. Remove from 
oven, blaze with a match and spoon, flaming, over dessert, or pour warm spirits 
over dessert and then flame. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: 'HEALING' A SOLID GUIDE TO CURATIVE POWERS OF FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dietitians have a saying: People eat for taste, not nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, then the authors of the new book "The Healing Foods" (Rodale 
Press: $24.95) should have a best-seller on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike its counterparts in the diet section of the bookstore, which focus on 
the hazardous characteristics of some foods, "Healing Foods" is an A-to-Z 
compendium of foods that have pharmacological benefits. Its subtitle says the 
book is "the ultimate authority on the curative power of nutrition." The book 
focuses on all the good reasons there are to eat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enough Science for Perspective 
</P>
<P>
There are familiar food-and-health correlations and unfamiliar ones; food is 
implicated in everything from rheumatoid arthritis to wound healing. But the 
text is written in a manner that is easy to read, with just enough science for 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Designed, according to its introduction, to accentuate the positive, the book 
is a tool that may help guide readers to the "healing potential of food." On a 
more general note, it aspires to help readers view food as friendly and fun -- 
not boring, inflexible and frightening. 
</P>
<P>
All the contemporary connections between health and food are here: fish and the 
omega-3 it provides is good for the heart; high-fiber foods help maintain 
better levels of both blood sugar and blood cholesterol; calcium-rich foods and 
those containing Vitamin D help build strong bones, and foods with substantial 
carotene, Vitamin C, fiber and selenium all are important cancer-fighting 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfamiliar Benefits 
</P>
<P>
But there are some surprises here too: 
</P>
<P>
Hearts of palm -- the famous ethnic/gourmet ingredient, boasts a mere 21 
calories per cupful and provides a full 100% of the Recommended Dietary 
Allowance for Vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>
Cauliflower -- although prized for its health benefit as a cruciferous 
vegetable, is noted for its contribution to lowering risk for some forms of 
cancer. A one-cup serving of cauliflower also provides 100% of the RDA for 
Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic -- although noted for centuries as a food with special health 
properties, an Indian study has shown that large amounts of the popular 
seasoning (10 to 12 cloves a day) may help reduce "bad" cholesterol and 
increase levels of the "good." 
</P>
<P>
The book is complete with a disclaimer, which warns against its use as a 
medical manual or guide to self treatment. The goal, according to co-author 
Judith Benn Hurley, is to restore the enjoyment once associated with eating, 
while providing information on how to keep a watchful eye on excess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Many Fad Diets' 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that there were too many diets, too many recommendations, too 
many foods to avoid," said Hurley, "with this book you can have a personalized 
approach with lots of options." Hurley is food editor for Prevention magazine 
and writes a syndicated column for the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
"Diet is a 'four-letter word' for people," Hurley said; "this book brings 
nutrition to the lay level. It's a friendly guide to a personalized approach to 
nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
But what about all those oat-bran-potato-chip eaters who may view this 
collection as a means of using food as a cure-all? 
</P>
<P>
"The book doesn't lend itself to that," said Hurley. "I think this is a real 
rational approach and it won't contribute to this whole-day-of-oats-thing. We 
stress the importance of looking at the whole day of food." 
</P>
<P>
Hurley explained that such over-zealousness on the part of consumers is one 
reason why some foods were intentionally omitted from "Healing Foods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meat and Potatoes 
</P>
<P>
While organ meats, for example, have some nutritional value, they are extremely 
high in fat and cholesterol, which tends to reduce their merit as healthful 
foods. Likewise, zucchini is a food that is terribly low in calories, but it is 
lacking in the protective nutrients necessary for today's battles against 
degenerative diseases, she said. Both of these were left out. Conversely, 
winter squash, with its high carotene content, has enough protective nutrients 
to be worthy of a mention. 
</P>
<P>
Sections on the nutritional advantages of beef and reasons to return pasta and 
potatoes to the diet are included. Also, the book discusses food choices that 
may relieve symptoms of angina, anemia, headaches, the discomfort of 
fibro-cystic breast disease, cold symptoms, and ease the pain of ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
The book also includes recipes, cooking tips and a table of the lactose content 
of some dairy products. A couple of seven-day menus for lowering triglycerides 
and cholesterol also are features. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a recipe for Sweet Potato Soup With Celery from "The Healing 
Foods" plus some other good-for-you recipes from The Times' recipe files. 
</P>

DEAR SOS: I would love to have a recipe for the minced squab I tasted at a 
Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CRISTINE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CRISTINE: Chinese recipes for minced squab are much the same from place to 
place, so here is one from the Mandarin in Beverly Hills.

HEARTY MOROCCAN CASSEROLE FOR ADULTS CAN TOP HALLOWEEN PARTY MENU; 
</P>
<P>
FINGER FOODS WILL KEEP THE SMALL FRY HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, more people become disenchanted with the Halloween celebration. What 
was once a time of carefree mischief for children and adults alike has become a 
time for vicious pranksters to play dangerous tricks on youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Halloween celebration needs an all-new game plan, and parties at 
home offer the most fun and the best sense of security. This year, invite a few 
couples to stop by after they've escorted their children on an early 
neighborhood trick-or-treat prowl. 
</P>
<P>
Or plan a celebration to which children can also be invited. Plan a simple 
box-lunch-type meal for them featuring a variety of finger foods, then set 
aside an area for them to play indoor games. They can even dispense goodies to 
trick-or-treaters ringing the doorbell. Once the children are safe and content, 
there's no reason why adults can't enjoy the fun of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Treat the adults to an easy-to-prepare yet sophisticated meal -- a hearty 
Moroccan-inspired casserole of lamb, sausage, prunes and sweet potatoes 
flavored with honey and cranberries. Instead of pumpkin pie, make a pumpkin 
brulee and top it with ginger-flavored cranberry sauce. The brulee is cooling 
and refreshing, just what's called for after a spicy main course. 
</P>
<P>
LAMB-SAUSAGE TAJINE 
</P>
<P>
6 Italian sausages 
</P>
<P>
4 pounds whole small lamb shanks 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1 stalk celery, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 medium onions, peeled and coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>

from casserole, leaving film of oil in pan. Add carrot and celery and saute 3 
minutes. Add onions and cook 3 minutes longer or until barely wilted. 
</P>
<P>
Return lamb and sausages to casserole. Sprinkle with salt. Cover and cook 15 
minutes over low heat. Uncover and stir in pepper turmeric, ginger, coriander, 
cumin and cinnamon. Then add tomatoes and stock. Cover and cook over low heat 
45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, peel sweet potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch slices or lengthwise 
strips, dropping into salted water as you go to prevent discoloring. Remove 
casserole lid and add honey, cranberries, prunes and sweet potatoes. Return lid 
to casserole and simmer 30 minutes or until meat and potatoes are tender. (If 
juices seem too thin, drain off and boil down until thickened. Pour back over 
casserole before serving.) 
</P>
<P>
Transfer tajine to serving dish or to prebaked pumpkin or squash that is heated 
if desired, or serve from casserole. Sprinkle with parsley. Makes 6 to 8 
servings.

OCTOBER IS THE PERFECT MONTH TO CELEBRATE THE APPLE; 
</P>
<P>
POPULAR FRUIT CAN BE ENJOYED AS PART OF A BREAKFAST, LUNCH OR DINNER MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL DEEGAN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrate October as Apple Month. Enjoy cold apple cider, apple pancakes, apple 
strudel, apple dumplings and, of course, apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
Want more? How about apple muffins, apple fritters, caramel apples, alcoholic 
and non-alcoholic apple drinks? 
</P>
<P>
According to the International Apple Institute, total apple production for 1988 
was 9.1 billion pounds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the dollar 
value for the 1988 crop was $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rich in Fiber 
</P>
<P>
Apples are rich in fiber, have no cholesterol and contain only 81 calories. 
They range in flavor from sweet to tangy. 
</P>
<P>
Apples are grown commercially in 35 states including Washington, New York, 
Michigan, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The season for apples begins in July and August, with early varieties such as 
Gravenstein and Early Cortland, and continues through November with the 
harvesting of such late varieties as the Golden Delicious and Granny Smith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Varieties 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 15 most popular varieties of apples, listed in order of 1988 
production, are: Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, McIntosh, Rome Beauty, Granny 
Smith, Jonathan, York, Stayman, Newtown Pippin, Winesap, Idared, Cortland, 
Northern Spy, R.I. Greening, Gravenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Granny Smith is growing faster in popularity than any other variety, a 
125% increase from the five-year average. 
</P>
<P>
The International Apple Institute says more than half of the U.S. apple crop is 
eaten as fresh fruit; the rest is processed into apple products including apple 
juice and cider, applesauce, dried apples and canned apple slices. Other uses 
include baby food, apple butter and jelly and vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
You can enjoy apples from a local supermarket, produce stand or right off the 
tree -- there are hundreds of "u-pick-em" orchards nationwide. For information 
about orchards in your area, contact your state travel bureau, chamber of 
commerce, or agricultural extension service. 
</P>
<P>
Apples can be stored in the fruit bowl on the kitchen table. However, if you 
don't plan to eat the apples right away, put them in the refrigerator. Cold 
temperatures slow down the ripening process. Apples can be stored in the 
vegetable crisper or in a plastic bag in the coldest part of the refrigerator. 
If there isn't enough room in the refrigerator, wrap each unblemished fruit in 
paper and store in slotted boxes in a cool, dark, well-ventilated storage area. 
</P>
<P>
To freeze apples, core, peel and slice them, then dunk the slices in lemon 
juice, and pack the slices closely in a container that can go into the freezer. 
Or make a large batch of applesauce and freeze it in small containers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooking Tips 
</P>
<P>
 -- When using sliced apples in a cold dish like apple salad, rub all exposed 
apple flesh with a mixture of equal parts of lemon juice and water so the 
slices won't turn brown too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't use water in apple pies or in brown Betty recipes. Apples are 
naturally high in water content, so they rarely need any extra moisture for any 
dish. When cooking applesauce, use only enough water to avoid scorching. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use apple pie filling as a topper for ice cream, or use on Belgian waffles 
with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: READER'S TIP FOR USING BAKING COCOA SIFTS OUT INCONSISTENT 
MEASURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I use baking cocoa quite often and have always found it difficult 
to measure. Some of the cans have rather small openings, and the cocoa itself 
is often lumpy. 
</P>
<P>
I've solved both problems by simply sifting an entire eight-ounce can into a 
two-pound plastic margarine tub with an air-tight lid. 
</P>
<P>
Now I have easy accessibility for any size cup or spoon, and the smooth texture 
makes for more consistent measuring. It stores just as well as in the original 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SHERRIE, Roanoake, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have an easy way to get most of the fat off of broths and 
soups. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the cooled broth or soup into a jar or plastic container with a 
tight-fitting screw-on lid. Make sure the lid is tight, then turn the jar 
upside down and put it in the refrigerator. The fat will rise and harden on the 
jar bottom (which is now at the top). Then pour off the broth or soup without 
the fat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GERMAINE, Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My favorite grocery store has bulk foods, and there are often 
cards with recipes or special hints for using them. I slip the card right into 
the bag, so when I'm ready to use the food, I don't have to hunt for the 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DEBBIE, Silver Springs, Md. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Do you know a way to remove melted plastic from the top of my 
toaster oven without ruining the cream-colored finish? 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. G. M., Wantagh, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. G.M.: Try fingernail-polish remover. Be sure the toaster oven is cool 
and unplugged since fingernail-polish remover can be flammable. 
</P>
<P>
Test the remover on an inconspicuous part of the finish to make sure it doesn't 
cause any color changes. If it doesn't damage the finish, soak a cotton ball 
with polish remover and go after that pesky plastic. If it does cause problems 
with the finish, use rubbing alcohol instead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I clip coupons and have a large envelope filled with them. When 
it is time for my grocery shopping, I take out the coupons I will use and 
arrange them in the same order as the grocery-store aisles are arranged. 
</P>
<P>
This way I'm not shuffling through them at the store. I simply take the one 
that is on top each time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JENNIFER, Denver, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Fall is traditionally apple time, so take advantage of all the 
wonderful kinds of apples that are available right now. 
</P>
<P>
We enjoy Red Delicious apples all year for their crisp juiciness, but there are 
many other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Winesap apples are good baked as well as fresh; Rome Beauties are best for 
baking and making good cider, and Jonathans are good for cider as well as for 
eating fresh. Cortlands are very versatile and are good as salads, cider, baked 
or fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Not all apples have to be red either. Green Granny Smith apples are tart, 
crunchy and full of fiber and are my favorites for breakfast. They're good in 
pies and sauces and also in fresh salads. Golden Delicious are also versatile, 
so you can use them for eating fresh, baking or almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're talking about cooking apples, did you know they're great cooked 
in the microwave? Soft apples take less time than firmer apples, so cooking 
times will vary with the type of apple you're using. 
</P>
<P>
Applesauce takes only six to eight minutes and needs no stirring. Baked apples 
take only a minute and a half in the microwave. Apples cut into rings can be 
placed in a glass pie plate with a little butter or margarine and microwaved 
for 30 to 45 seconds. They're a great accompaniment for meat, especially pork, 
and other fall and winter vegetables such as squash. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Everyone in my family loves avocados in salads and main dishes, 
but I have a problem picking out avocados that are ready to eat right away. 
Either they are too hard or they ripen overnight and can't be used. 
</P>
<P>
When I'm buying them I check to make sure they are soft. They feel right, but 
when I peel them I find they are brown and tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a certain way I can check to make sure the avocados I buy are not too 
ripe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SARA, Laredo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SARA: When buying avocados, don't pick the soft ones unless you are going 
to use them that evening. Avocados to use in a few days should be firm, but not 
rock-hard. 
</P>
<P>
If the avocados are too hard, you can put them in a brown paper bag and set it 
in a warm place to help them ripen quickly. 
</P>
<P>
To check for ripeness, stick a toothpick in the fruit at the stem end. The 
fruit is ripe if the toothpick goes in and out easily. If you have too many 
ripe avocados, keep them in the refrigerator to prevent them from ripening any 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Don't toss the pits in the trash; plant them. They make beautiful indoor plants 
that are easy to grow. I have some that are touching the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a hint you may be interested in. When I make soup or 
sauce, I always make enough to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
I freeze it in quart bread pans and after it is frozen solid, remove it from 
the pan and wrap it in freezer wrap or foil and label it. 
</P>
<P>
This way they stack neatly in the freezer and I can keep a nice variety for our 
own use or for unexpected guests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ALMA, South Dennis, Me. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I wonder if your readers realize all the helpful uses for 
non-stick pan spray. It adds no flavor and only a few calories and I find it 
great for the following: 
</P>
<P>
Spray sauce pans before making pudding, white sauce or heating creamed 
vegetables. No sticky pan bottom. Try it in a baking pan before pressing in the 
meat loaf and the pan will sponge clean in the dishwasher. It's terrific for 
broiling pans for steaks, chops and chicken -- no burned-on fat, no tiresome 
scouring. 
</P>
<P>
I've found it to be so helpful with most everything I bake and cook. It's not 
just used for making cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I go to a country store and buy double-yolk eggs. For some reason 
my family likes them better and I enjoy making them happy. If a recipe states 
one egg, can I use a double-yolked one? 
</P>
<P>
 -- RUTH, Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR RUTH: The experts at the American Egg Board say that usually the yolks of 
double-yolk eggs are smaller than a regular egg yolk and can be substituted one 
for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE

DEAR HELOISE: A recipe I was making called for one cup of dark brown sugar, but 
all I had on hand was light brown sugar. Can you substitute light for dark and 
vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
 -- LEE, Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LEE: Yes, you can substitute dark for light or light for dark. The only 
difference is the amount of molasses. More molasses is in the dark brown sugar 
than in the light. Dark brown sugar has a stronger flavor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: This helpful hint is for new mothers, like myself. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of stores use plastic bags for merchandise. These plastic bags fit well 
in diaper pails, and when the bag gets full all I have to do is tie the handles 
together and pitch it in the outside garbage can. Not only does it save me from 
a mess, it also saves money I would have spent buying diaper pail liners. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here it is almost time again for little trick-or-treaters. I 
disliked the idea of handing out treats that parents might not want their 
children to eat, especially if it's baked goods or unpackaged fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Here is an easy solution. I attach an address label to all the goodies that I 
give out. Since all of the neighbors know me, they know that the treat is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- VANESSA, Benton Harbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
This is a great idea. I hope after reading this, other readers will be tempted 
to try it.

</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints 
received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

RENOVATION OF VENTURA PIER APPEARS ASSURED WITH STATE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major renovation of the Ventura Pier -- a $3.5-million overhaul needed to save 
the historic structure from possible destruction -- could begin as early as 
this spring because of a successful campaign to persuade Gov. George Deukmejian 
to fully fund the restoration job. 
</P>
<P>
While cautioning that studies are not yet complete on how to pay for 
maintenance of the pier in the future, Ventura city officials this week said 
Deukmejian's approval of the final $1 million needed for the job virtually 
assures the pier's salvation. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step in what began as a citizens drive to save the pier from 
demolition involves negotiations between state and city officials to transfer 
ownership of the 117-year-old structure from the state of California to the 
city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the governor has signed the legislation providing us with the money 
needed for the renovation, I would hope agreements could be signed within the 
next month," Ventura Mayor James Monahan said. "The whole job might take two 
years or more, but the pier is definitely going to be saved." 
</P>
<P>
Heavily damaged by a winter storm in 1986, the 1,600-foot pier was closed for 
more than two years before a 1,200-foot portion was reopened in 1988 after 
repairs described by state officials as "Band-Aid work." They warned that the 
pier faced total destruction without major renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the campaign to save the pier, city officials noted this week, the 
drive was led by the Ventura Jaycees and the Chamber of Commerce. A Pier 
Steering Committee was set up and collected 15,000 signatures urging full 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
While $1.5 million had been raised by this summer, the city's hopes for saving 
the pier rested primarily on a budgetary bill in the Legislature that would 
have included $2 million for the project, but that amount was cut in half by 
Deukmejian in July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus Shifted 
</P>
<P>
With the city still short of renovation funds by $1 million, the focus of the 
effort shifted next a campaign by state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) to have the extra money included 
in the budget for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan and other city officials praised Hart and McClintock this week for 
their efforts, while the two political leaders also praised the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation for endorsing full funding of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it was not a tough sales job," McClintock said. "It was simply a 
matter of pressing a very meritorious issue. Henry Agonia, director of the 
parks department, was of tremendous help in pushing it with the governor." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's initial veto of full funding for the pier work had nothing to do 
with his views on the project, but was based on the fact that the earlier 
legislation had not been properly reviewed by the Department of Parks and 
Recreation, Kevin Brett, the governor's press aide, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Final Studies 
</P>
<P>
Now that the political maneuvering in Sacramento has ended, Ventura officials 
said the next step is to review final studies on how much repair work is 
actually needed and what facilities can be built around the pier to generate 
the $150,000 or so that will be needed for annual upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said studies show that about 10% of the pier's pilings must be 
replaced, along with decking and wiring. There could be additional damage to 
the pier that has not yet been detected, they added, and the repair job could 
grow even costlier if winter storms batter the pier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Even those officials who were initially skeptical of whether enough money could 
be raised to save the pier expressed belief this week that come more high water 
or not, there is no longer a chance that the structure will have to be torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really skeptical until the money popped up," Councilman Richard Francis 
said. "I am one of those who would like to save the pier, but not at any cost. 
I'm optimistic that the work now will be done in a year or so, probably 
starting with the first repairs in the spring."

EMERGENCY ROOM FILLS 2-YEAR GAP; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST ONE SINCE '87 OPENS IN CENTURY CITY; WILL SERVE 100,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bucking the trend, Century City Hospital has opened an emergency room, not 
closed one -- the first to open in Los Angeles County in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The new emergency room brings to 93 the number in the county licensed by the 
state to receive paramedic and ambulance traffic -- one fewer than the region 
had at the beginning of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Officially opened Monday at a ceremony that included quiche and comedians, the 
facility offers 24-hour emergency services to an estimated 100,000 people in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dream Emergency Room' 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the closest emergency rooms were at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in 
West Los Angeles, UCLA Medical Center in Westwood and Beverly Hills Medical 
Center. Even people who regularly visit the 195-bed hospital for other reasons 
had to seek emergency care elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything you would want if you were able to build a dream emergency 
room," said James Pagano, medical director for emergency services at Century 
City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The staff was involved in planning the facility, Pagano said, and recommended 
such features as placing the nurses' station where the nurses could watch both 
the door used by incoming paramedics and patients and the monitoring equipment 
at the beds reserved for the critically ill. The emergency room will be staffed 
by nine full-time physicians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,400-square-foot facility cost $1.5 million, hospital Executive Director 
Joel Bergenfeld said. Century City is a private, for-profit hospital, owned by 
National Medical Enterprises of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As Pagano pointed out, the new emergency room is not a trauma center; it lacks 
the in-house surgeon and anesthesiologist that are among the requirements for 
licensing as a trauma center. Nor is the opening of an emergency room in a 
private hospital in affluent Century City expected to be more than a Band-Aid 
on the county's faltering emergency care system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Have Dwindled 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Pavey, an official with the county's emergency medical services agency, 
said the number of emergency rooms in the county has slipped to 93 from 100 
since 1987. Only 13 of the 23 trauma centers linked in 1983 remain in 
operation. Pavey said she doubted that the Century City facility will be "a 
high-impact ER" as would a new facility in Inglewood or another under-serviced 
area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Century City Hospital officials and observers agree that the facility will 
at least provide paramedics with an additional option on those increasingly 
common occasions when busy emergency rooms are "on diversion," or temporarily 
closed to them. 
</P>
<P>
At such times, paramedics often have to drive far longer than the requisite 10 
minutes from the pickup point, making several stops before they find an 
emergency room that will accept an ill or injured individual. 
</P>
<P>
"It just gives one more place for paramedics to go if the midtown hospitals are 
on diversion," said Kathleen Belkham of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Bergenfeld said the new emergency room will probably receive three or four 
ambulance transports a day. 
</P>
<P>
Century City Hospital staff carefully studied the demographics of health care 
in the area before opening the facility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most emergency-room closings are attributed to economics: The facilities, which 
are required as a condition of their licensing to treat anyone who walks 
through the door, say they cannot afford to care for growing numbers of 
uninsured, indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
But Century City Hospital believes that it can make a go of it, in part, 
because it expects the majority of its clients to be insured or able to pay. 
Bergenfeld pointed out that a good emergency-room experience can turn a 
single-occasion patient into a regular client of a particular hospital. "If we 
didn't think this would be a profitable operation, we wouldn't have proceeded," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency room is still a gamble, Bergenfeld said. More emergency room and 
trauma closing centers in Los Angeles could alter the new facility's patient 
population and its economic viability. "There are a lot of factors that are 
completely and totally out of our control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But hospital staff are confident enough about the facility's chances for 
profitability to laugh about it. At Monday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, which 
included the inevitable speech-making and mini-quiches on the brunch buffet, 
the Groundlings improvised Westside hospital comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't this a bank?" asked a comic playing a confused patient. "No, it isn't a 
bank per se," the comedy doctor answered.

FLYER WARNING SENIOR RESIDENTS THAT THEY MIGHT BE FORCED TO MOVE SPURS THEM TO 
ATTEND MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 elderly residents of the Westwood Horizons retirement hotel turned out 
for Tuesday's public hearing on the Westwood hotel dispute after receiving a 
flyer warning them that "your home as you know it could cease to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Allies of a developer who wants to build a hotel across the street from 
Westwood Horizons acknowledged that they were responsible for the flyer, which 
an opposing attorney labeled a dirty trick. 
</P>
<P>
The one-page memo, which said it was from the "Senior Housing Advocacy Group," 
asked the residents: "Will you be forced to move from your home in 1990?" 
</P>
<P>
It also urged the residents to "take action" to protect senior citizens whose 
rights were being 'threatened" and "disregarded," and offered door-to-door 
transportation by bus and a box lunch for those who attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Public relations consultant Nann Miller acknowledged in a telephone interview 
that she had produced the flyer and said the Senior Housing Advocacy Group does 
not really exist. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was hired for the job by Fred Fulcher, who said he is a longtime friend 
of Nansay Corp. President Eric Yokeno. Nansay is seeking permission from the 
city of Los Angeles to build a 350-room hotel in Westwood Village. Fulcher said 
he did not consult Yokeno before mounting the public relations effort. 
</P>
<P>
Miller shepherded the group to the hearing, and several of them deferred to her 
when asked why they attended the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
According to Miller, she was told to get the word out to the senior citizens. 
"All we were telling the tenants is come to the hearing and make up your own 
mind." The memo, she said, "was certainly meant to get their attention," but 
"wasn't meant to scare anybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Taken as Eviction Notice' 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Bley, an attorney for the owners of the Westwood Horizons property, who 
lease it to the retirement hotel operators, accused Nansay of unfair, 
misleading tactics that upset the residents. "It was taken as an eviction 
notice by some people," Bley said. 
</P>
<P>
Bley's clients, David and Natalie Roberts, are attempting to preserve their 
option to convert the Westwood Horizons to a commercial hotel in the future. 
They oppose the Nansay hotel project because the city's development plan for 
Westwood allows only one hotel in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Several Westwood Horizons residents noted that the flyer had upset some of 
those for whom any change in routine precipitates a major crisis. "There's such 
distress throughout the hotel with the residents," Mabel Seelen said. "He's 
planning to throw us out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Defending the flyer, Fulcher said: "The main thing was to notify the people. . 
. . What's deceptive? It's a public hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Fulcher said he might have taken a "wrong action" by not notifying 
Yokeno. A spokesman for Nansay denied involvement in the public relations 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Nansay attorney Maria Hummer, however, said she did not understand an objection 
"to neighbors of a proposed project coming to a hearing."

SANTA MONICA RESTAURANT TO FIGHT JUDGE'S ORDER TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ned Kelly's Bar and Grille on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade was slated 
to be closed this week because it had operated as a rowdy nightclub and for 
owing rent, but the restaurant owners say they will fight the effort to kick 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica Superior Court judge last Thursday ordered Ned Kelly's to leave 
its spot at 1212 Santa Monica Mall and to pay more than $12,600 in back rent to 
property owner Hildegarde Heidt. The amount is based on sales that had been 
under-reported in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant was also ordered to pay $4,048, the cost of Heidt's audit. 
Richard Knickerbocker, the restaurant's attorney, said he has filed motions to 
stave off the Los Angeles County marshals who were to seal the doors this week. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt sued restaurant owners Greg McElroy and Vincent Cullinan in June, 
charging that restaurant operations were improper and raucous, according to 
Heidt's attorney, Gordon P. Gitlen. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt claimed that the restaurant owners, who took over Ned Kelly's in October, 
1988, were operating as a nightclub without proper permits. Gitlen said that 
the restaurant served mostly liquor and only a little food, in violation of its 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
Gitlen said in an interview that the restaurant offered live and recorded music 
for about $7 admission and each night bore a different name, such as "West Go 
West" and "Menace and Mayhem" as a promotion for its nightclub operation. 
</P>
<P>
Knickerbocker said in an interview that the restaurant's dining business -- 
with a menu that includes "New Wave Soups" and sandwiches called "The 
Springsteen" and "The Yoko Ono" for about $5 -- suffered during the renovation 
of the mall and that the entertainment was aimed at stimulating food and drink 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bomb Threats 
</P>
<P>
According to Gitlen, the crowds at Ned Kelly's got out of hand: There were 
frequent bomb threats, patrons got into fights and broke windows in neighboring 
businesses, and "blood and vomit was seen in the morning, near the broken 
windows." 
</P>
<P>
Knickerbocker disputes those claims. In January, a patron died after he got 
into a brawl on the promenade, but Knickerbocker says the man had left Ned 
Kelly's before he got into the fight and that the incident had no connection to 
the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Rent for the restaurant is $1,900 a month or 6% of the restaurant's gross 
sales, whichever is greater. In some months, the restaurant grossed up to 
$58,333, providing rent of $3,500 to Heidt, Knickerbocker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gitlen claimed that the restaurant was reporting only its cut of proceeds 
from cigarette vending machines and promotional entertainment events, instead 
of reporting "gross sales" as stated in the lease, which he said would also 
include the share taken in by the vending company, promoters and any other 
sublessees or concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Gitlen also claimed that the restaurant owners destroyed cash register tapes. 
Knickerbocker argued that it was previous owners, not McElroy and Cullinan, who 
threw away the tapes after recording the figures. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt is "pleased she did put her foot forward as a responsible owner and (as 
someone who's) responsible to the community," Gitlen said, adding that Heidt 
was looking for a new commercial tenant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Appeal Case 
</P>
<P>
But Knickerbocker said Heidt was "asking more than she's entitled to" and that 
he will appeal the case, including Judge Sara Radin's instructions to the jury 
that the case was not one of failure to pay rent but one of a breach of other 
lease provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In failure-to-pay-rent cases, a landlord can only collect rent back to one 
year, whereas if "they . . . call it a (breach of lease),. . . (they) can go 
back as far as they want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ned Kelly's is considering filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, "to 
protect our creditors, so we do not have one creditor like Hildy Heidt grabbing 
all the cookies at the expense of all the other creditors who've been dealing 
with Ned Kelly's on a (fair) basis," he said. The restaurant is also looking 
for a new site in Santa Monica or West Los Angeles in case it is forced to 
move, he said.

PERSEVERANCE PAYS OFF FOR SINGER WHO ANSWERED CALL FROM GOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Hill was playing a dark country-Western bar in Ventura when he first felt 
the tap on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a tugging took hold as he sang and played guitar and watched bartenders 
pour drinks to patrons who'd already had too much -- women hard and lined 
before their time, men lost in battles with their sanity and each other. 
</P>
<P>
When he started having the dreams though, Hill knew that it was time. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Hill says today in his honeyed drawl, it was God who was calling. And 
when you're raised a strict Southern Baptist in east Texas, you don't ignore 
such communiques. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1984, Hill -- a musician who has seen hard times and excesses to rival 
the most gut-wrenching of country songs -- followed his calling and was 
ordained a Pentecostal preacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people I met in barrooms who needed help, they were my 
congregation," Hill said. Musicians, too, were drawn to a church run by a 
fellow singer/songwriter. Soon, the faithful numbered 120. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Award Recipient 
</P>
<P>
Today, fiddling for the Lord and his audiences has finally paid off. Tuesday in 
Nashville, Hill will receive two songwriting awards from Broadcast Music Inc., 
an industry association that holds annual competitions. He will share the 
honors with his friend and songwriting partner Chris Hillman (formerly of the 
1960s country rock band the Byrds), with whom he pens all the lyrics for 
Hillman's new musical endeavor, the Desert Rose Band. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to Hill, the Desert Rose Band has also been nominated in two 
categories in the American Country Music Awards, which will be held Monday. The 
band is a contender for "Best Vocal Group of the Year" as well as the "Horizons 
Award," which goes to up-and-coming bands. 
</P>
<P>
"It really feels gratifying," Hill said about the recognition that has finally 
come his way. "It's like tying a rope around a train and trying to pull it all 
these years. Finally that sucker is starting to roll." 
</P>
<P>
But the tugging took a trainload of determination. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the singing preacher assembled his congregation in rented 
spaces -- a meeting room at the Harbor Patrol office in Oxnard's Channel 
Islands Harbor and a hall near the Lobster Trap restaurant. He called his 
church the Harbor Light Fellowship and said of some ardent members, "I'd see 
them Saturday night just plastered, but boy, they'd be there at church on 
Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flying Burrito Brothers 
</P>
<P>
One of the better-known parishioners was Hillman, a Ventura-based musician who 
in addition to the Byrds, played with the Flying Burrito Brothers and now the 
high-riding Desert Rose Band. In 1985, Hill baptized Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked out a lot of churches and I thought Steve was real down-to-earth. 
I'd come on Sundays and we'd sing together, mostly the old gospel stuff," 
Hillman said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon they were writing music together. And Hillman, who has written with such 
rock and country legends as Roger McGuinn and Steven Stills, said the preacher 
from east Texas can write with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a song I wrote about my father's death I could never have written with 
anyone else," Hillman said. "He drew that out of me. He's a good catalyst. We 
approach songwriting like a novel . . . not just some generic country Nashville 
love song." 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Hill/Hillman duo has written 30 songs, including some that hit 
the top of the country music charts, like "Summer Wind," "Love Reunited" and "I 
Still Believe in You." Their subjects are varied; the tunes deal with such 
topics as drug abuse, married love, homelessness, political unrest in 
Nicaragua, the death of a parent and child custody. 
</P>
<P>
"We share similar backgrounds and values," Hillman said. "Our families come 
first and we have both earned everything we ever got." 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, with a blossoming musical career tucked under his cowboy 
belt after 19 years in the business, 40-year-old Hill has stepped aside from 
the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
His preaching days ended in late 1986 when he sold his Ventura house and headed 
with his family to Nashville looking for musical stardom. But the Grand Ole 
Opry didn't come a-courting; he sunk his money into a development deal that 
went sour and Hill came back to Ventura eight months later, flat broke. 
</P>
<P>
But he persevered. Today, his recently formed Steve Hill Band plays a mix of 
gospel, Cajun and rollicking country tunes. He plays Mondays through Wednesdays 
at the Shores, an Oxnard nightspot, and can be seen Oct. 28 and 29 at the Point 
Mugu Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
And he has more blessings than he can count. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Fancy House' 
</P>
<P>
He has a "real big fancy house with six bedrooms, a swimming pool and a 
Jacuzzi" in Thousand Oaks, where he lives with his second wife, Marla, and 
their three children. (A 12-year-old son from an earlier marriage lives with 
his mother in Jacksonville, Tex.) 
</P>
<P>
He co-owns a music studio in Agoura Hills that records and produces gospel 
music. And royalties are rolling in. "Three years ago I was homeless and now I 
have three hit records under my belt. I owe it all to God," said Hill, a tall, 
broad-shouldered man whose hair, finely etched with gray, falls below his 
collar. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is also feeling that familiar tugging again. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Light Fellowship "sort of fizzled out" during Hill's Nashville 
stint, and he talks now of starting another church. Until he does, he is active 
in Calvary Community Church, a charismatic Christian group in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Religion comes in handy for him, even in bars. 
</P>
<P>
One time Hill was playing "Orange Blossom Special" in a Carpinteria bar when he 
looked out and saw that "everybody in the place was fighting, stabbing, 
throwing chairs." 
</P>
<P>
Hill didn't skip a note but launched immediately into "Amazing Grace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calmed Brawlers 
</P>
<P>
"That calms 'em down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill grew up dirt-poor in Longview, Tex., in an area of pine forests, rolling 
hills, rivers and wilderness that also produced such musicians as Billy Gibbons 
from ZZ Top, Edgar and Johnny Winter and former Eagle Glenn Frey. 
</P>
<P>
Attending Stephen Foster State University in Nacogdoches, Tex., on a music 
scholarship, he played the trumpet and earned a bachelor's degree in business. 
But it was roommate Rodney Crowell, now a successful producer/writer/musician 
married to Rosanne Cash, who taught him to love country music. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978 at Crowell's suggestion, he came to Los Angeles to audition for Emmylou 
Harris' band. Although he didn't get the job, he stayed out West pondering his 
next move, living with his family in a motor home parked at a friend's Oxnard 
house. 
</P>
<P>
One night when Hill was at a church meeting seeking guidance about whether to 
stay in the area or head back to Texas, disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
"I got home and there were firemen all around, and the motor home was all in 
flames. I said, 'I guess I'm staying here,' " Hill recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guitar Undamaged 
</P>
<P>
When he pulled a charred guitar case out of the wreckage, opened it and saw 
that his guitar had escaped unscathed, well, that cinched it. 
</P>
<P>
"They say the Lord works in mysterious ways and that sure was mysterious," Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends put them up for several weeks, but Hill soon got a job at Heck's Music 
in Ventura and moved his family into a rented house. 
</P>
<P>
He played gigs every night. His wife took a sales job at the Broadway. On 
weekends, Hill served as music director at the Apostolic House of Worship in 
Ventura, a Pentecostal church on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Pentecostalism is a highly emotional form of religious worship that emphasizes 
prayer, faith healing, the belief in everyday occurrences of the supernatural 
and speaking in tongues. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Earl Meyers recalls Hill as a devout and enthusiastic parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Was a Good Boy' 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he was active in our church. He'd play the guitar and do lead singing and 
solos, and his wife would read Scripture. He was a good boy," said Meyers, a 
man with snow-white hair who speaks in measured tones. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hill often played Santa Paula bars with a musician who had become 
enamored of Eastern mysticism and said he heard voices. Unfortunately, however, 
the voices often told him to stop in the middle of a set. 
</P>
<P>
"One night we said, 'We've had it with this guy; we're going to pray for him.' 
He was well, possessed." 
</P>
<P>
And as Hill knelt down to pray, an odd thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself speaking in tongues. I had never given it any credence before, 
but it's the spirit inside you speaking. It's an extra little thing that God 
will give you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, when Hill played local bars, word about the singing minister 
was out. Hill said people often sidled up to him to say skeptically, "So, I 
hear you're a preacher. What are you doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Listen to Problems 
</P>
<P>
Hill would explain that he was trying to make a living like everyone else and 
that Jesus hadn't hung out with the saved. Then he would sit down and listen to 
their problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are drunk, they get real sentimental. They want to hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One time during a show in Santa Barbara, Hill learned that a woman in her late 
20s had taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He stopped in the middle of the 
set, took her to a hospital and had her stomach pumped. 
</P>
<P>
Then he took her home and had her live with his family for six weeks, talked to 
her about Jesus and eventually found her a job flipping burgers on a charter 
fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
"She works in L.A. now, goes to church regularly and has really changed her 
life around," Hill said with evident pride. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not every experience ends on such an amazing note of grace. For 
everyone he helps, there are others who fall through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
"It eats me up. You bet I feel a sense of loss; I feel it physically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It reflects in his songs too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bluegrass-Tinged Lament 
</P>
<P>
A song about the homeless, a bluegrass-tinged lament, tells the tale of a woman 
and her children forced to live in a car after her husband loses his job and 
abandons them: 
</P>
<P>
 "In this land of milk and honey, we share with all who need, 
</P>
<P>
 Except the ones outside our door, the ones we cannot see. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the proud, the true, the faithful, left out in the cold, 
</P>
<P>
 It's people just like you and me at the end of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill can write with some knowledge about homelessness. When he came back to 
Ventura in 1987 after losing his money in Nashville, he lived with Jerry Roberg 
and his wife Carol, who run the Oxnard Rescue Mission in downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked 12 gigs a week to earn money to bring his family back from 
Nashville. They eventually moved in with another Christian family, eight people 
sharing a two-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
"They were real tough times," Hill recalled. "I've been there. It's a tough way 
to live."

WESTWOOD HOME FOR SENIOR CITIZENS RULED NOT A HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGNATION IS AT CENTER OF DISPUTE OVER A NEW DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals has decided that the Westwood Horizons 
senior citizens' residence is not a full-fledged commercial hotel and that its 
300 rooms do not count toward the 350 hotel rooms contemplated in a new 
development plan for Westwood Village. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that site qualifies for that 350 beds in any way, shape or 
form," said Commissioner Ilene Olansky, before the 4-0 vote that ended a 
four-hour public debate Tuesday on the question, "What is a hotel?" 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner John Mack, as did others on the board, relied upon a commonly 
understood meaning of hotel to eliminate Westwood Horizons from that category. 
"It is not the Century Plaza," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was before the board on an appeal of an advisory opinion by Chief 
Zoning Administrator Franklin Eberhard. He had determined in July that the 
retirement hotel was never considered a commercial hotel in the four-year 
battle for a specific development plan for Westwood Village. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel designation for Westwood Horizons was sought by three Westwood 
homeowner groups attempting to prevent construction of a hotel in the village. 
The designation was also sought by the owners of the Westwood Horizons 
property, David and Natalie Roberts, who are trying to preserve the option of 
converting the building to a commercial hotel in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although not binding on the director of planning, who has the final say for the 
city, the board's decision was significant in clarifying that the specific plan 
called for 350 hotel rooms altogether, not 350 new hotel rooms plus 300 from 
the Westwood Horizons' property, should it be deemed a commercial hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The board also upheld the plan's prohibition on having two hotels within 500 
feet of one another. The parking lot on Glendon Avenue designated as a hotel 
site in the plan approved in December, 1988, is 75 feet away from Westwood 
Horizons, so if both were hotels it would violate the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Nansay Corp. has longstanding plans to build a hotel on the Glendon 
Avenue site that would be blocked if the senior citizens' residence were deemed 
a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Westwood, applauded 
the ruling, saying that 350 new rooms were exactly what was meant by the plan. 
The reason the word new wasn't included in the language was because no one 
thought there was another hotel in the area. That didn't mean Westwood Horizons 
was overlooked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we looked at that 14-story building at Le Conte and Tiverton, we looked 
at it as a retirement hotel," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate his point, Yaroslavsky said he picked up the phone and posed as 
a businessman from New York seeking accommodations for the night at Westwood 
Horizons. He said he was told they only offered long-term rentals to senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But Kenneth Bley, an attorney for the Roberts, who lease the former UCLA 
dormitory to Westwood Horizons, argued to the zoning board that current use is 
not the critical factor in defining a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The retirement residence is a hotel because it has a certificate of occupancy 
that says it is and because it does not meet the legal definition of retirement 
hotel or apartment hotel, Bley said. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been and is and will be a hotel," said Bley. "They have the (legal) 
right to use it as a hotel even if they are now choosing not to do so. They 
could do that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood and vice president of the Westwood 
Homeowners Assn., told the panel that the homeowner groups have been convinced 
that Westwood Horizons is a legal hotel and that they made an "innocent 
mistake" in not treating it as such in the development plan. Urging the zoning 
board to reverse administrator Eberhard's ruling, Lake said, "We are asking you 
to undo . . . an open invitation to a second hotel." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing on the other side were Eberhard, Yaroslavsky, attorneys for Nansay, 
Dori Pye of the Los Angeles Business Council and a consultant who insisted that 
the intent of the specific plan was for new hotel beds, not to be confused with 
beds currently occupied by senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Eberhard based his opinion in part on the fact that Westwood Horizons does not 
pay a "bed tax" as commercial hotels do. He further concluded, and the board 
agreed, that Westwood Horizons could not operate as a hotel unless it came back 
to the city for conditional-use permits. Depending on when this occurred, the 
Nansay Corp. may have already have built its hotel, in which case the 
retirement hotel would be frozen out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Door Left Open 
</P>
<P>
Westwood Homeowners Assn. President Sandy Brown said after the ruling that she 
was not satisfied because the door was left open for Westwood Horizons owners 
to come back in 10 years and get another commercial hotel approved through the 
conditional-use process. That would circumvent the intention of the specific 
plan to limit hotel rooms to 350, Brown said, and means that homeowner groups 
would have to remain vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he would fight a conversion by Westwood Horizons because it 
would disturb the senior citizens, about 20 of whom were brought to the hearing 
room by a public relations expert hired by a friend of the owner of the Nansay 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Westwood Horizons to stay as it is," said 8 1/2-year resident Susan 
Ludloff. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Mabel Seelen, offered a common-sense opinion on why Westwood 
Horizons is not a hotel: Anyone who walks in the lobby can see it's not a hotel 
because there are as many nurse's aides as guests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the commissioners said the issue is not so much, "What is a hotel" as, 
"Your hotel or mine?" 
</P>
<P>
"There's 350 rooms. Either Westwood Horizons gets it or Nansay gets it," said 
board Chairman James Leewong. "If Westwood Horizons is a hotel, the other site 
is automatically out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made No Sense 
</P>
<P>
Leewong reasoned that it made no sense to grapple with the question of whether 
a hotel was warranted in Westwood during the four-year planning process only to 
suddenly conclude that one was already there. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth voting zoning commissioner, Nikolas Patsaouras (a fifth member was 
absent), said Westwood Horizons had an opportunity to argue for its hotel 
rights during the lengthy planning process. "(David Roberts) had his chance and 
he missed it," Patsaouras said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bley, a court battle is expected because "too much is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the new hotel will serve as a balance to the youthful 
movie-going crowd that has become synonymous with Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to get some suits and ties in Westwood Village," Yaroslavsky 
said.

CITY COUNCIL PROPOSES NEW YEARLONG DEVELOPMENT BAN; 
</P>
<P>
ORDINANCE DESIGNED TO TAKE PLACE OF INVALID MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the state Court of Appeal invalidated Glendale's year-old moratorium on 
apartment and condominium construction, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday 
introduced legislation to impose a new moratorium effective until Nov. 9, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"This time, we are going to do it right," said Councilman Larry Zarian, who 
introduced the proposed moratorium ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium would allow the council more time to continue searching for 
mechanisms to control the city's population growth. 
</P>
<P>
The council also signaled through introduction of a second ordinance Tuesday 
its willingness to allow about 30 building projects now frozen by the present 
construction ban to proceed under zoning standards that were in place before it 
was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the moratorium was ruled invalid, the city does not have to issue 
building permits until its 15-day deadline to appeal the decision expires. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postponed Vote 
</P>
<P>
The council also postponed for another week a vote on the so-called Design 
Ordinance, which would terminate the present moratorium. The council wants to 
make its adoption concurrent with the two ordinances introduced Tuesday -- the 
new moratorium and release of the projects frozen by the ban. 
</P>
<P>
The new moratorium would become effective 30 days after adoption. To avoid a 
period in which developers could apply for building permits, the council asked 
planning staff members to prepare for consideration next week a resolution that 
would allow the city to withhold building permits until the new moratorium goes 
into effect. That resolution would take effect when it is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal ruled Sept. 28 that Glendale had imposed its moratorium 
illegally because the council had not allowed five days to elapse between its 
introduction and adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the council had the right to impose a moratorium on 
building construction, but chastised the city for enacting the moratorium as an 
emergency ordinance without a five-day waiting period to allow public input. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed moratorium, like the invalid one, is intended to temporarily 
prevent a flood of applications for building permits while the city studies a 
zoning ordinance to limit the city's population to about 200,000, as 
recommended in the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they need up to another year to draw up permanent limits 
because the zoning changes they are seeking will require land-use surveys, 
environmental impact reports, General Plan amendments and extensive public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the council had been unable to agree on temporary zoning 
restrictions to replace the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Three council members wanted to reduce by half the number of units allowed per 
lot, but the other two council members opposed that option, claiming that it 
was too drastic. The proposed moratorium is a compromise between the two 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week's court ruling invalidated the present moratorium, council 
members had been reluctant to adopt a new one because city attorneys had 
expressed doubts that a new building freeze could withstand a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 24, Planning Director John McKenna told the city manager in a 
memorandum that the city "could enact a new moratorium," but he added that the 
option is not defensible, said Scott H. Howard, senior assistant city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said Tuesday that his report was written before the court decision and 
thus "doesn't have a bearing on the current situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Difficult' 
</P>
<P>
Howard said last week that the city planner had misunderstood him. "I said it 
would be very difficult -- not impossible -- to defend a new moratorium in 
court without a solid reason to impose one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Frank R. Manzano said the city's inability to accomplish its goals 
during the tenure of the present moratorium makes the new freeze susceptible to 
a legal challenge. "It's the time element," he said. "The courts might ask, 
'Why weren't you doing this six months ago?' " 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for a group of developers that successfully challenged the 
moratorium said his group would not attempt to halt the proposed building ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has the legal right to adopt the new moratorium," said Haik Vartanian 
of the Moratorium Litigation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it's their decision," he said. "But they've gone through an 
entire year with an illegal moratorium and caused a great deal of suffering to 
the projects in the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian said he was considering filing suit against the city for damages and 
lost profits caused by the present moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Council members were divided as to whether the city should appeal the Court of 
Appeal ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to put this case behind us and move on," Zarian said. 
Councilman Dick Jutras agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Ruling 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said the city should appeal because although 
she agreed that the developers were entitled to proceed with their projects, 
the court ruling interfered with the city's right to self-government. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling "is inaccurate and contradictory," Bremberg said. "It upholds our 
City Charter in one page, then state law in the next. I feel our right to home 
rule is being challenged and our right to decide our destiny as a city." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold Milner said the council will most likely decide Tuesday whether to 
appeal to keep within the 15-day court deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Manzano said it would be very difficult to obtain a hearing in the Court of 
Appeal or the state Supreme Court. But he said both possibilities were open to 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
MORATORIUM SAGA Sept. 19, 1988: The City Council holds study session in Oxnard 
on growth-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 27: The City Council introduces, unanimously adopts and makes effective 
immediately as an "emergency measure" an ordinance stopping all development in 
neighborhoods zoned for apartments, townhouses and condominiums for 150 days. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 4: A group of developers form the Fair Growth Coalition to oppose the 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 25: The council rejects a coalition request to exempt from 
</P>
<P>
the moratorium some 70 projects halted in the plan-approval stage. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 4: The city planning staff unveils a draft ordinance that 
</P>
<P>
would reduce the size and improve the quality of all new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 20: The Planning Commission holds the first of four public hearings on the 
proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 21: The Moratorium Litigation Committee, an offshoot of the Fair Growth 
Coalition, files suit against the city, claiming that the moratorium was 
improperly enacted and therefore void. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 29: Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam A. Vogel rules that while the 
city erred in not allowing five days between the introduction and passage of 
the moratorium ordinance as required by the City Charter, the builders do not 
have a vested right to building permits. Vogel grants the plaintiffs a 
reconsideration hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 10, 1989: Without a five-day waiting period, the council adopts another 
ordinance extending the moratorium to April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 26: Vogel blasts city officials for defying the intent of her ruling by 
incorrectly extending the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 31: The City Council reintroduces the Jan. 10 ordinance for approval the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 6: Upon reconsideration, Vogel rules in favor of developers and orders the 
city to issue building permits. The city appeals. Vogel's order is stayed. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 7: The council adopts a moratorium extension ordinance identical to the 
one of Jan. 10, except for the addition of an "emergency" clause intended to 
make it effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 13: At the final of four hearings, the Planning Commission endorses the 
proposed zoning ordinance with minor modifications and sends it to the council 
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 21: The City Council adopts a resolution, which requires no waiting 
period, to extend the moratorium until May 21 to hold public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
March 28: After three public hearings, the council is told by city planners 
that the proposed zoning ordinance would only have a marginal effect in 
reducing population growth. Council members start calling the proposal the 
Design Ordinance. They instruct the staff to begin work on a new ordinance to 
limit population growth. Planners say the new ordinance will not be ready until 
at least February, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
April 25: With another resolution, the council extends the moratorium to Aug. 
22 or until the Design Ordinance is adopted. Although the council no longer 
believes that the Design Ordinance is the solution, the language of the 
original moratorium ties the two together. 
</P>
<P>
June 20: Councilman Carl Raggio proposes replacing the moratorium with 
temporary zoning controls that would reduce by half the number of units 
allowed. Three council members vote in favor, but City Atty. Frank R. Manzano 
advises that zoning ordinances require four votes for approval. Unable to agree 
on temporary zoning restrictions, the council postpones action for the 10th 
time on the moratorium-ending Design Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
July 11: A third resolution extends the moratorium until Feb. 28, 1990, or 
until the Design Ordinance is adopted. Raggio reintroduces his proposal for 
interim controls and falls short once again. Council members Dick Jutras and 
Larry Zarian say it's too drastic. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 21: Under pressure from public officials, Manzano reverses his previous 
stance, advising the council that Raggio's proposal can be approved by 
resolution on a simple majority vote. With that issue resolved, Zarian finally 
introduces the Design Ordinance after 19 postponements for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 26: The city submits arguments against Vogel's ruling to the state Court 
of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 28: The appellate court quickly upholds Vogel's ruling, adding that the 
resolutions adopted by the council are also invalid because zoning issues must 
be legislated through ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 3: The council introduces ordinances to enact a new moratorium and allow 
the projects held up to proceed under present zoning standards. The Design 
Ordinance vote is postponed another week.

Flying-Hi Enterprises put two people high in the sky last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dangling gently under a huge red and yellow parachute, the passengers bounced 
gracefully in the wind about 600 feet over San Pedro Bay in Long Beach. 
Tethered by steel cable to the deck of a 300-horsepower boat, they angled back 
and forth in the air like the flying sailors they had become. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared," Carey Mayberry said before climbing into the two-seat open 
compartment beneath the parachute. Using a winch, crew members began reeling 
the chute and its human cargo out like a kite directly from the moving deck 
into the flapping breeze behind. "I'm afraid of heights," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old cocktail waitress from Sunset Beach, she had won this ride for 
herself and companion Paul Scaringe by placing second in a local beauty 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was business as usual for the parasailing concession in this city on 
the ocean. For Flying-Hi Enterprises, "business" these days means providing its 
services for free. Long bureaucratic delays, its owners say, have prevented 
them from obtaining the city permits necessary to operate for profit in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
So the company is giving occasional promotional rides to people like Mayberry 
and Scaringe and planning to move to Mexico. When that happens, it will become 
the second local parasailing concession to disappear this fall, leaving the 
city's would-be parasailers with nowhere to turn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating," Flying-Hi president Bill Kimball said. "Very 
disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lorraine June, spokeswoman for the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors 
Council, which three months ago was touting the city's two parasailing 
concessions as major tourist attractions: "I'm very sad. (They) were helping 
make our waterfront come alive again with visitor activities. We've got these 
tremendous waterfront facilities, and it's a shame that they're not being taken 
advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
The city's brief stab at becoming a year-round parasailing center began last 
year with the arrival of a company called Parasail Adventures. Southern 
California in recent years has seen an increase of interest in the sport, in 
which customers pay to be strapped or seated under parachutes that are pulled 
behind fast-moving boats. 
</P>
<P>
In very short order, according to June, Parasail Adventures was able to get an 
exclusive contract to operate out of one of the city's prime locations, a dock 
near Shoreline Village by the downtown marina. 
</P>
<P>
That did not dissuade Kimball's competing Flying-Hi Enterprises from setting up 
shop a short time later. Because Shoreline Village was already spoken for, 
Kimball said, he obtained a temporary permit to operate out of nearby Shoreline 
Aquatic Park and embarked on negotiations for a permanent berth at a city-owned 
marina near the Viscount Hotel and Queen Mary across the Los Angeles River 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
For awhile things seemed to be going smoothly for the city's fledgling 
parasailing industry. Then two weeks ago, the industry hit turbulent waters: 
Parasail Adventures announced that it was going under. Company owner Kwan Lee 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Terry Koenig, marketing manager of Catalina Cruises which had contracted 
with Parasail Adventures for use of the dock near Shoreline Village, attributed 
the company's failure simply to its inability to attract enough customers to 
stay afloat. "Between advertising and running the boat," Koenig said, "they 
weren't able to make a go of it." 
</P>
<P>
Kimball's company, meanwhile, had developed problems of its own. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's temporary berthing permit expired Sept. 4 after only one month of 
operation. And negotiations for permanent use of the marina near the Viscount 
Hotel appeared to him to be hopelessly mired in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball blames the delay on foot-dragging by the hotel, which leases the marina 
from the Port of Long Beach and must formally request permission from the 
port's board of directors to allow parasailing there. 
</P>
<P>
Dave LaPort, manager of the Viscount Hotel, on the other hand, attributes it to 
Kimball's own delays early in the process in obtaining proper insurance and 
registering his boat with the Coast Guard. "The problem is that (he) started 
too late," LaPort said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, Kimball now says that he cannot remain in Long Beach. With 
no income and expenses of nearly $2,000 a month, he says, his small 
family-owned firm is on the verge of collapse. To stave off bankruptcy, Kimball 
says he plans within a few weeks to move to Baja, California, where he hopes to 
contract with a tourist resort to offer rides for about $35 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
But he has not given up on Long Beach. "We'll be back next year," he said, 
adding that he will begin negotiations early enough this time to be 
well-established by the beginning of the summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, though, he is mainly giving free rides to friends, family 
members and occasional contest winners. 
</P>
<P>
"That was great!" Scaringe, the contest winner's friend, enthused after his 
recent experience in the sky. "I'd do that again." 
</P>
<P>
Mayberry, for her part, seemed a bit less certain. "If people like roller 
coasters, they'll love this," she said, looking slightly pale. "My stomach 
hurts."

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;

<P>
TENTATIVE TEACHERS ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Teachers Assn. on Monday unveiled to teachers a tentative 
agreement with the district that includes a 6% pay raise and new health 
benefits for retirees but also has higher health insurance co-payments and a 
1.45% salary deduction for teachers who wish to buy into the Medicare system. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 120 teachers attending the meeting at Farragut Elementary School 
expressed disappointment at the tentative agreement, which is for this school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the district will pay $1,250 per year for health insurance 
for future retirees after age 65, to supplement Medicare coverage they may 
have. Retirees do not have any district health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The district will increase its contribution by 7% for teachers who are under a 
fee-for-service health plan. But the the total increased cost is higher, so a 
teacher's payment for individual coverage will go up from $41 to $57 a month, 
said association President Bess Doerr. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also adopts a new state provision in which teachers can buy into 
Medicare by paying 1.45% of their salary, which will be matched by a district 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Bennett, chairman of the School Employees Assn. for Lifetime Health 
Coverage, said the increase in teacher payments for the fee-for-service health 
plan, the 1.45% contribution for Medicare and increases in the cost of living 
eliminate any gain in buying power from the 6% raise. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett urged teachers to reject the contract in the ratification vote Oct. 10. 
"It doesn't take a math teacher -- and I'm an English teacher -- to figure out 
this is no deal," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said she expects the contract to be ratified in a close vote. The 
district and the teachers union have been negotiating since June over salary 
and benefits for this year, the second in a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would cover about 280 teachers, counselors, nurses and 
librarians. The district's 250 custodians, instructional aides, cafeteria 
workers and other classified employees -- under a "me too" clause in their 
contract -- will get the same salary and benefit provisions that teachers get, 
Assistant Supt. Ralph Villani said.

TRASH INCINERATOR TAKEOVER WILL AVOID SHUTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To avoid a shutdown of Long Beach's new trash-burning plant on Terminal Island, 
the city is taking over the plant from the company that built it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city will pursue legal claims against that company, Dravo 
Corp. of Pittsburgh, which has indicated it intends to sue the city for 
additional construction and testing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Dravo, insisting it has fulfilled its contract obligations, has also informed 
the city it will soon pull out of the plant. To keep it running, the City 
Council and the plant's governing board Tuesday voted to assume responsibility 
for the facility and continue the contract with the company that is actually 
operating the plant, Montenay Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Using money from a construction escrow account, the city will attempt to finish 
the repairs it says are necessary to get the plant running the way it is 
supposed to. Officials also voted to stop any remaining payments on the $107 
million plant and to pursue legal claims against Dravo for breach of contract.

SENIOR CENTER TO GET GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A full-time security guard will be on duty at the West Hollywood Senior Center 
in Plummer Park this month, in response to rising concern about the safety of 
staff and clients there. 
</P>
<P>
A letter to the Department of Human Services from Jewish Family Services, which 
operates the center, said the increasing number of transients, including the 
homeless, mentally ill and drug users, is causing volunteers, staff and clients 
to feel unsafe. The letter cited four incidents of violence that have occurred 
since June. 
</P>
<P>
The city council called for an evaluation by its staff of the security 
situation in early November.

COSTS WILL BE SPLIT 3 WAYS FOR COLLEGE STUDENT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 20 years of struggle, students at Cerritos College will get a 
student center under an innovative plan recently approved by the Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, three administrative offices will be renovated and converted to 
a student center for the 20,000-student campus. 
</P>
<P>
A new administration building will then be constructed to house the displaced 
administrative offices. Construction will take about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Students of Cerritos College will contribute $400,000 toward 
construction costs, while the administration will provide $245,000 and 
financial aids programs will give $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been too expensive for the Associated Students to raise enough 
money to construct a new center, said Mark Wallace, public information 
director.

COLLEGE TEACHERS AT IMPASSE IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators and teachers at Rio Hondo College have reached an impasse in 
their contract negotiations, mostly because of disagreements over salary, and 
have requested that the state send in a mediator to help solve the differences. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, which had been going on since last spring, are expected to resume 
when a negotiator is assigned in two weeks. Meanwhile, the teachers are 
continuing to work under the terms of their old three-year contract, which 
expired in July. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides say they expect to solve the disagreements without a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are extremely amicable right now," said college spokeswoman Pamela Cox, 
adding that outside mediators often have been called upon to help solve 
contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are requesting an immediate 12% raise and an 18% salary increase 
over the next two years. College administrators are offering an immediate 6.5% 
increase and a 12% increase over the next two years.

SCOPE: MUSEUM OF ART IN FURMAN PARK 'ADDS A DIMENSION THAT'S NECESSARY TO THE 
CITY OF DOWNEY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an island of culture behind the trees and benches where mothers watch 
their children play in Furman Park. It is the Downey Museum of Art, whose goal 
for the past 32 years has been to exhibit quality art without admission charge 
for Southeast-area residents who cannot, or will not, venture into the large 
museums of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here as an educational institution, to teach about art, to give (area 
residents) a place to come to appreciate art," Executive Director Scott Ward 
said. "It's an important resource to this area to have free access to 
high-quality art." 
</P>
<P>
Ward estimates that about 15,000 people a year pass through the modest building 
to view its exhibits. Part of Ward's mission is to attract art enthusiasts with 
quality displays. The other part is to expose area residents to the world of 
painting, sculpture, weavings and other art forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people who come to the museum had no intention of coming to view 
art," Ward said. "They came (to the park) for a birthday party or to jog 
around." 
</P>
<P>
The museum was founded in 1957 by a group of residents called the Downey Art 
Assn. Developer Willard Woodrow donated the facility to the city for the 
museum. His wife, Alice, was the museum's founding director. 
</P>
<P>
"In that time there was an extraordinary amount of interest and civic ambition 
to raise the lot of the locals, in a sense," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials still view the museum as an important part of the municipal 
landscape. The city pays for maintenance of the building and for its utilities 
-- about $35,000 a year, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"It adds a dimension that's necessary to the city of Downey," Councilman Robert 
G. Cormack said. "And it's not at a great cost to the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
The museum is a nonprofit organization that runs on an annual budget of about 
$100,000, which includes the salaries of its four part-time employees, Ward 
said. In addition to the support from Downey, the museum receives several 
grants and money and services from about 300 individual and corporate members, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey Museum of Art concentrates on showing art produced in this century 
by professional California artists. The museum does not have the clout to 
attract expensive masterpieces nor the protective facilities to ensure their 
safety, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
In a north-south group exhibit, the museum is now showing the works of five 
artists from Northern California and five artists from Southern California. The 
exhibit, which runs through Nov. 5, includes pieces by Cheryl Calleri of Santa 
Cruz, Gail Chase-Bien of Napa, Stan Dann of Oakland, Shari Lamanet of San 
Francisco, Barbara Milman of Davis, Beth Bachenheimer and Hilary Baker of Los 
Angeles, Mitchell Friedman of Sherman Oaks, Penelope Jones of Highland Park and 
Gary Singer of Riverside. The museum is open from noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In most exhibits, the art is either loaned by the artist or by a collector. 
Many of the works are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hard to pull together shows because there are lots and lots of 
artists in the world who want to show," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, the museum space is reserved for the Downey Art League, which 
sponsors an exhibit of works produced exclusively by local artists. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren frequently tour the museum, which also offers art classes during 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then, Ward displays portions of the museum's modest 400-piece 
collection. About half of the collection is composed of works by Boris Deutsch, 
a Los Angeles painter and muralist who died in 1978. Deutsch's works were 
displayed last May and June along with the works of other artists who depicted 
Los Angeles in the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he does not know the value of the museum's collection, but it will be 
evaluated in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The art displayed by the museum has, in past years, produced an uproar within 
the largely conservative city. Cormack remembers an exhibit several years ago 
which contained sculptures of genitals. Community members and city officials 
complained. The offending items were moved to a back room and a sign was posted 
warning patrons that they might be offended by looking at them. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see just the organ on a pedestal or something, I think that's 
carrying things a little far," Cormack said. "But I think they've had some real 
thought-provoking art in the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a photographer who became the museum's executive director two years ago, 
said he is mindful of the family nature of the community when he plans a show. 
But that does not prevent the display of a legitimate piece of art that may 
contain nudity. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he plans to produce more shows that reflect the changing demographics 
of the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the museum showed the art of about 25 Soviet emigres, many of 
whom were Armenian. The Southeast's Armenian community is concentrated in 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
A "Cambodians in America" show is scheduled for late 1990. And Ward says he 
plans to exhibit the work of artists from Guadalajara, Mexico, the following 
year in recognition of this area's large Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to reach out to a broad audience," Ward said. "We're trying to respond 
to the region and its changing nature."

CITY NODS TO RECYCLED ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recycled paper will supply 10% of the city's paper needs by mid-1990, if a goal 
set by the City Council is met. Council members adopted a policy of preference 
for recycled and reusable goods, authorizing city staff to pay up to 5% more 
than it is now paying for such products. 
</P>
<P>
"We're protecting the atmosphere and fighting the greenhouse effect," 
Councilman John Heilman said at Monday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the meeting, council members sipped water from bright blue 
plastic-coated paper cups. (According to Mary Tyson, the city clerk, all cups 
ordered through the city's purchasing department are nontoxic and 
biodegradable. The plastic cups, she said, were bought by an employee at a 
supermarket to match the blue cloth and thermos bottles on the speakers' 
table.) 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed after the meeting about City Hall's overall recycling practices, 
Heilman's deputy, Nancy Greenstein, said: "We've been recycling for about a 
year and a half, and we're doing real well. All city buildings have bins for 
newspaper, white and computer paper, bottles and plastic soda jars and cans. In 
the past year, she said, City Hall, an elementary school, a senior center and 
an office of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department had designated nearly 40 tons 
of discarded items for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Greenstein was enthusiastic about prospects for purchasing recycled paper. 
"We've been looking at buying it for a long time, but it was too expensive. Now 
the prices have come down, and the differential is not that great. And we'll be 
talking to other cities, such as Santa Monica, about making joint purchases to 
be really cost-effective."

OXNARD COUNCIL CUTS TRIPS, TURNS IN CREDIT CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a symbolic gesture to Oxnard residents, City Council members have turned in 
their city-sponsored American Express cards and canceled out-of-state trips to 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday also called for its staff to develop a balanced budget that 
does not require using any reserve funds and requested a report on travel by 
city workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sending a message to not only the city staff but to everyone in the 
city," Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said. "We have to cut corners." 
</P>
<P>
The council disclosed two weeks ago that estimated 1988-89 revenue is about 
$1.7 million less than expected, while expenditures are about $850,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the council adopted a 1989-90 budget with service-level reductions of 
$1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the council withdrew $805,000 from reserve funds, which it 
has been forced to do several times since the 1986-87 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The council has recently been barraged by residents angered over closures of 
fire stations -- an action forced by budget reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also at an impasse with the Oxnard firefighters union and the 
Oxnard chapter of the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County, a union 
representing more than 300 clerical, technical and professional city employees. 
</P>
<P>
To show their concern for finances, three of the council members have canceled 
trips to Atlanta to attend the National League of Cities conference. 
Councilwoman Ann Johs will pay her own way. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Maron said she will not ask to be reimbursed for previous travel 
expenses amounting to between $1,500 and $1,800. And Johs produced a check for 
$1,329.05 to cover her expenses for the Atlanta trip. 
</P>

Council members Manuel Lopez and Geraldine Furr were not present.

HISTORICAL DISTRICT IS NOT WARRANTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in regard to your Sept. 24 article, "Landmark List Grows Quickly as 
Long Beach Hails Heritage." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Long Beach has a tendency to embark on zoning changes when only a 
minority of residents have voted on a special issue. With only 43% of 
California Heights residents voting, Long Beach is considering designating my 
neighborhood a historical district. This "wholesale" designation of California 
Heights is not warranted. The homes here were built over the last 50 or more 
years and are not like the Carroll Park area where the architecture is 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of designating the entire neighborhood, they should seriously consider 
doing it by structure as mentioned in your article. The historical district 
designation will only discriminate against homeowners who cannot keep their 
homes to the standards decided by the affluent members of the Cultural Heritage 
Commission. The new designation will act to keep out marginal homeowners and 
create a neighborhood where only the rich can live. Whatever happened to a 
democratic society where we do things for the good of the entire society and 
not for just a few rich ones?

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
AIR TRAVEL SECURITY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 392 to 31, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1659) requiring 
U. S. airlines and high-risk domestic and international airports to upgrade 
their defenses against terrorism. In a policy shift, the U. S. Treasury rather 
than the private sector would pay for stiffer airport and flight security. 
</P>
<P>
The bill requires airlines to install state-of-the-art explosives detectors at 
airports rated as likely terrorist targets. Commuter flights feeding major 
airlines would have to greatly tighten security, and airports would be required 
to begin computerized personnel screening to keep saboteurs out of sensitive 
areas such as baggage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's cost of nearly $240 million over the next two years would come 
mostly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund rather than new appropriations. 
Built by ticket taxes, the fund has a surplus of $5.8 billion that serves 
mainly to reduce the deficit. President Bush opposed the bill on grounds that 
the cost should be met by airlines and airports and, where federal funds are 
necessary, through the discipline of the appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City) said the government should pay the 
cost because "the barbarous activities of terrorists are directed at . . . the 
U. S. government, not at the commercial carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) said: "Those who fly on international flights 
should pay for their own security through a surcharge of just $2 a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Arms Control Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The House rejected a bill (HR 1495) to reauthorize the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency through fiscal 1991 at a cost of about $73 million. The vote 
of 247 to 140 fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill 
under a shortcut parliamentary procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The agency puts into effect arms control policies set by the President and top 
Administration officials. Congress also has influence over it. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly at issue on this vote was House committee control of the agency's 
On-Site Inspection Agency, which monitors Soviet compliance with the 
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty's requirement that the superpowers 
destroy their intermediate-range missiles. The bill gave the Foreign Affairs 
Committee more jurisdiction over the agency than the Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said the bill will promote "greater 
reassurance that compliance is, in fact, occurring." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) said the bill undermines "our ability to ensure that 
the INF treaty is implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

DEUKMEJIAN OKS $250,000 GRANT TO RESTORE OLD LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After receiving a barrage of letters from Eagle Rock community groups, Gov. 
George Deukmejian has signed into law a grant of $250,000 for restoration of 
the 75-year-old former Eagle Rock Library building. 
</P>
<P>
The allocation was part of a bill bringing together California legislators' pet 
spending projects. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) inserted the money for the library 
into the legislative package generally known as the "Christmas tree bill," 
which was adopted on the final day of the legislative session. Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale) also worked on behalf of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deukmejian's signature this week was anticipated, a dozen Eagle Rock 
organizations mounted a letter-writing campaign to ensure against an item veto. 
The governor deleted the same allocation from this year's state budget in July. 
</P>
<P>
The grant, when combined with a similar allocation of $230,000 last year, will 
still provide only about half the money needed for restoration of the Spanish 
Mediterranean building at 2225 Colorado Blvd., which was vacated when a new 
library was built in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Mike de la Torre, a deputy for Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, 
said the next step for the city will be a $40,000 engineering study to 
determine the feasibility of converting the building into a community arts 
center.

GROVE SCHOOL EQUIPS MUSIC AFICIONADOS TO PLAY FOR A LIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Kidwell kept warm through three Alaskan winters by humming "Summertime" 
while on ski patrol for the U. S. Army. But he recently got the chills singing 
it at a Van Nuys music school where such pop icons as Linda Ronstadt and Barry 
Manilow have taken classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Summertime, and the living is easy," croaked Kidwell, 21, wide-eyed and 
trembling slightly with stage fright during his first performance for fellow 
students in a class at Grove School of Music. But with the steady encouragement 
of his teacher and classmates, Kidwell's reedy voice became smooth enough for 
him to belt out the last few lines of the George Gershwin tune. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Grove's reputation for preparing students, such as 
the clean-cut Kidwell, as well as aspiring long-haired singers for musical 
success has enabled it to double its enrollment and to move out of its cramped 
quarters in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.5-Million Renovation 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley's only music trade school, which offers a variety of 
classes, including rock keyboard and Latin percussion, occupies the old Daily 
News building in the 14500 block of Sylvan Street. The school has spent $1.5 
million to renovate the building, including the addition of two recording 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an outstanding school -- one of the best in the country," said Jack 
Wheaton, administrative director of jazz studies at USC's School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
"They're particularly strong in turning out people who are specifically trained 
to go out and make a living in music, be it nightclubs or writing for TV and 
film." 
</P>
<P>
"They have some fantastic teachers," said David Roitstein, a professor at 
CalArts. "I have a lot of respect for what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
But the school that trains its 600 students to become, or at least rub 
shoulders with, some of the world's best jazz, rock and popular musicians 
cannot boast of a glamorous campus. The seedy pawnshops and discount stores of 
Van Nuys Boulevard are just a block away from the school's one-story building. 
</P>
<P>
"This school shouldn't be here," said Swiss drummer Pascal Chollet, 25, one of 
the 100 or so foreign students enrolled at Grove. "We should be in Hollywood 
where the clubs are." 
</P>
<P>
But Joel DiBartolo, a bass player on "The Tonight Show" and an instructor at 
Grove, pointed out that many of the city's movie and recording studios are in 
the San Fernando Valley. For example, Universal Studios is in Universal City 
and Evergreen Recording Studios is in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians these days can't just depend on the club scene for work," DiBartolo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its unglamorous location, Grove manages to attract students from the 
East Coast, Hawaii and Japan. Ronstadt took a guitar class there in the 
school's early days, and Manilow studied electronic music there even after he 
became famous, according to Todd Ferguson, the school's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Hours 
</P>
<P>
Accredited by the National Assn. of Schools of Music, Grove offers several 
one-year programs, including general musicianship, recording and engineering, 
composing and arranging, and guitar. Costs vary from $200 for a 20-hour 
workshop to thousands of dollars for the yearlong programs. 
</P>
<P>
From early in the morning until long after midnight, students crowd the 
school's gray, carpeted halls, carrying instrument cases and music folders. It 
is not uncommon for cafeteria patrons to have students interrupt their lunch 
with spontaneous renditions of country and Western songs or guitar "riffs." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students resemble the members of the long-haired rock band Bon 
Jovi, whose members wear tight black clothes and earrings; others would not 
look out of place in a business office. 
</P>
<P>
Chip McClelland, 49, still dresses like an accountant on holiday in beige 
slacks and a button-down shirt. He left his accounting firm and family behind 
four months ago in Maui, Hawaii, to pursue his passion -- playing the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the people on the island think I'm crazy to come over here with a bunch 
of heavy metal guitar players, but my wife understands," McClelland said. "I 
knew I had holes in my training, but I was almost buried by the work last 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Caruso, 26, who traveled from Queens, N. Y., to Van Nuys to perfect his 
guitar playing, also finds the curriculum challenging. Caruso wears his long, 
black hair in a frizzy halo and said he performs on weekends in a band called 
Chastity. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get on stage and play rock all day, but I want to be a better musician 
than that," Caruso said. He said he doesn't have the discipline to learn to 
read music on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Versatility Essential 
</P>
<P>
The professional music world has become so competitive that, in order to have 
an edge, even rockers have to be able to play a variety of styles, said Rob 
McConnell, a well-known trombone player and bandleader who teaches at Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, a guitarist should know the whole electronic side of things, 
synthesized music, doing solos, acoustic, 12-string and maybe even how to play 
another instrument," McConnell said. "Otherwise, with the turnover in the 
popularity of rock groups, you could be a hot rock player today and some bum on 
the street tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Since the school was established in 1974, its philosophy has been to make its 
students marketable, said founder and President Dick Grove, 61. A well-known 
composer, arranger and pianist, Grove teaches at the school. 
</P>
<P>
John Campbell, 28, of Claremont said his education at Grove has paid off. A 
free-lance keyboard player, composer and arranger, Campbell was able to build a 
home recording studio this year with his $85,000 in earnings. Attending the 
school "changed my life," Campbell said. "I'd never be this successful 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gates, 33, of Canoga Park said he has only made $17,000 as a free-lancer 
during the nine months since he graduated. But he credits the school with 
teaching him how to write music, including jingles for Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Being a musician "is not like being a lawyer or accountant," he said. "It takes 
years to build contacts, but I love music and that's what drives me," despite 
constant rejections and low income.

The "New World Arts Festival" in Ventura this weekend celebrates North and 
South American art, music and poetry, and offers activities as diverse as a 
puppet show and a tour of artists' homes and studios. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Arts Council is tying the celebration, which focuses on culture in 
the Americas, with Columbus Day on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend begins with the Magical Moonshine Puppet Theatre using giant 
puppets, masks and music to present "Animal Folktales of the Americas." The 
performance will be held at 7 p.m. Friday at Sheridan Way School, 573 Sheridan 
Way, Ventura. Advance tickets are $3 for children and $5 for adults; at the 
door, they are $4 for children and $5.50 for adults. 
</P>
<P>
Local Chumash legends will be told by storytellers Michael Ward and Vincent 
Tutaimait -- who is of Chumash descent -- accompanied by flute music from 
several Indian tribes by Renee Janton. The program "Corn Songs and Coyote 
Stories" will be held from 2 to 4 p.m. Saturday in the courtyard of the Old 
Livery, 34 N. Palm St. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening will be highlighted with a poetry reading in English and 
Spanish. Chicano poets Luzma Espinosa; Armando Garcia and Jesus Perez, both of 
Los Angeles; Armando Vallejo of Santa Barbara, and Diane Wyman of Ventura will 
read from their works. The "Poema" reading will be from 7 to 9 p.m. at the City 
Bakery, 2358-C E. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
Stone lithographs by Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo, who is celebrating his 90th 
birthday, will be on display along with hand-colored copper etchings by 
engraver Carazo Rosales. Acrylic and gesso paintings by Mexican artists Mario 
Romero Mauricio and Fernando Robles will be featured in an exhibition titled 
"Mexican Masters," opening Sunday with a reception from 2 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Ben Medrano will perform pieces by South American composers at a 
reception at the Momentum Gallery in the Old Livery, 34 N. Palm St. The 
exhibition, which will continue to Nov. 18, is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Mondays through Fridays and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekends.

Westpark, 450 W. Harrison Ave., at 11 and 11:45 a.m., and 12:45 and 1:30 p.m. 
Tours are free and reservations are suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity of Latino music and dance with Latin jazz, fusion, salsa, 
cumbias, rock 'n' roll and protest songs will be presented in a concert at the

TOP RUNNER MORRISON LOST TO NORDHOFF AFTER INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's bad enough Nordhoff High became the fourth team to be beaten up by the 
Moorpark Musketeers. But the Rangers suffered their biggest loss when their 
leading ground gainer left Friday's game early with an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Jayden Morrison, who leads the team with 286 yards in 51 carries, 
dislocated his right elbow in the first quarter of the 34-7 loss. He will be 
out four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, a senior, is the single setback in the Rangers' run-and-shoot 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to lose Jayden," Nordhoff Coach Cliff Farrar said. "We had the 
ball inside the five-yard line three times and scored once." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Brett Jackson, who has two carries for one yard, will most likely 
replace Morrison. Nordhoff (1-3) has fewer yards rushing (415) than any of the 
five leading ground gainers in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Farrar said he isn't afraid to pass on every down if the Rangers continue to 
have an ineffective running attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We can throw the ball 60 times if we have to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not convinced: Rio Mesa High could very well be undefeated entering its second 
Channel League game, but Coach John Reardon is skeptical that the Spartans are 
a better than average team. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa has a 3-1 record after convincing victories over Camarillo, Santa 
Clara and Hueneme last Friday. The Spartans would be undefeated if they had 
successfully made a two-point conversion in the final minute against Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still untested," Reardon said. "I don't think we've beaten an 
outstanding team yet. Santa Clara has an outstanding team for a Division VIII 
school. But we compete in a Division II league and there's a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
That test, Reardon believes, will come Friday at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Showing support: Mike Olgy, who was replaced by Rick Scott as Buena head coach 
in 1988, has been a valuable assistant and played an instrumental role 
preparing the Bulldogs for Friday's 35-29 win against Oxnard. After hearing 
that his father Jack Scott had suffered a stroke in San Gabriel Thursday 
morning, Rick Scott left the team in the care of Olgy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at the hospital, he ran the team," said Scott, who has become close 
friends with Olgy. "He was there to help when I needed him the most. I consider 
Mike a co-head coach, not just an assistant. I trust him to run the defense. He 
makes his decisions and I make mine." 
</P>
<P>
Roster changes: Fillmore also lost a key player when starting guard/linebacker 
Mike Palmateer sustained a broken bone in his left hand. Palmateer, who will be 
out four weeks, is the fastest linemen and is the third on the team with 28 
tackles. . . . Buena will have two of its top lineman back in uniform. Tackle 
Phil Kurta returns after missing four weeks with a broken bone in his left 
hand. Guard Terry Hall, who broke a bone in his right foot, will also be back 
in the lineup. . . . Joe Elliott, a two-way starter at St. Bonaventure, has 
moved with his family to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders rolling: Moorpark College (3-0) recorded its second consecutive shutout 
with a 55-0 pasting of Compton College on Saturday in a Western State 
Conference football game. 
</P>
<P>
While the defense has been hitting on all cylinders, Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner 
has been looking for a more balanced offense. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark achieved that balance against Compton in piling up 555 yards of total 
offense. Marc Monestime of Thousand Oaks rushed for 137 yards, and Freddie 
Bradley of Hueneme ran for 83 yards. Quarterback Jayson Merrill of Newbury Park 
completed 12 of 17 passes for 238 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to get where we want to be," Bittner said. "We're starting to 
get where we're proficient at both running and passing. That's what we're 
after." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are gearing up for a 1 p.m. home date against defending national 
champion Bakersfield on Oct. 14 and should have little trouble this week at 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Quick start: Ventura College (3-0, 2-0) has averaged more than 33 points a game 
and allowed only eight. 
</P>
<P>
So Saturday's WSC game at West Los Angeles (0-3), which has lost 13 consecutive 
games since resuming its program last season and has been outscored 106-9 this 
season, should be a sure win, right? 
</P>
<P>
"You compare scores and think we should win," Ventura Coach Phil Passno said. 
"But we still have to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Making special teams special: In a WSC win over Santa Monica on Saturday, 
Ventura's special teams blocked a punt that set up a touchdown, blocked a field 
goal that would have given Santa Monica a lead, and also blocked a point-after 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
"Our special teams made the difference," Passno said. "Our kicking situation 
was better than theirs, and it paid off." 
</P>

HAMILTON'S 'LITTLE TRAIN' ON RIGHT TRACK FOR STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Fields probably has as much right to call himself "Little Train" as Lionel 
James, the former San Diego Chargers' star running back. Maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, the 5-foot-5, 150-pound Hamilton High School tailback and place-kicker, 
is about the same size as James, and his speed carries him through defenses 
swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
As did James, he can deliver the ball to the end zone on the ground, and he can 
also strike with extra point kicks and field goals. In addition, his high, 
booming kickoffs usually reach the end zone and are difficult, if not 
impossible, to return. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike James, his first name is not the same as a famous maker of model trains, 
but he is a railroad history buff and has a model train setup that fills his 
family's garage. And one day he would like to go into the transportation 
business. 
</P>
<P>
He is in business as Hamilton Coach John Ausbon's favorite mode of transport on 
the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"He is such a good runner and so maneuverable," Ausbon said. "He does such a 
sweet job of following his blocking that he can pick his own hole. He is that 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"He can find the hole, and I'm giving the ball to him. He's good for 25 carries 
a game." 
</P>
<P>
The senior runner found a lot of holes in the Yankees' opener, a 42-6 rout of 
Hollywood. He rushed for 188 yards on 14 carries (a 13.4-yard average), scored 
four touchdowns (including a 47-yarder) and kicked four extra points. 
</P>
<P>
A Hamilton fan at last week's game with Granada Hills was overheard saying that 
Fields did some things in the Hollywood game that he had never seen any runner 
do before. 
</P>
<P>
But that was against Hollywood. Against highly ranked Granada Hills, however, 
Fields was the Little Train that couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders trounced Hamilton, 43-6, and Fields found no holes in the 
Granada Hills defensive line and went nowhere. Hounded by swarms of tacklers 
wherever he went, he rushed for just 53 yards on 14 carries (a 3.8-yard 
average). 
</P>
<P>
His bad day wasn't his fault. His offensive line was badly out-manned and 
didn't provide much blocking. Granada Hills had several tacklers on Fields 
every time he carried the ball. Even a big train can't carry the mail through 
an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
Ausbon said that Fields "was taking some shots" in the Granada Hills game, but 
"he's still our running back and I'm going to give him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
He said Hamilton "may go to the pass more often" this year, but he added: 
</P>
<P>
"We probably won't face as tough a team as Granada unless we get into the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
If the teams don't get any tougher than the Highlanders, Fields seems certain 
of having better days; he has a good track record. Last year he was named to 
The Times All-Westside prep football team after a season in which he rushed for 
837 yards, caught 16 passes for 200 yards and kicked seven field goals, 
including a 52-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
It does not seem to be in Fields' makeup to make excuses for bad days, but he 
has been motoring on one bad wheel since he injured his left knee about midway 
through last season. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the knee has "a slight bone chip which rubs against the tissue" 
and that he wears a protective brace. His doctor has told him that he can play 
with the injury but that the knee will heal only with rest. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't plan to rest during the football season. "I was afraid that the 
brace would restrict my lateral movement, but it hasn't yet. I ice it down 
after a game and use a heating pad on it before I go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
The knee doesn't hurt him when he runs, but it does hurt when he plants his 
left foot to kick and that sometimes cuts down his kicking yardage a bit, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The knee may be a slight handicap, but his size may be an advantage for him as 
a runner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in the heart, I guess. It's strange how some big guys look tough but 
don't have it. It's all on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he also has an advantage in running behind his offensive line at 
Hamilton, which "has really done a good job. It's tough for the defense because 
they don't really know where the ball is until I come out from behind a bunch 
of big guys. Being small helps me out; it gives me an extra bit of hustle. If I 
were big, I'm afraid I'd be lazy." 
</P>
<P>
Laziness isn't in his makeup either. Ausbon said Fields is a good student. He 
was All-Los Angeles City in football and as a baseball shortstop in his junior 
year, he picked up his kicking skills in youth soccer leagues and he played 
youth league ice hockey for two years before his uncle Jeff talked him into 
going out for B football in his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
Fields said that he is an avid hockey fan and has been on either ice or roller 
skates all his life but that he is glad he gave up hockey for football. "I just 
decided that I'd rather be oriented with high school and be around the people 
I'm with all day in school." 
</P>
<P>
He said he prefers football to baseball "because I like non-stop action. In 
baseball, you have a lot more time to think; football is a reaction sport. 
</P>
<P>
"In baseball, it's easier for me to make the tough plays, to get to the hard 
shots, than it is to field a slow roller, where you have to think and then pick 
up the ball." 
</P>
<P>
More than a few colleges -- including UCLA, Nebraska, Oklahoma, San Diego State 
and Iowa State -- have picked up on Fields' ability to play football, and he 
wants to play in college. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks, however, that most of the bigger schools will want him more for his 
kicking ability than for his running and pass-catching skills. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when he went out for football as a Hamilton sophomore: "I was just 
out to play the game, to enjoy it. I didn't think it was going to be a big part 
of my life." But he turned out to be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I hope success comes with place-kicking and as a tailback," he said. 
If his choice of a college scholarship came down to kicking for a football 
power or being a runner or wide receiver at a smaller school, he said he would 
choose the smaller school "because I would have more input than as a 
place-kicker." 
</P>
<P>
Ausbon said if Fields hopes to be more than a place-kicker in college that he 
will have to become a more dedicated weightlifter than he has been. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll have to get pumped up," he said, "but wherever he goes, I hope they'll 
give him consideration as a running back too." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks Fields is capable of playing running back at a major 
college, Ausbon said: "That's a hard question. 
</P>
<P>
"If he feels in his heart and mind that he is capable of being a top running 
back with a big school, if that's what he wants to do, then I believe Jay has 
that ability."

GAME FISH CATCHES ARE PUTTING ROCK COD SEASON ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early season rock cod fishing trips have been put on hold. Traditionally in 
October, most anglers bring out their deep-water fishing gear. It's hard to 
believe they are keeping busy with so many late-season catches of game fish in 
all areas. 
</P>
<P>
The one-to-three-day trips have been heralded as the best exotics fishing in 
four years, as the yellowtail and tuna continue to move closer to the South Bay 
fishing fleets. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned from a trip to Cedros Island 
off Mexico and came upon a wide open yellowtail bite, plus tuna and some 
albacore that hit anything thrown at them. 
</P>
<P>
Each day of fishing resulted in large catches. Bill Lawson of Manhattan Beach 
was the first-day jackpot winner with his 35-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Denton's 34 1/2-pound yellowtail gave the Redondo Beach angler the 
second-day jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bontragen of Hermosa Beach, using 40-pound test line and after fighting 
his fish off the bottom, brought up the third-day jackpot winner and the 
largest fish of the trip when his sea bass weighed in at 77 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Forman of Torrance caught 24 yellowtail and five tuna using 20-pound test 
line and every one of his fish weighed more than 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena angler Mike Larose also used light tackle and decked 20 yellowtail, 
seven tuna and two albacore. 
</P>
<P>
A record was set at last week's Catalina Island Marlin Gold Tournament as 67 
marlin were weighed in during the two-day event. Four of the marlin went more 
than 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The winner was Mark Mitchell of Orange County, who weighed in a 230-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Second place went to San Pedro fishermen Gary Norby and Jim Stein aboard 
Norby's boat the Outerlimits. It weighed 228 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin anglers fishing the 277 Spot report that tuna have been picked up while 
trolling for marlin. This has alerted South Bay sportfishing boats, which can 
make the trip in one day.

NORTH TORRANCE AT CULVER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culver City (4-0 overall) continues to roll, and wide receiver-defensive back 
Greg Hooks provided much of the momentum last week as the Centaurs opened their 
Ocean League schedule by swamping Centennial, 44-0. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks scored in nearly every way imaginable: on interception returns of 45 and 
34 yards, a 77-yard punt return and on a 47-yard reception of a Troy Dunlap 
pass. Dunlap completed nine of 13 passes for 161 yards and also threw a 37-yard 
touchdown pass to tailback John Haqq. Haqq carried 18 times for 118 yards and a 
23-yard touchdown, and in four games he has rushed for 679 yards and has 
accounted for 751 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance (1-3, 1-0) came from behind to edge Morningside, 8-7, in a 
league opener last week. The winning drive was mounted on the ground rather 
than in the air, the usual strength of the Saxons. Last summer North won the 
Los Angeles Games passing championship behind all-league quarterback Brian 
Jurado and wide receiver Eric Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
The Centaurs will play host to North Torrance at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes at Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
With starting running backs Mark Harper and Mike North sidelined with injuries, 
Santa Monica (3-0 overall) was fortunate to defeat Torrance, 20-15, in a Bay 
League opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars got out to a 15-0 lead before quarterback John Aylsworth spurred 
Santa Monica to victory. Aylsworth hit on 12 of 26 passes for 147 yards and two 
touchdowns and scored the winning touchdown on a six-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings will entertain Palos Verdes (3-1, 0-1) at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Santa 
Monica College. The Sea Kings won their first three games, but unbeaten 
Hawthorne shut them out, 20-0, in a league opener. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hamilton at Venice 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton (1-1 overall) and top running back Jay Fields couldn't dent the 
Granada Hills defense last week. Fields was held to 53 yards on 14 carries, and 
the Highlanders routed the Yankees, 43-6. 
</P>
<P>
Venice (3-0) held Monroe to 123 yards rushing and didn't allow a pass 
completion in its 27-6 victory last week. 
</P>
<P>
On offense against Monroe, Venice was led by junior tailback Mark Walker and 
quarterback Louis Jones. Walker rushed for 135 yards on 14 carries and scored 
on a 26-yard run. Jones, a wide receiver on offense last year, had eight 
completions in 10 attempts for 65 yards and one touchdown and also scored on a 
seven-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams may pass more often than usual in this Coastal Conference opener at 
8 p.m. Friday at Venice. Jones is improving in his new role as a passer, and 
Hamilton scored its only touchdown on a nine-yard pass from Courtney Curry to 
Matt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts at Westchester 
</P>
<P>
Westchester (2-1 overall) moved out to a 19-0 lead, held El Camino Real to 88 
yards in total offense and coasted to a 27-7 victory last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Comets, who will play host to Manual Arts (0-3) in a Coastal Conference 
opener at 8 p.m. Friday, scored on the first play from scrimmage against the 
Conquistadores. 
</P>
<P>
In the El Camino game, Brad Freeman began by throwing a 63-yard touchdown pass 
to Nathaniel Bradley. On his second pass attempt, Freeman connected with Darren 
Johnson on a 65-yard screen hat set up the Comets's second touchdown, a 17-yard 
run by Tim Holliday. Johnson returned a fumble 45 yards for another touchdown.

SCHOOL BUS ROUTES RESTORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to parental protests, the Bassett Unified School District will 
reinstate several school bus routes it eliminated last summer to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
The board said it will spend an additional $150,000 per year to lease or buy 
two more buses. In June, the district consolidated bus stops and eliminated 
several routes to trim its $450,000 transportation budget. 
</P>
<P>
Parents complained that the action endangered their children by forcing them to 
walk along busy streets and through unsafe neighborhoods. School officials said 
they did not eliminate any bus lines where students would have been forced to 
walk across major streets or railway tracks. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,100 students attend the Bassett Unified School District, which serves 
western La Puente and Valinda. The district has an annual budget of about $20 
million.

NEW LIBRARY HAS OLD TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nine-week renovation project at Pasadena's Central Library downtown has 
yielded a return to the past and a technological step forward. 
</P>
<P>
With $2.4 million raised by the Pasadena Public Library Foundation, the library 
was closed while workers removed light fixtures from the 1960s and shelving in 
two rooms from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
In their place went brass ceiling lights, reproductions of the original 
fixtures when the library first opened in 1927, and dark-stained wooden shelves 
in the two rooms matching the older shelving in the rest of the library. 
</P>
<P>
The historically accurate touches were complemented with a computerized card 
catalogue system and computer terminals recessed in the circulation desk. A 
security system at the entryway was also installed and concealed in wood 
paneling. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to provide the most current technology but not in contrast with 
the building itself," said librarian Victoria Johnson.

MALL DEVELOPER WINS DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has given the developer of Covina Town Square Shopping Center, 
Alexander Haagen Development Co., until next June to file the final tract map 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly modified map the City Council approved Monday divides the 36-acre 
property on North Azusa Avenue into 14 lots. When the project is completed in 
about a year and a half, 13 main buildings housing either retail shops or 
department stores will stand on individual lots, and a 14th lot would include 
common areas and an existing Sears store. 
</P>
<P>
The subdivision of the property is important to simplify financing of the 
development and the sale or lease of separate portions of the complex, Planner 
Hal Ledford said. He added that the city encouraged the project partly because 
of fears that Sears might move, if improvements were not made. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative map with the site divided into eight instead of 14 lots was 
approved by the council in 1987, but that approval was good for only two years. 
The developers have until June, 1990, to file a final map with the county, 
Assistant Planner Shelby Williams said.

SWIM CENTER GETS ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-million advance to help build the $6-million Rose Bowl Aquatics Center, 
under construction since June, has been granted by the Pasadena Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The advance was part of a $28-million revenue bond issue approved Tuesday by 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the public swim center call for two Olympic-size pools, competition 
diving equipment, a small children's pool and a clubhouse. The center is 
expected to be completed by May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Under a financial agreement with the city, the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center, the 
nonprofit corporation building the center, was to receive $4 million from the 
bond issue, pay back $3.5 million to the city over five years and obtain the 
rest of the money from contributions. About $2 million in pledges has been 
raised so far. 
</P>
<P>
However, the $1-million advance from the city's General Fund was requested to 
meet construction expenses that must be paid before money will be available 
from the bonds and contributions.

FEMALE PILOTS AT MUDD RECALL THEIR EXPLOITS

<P>
Pioneer aviator Fay Gillis Wells was at Harvey Mudd College last week, talking 
about how in 1929 she became the first female member of the Caterpillar Club, 
open only to those who parachute from an airplane in distress. 
</P>
<P>
"My instructor asked me if I'd like to try aerobatics, after I'd been flying 
three weeks," said Wells, who counts President Bush as a fellow Caterpillar 
Club member. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were upside down, the plane began to vibrate and then some tail and 
wing sections disintegrated. I bailed out and landed in a tree -- without a 
scratch. But he was put into an ambulance and, after heading for the hospital, 
it was hit by a car. Meanwhile, they rushed me back to the airport to fly 
again, so I'd get rid of the fear." 
</P>
<P>
The mystery of a lost trophy and the mystique of a round-the-world flight were 
a bond for a group of female pilots who gathered for a meeting at the college 
in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for Lost Trophy 
</P>
<P>
Wells was in California to search for a lost trophy given to female aviators 
each year. The Claremont meeting was suggested by Luanne Paul King of Pasadena, 
a pilot, educator and writer with whom Wells stayed in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Iris Critchell of Claremont, veteran pilot and co-founder with her husband, 
Howard, of Mudd's unique Isabel Bates Aeronautics Program, got together a group 
of Mudd students and faculty to meet Wells in the college library. In the Bates 
program, flying is taught to science and engineering students, not as a sport 
or technological discipline, but "to add a new level of self-mastery in 
learning" and "enhance the whole education and development of the individual 
young person through the privilege of flight," according to a brochure. 
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, Critchell also reported on the progress of her friend, Gaby 
Kennard, an Australian who is flying solo around the world. Kennard was making 
a crucial crossing of the South Atlantic at that point, and later was reported 
safe on terra firma at Dakar, the capital of Senegal on the West African coast, 
where she was to rest briefly before the final part of her journey back to 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earhart's Route 
</P>
<P>
Kennard is retracing approximately the equatorial route along which aviation 
pioneer Amelia Earhart disappeared in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, who will turn 81 this month, told of other exploits in the air, as well 
as in journalism. They varied from Africa, where her son was born while she and 
her husband covered the Italo-Ethiopian war, to the Soviet Union, where she 
once spent 19 days flying from Moscow to Tashkent, "because we had to make 40 
forced landings." 
</P>
<P>
But she wouldn't trade those interruptions for anything, she said, because they 
offered incomparable opportunities to fraternize with Russians. "Routine stops 
wouldn't have been permitted then," she said, "But an emergency? Hey, roll out 
the vodka!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breaking News 
</P>
<P>
She was in China in 1934 to cover the coronation of Pu Yi ("The Last Emperor") 
and again with President Nixon when he reopened relations with Beijing in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of the founders, with Amelia Earhart and others, of the Ninety 
Nines, an international association of women pilots, and was the main force 
behind creation of the organization's International Forest of Friendship, in 
Atchison, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Wells has been trying to find out what happened to one of the 
Harmon Trophies. The Clifford B. Harmon International Trophies were established 
in 1926 and given annually for outstanding achievement by male and female 
aviators or by aeronauts (balloonists). 
</P>
<P>
However, the female aviator trophy has somehow been lost and the trail led 
Wells not only to the Mudd library but also to a woman in Agoura whose late 
father was a key Harmon trustee and to the last two women who won the award, 
both residing in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Janice Brown of Bakersfield, the Harmon winner in 1981, told Wells 
she never saw the trophy itself. "I just got a plaque," she said. She won it 
for flying the first solar-powered airplanes designed by Paul MacCready of 
Pasadena.

HOUSE VOTES DOWN CATASTROPHIC CARE; 
</P>
<P>
ACTION TO REPEAL PORTION OF MEDICARE PLAN SPURRED BY PROTESTS OVER SURTAX

<P>
The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to repeal Medicare's catastrophic care 
program, which Congress had enacted just 16 months ago as a major expansion of 
health benefits for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The 360-66 vote culminated a determined protest campaign by retired persons who 
were outraged by the special surtax levied on the elderly to provide the bulk 
of the money for the new benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of this country have spoken out," Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) 
said during Wednesday's occasionally emotional debate. "Let us be honest and 
face the fact we made a mistake a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to salvage a fragment of the program, its supporters offered a 
shrunken version containing the prescription drug benefit and several other 
provisions. They proposed to repeal the surtax and keep only a $4-a-month 
increase in the monthly premium paid by all Medicare beneficiaries. But even 
that proposal was rejected, 269 to 156. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senate to Vote 
</P>
<P>
The huge margin for repeal in the House strengthens the likelihood that the 
Senate, which will vote on the issue today or Friday, will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a powerful boost," said a spokesman for Sen. John C. Danforth 
(R-Mo.), who plans to offer an amendment to repeal the program. 
</P>
<P>
The House attached the measure to a massive deficit reduction bill that 
includes such controversial issues as the House-backed capital gains tax cut. 
The House hopes to complete action on the bill today and send it to the Senate, 
but final action could be several weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
The House vote cast a shadow over future efforts that Congress might have 
planned to expand Medicare or other social programs. New programs must be 
"carefully considered to ensure (that) they have broad public support," House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's House action represented an amazing turnabout by the House, which 
last year had voted, 328 to 71, to approve the catastrophic care program. The 
program's benefits include unlimited free hospital care after the first day, a 
ceiling on personal spending for doctor bills and partial coverage of 
prescription drug costs. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress, breaking with the tradition that the cost of social programs is 
spread across the entire population, mandated that the benefits of the 
catastrophic care program be paid for exclusively by the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Catastrophic care was still a relative bargain for 60% of the 33 million 
Medicare beneficiaries. Their only new expense was the additional $4-a-month 
Medicare premium. 
</P>
<P>
But the other 40% -- those who earn enough money to owe federal income taxes -- 
were hit by a new surtax of 15%, ranging up to $800 a year. These angry 
taxpayers, many of whom already had supplemental health insurance that provided 
many of the same benefits as the catastrophic care program, galvanized a 
congressional campaign for repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Congress "completely missed what seniors wanted," said Rep. Rod Chandler 
(R-Wash.) "We put this on the backs of the middle-income elderly." The handful 
of defenders of the law accused the House of retreating in panic. "When you 
hear the screams of protest from a well-organized constituency, you simply 
can't stand the heat," said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), one of the prime authors of the catastrophic plan, 
called it "one of the shortest legislative victories in my career. We are being 
stampeded by a small group of the wealthy to deny needed benefits to seniors." 
</P>
<P>
By repealing catastrophic care, which would have helped pay for mammogram 
screenings for breast cancer, "you are going to cause the death of 4,000 
elderly women," Stark told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Brian Donnelly (D-Mass.), leader of the repeal forces, called Stark's 
comments "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
For Rep. Harris W. Fawell (R-Ill.), one of a tiny band of congressional 
opponents who began pushing for repeal when Congress began work in January, 
Wednesday was a particularly sweet day. "Perhaps never before have American 
seniors spoken so clearly, so overwhelmingly and so unanimously on an issue 
before Congress," he said after the vote. "The House of Representatives today 
got the message." 
</P>
<P>
The vote was a sharp rebuke to a variety of organizations involved in issues 
affecting the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Retired Persons, with 30 million members, was a strong 
supporter of the original legislation resoundingly repealed Wednesday. As a 
fallback position, AARP backed the truncated prescription-drug version that 
also went down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Senior Citizens, which includes many retired union 
members, also supported the unsuccessful prescription drug plan as preferable 
to outright repeal. 
</P>
<P>
The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare had been a 
strong opponent of the surtax from the beginning, but it favored a change in 
the financing system over total repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House-passed measure, current catastrophic care rules, including 
expanded benefits for care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, would 
remain in effect until Jan. 1, 1990. After repeal, the old Medicare rules would 
resume, reducing the number of free hospital days and requiring greater 
payments by patients. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill would retain two relatively minor benefits: expansion of health 
coverage for poor people and some income protection for the spouses of people 
in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IS LOWER FOR NIBBLERS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frequent nibbling may be better for a person's cholesterol level than eating 
three square meals a day, Canadian researchers suggest in a study published 
today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol were 13.5% lower when study subjects ate small 
amounts of food 17 times a day than when they ate the same food but in three 
conventional meals, the University of Toronto scientists found. Total 
cholesterol in their blood, a combination of LDL and a beneficial form, called 
HDL, declined to 8.5% lower than on the three-meal plan. 
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that a person trying to cut cholesterol and the risk of 
heart disease could maximize the effects of a low-fat diet by also changing to 
small, frequent meals, said Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, professor of medicine and 
nutritional science, and chief author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the average man and woman, they will never go out and eat 17 meals 
a day," Jenkins said, "but we are saying that there seems to be some advantage 
to spreading the intake load during the day." 
</P>
<P>
If the idea sounds familiar, it is a basic tenet in dietary advice given to 
diabetics, and also has shown up in the last decade among a group of Americans 
the food industry refers to as "grazers." 
</P>
<P>
Grazers nibble their way through the day, sampling many different types of 
foods in small portions. The rise in appetizers on restaurant menus is one 
result, restaurant industry spokesmen say. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in the 1960s a series of research studies compared the effects of 
nibbling and gorging on cholesterol levels in the blood. The studies concluded 
that nibbling was better, and gorging was bad -- but nibbling was abandoned as 
a health strategy because overeaters who were urged to adopt nibbling tended to 
overeat several times a day instead of three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Jenkins and his colleagues suggest that the strategy may be useful 
as a cholesterol control strategy added to other dietary changes, if the 
patient's preferred eating pattern is already toward nibbling. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who can nibble or who can train themselves to nibble, 
and they would get some material advantage from this," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to confirming the earlier studies' results, the Toronto team 
suggests the biochemical mechanism for why nibbling suppresses cholesterol 
levels: the maintenance of a steady level of insulin in the body is responsible 
for this effect. 
</P>
<P>
This is because when a large amount of food is eaten, the pancreas responds by 
releasing a large amount of insulin, a hormone that is essential for the body 
to use sugar. The insulin stimulates the body to produce an enzyme that in turn 
causes the liver to produce cholesterol and dump it into the blood, they 
report. Excess insulin also has been shown to stimulate changes in the arterial 
walls that promote formation of fatty plaques, leading to coronary heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto researchers put seven men -- ages 31 to 51 and with an average 
total cholesterol level of 204 mg per deciliter of blood -- onto a 33% fat 
diet. This proportion is similar to that being advocated as healthy by various 
nutritional experts. The diet gave roughly 2,500 calories a day. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government's cholesterol education program defines total 
cholesterol levels below 200 as desirable, 200-239 as borderline high-risk and 
240 or above as at high-risk of cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
Each man spent two weeks on the nibbling diet, eating every hour during the 
day, and another two weeks eating the same types and total amounts of food, but 
in three normal meals. The test periods were separated by two weeks in which 
the subjects ate their normal diets. 
</P>
<P>
During the nibbling phase, a pocket timer reminded the subjects to eat their 
small snacks prepackaged by the researchers -- for instance a half-slice of 
bread, a bare smear of margarine and half of a banana. During a dinner-hour 
splurge, subjects had three ounces each of broccoli, cauliflower and zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
With nibbling, total cholesterol levels fell from an average of 204 to 172. 
They also fell on the three-meal diet, to 189. Total cholesterol was 8.5% lower 
on the nibbling diet than on the three-meal one. 
</P>
<P>
The average levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol, fell from 127 to 105 on the 
nibbling diet, 13.5% lower than on the three-meal diet. LDL levels on the 
three-meal diet did not change significantly. 
</P>
<P>
LDL levels below 130 are considered desirable and above 160 high-risk. Since 
LDL is a major cholesterol carrier released into the blood by the liver, it is 
considered the major indicator of potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said reactions to the diet varied, depending on the person's normal 
eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
"Some individuals are nibblers, and some individuals are meal eaters," he said. 
"Meal eaters detested the nibbling because they never got a meal, and they 
hated eating all the time. The nibblers found being constricted to three meals 
without snacks was rather unpleasant, and they found themselves getting 
particularly hungry between meals." 
</P>
<P>
Dieter Kramsch, professor of research medicine in USC's Atherosclerosis 
Research Institute, said the Toronto study is noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins gives this advice to Americans who want to apply the Toronto research 
in their daily lives: "They should be very wary of the quick cup of coffee and 
cigarette in the morning, further coffee and a Danish at lunch and the entire 
balance of one day's intake at dinner time -- which is unfortunately a habit of 
many tired people when they get home from work," he said.

E. BERLIN BARS REFUGEES FROM U.S. EMBASSY

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 East German police officers sealed off the U.S. Embassy here 
Wednesday to prevent a crowd of East Germans from pushing their way in after 
learning that 18 others were seeking refuge there. 
</P>
<P>
The 18 had slipped into the embassy Tuesday through a side door and insisted on 
being helped to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
But by nightfall they had been persuaded to leave, on the assurance that the 
East German government would "view favorably" their applications for emigrant 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Europe, East Germans swam rivers, jammed railroad stations and 
crowded into other Western embassies hoping somehow to get to the West. Such 
scenes were being played out in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dresden Blockade 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, thousands of East Germans were boarding 
trains for West Germany. Thousands of others were lining up along the route 
hoping to get on board. At just one point, in Dresden, 3,000 people were 
reported to have been driven by the police from the right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, more than 100 East Germans arrived at the West German Embassy 
seeking asylum, bringing the number of East German refugees there to about 400. 
Some of them told of swimming rivers and evading border guards to get there. 
</P>
<P>
In Sofia, Bulgaria, four East Germans were reported to have asked for asylum at 
the West German Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin, the 18 unexpected guests -- 10 men and 
women and eight children, including three infants -- were kept in an anteroom 
off the main lobby. The curtains were drawn, and no outsiders were admitted. 
</P>
<P>
When the door was opened, they could be seen, in jeans and sneakers, lounging 
in leather chairs. Cartons of milk and mineral water stood next to three 
portable cribs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a problem," an embassy official said. "We can't throw them out on the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington a State Department official said, "We are devoting every effort 
toward finding a humanitarian solution to their plight." 
</P>
<P>
No details were made public here on what might have taken place between U.S. 
and East German officials. According to one report, embassy officials had 
talked with Wolfgang Vogel, the East Berlin lawyer who has been involved in 
earlier such situations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowd Gathered 
</P>
<P>
When it became known Wednesday morning that the East Germans had managed to get 
into the embassy, a crowd began gathering in front of the building. Several 
people, some of them carrying suitcases, tried to get in through the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, a young woman with a 3-year-old daughter, told reporters: "We 
heard the news on the radio that people were going into the American Embassy to 
leave East Germany -- and we decided to do the same thing. But they wouldn't 
let us in." 
</P>
<P>
People crowded around the entrance, but East German police soon arrived and 
herded them across the street. Later in the day, the police cordoned off the 
entire block and closed it to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in West Germany said that the trains carrying East Germans out of 
Prague would take a route different from that taken over the weekend, when 
scores of people along the way jumped on board. They said the route would move 
over a small section in the southwestern corner of East Germany, just enough to 
allow the East German authorities -- who have sought to avoid the stigma of 
mass defections -- to say the travelers were being expelled. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, the second wave of freedom-seeking East Germans left the West German 
Embassy to the sustained applause of several thousand Czechoslovak onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak officials, whose evident impatience with the East German 
government may have spurred the exodus, estimated that between 11,000 and 
12,000 East Germans will make the trip in an operation that was expected to 
require at least 12 trains and most of the night to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coins Discarded 
</P>
<P>
As the first train pulled out of Liben station in northeast Prague, with about 
1,000 cheering East Germans on board, the boarding area echoed with the sound 
of East German coins flung from the windows. Czechoslovak police, standing by 
with their arms folded, smiled and shook their heads as if in disbelief at the 
events of the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of the East Germans came five days after a similar operation, 
which removed 6,000 East Germans from inside and around the West German 
Embassy. West Germany confers automatic citizenship on East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, officials thought the arrangement was a one-time deal struck by 
East Germany, West Germany and Czechoslovakia. But within days the embassy 
grounds were again full, and East Germans continued to arrive until Tuesday, 
when the government in Berlin imposed restrictions on travel to Czechoslovakia, 
which has become one of the East Germans' major routes to the West. 
</P>
<P>
By the time East Germany agreed Tuesday to allow a second group of East Germans 
to leave Prague, nearly 10,000 were camped on the embassy grounds and in the 
streets approaching the 18th-Century palace that houses the West German 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trouble Clearing Tracks 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the embassy had expected the new departures to begin Tuesday 
night. But a Czechoslovak official at the Transportation Ministry said 
Wednesday that the East Germans had a problem clearing the railroad tracks of 
people who hoped to board the trains. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the Czechoslovak government, increasingly concerned 
over widespread public sympathy for the emigrants, pushed the East Germans to 
move quickly to bring the drama to a conclusion. Some sources suggested that 
the Czechoslovak government may have threatened to open its borders with West 
Germany unless the East Germans moved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Along with East Germany, Czechoslovakia is among the East Bloc's rock-ribbed 
resisters to political reform, and the government here has been seriously 
rattled by the problem of the East German refugees. Although the Czechoslovak 
government has been philosophically inclined to deal harshly with the East 
Germans -- and to uphold bilateral agreements that would prevent their 
departure to the West -- the involvement of a Western diplomatic mission and 
world press attention presented it with an almost insoluble problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apparent Confusion 
</P>
<P>
The confusion of the Czechoslovak authorities was apparent in the sometimes 
schizophrenic reaction of the police, who forcibly detained East Germans trying 
to scale the fences at the West German Embassy, then relented and let scores -- 
and then hundreds -- to enter unimpeded. By Tuesday, the police were simply 
standing on the fringes of the large crowd, which remained orderly and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
But for a Czechoslovak government that is not averse to turning fire hoses on 
its own protesting citizens, the spectacle of massive socialist disobedience -- 
much of it obviously supported by the population of Prague -- was hard to take. 
</P>
<P>
Many Prague residents offered lodgings to the East Germans, particularly to 
young parents with small children. Taxi drivers were ferrying them to the 
neighborhood of the embassy without charge. Many brought food to them, offered 
to cook and gave candy to the children. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands more came simply to watch, seemingly caught up in the spectacle. When 
the buses began to load Wednesday evening, thousands of Czechoslovaks watched 
from a closed-off plaza and applauded as the East Germans, in groups of about 
60, moved along the street to board the buses. 
</P>
<P>
At the railroad station, the mood, after days of tension, was jubilant. As West 
German Ambassador Hermann Huber looked on, the travelers trooped into the train 
carrying babies and backpacks, flung down the compartment windows and marveled 
at their good luck. 
</P>
<P>
"We are totally happy," said Christiane Busching, a 19-year-old from Dessau. 
</P>
<P>
"I got here only yesterday," said Dianna Krause, 21, from Furstenwalde. "We 
were very lucky. We got here just before they closed the border." 
</P>
<P>
Few observers here believe that the move by the East Germans to restrict travel 
-- to require exit visas for travel to Czechoslovakia -- will do more than slow 
the exodus. They point out that much of the border, about 150 miles of it, is 
unguarded, and that many will attempt to cross through the forests to get to 
Czechoslovakia, where officials at the West German Embassy in Prague have said 
they will be willing to take them in. 
</P>
<P>
The refugee problem has highlighted the growing isolation of the hard-line 
states on the western edge of the Soviet Bloc, which are now forced to deal 
with the fallout from reforms being made in Hungary and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
It has also brought intense embarrassment to the regime of 77-year-old Erich 
Honecker in East Berlin, whose government this weekend will observe the 40th 
anniversary of the founding of the East German state. Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev is scheduled to be on hand for the anniversary, and the sudden 
exodus -- and growing restiveness -- of the East German population will almost 
certainly be a topic of his discussions with the ailing Honecker.

JURY VOTES DEATH FOR NIGHT STALKER RAMIREZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four days of deliberations, jurors recommended on Wednesday that Texas 
drifter Richard Ramirez be sentenced to death for the Night Stalker murders, a 
rampage of savage, Satanic-tinged slayings that haunted Southern California in 
the summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We the jury . . . fix the penalty therefor at death," Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Michael A. Tynan read aloud 19 times, the number of special 
circumstances attached to felony convictions that included multiple murders, 
burglary and sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators gasped as the first death penalty was recommended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Alternatives Available 
</P>
<P>
The solemn-faced jury was the same panel that last month found Ramirez guilty 
of 13 murders and 30 other felonies. The only alternatives available to the 
panel were death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Deliberations had begun after both prosecution and defense declined to present 
witnesses in the so-called penalty phase of the trial. Ramirez's lawyers had 
pleaded with the jurors to "show mercy," while prosecutors argued that the 
Night Stalker should be given his "just deserts." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a self-proclaimed devil worshiper, was clad in black from head to toe 
as he entered court to hear the sentence recommendation. He rattled his waist 
chains, turned several times to stare at the crammed courtroom and began 
rocking back and forth in his chair as Tynan repeated "death" again and again. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, as three bailiffs escorted him from the courtroom, he managed a 
slight smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, big deal. Death always went with the territory," the 29-year-old El Paso, 
Tex., native said in a husky voice as he left the downtown criminal courts 
building in a sheriff's van. "I'll see you in Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
One woman among the group of about 30 people who gathered to watch him depart, 
said: "He just blew us a kiss and smiled. It was funny, he didn't look nervous. 
Maybe he just accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
Formal sentencing was set for Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Tynan could reduce the sentence to life without possibility of parole, but is 
unlikely to do so given the jury's vote for death on all counts. Death 
sentences automatically are appealed to the state Supreme Court, and the 
appeals can be advanced to the U.S. Supreme Court, resulting in years of 
delays. No one has been executed in California for 22 years. There are 262 
inmates on Death Row in San Quentin, where the state gas chamber is located. 
Eighty-five of the Death Row inmates were convicted in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Courtroom spectators included sheriff's deputy Andy Ramirez (no relation), who 
first handcuffed Ramirez four years ago after he was captured by East Los 
Angeles residents, and several survivors of his victims. 
</P>
<P>
Tears streamed down the cheeks of Judith Arnold and Ellen Francis, daughters of 
Glendale murder victims Maxon and Lela Kneiding. When her parents' names were 
read, Arnold placed her hand over her face and her shoulders heaved as she 
fought back sobs. 
</P>
<P>
"The punishment fits the crime," she said later. "It's been a long, hard road." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors P. Philip Halpin and Alan S. Yochelson both sighed with relief that 
the long trial was over. 
</P>
<P>
"These things (trials) are not contests," Halpin said. "It has not been fun." 
</P>
<P>
He said he regretted not having gained more insight about Ramirez -- "a twisted 
man but an intelligent fellow" -- from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragedy not to see how this all happened," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Daniel Hernandez said that "society should be saddened and 
sympathetic for anyone who is sent to death," adding that that the question of 
whether Ramirez got a fair trial will be dealt with on appeal, which will 
likely be filed by a lawyer from the state public defender's office or the 
California Appellate Project. 
</P>
<P>
Co-counsel Ray G. Clark, who joined the defense team well into the trial, said 
that while homicide is a serious crime, "I could not condone taking even 
Hitler's life." He said he doesn't know whether Ramirez is guilty or not: "I 
never asked." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors who spoke after the verdict expressed relief that their intense, 
eight-month involvement in the case was over. Some said they had suffered 
nightmares and spent sleepless nights over their impending decision. 
</P>
<P>
They met briefly with Tynan after delivering the verdict. The judge thanked 
them for their work and presented them with a short letter. It praised their 
"extraordinary courage" and wished them "the best of everything that this life 
can bring to you and your families." 
</P>
<P>
Then they walked into a swarm of glaring television lights that packed the 
hallway, some quickly heading for the elevator and a prearranged party at the 
home of juror Shirley Zelaya, a postal employee. The jury had been banned from 
making comments to the press until after the penalty phase of the trial was 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Felipe G. Rodriguez of El Monte, a 30-year-old city street-light 
installer who said he put bolts on his doors and windows while Ramirez was on 
the loose, said he had few qualms after finding Ramirez guilty or recommending 
death -- although he would have liked to have heard from Ramirez himself on the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I fulfilled my responsibility to society after his reign of terror," he 
said. "It's a just punishment. . . . As for sending a man to his death, that's 
a spiritual thing I have to work out between God and myself. I feel he's a 
human being that may have gotten sidetracked through his growing years and all 
I can say now is that he kind of wrote his own story." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the jury took 22 days to reach its guilty verdict and four days 
to reach a penalty verdict only because the panel thoroughly examined each 
count. He said after some discussion, members took a secret ballot and were 
generally unanimous about his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The clincher in the case against Ramirez, if there was one, was the discovery 
at a burglary of both an Avia shoe print that had been picked up at six other 
Stalker crime scenes and Ramirez's palm print, Rodriguez said. These were 
detected at a Monrovia burglary and represented the only time both the shoe and 
a Ramirez print were found together. Ironically, he was not charged in the 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the penalty phase, he said the jury was split at first, with 10 
favoring a death sentence and two opposed. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who sympathized with Ramirez was juror Cynthia E. Haden of 
Glendale, a bank administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for me to give him the death penalty," she said. "I don't want to 
be responsible for someone's murder. That's basically what it is." 
</P>
<P>
She said she felt sorry for the serial killer, referring to him as "Rick." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's looked at as a human being, but as a monster," Haden said. 
"I wouldn't call him a monster." 
</P>
<P>
Her feelings, however, did not in the end persuade her that Ramirez's life 
should be spared. She explained: "I think he's sane. He understands what he's 
done. . . . He'll finally be doing something right -- atoning for all the 
deaths that he's caused." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Alfredo Carillo, a tax collector for the state Board of Equalization, 
estimated that the panel took nearly 100 secret ballots on the 19 counts 
involving special circumstances that would open the possibility of a death 
sentence. The voting went quickly on the more gruesome cases, in which victims 
had been mutilated in various ways. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, jurors said that the brutal nature of the attacks helped dictate their 
decision. Testimony in the trial described horrific murders in which eyes were 
gouged out, throats slashed and Satanic markings left behind as taunting clues. 
</P>
<P>
For juror Arthur V. Johnson, a mail carrier, the decision to condemn Ramirez to 
death was not difficult: "There were some doubts, but the murders were just too 
bizarre. We looked for some sign of mercy, but there was none. . . . How could 
someone commit crimes like that . . . maybe Satan will give him his reward in 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Ashley Dunn, Charisse Jones, John H. Lee and Carol McGraw 
also contributed to the coverage of the sentencing of Richard Ramirez.

NORIEGA NOT IN HIS OFFICE, COUP PLOTTERS DISCOVERED

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebellious officers mistakenly believed that Gen. Manuel A. Noriega was inside 
his downtown headquarters when they seized the compound in a failed plot to 
kidnap the Panamanian dictator, informed American and European officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, who reconstructed Tuesday's coup attempt, said that the rebels 
were backed by no more than 200 soldiers and did not expect to spark a massive 
military uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the sources said, the rebels' strategy was to hold their commander in 
chief hostage, negotiating for his removal and the retirement of the Panama 
Defense Forces' general staff. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt, which began with gunfire at 7 a.m., failed when the rebels 
discovered that Noriega was not in the four-story compound, the sources said. 
After five hours of heavy fighting, the rebels surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
"The key flaw in their plot was that they had expected Noriega to be in the 
headquarters," a U.S. official said. "The idea was to hold him hostage. When he 
wasn't there, they didn't stand a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, contradicted a U.S. 
intelligence report Tuesday that Noriega was in the compound at the time of the 
uprising. Some members of Congress, given that report by the CIA, reacted with 
outrage that U.S. troops stationed nearby to guard the Panama Canal did not 
intervene to arrest the general. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 1,500 cheering Noriega supporters surrounded the battered 
military headquarters, throwing kisses and salutes to officers. Periodically, 
Noriega appeared in fatigues at a second-story window and raised a clenched 
fist in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"The people love Noriega because he's the only one who's ever done anything for 
us," Rufina Castillo, 59, shouted over the music of a brass band. "Because of 
him we have housing." 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers puttied and painted over craters in the facade of the headquarters 
building and carried bags of cement and cinder blocks inside the compound to 
repair damage from Tuesday's battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is stepping all over us," said Virginia Saenz, 53. "We 
believe the (rebel soldiers) were paid a lot of money. They sold out."

The Panamanian government charged again Wednesday that the Bush Administration, 
which openly seeks the general's ouster, masterminded the revolt. "Failed Coup 
Was Coordinated With U.S. Southern Command," declared a red banner headline in 
the pro-government newspaper Critica. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of U.S. involvement, Noriega's provisional president, Francisco 
Rodriguez, told the United Nations on Wednesday that his government has 
photographs showing U.S. troops and military vehicles blocking access to the 
headquarters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Panamanian military source said U.S. roadblocks were in place three hours 
before the first shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said some roads may have been blocked by U.S. 
tanks trying to seal off and protect American bases 600 yards away after the 
trouble started. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops on Alert 
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 U.S. troops stationed at the Southern Command's bases at Quarry 
Heights and Ft. Amador on the western edge of Panama City remained on alert 
Wednesday. Movements of U.S. personnel were restricted. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government kept an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew in force. 
</P>
<P>
The coup attempt, the second against Noriega in 19 months, was led by four 
mid-level officers and troops from the Urraca Company, which was assigned to 
protect the 51-year-old Noriega's headquarters. Officials and witnesses gave 
this account: 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m., the first gunshots rang through the poor El Chorillo neighborhood, 
where the headquarters is located. Hundreds of residents fled with their 
belongings and, in some cases, their pets, as police moved in with water cannon 
and armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
By 7:20 a.m., the U.S. Southern Command had put its troops on highest alert. 
Gunfire continued in the streets, nicking buildings and shattering the windows 
of parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops in combat gear took up positions around their bases. U.S. 
helicopter gunships and Blackhawk troop carriers flew over the Bridge of the 
Americas, which crosses the Panama Canal west of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troops loyal to Noriega moved in. The elite Battalion 2000, named 
for the year Panama is to take full control of the canal, made its way from Ft. 
Cimarron, 25 miles east of the city; the Machos de Monte unit came from Rio 
Hato, 55 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:30 a.m., rebels issued a communique, signed first by Maj. Moises Giroldi 
Vega, commander of the Urraca Company. Read in a radio broadcast, the 
communique said that Noriega and six of his top colonels had been "retired." 
The mutineers called on other units to join them and promised to hold elections 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrations in Streets 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of opposition supporters took to the streets to celebrate, but within 
half an hour, forces loyal to Noriega called a local television station to say 
they were fighting back. The loyalists surrounded the compound and bombarded it 
with grenades and rocket fire. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m., Noriega loyalists had regained control, although sporadic gunfire 
continued for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
In reconstructing the events, several sources speculated that Noriega's men had 
anticipated the plot and tricked security guards at the headquarters into 
believing that the general was there. Noriega seldom uses his downtown office, 
spending most of his workday at Ft. Amador, an installation shared by U.S. and 
Panamanian army units. 
</P>
<P>
None of the sources could say where Noriega was during the revolt. He was not 
seen in public until he appeared on television at 4 p.m., denouncing the coup 
as part of the United States' "permanent aggression" against Panama. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source familiar with Tuesday's events refused to say whether the United 
States had provided the rebels with intelligence on Noriega's supposed 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that U.S. 
officials learned of the plot last weekend, but he denied there had been any 
U.S. military support. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. source denied that any deals were made with the rebel officers, but he 
said the rebels were told that the Bush Administration would like custody of 
Noriega if he were apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
According to a senior U.S. official in Washington, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney briefed lawmakers Wednesday night, telling them of a discussion between 
an officer of the U.S. Southern Command and two of the leaders of the attempted 
coup. The American officers offered to "relieve them of Noriega, take him off 
their hands," said a defense official, recounting Cheney's report. The 
Panamanian officers declined the offer, saying they did not wish to extradite 
Noriega but wanted to permit him to retire within the country. 
</P>
<P>
The official said Cheney and other Pentagon officials assumed that the officers 
were holding Noriega, but added, "We never knew for certain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanctuary to Plotters? 
</P>
<P>
The Panama Defense Forces said further proof of U.S. involvement was a report 
that two of the plotters took refuge at Ft. Clayton, a U.S. military base in 
the Panama Canal Zone. The two were not identified. U.S. officials refused to 
confirm or deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian newspapers said six people were killed in the coup attempt, 
including Maj. Giroldi. The report has not been confirmed by official sources. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez said several people had 
been wounded but none killed. He said that at least 60 soldiers and four 
officers were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian officials have said there was no civilian involvement in the 
uprising. But opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said Raul Ossa, a vice 
president of the Christian Democratic Party, was arrested following the revolt, 
for reasons unclear to Arias. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush first called for Noriega's overthrow last May after the general 
nullified an election that international observers said his handpicked 
candidate had lost. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, a favorite in Washington when he became commander in 1983, has been 
the object of official U.S. enmity since February, 1988, when federal grand 
juries in Florida indicted him on racketeering and cocaine conspiracy charges 
for allegedly turning Panama into a safe haven for Colombian drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
The dictator has accused the United States of seeking his removal in order to 
nullify the 1977 treaties and retain control over the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Denounced 
</P>
<P>
Outside his bullet-pocked headquarters Wednesday, Noriega declared to his 
supporters, "The U.S. imperialists are like piranha fish and want to gobble up 
the Panama Canal." 
</P>
<P>
After surviving a coup attempt in March, 1988, Noriega purged his high command 
of potentially disloyal officers. He created the Strategic Military Council, a 
parallel command of loyal captains and majors. 
</P>
<P>
A military source said that Maj. Giroldi had actively opposed the 1988 coup 
attempt and, as a result, was promoted from captain to major, but he was not 
given a seat on the new council. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the great majority of the 14,000-member Defense Forces 
ignored Giroldi's plea for support in Tuesday's uprising. The cavalry 
headquarters in Panama City's old colonial section was apparently the only 
other installation involved in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
None of the rebel leaders belonged to the high command or the Strategic 
Military Council. 
</P>
<P>
So far, divisions in the armed forces do not appear to go beyond the 
approximately 200 soldiers said to have taken part in the revolt. But while 
Noriega quickly put down the uprising and has demonstrated his military 
support, diplomats say the revolt is bound to damage him. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot say after a coup attempt that Noriega is stronger," said a European 
diplomat. "If you have one, two, three attempts, statistically one day the man 
is going to fall. But because of this (failure), I would say nothing else is 
going to happen for at least another year." 
</P>
<P>
Added another diplomat: "Noriega looks stronger now, but he could be like the 
ill patient in remission."

COLOMBIA FIRES 2,075 POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombia's national police announced that 2,075 officers have been fired, many 
for having links to drug traffickers. The firings came under an anti-corruption 
drive begun last February by Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national police 
chief. Gomez Padilla took over the top job in the 80,000-member force from a 
general who was forced out because of connections with drug traffickers. 
Meanwhile, Roman Catholic bishops issued a statement calling the murder of 
Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, reportedly kidnaped by leftist rebels, "vile, 
sacrilegious and pitiless." His death was apparently not connected to the drug 
war.

A shoot-out in an El Toro jewelry store left the owner wounded as four bandits 
escaped in the latest in a series of "smash-and-grab" robberies in the 
Southland. Bob Gossett, the owner of Gossett Jewelers, was shot once in the 
shoulder after three men and a woman -- armed with a handgun, hammers, tire 
irons and crowbars -- entered his store, Orange County sheriff's officials 
said. "They started to smash the (display) cases, and the owner came out with a 
handgun," Lt. Richard J. Olson said. "A gunfight ensued, and the owner got hit 
and went down." It appeared that none of the robbers were injured.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals refused to block the extradition of a 
juvenile facing a possible death sentence in Alabama in connection with a 1988 
firebombing that killed a 14-month-old boy. A three-judge panel of the court 
ruled that the district must honor an interstate agreement governing the 
extradition of juveniles, despite the district's own ban against capital 
punishment. The youth, identified only by the initials O.M., has been held by 
district authorities since last December, when he was arrested in connection 
with a warrant issued by Gadsden, Ala., authorities.

Canada will cut its leading passenger train service in half next year as a 
money-saving measure, officials said. The announcement by Transport Minister 
Benoit Bouchard upset opposition lawmakers, who said it means the death of the 
government-run service known as Via Rail. Bouchard said the cuts will allow the 
government to reduce its annual Via Rail subsidies, now at $640 million, to 
$350 million by 1993. Via Rail said that of a total of about 7,300 employees, 
2,761 will lose their jobs, mainly in 1990. The cuts will leave Via Rail 
operating three weekly trains linking central Canada with the East and West 
coasts, a major chunk of its existing Quebec-Ontario corridor trains, a couple 
of regional routes and eight remote services.

Israeli troops fired on masked Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, killing two and 
wounding others, the army announced. Arab reporters said some soldiers were 
disguised as laborers and drove a private car. The army spokesman's office said 
the soldiers were in uniform. The killings raised to 583 the number of 
Palestinians killed by Israelis since the uprising began in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip 21 months ago. In addition, 40 Israelis have died. 
Meanwhile, three Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel were 
reported killed by fellow Arabs.

The House voted to spend an additional $9 million to help the opposition in 
next year's Nicaraguan elections after the Bush Administration promised not to 
use the CIA to influence the outcome. The House action, on a vote of 263-156, 
sent the measure to the Senate, where it could come up this week. Nicaragua's 
Sandinista government and its president, Daniel Ortega, "have all the resources 
of the state at their disposal," said Rep. Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.). Yet the 
coalition opposing the Sandinistas operates out of a shabby office with almost 
no equipment and doesn't even have a fully working telephone, proponents of the 
aid package argued.

A bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee would give more than 100 years 
of amnesty to fraternal groups, taverns and convenience stores for past-due 
levies under a little-known tax on liquor retailers. Protests over the tax had 
mounted after a Pennsylvania Elks lodge got a $9,000 bill for 50 years of 
non-payment. The measure would prohibit the federal government from collecting 
unpaid balances and penalties on the 123-year-old tax if they accrued before 
Jan. 1, 1985, according to Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.). Although the tax has been 
on the books since 1866, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says that 
up to 40% of retailers had never heard of it until the agency began a vigorous 
collection effort last year.

COMPARABLE WORTH LAWSUIT AGAINST STATE DEALT SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Wednesday dismissed the heart of the nation's largest 
comparable worth lawsuit, setting back a union's claim that California 
deliberately underpaid thousands of women in female-dominated state jobs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel -- who once served as legal counsel for 
the National Organization for Women -- ruled in San Francisco that the 
California State Employees' Assn. had failed to prove deliberate sex 
discrimination in state salaries. 
</P>
<P>
She allowed the association to submit new arguments on a claim that state 
policies had the effect of illegally holding down the salaries of female state 
employees. But Ellen Eggers, staff attorney for the CSEA, said the association 
was undecided about whether to pursue the lawsuit in light of Wednesday's 
ruling because, without proof of intent, such suits have been made much more 
difficult to prove by a recent Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Significant' 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased," said Christopher Waddell, chief counsel for the 
California Department of Personnel Administration. Although the case is only 
partially resolved, Waddell called Wednesday's ruling "very significant." 
</P>
<P>
Filed in 1984, the lawsuit is the nation's largest case brought under Title 7 
of the Civil Rights Acts. More than 60,000 current and former secretaries, 
clerks and other workers in mostly female state jobs stood to share in back 
pay, interest and wage increases that could have cost California taxpayers as 
much as $1 billion, according to calculations made by the state employees' 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Although the association attempted to paint its case as a sex discrimination 
suit, it had been generally referred to as a comparable worth action because it 
is based on pay disparities between different types of jobs, rather than a 
claim that women were paid less than men in the same job. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ruling shocked labor and women's rights groups who had been hopeful 
for a more positive outcome in the hands of Patel, who was appointed to the 
bench in 1980 by then-President Jimmy Carter after her stint as legal counsel 
for NOW. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision means you have to virtually find the smoking gun that shows 
(discriminatory) intent," said Martin Morgenstern, a former state personnel 
director who is chairman of the center for labor research and education at UC 
Berkeley. "I think this decision is a significant setback." 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed," said Gail Kaufman, associate director of Equal 
Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based public interest law firm. "The stakes 
were very high in this case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Difficult Case to Prove' 
</P>
<P>
"In the political climate that we are dealing with right now I don't think 
Judge Patel was willing to go out on a limb in any way," said CSEA's Eggers. 
"But in fairness to the judge, it was a very, very difficult case to prove 
because there were no live witnesses from the 1930s." 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in Wednesday's ruling was whether the state has deliberately 
discriminated against women since the 1930s, when state pay scales were 
revised. The association, relying on documents issued by state officials in the 
1930s, contended that the effects of unequal pay levels for men and women in 
those revisions persists. 
</P>
<P>
The state denied bias and said any differences in pay levels reflected rates 
being charged by other employers. Lower pay for female-dominated jobs based on 
prevailing market levels was declared legal in 1985 by the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
But Patel ruled that documents from a 1931 salary revision, containing staff 
comments suggesting lower pay for some female-dominated jobs, failed to prove 
deliberate discrimination, and that the effects of any bias were mostly 
eliminated in a state reclassification in 1937-38.

GENETIC EVIDENCE BOLSTERS AFRICAN ORIGINS THEORY 
</P>

New genetic evidence has strengthened the claim that all humans alive today are 
descended from a single African woman and suggests that the woman lived 140,000 
years ago, not 200,000 as was previously believed, a UC Berkeley researcher 
said here Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Descendants of that woman, whom scientist have dubbed "Eve," started migrating 
north out of Africa 75,000 years ago and had fully settled in southern Europe 
35,000 years ago, displacing the indigenous Neanderthal population, said 
molecular biologist Allan C. Wilson. The Neanderthals were dispossessed because 
they were genetically incompatible with the humans of African origin, Wilson 
said at an international genetics conference. 
</P>
<P>
The new evidence also indicates that early males may have roamed rather freely 
throughout Africa nearly 100,000 years ago while females stayed firmly rooted, 
suggesting that sharp changes in cultural interaction of men and women occurred 
over a period of about 30,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis of Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
Wilson reached his conclusions by studying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the 
genetic blueprint of humans) found not in the nucleus of cells, where most 
genes are stored, but in mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell that are 
the source of the cell's energy. Mitochondria have only 37 genes, compared to 
the estimated 100,000 found in the cell's nucleus, making them much easier to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike genes in the nucleus, which are inherited from both parents, genes in 
mitochondria are passed down only from mothers. Because of this, researchers 
can trace maternal lineages unaffected by contributions from males. 
</P>
<P>
Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are believed to occur at a constant rate over 
long periods of time. By studying the differences between mitochondrial DNA 
from two women, for example, researchers can determine how long ago they shared 
a common female ancestor. When many women are used, the technique also reveals 
where that ancestor lived. 
</P>
<P>
Using mitochondrial DNA from placentas, Wilson and his colleagues reported in 
1987 that all modern humans are descended from a woman who lived in southern 
Africa about 200,000 years ago, a woman who has subsequently become known as 
Eve or "the mother of us all." That finding does not mean that only one woman 
was alive then. Rather, it means that the lineages that descended from all 
other women eventually died out -- a phenomenon that is common in biology. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing every possible pairing among the 147 people tested in the study, 
the researchers concluded that Eve could only have lived in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Although other researchers generally accept Wilson's methodology, they 
criticized two aspects of his studies: the fact that he used black Americans in 
his study as a surrogate for Africans, and the speed of his so-called 
"molecular clock." The molecular clock is a measure of the rate at which 
mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, and critics charged that Wilson's was too 
fast, placing Eve too near us in time. 
</P>
<P>
In his current study, Wilson used newly developed biochemical techniques that 
allowed him to study the mitochondrial DNA contained in a sample as small as a 
single hair. Because he could use hairs, he was able to obtain specimens from 
two hunter-gatherer tribes in central Africa and from the !Kung bushmen of 
southern Africa, who would not have donated placentas for such a study. (The 
spelling of !Kung denotes a clicking sound in the pronunciation of the K.) 
</P>
<P>
He was also able to perform similar studies on chimpanzees, which helped him 
achieve a finer calibration of his molecular clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to refute both criticisms," Wilson told a meeting of 
geneticists. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the new data, he said, Eve lived in southern Africa 142,000 years ago. 
"We are all a derivative of one of the !Kung lineages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The data further show that humans -- men and women together -- began migrating 
out of Africa into the Middle East about 75,000 years ago. By 35,000 years ago, 
they were firmly established in southern Europe, displacing the Neanderthals 
who had lived there. 
</P>
<P>
That agrees with archeological data, thereby confirming the accuracy of his 
molecular clock. The fact that Neanderthal women made no contribution to the 
gene pool indicates, he said, that a fundamental genetic incompatibility 
existed between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Although men and women began migrating out of Africa 75,000 years ago, men must 
have begun moving around and exploring the continent much earlier, he said. 
Evidence for this was provided by the genes of the three groups of African 
women. 
</P>
<P>
In those stages men did all the exploring and left women to tend to the home, 
whereas later the family group was clearly more important and migrated as a 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson found virtually no overlap in the mitochondrial DNA from the three 
groups, indicating that the females had stayed put for periods long enough for 
gene differences to develop -- many tens of thousands of years. To his 
surprise, however, Wilson found an almost complete overlap in key nuclear 
genes, which are inherited from both parents. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that during most of the time in Africa, our female ancestors moved 
very little, while the males apparently migrated quite a lot," he said.

BOMBER'S BALKY WHEEL FORCES DUSTY DESCENT

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A B-1B bomber made a dusty but safe emergency landing here on partly retracted 
landing gear Wednesday evening after the flight crew had struggled 
unsuccessfully for more than six hours to lower the plane's nose wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said the bomber flew more than 1,000 miles to this Kern County 
base from Texas after the problem was discovered on a training flight. It made 
several preliminary low-level passes, including a brief "touch-and-go," before 
making its final approach at about 6:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The big plane settled onto the long dirt runway on its two main landing gear, 
which were locked properly into position. The pilots stayed off the brakes to 
keep the nose up, and the plane rolled down the landing strip for almost three 
miles before nosing down gently on the retracted front gear and sliding to a 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a great day for flying, except for a few glitches," one of the 
pilots said seconds before the plane came to a halt and the dust cloud began to 
settle. The radioed remarks from the cockpit were monitored by a local aviation 
buff. 
</P>
<P>
The supersonic bomber apparently suffered only "minimal" damage and no one on 
the crew was injured, officials said. Aboard were Capt. Jeffrey K. Beene, 30, 
the aircraft commander; Capt. Vernon B. Benton, 30, pilot; Capt. Robert H. 
Hendricks, 31, weapons officer, and Lt. Col. Joseph G. Day, 39, an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"They all look fine," Air Force Lt. Col. Jan Dalby, chief of public affairs at 
Edwards, said later. "They're glad to be down. They were up there over 12 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the B-1B was not armed with any of the nuclear bombs it is 
designed to carry. 
</P>
<P>
They said the crew had some hydraulic problems during their three-hour training 
flight, and as they were coming in for a landing at Dyess Air Force Base, near 
Abilene, Tex., the front landing gear, which is operated hydraulically, failed 
to lower. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was refueled twice by an airborne tanker as it circled for another 
four hours while experts discussed how to solve the problem. The bomber then 
made the three-hour flight to Edwards, circling over the base for another two 
hours before the landing was made. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said it was decided to land the plane on Rogers Dry Lake at 
Edwards -- the site of most of the Space Shuttle landings -- because the 
smooth, six-mile, unpaved runway there is one of the safest spots to attempt an 
emergency touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
They said the unpaved surface minimizes sparks that could touch off a fire, the 
length of the runway reduces the need for emergency braking, and Edwards is 
equipped with some of the best-trained emergency fire crews in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The B-1B -- 147 feet long, with a wingspan of 137 feet and a laden weight of up 
to 477,000 pounds -- was the centerpiece of the Reagan Administration's 
$260-billion effort to modernize the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
The swing-wing bomber was designed to fill the gap between the aging B-52 fleet 
and the new B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, the Air Force temporarily grounded all 97 of the $285-million B-1Bs 
because of problems with one of the movable wings on one of the planes at 
Dyess. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the grounding was ordered after a pilot found in a preflight 
check that he was unable to synchronize the movement back and forth of the 
plane's adjustable wings. The officials later said the problem apparently was 
confined to the individual plane. 
</P>
<P>
There have been four crashes involving B-1 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
The first, which killed veteran Rockwell International test pilot T. D. (Doug) 
Benefield and injured two other members of the flight crew, involved a 
prototype on an Edwards-based, low-altitude test flight over the Mojave Desert 
on Aug. 29, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force investigative panel concluded that "human error" -- failure by the 
cockpit crew to properly redistribute the fuel load -- caused the plane to 
stall, veer out of control and plummet earthward. The crew ejected, suffering 
their injuries when a malfunction of the ejection mechanism caused the escape 
capsule to land at the wrong angle. 
</P>
<P>
The second crash, and the first involving a production model B-1B, occurred 
Sept. 28, 1987, when a Dyess-based plane collided with a large bird -- probably 
a pelican -- on a test flight over southeastern Colorado. The "extremely rare" 
collision with the bird at 600 m.p.h. caused a fire that doomed the plane, Air 
Force investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Three crew members ejected safely before that crash but another died because 
his ejection seat malfunctioned. Two others were killed because they were 
sitting in jump seats that had no ejection devices, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The third crash, on Nov. 8, 1988, occurred when a B-1B suffered an engine fire 
and slammed into a cow pasture shortly after takeoff from Dyess. All four crew 
members ejected safely. 
</P>
<P>
Nine days later, on Nov. 17, 1988, a B-1B clipped a power line on final 
approach to Ellsworth Air Force Base, near Rapid City, S.D., and fell into a 
field short of the runway. The four crewmen escaped with minor injuries.

SOVIET BRASS SMILE ON U.S. WEAPONRY

Breaking another Cold War barrier, the Americans opened the gates of two 
military installations in California on Wednesday to the Soviet Union's top 
military official, a jovial man who chatted with Marines, joked with generals 
and admiringly watched the firepower paraded before him. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on a good will tour," Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov said, beaming. "We 
have come to show the American people that we have sincere and friendly 
feelings toward the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
High-ranking U.S. and Soviet officials heralded Yazov's visit, the first to the 
West Coast by such a high-ranking Soviet, touting it as glasnost trickling down 
to each nation's stronghold, the military forces. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov viewed North Island Naval Air Station on San Diego Bay, where he shook 
hands with F-14 Tomcat jet fighter crewmen. The cordial and grandfatherly Yazov 
and his entourage then traveled to the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, 
where a drama of simulated fighting unfolded on the shores of Red Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Yazov had taken his seat on a bluff overlooking the dunes, rubber 
boats and amphibious assault craft zipped through the water, depositing men on 
shore. Marines stormed the beach, and planes roared overhead, dropping 
simulated bombs. The ground shook, officials covered their ears, and the 
Marines surged forward, each toting about 70 pounds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
A watchful Soviet Adm. Vladimir Z. Khuzhokov, a member of Yazov's entourage, 
said, "It's good. Your boys are just like our boys. Just the same boys." 
</P>
<P>
Dust swirled, engines roared and yellow smoke bombs clouded the simulated 
combat area. An announcer, first in English and then in Russian, told the 
assembled dignitaries about the attributes of each craft. 
</P>
<P>
And as the announcer described the capabilities of the CH-46 Sea Knight 
transport helicopter, one Marine pilot watching the ceremonies groaned. "Oh, 
no, don't tell the Russians about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here come the Russians. I've been trained to hate Russians," said Rear Adm. 
John W. Adams. "It's kind of odd. Now, I'm welcoming them. It's an initiative 
that can do nothing but help the entire world. Ultimately, if it's successful, 
it would cost me my job -- I think that would be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Marines seemed pleased with the pat on the shoulder that Yazov gave 
as he walked down the line chatting with the men who had stormed the beach. 
Others showed off the Soviet enamel pin he placed in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he hoped we are the best for our service, like his men are for his," 
said Cpl. Robert Denully of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Showing the equipment to the Soviet group violated no security restrictions. 
And officials and experts agreed that it was probably all hardware that the 
Soviet military already knew about. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly both sides know everything there is without visiting the sites," 
said Leon Aron, an expert on Soviet affairs with the Heritage Foundation in 
Washington. "But this is public diplomacy. We'll see more of these visits." 
</P>
<P>
Yazov, who joined the Soviet Army in 1941, was appointed defense minister in 
June, 1987. He replaced 75-year-old Marshal Sergei L. Sokolov, who was fired 
after a West German teen-ager flew a single-engine Cessna from Finland more 
than 400 miles over Soviet territory and landed in Moscow's Red Square, next to 
the Kremlin.

SOVIETS FREE THE DREADED PHOTOCOPIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years into the era of xerography, the Soviet Union is getting ready to 
move its photocopiers from their guarded, double-locked, steel-covered doors as 
the country tries to catch up with the worldwide explosion of information. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Ministry of Interior Affairs announced Wednesday that it wants to 
"relinquish control over the acquisition, storage and operation of copying 
equipment," admitting that photocopiers are now standard office equipment and 
not really the grave threat to state security they were once perceived to be. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Second Department of the Main Directorate of Protecting Public 
Order acknowledged that the recent spread to more than 60,000 different Soviet 
organizations of kseroks machines, as all photocopiers are called in Russian, 
had made its task of supervising their operation virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In what will be a major step toward implementing President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's policy of free-flowing information under glasnost, or political 
openness, the ministry is drafting regulations permitting government offices, 
scientific institutions, enterprises and other organizations to assume 
responsibility for their own photocopiers. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate impact will probably be the importation of thousands more copiers 
-- as soon as the foreign exchange can be found to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from the Interior Ministry will no longer be checking each machine 
to ensure that it is locked in secure quarters, that complete registers are 
kept of the documents copied and that the numbers of copies correspond to the 
tamper-proof counters required on each machine. 
</P>
<P>
The truly conscientious inspectors had also checked the desks of the operators 
for unauthorized materials and seized such contraband as horoscopes and sex 
manuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Semi-Criminal Operation' 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens -- engineers, 
students, scientists, even grandmothers with medical records -- need documents 
copied every day, the government newspaper Izvestia observed Wednesday that 
those people have faced either very long lines, as they and their papers were 
scrutinized at authorized photocopier offices, or "a semi-criminal operation" 
to get papers copied quickly in violation of government controls. 
</P>
<P>
Under the elaborate "instructions on procedures of printing nonclassified 
documentation," adopted in 1974 to prevent dissidents from photocopying their 
political tracts, then known as samizdat, or "self-published" materials, 
getting anything copied was never quick and never anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The official reasons for all these controls -- to prevent the copying of 
confidential documents in a state obsessed with secrecy and to thwart 
counterfeiters -- were valid, Izvestia said, noting as well that "the primary 
goal was to prevent the proliferation of undesirable texts" in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"From the first days of Soviet power," the paper added, "even typewriters were 
put under tight supervision, and that incidentally was abolished only 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
V. Vashenko, the chief of the Second Department of the Main Directorate of 
Protecting Public Order, told Izvestia that, in fact, new technology has 
overtaken the controls on photocopiers. 
</P>
<P>
With computers, optical scanners, laser printers and other equipment for 
desk-top publishing able "to produce a whole newspaper" and not subject to the 
same strict controls as photocopiers, the regulations governing copiers have 
become pointless. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply impossible to control this process now," Vashenko told Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
Once so rare that access was limited to top government and Communist Party 
officials, scientists at the most prestigious research institutes and the KGB, 
the state security agency, photocopiers have proliferated to the extent that 
political activists of almost every kind have easy access to them.

JEWISH LEADER'S KILLING COULD BE POLITICAL

Belgian police were investigating the possibility Wednesday that a prominent 
Jewish leader, active in the recent controversy over the Carmelite convent at 
the old Auschwitz death camp in Poland, was shot to death by a political 
assassin. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Wybran, 48, secular leader of Belgian Jews and an internationally 
recognized immunologist, was shot Tuesday night in the parking lot of a 
suburban hospital where he worked. He died Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Wybran recently took part in demonstrations outside the Vatican's diplomatic 
offices in Brussels, protesting against the continued presence of the convent 
at Auschwitz, the Nazi German camp where about 4 million people, including more 
than 2.5 million Jews, were put to death during World War II. He also led a 
Belgian delegation to Poland to meet with Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Polish 
primate. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the nature of Dr. Wybran's activities," Belgian police authorities said 
in a statement Wednesday afternoon, "a political assassination, or at least one 
springing from an ideological or philosophical opposition, cannot be excluded." 
</P>
<P>
The police said there are no witnesses to the shooting, which occurred between 
6:30 and 7 p.m. Tuesday as Wybran was getting into his car in the parking lot 
of Erasmus Hospital, just outside Brussels. He was shot once in the head at 
close range with a 7.65-millimeter pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The police statement said, "Everything leads one to the conclusion that one or 
more of the killers were lying in wait for the victim." 
</P>
<P>
Wybran's killing shocked the Belgian Jewish community of 30,000. He was 
chairman of the Coordination Committee of Jewish Organizations, the umbrella 
group for 30 Jewish organizations in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
"Professor Wybran was a world-known physician in immunology," said a friend, 
Maurice Konopnicki, director of the Israel Information Center in Brussels. "He 
was . . . not an extremist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Cancer Research 
</P>
<P>
Wybran was chief of the immunology, hematology and transfusion division of 
Erasmus Hospital. He was active in cancer research and in efforts to find a 
cure for AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He was also a professor 
of medicine at the University of Brussels. He was married but had no children. 
</P>
<P>
Konopnicki blamed the killing on "some extreme-right organization who would 
exploit this conflict for their own purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Shimon Samuels, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's European office in 
Paris, noted that the killing comes at a time of "rising right-wing prejudice, 
particularly in Belgium." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador to Belgium, Avi Primor, speculated that the killer or 
killers may have come from the country's small but active neo-Nazi fringe. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of reason to be angry with Prof. Wybran," Primor told the 
Associated Press. "He was one of the initiators to remove the Carmelite 
monastery from Auschwitz." 
</P>
<P>
The movement to remove the 14 Polish and German Roman Catholic nuns from the 
site began in Belgium, in 1985, after a right-wing Catholic organization 
published an appeal for donations to the convent in an issue of a small 
magazine, "Aid to the Church in Distress." 
</P>
<P>
The language of the appeal, particularly a phrase that said the nuns "would 
pray for wayward souls" at Auschwitz, outraged many Belgian Jews, some of whom 
felt it was an attempt at posthumous baptism. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, a delegation of four Belgian Jews led by Wybran's 
predecessor as chairman of the Coordination Committee, Markus Parves, visited 
Poland and met with Catholic leaders to request that the convent be moved. 
</P>
<P>
The killing came at a time when tension has eased between Roman Catholics and 
Jews over the Auschwitz issue. In September, the Vatican decided that the 
convent should be moved and offered to pay some of the cost.

U.S. OKS $200 MILLION IN AID TO POLAND

<P>
Responding to Poland's pledge of major economic reform, the Bush Administration 
Wednesday promised a $200-million grant to the new government in Warsaw, 
bringing the total U.S. aid package to $427 million. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is intended to bring the Polish government, led by a non-Communist 
Cabinet, closer to the $1 billion it seeks from the West to help stabilize its 
seriously damaged economy. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is contingent on Poland's reaching an agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund on a specific plan to restructure its economy as 
the nation places a greater emphasis on private enterprise and a free-market 
system. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, announcing the new funding, also 
said that President Bush has invited Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski, a 
Communist general, and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who formed the new, 
Solidarity-led government, to visit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The White House announcement came one day after the 12 members of the European 
Community agreed to contribute more than $300 million to Poland. The Common 
Market and U.S. commitments are part of $660 million pledged so far by 24 of 
the world's richest nations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has come under increasing congressional pressure over the last two months 
to provide more U.S. assistance for Poland as the government there, led by key 
figures in the Solidarity trade union, tries to maneuver the shaky economy 
through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Aid Doubled 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 14, Bush nearly doubled the amount of food aid offered to Poland by 
the United States, adding $50 million to a previous offer of $58 million 
offered during fiscal 1989 and 1990. In addition, the Administration is 
supporting a $119-million, three-year package of economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic changes in Poland over the past two months have lent new urgency 
to our efforts," Fitzwater said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
But the President's plan pales in comparison to that urged by congressional 
Democrats. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) have proposed $887 million in economic aid, $125 
million in food assistance and trade and investment incentives for Poland and 
Hungary, which is also undergoing a dramatic liberalization of its economy and 
political life. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no disagreement that both Poland and Hungary need, and will have, 
strong U.S. support," Fitzwater said. "There is no disagreement that the U.S. 
needs to play a leading role in developing a concerted Western approach to 
Poland's economic recovery. The question is how best to achieve our goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe, as do our Western economic partners, that Poland can best go 
forward by reforming its economy and becoming credit-worthy again by reaching 
early agreement with the IMF on an economic reform plan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater added that the Administration is "willing to negotiate with Congress 
on the amounts and the nature of the package. Obviously, we proposed an amount 
that we feel is realistic in terms of the need as well as our ability to pay. . 
. . But the numbers are all negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Blackwill, a National Security Council staff member, said that the 
Polish government presented its request for the funding last week and pegged it 
to a series of steps planned there. The reforms include stabilizing its 
currency, dramatically reducing government subsidies to a variety of industries 
and agriculture and seeking $700 million from the International Monetary Fund, 
in addition to the $1 billion it is seeking from wealthy Western nations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very bold and tough," he said of the Polish plan. "It has the classic 
measures of trying to right an economy." 
</P>
<P>
Specific plans for spending the $200 million have not been drawn up. However, 
an Administration delegation made up of experts in finance, agriculture, 
industry, business, transportation, communications and labor will be sent to 
Poland to offer advice, Fitzwater said.

U.S. SEIZES SHIP, COCAINE CARGO IN GULF OF MEXICO;

COAST GUARD HAUL POINTS TO FRANTIC BID BY COLOMBIA DRUG LORDS, OFFICIALS SAY

<P>
The Coast Guard, announcing "the largest maritime cocaine seizure in history," 
said Wednesday it has intercepted a ship carrying at least 5.75 tons of the 
drug, with an estimated street value of nearly $2 billion, through the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the seizure reinforces mounting evidence that 
Colombian traffickers, reacting to a government crackdown, have launched an 
effort to move bulk quantities of cocaine to the United States before their 
vulnerable caches are uncovered by police authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Indications of the exodus have been found in an extraordinary series of cocaine 
busts by U.S. authorities, beginning with a record 20-ton find in a Sylmar 
warehouse last week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest interception, about 400 miles south of New Orleans, brings the 
week's count of cocaine seizures to nearly 28 tons -- about 7% of estimated 
annual world production. 
</P>
<P>
"Their stash sites in Colombia are in jeopardy, and they've had to move it 
out," said Charles P. Gutensohn, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's 
cocaine investigations division. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the unusual size of the cocaine stockpiles found in the Los 
Angeles area and aboard a number of vessels offshore suggests that cocaine 
traffickers in Colombia have adopted new tactics in an effort to dispatch 
shipments in haste. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Gutensohn said, "they're making big, dumb mistakes." But he and 
other officials cautioned that the new modus operandi by Colombian traffickers 
is certain to include changes "that we don't yet know about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Something Unusual Happening 
</P>
<P>
"We have never seen these large stashes before," said John Zienter, special 
agent in charge of Los Angeles DEA office. "It tells me something unusual is 
happening. The something unusual is the pressure we're applying in South 
America, particularly in Colombia. It's too early to say if they (the 
Colombians) are panicking, but I certainly would hope so." 
</P>
<P>
The apparent burst of activity by the drug cartels marks an end to a monthlong 
lull in cocaine smuggling. Federal officials had hailed the slowdown as an 
indication that the Colombian government's offensive against trafficking 
operations was succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the respite had ended, officials contended that the 
pattern of disruption is continuing. Shipments of raw coca from Peru and 
Bolivia to factories in Colombia remain minimal, they said. And they 
characterized the huge U.S.-bound shipments as indications of desperation among 
Colombian traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"First they battened down the hatches," one official said. "Now their cache 
locations are in jeopardy, and they're looking for an opening to get it out." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the massive seizure in the Gulf of Mexico resulted from a 
"cold hit" on a ship bound for Tampa, Fla., by a lone Coast Guard cutter 
patrolling in international waters near the Yucatan peninsula. A "cold hit" is 
an apprehension based on no prior information about suspected criminal 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard crew members who boarded and searched the vessel found 11,500 
pounds of cocaine secreted in containers aboard the ship, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. 
Jim Simpson said. Three more containers inaccessible at sea might contain yet 
more cocaine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard cutter was escorting the seized vessel to New Orleans, where it 
is expected to dock early today. Officials said that the interception took 
place several days ago, but they declined to provide further details until the 
ship is in port. 
</P>
<P>
The largest previous maritime seizure of cocaine occurred in November, 1987, in 
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., where officials found more than 8,700 pounds of cocaine 
in hollowed-out lumber that had been cut for patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the gulf seizure followed two U.S. operations earlier this 
week that together netted nearly two tons of cocaine near Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Big Seizures 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Coast Guard-Customs Service operation seized a 148-foot Panamanian 
freighter and found 2,840 pounds of cocaine hidden in a shipping container in 
the cargo hold. On Tuesday, another joint operation recovered 1,120 pounds of 
cocaine in bales that had been dropped at sea from an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The 15,460 pounds seized in the three operations represents more cocaine than 
the Coast Guard seized during all of 1988, officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sat through roughly a month now of a pretty dry spell as far as 
smuggling activity was concerned," said Leon Guinn, a senior Customs official 
who heads enforcement operations in Florida. "Now suddenly we're back in the 
middle of it again." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that it was the sheer magnitude of the 20-ton stash found 
in the Los Angeles warehouse -- rather than the fact that it contained drugs 
from both the Cali and Medellin cartels -- that provided a powerful clue that 
something unusual was afoot. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Cali and Medellin operations have long used the same Mexican smugglers 
to bring their cocaine into Los Angeles, and they are believed even to have 
shared the same warehouses before reclaiming the stashes for distribution, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But they also said they believe the size of the stockpile was unprecedented. 
"It just doesn't make sense for anyone to put that much cocaine in one place," 
said the DEA's Gutensohn. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA's Gutensohn declined to say if investigators had learned when the 
cocaine had been smuggled into the United States. But other sources said that 
evidence uncovered in the search indicated that the Los Angeles warehouse was 
being used as a storage site for bulky shipments dispatched from Colombia 
within the last few weeks.

STATE SEIZES JERSEY CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM, FIRES OFFICIALS

JERSEY CITY, N. J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state of New Jersey fired the superintendent and dismissed the local school 
board of this faded industrial city Wednesday in the largest state takeover of 
an urban school district in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover, approved by a unanimous vote of the state Board of Education, 
meeting in nearby Jamesburg, was based on allegations by state investigators 
that the 28,000-student school district is academically bankrupt and riddled by 
corruption, mismanagement and political favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
In examinations administered last spring, more than half of the ninth-graders 
in the district -- the second largest in New Jersey -- failed a test on basic 
proficiency in reading, writing and mathematics. In addition, state 
investigators have described conditions in the city's schools as deplorable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Innocent Victims' Cited 
</P>
<P>
"We can now step in on behalf of the innocent victims of the Jersey City school 
system -- the children who have not received the educational opportunity to 
which they are entitled," state Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman said 
after the board's action Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board appointed Elena J. Scambio, who had been serving as Essex County 
schools superintendent, as the new Jersey City superintendent for a three-year 
term at a $100,000 annual salary. Scambio, speaking at a news conference, 
pledged a get-tough policy and said that her first initiative will be to 
streamline the school district's bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to fish, cut bait or get out of the boat," she said in a 
warning to principals and school administrators in Jersey City. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover was the first in New Jersey under a law enacted last year giving 
the state the power to assume control of chronically troubled school districts. 
At least seven other states have similar laws, and two of them -- New Mexico 
and Kentucky -- have seized districts that were judged to be failures. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials in New Jersey said that the Jersey City case is being 
watched closely throughout the nation as a possible model of school 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
Under New Jersey's law, once the state takes over, the local school 
superintendent and board of education are immediately dismissed, along with 
executive administrators in charge of curriculum, finance and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperman said that a 15-member advisory board of education will be established 
in Jersey City within 60 days to replace the locally appointed nine-member 
board. He will appoint 13 of the members and the city government will name the 
other two. 
</P>
<P>
The state has five years to bring the district up to par with state 
certification requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Scambio said that "change will not come easily nor will it come overnight." 
But, she added: "I do not have the slightest doubt that students from even the 
most impoverished and difficult backgrounds can succeed academically and 
socially. I intend to see that Jersey City students succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The student population in the district is about 44% black, 34% Latino and 13% 
white. More than half the students are enrolled in compensatory, bilingual or 
special education programs. 
</P>
<P>
The school budget this year is about $186 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kabili Tayari, president of the Parents Council of Jersey City, said that his 
organization had mixed emotions about the state takeover. "What we heard sounds 
good," he said, "but we have reservations because it's the first time it's 
happened (in New Jersey) and we haven't seen a plan for implementation or a 
timetable." 
</P>
<P>
Tayari said he hopes that state control leads to a more aggressive program of 
hiring minority-group teachers and staff members. Less than 5% of the teachers 
are black or Latinos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover move was bitterly resisted by many Jersey City officials, who 
blamed past administrations and the inadequacies of school funding for the the 
district's problems. The board of education reportedly owes $500,000 to the New 
York law firm it hired to defend itself against state seizure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Blow to Children 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Williams, the superintendent fired by the state, said Wednesday: "In a 
society that offers little enough to bolster the self-confidence of urban 
children, the campaign to take over the Jersey City schools has only further 
lowered the self-image of our students." 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Gerald McCann, who won office earlier this year after a campaign 
that endorsed a state takeover of the school district, called the state's 
action a "real win for the schoolchildren of Jersey City," according to a 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the takeover, the state board cited political intrusion in hiring, 
violations of bidding laws, failure to provide for handicapped children and 
unauthorized use of state funds.

CAMERAMAN, CBS DENY AFGHANISTAN SCENES WERE FAKED 
</P>

Michael Hoover, the free-lance cameraman accused of faking footage in reports 
about the Afghanistan war that aired on "The CBS Evening News," labeled the 
charges "absolute rubbish" Wednesday. CBS agreed and said it was closing the 
book on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to allegations that were published last week in the New York Post, 
Hoover said that he stood by the authenticity of his work. 
</P>
<P>
"I never staged any battles at all, or any phony clashes or anything of that 
sort," Hoover said in an interview, a day after meeting here with CBS News 
President David Burke. "Their sources weren't even there with me at the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites In-Fighting 
</P>
<P>
He said that the accusations originated from in-fighting among rival Afghan 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The only allegation in the Post stories conceded by Hoover was that a Pakistani 
plane had been mistakenly identified as a Soviet plane. "With the exception of 
that plane, all of the accusations in the Post stories are false," Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
The Post alleged that "The CBS Evening News" aired faked battle footage and 
false news accounts on Afghanistan on several occasions in the mid-1980s. Some 
of that footage was used again in a 1987 CBS documentary, "The Battle for 
Afghanistan," which was narrated by CBS anchor Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover acknowledged a published report that he had used re-creations in two 
films about outdoor adventures. But he said those programs had carried on-air 
disclaimers about possible re-creations and insisted that he had abided by CBS 
News standards in his work for the network. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Hoover, who was on assignment in New Zealand when the story 
broke, CBS News President Burke issued an internal memo to the CBS staff that 
was made available to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
"After extensive conversations with persons in the United States and abroad, as 
well as a searching discussion with free-lance photographer Michael Hoover, CBS 
News is satisfied that allegations that it broadcast fake combat footage from 
Afghanistan in the mid-1980s simply are not true," Burke wrote. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The CBS Evening News,' Dan Rather and the producers involved with the 
coverage of that distant war back then met all of their professional 
obligations and met them with complete integrity." 
</P>
<P>
According to CBS sources, the network conducted its own investigation of the 
charges, contacting sources quoted in the Post story and screening the footage. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, this is finished," CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said. 
"There's no reason for us to spend more time looking for errors that don't 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post did not back down from its story. "I believe we've met our 
burden of proof," said editor Jerry Nachman. "I'm not certain Mr. Burke or Mr. 
Hoover have met theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Richard Salant, who was president of CBS News for 16 years until 
retiring in 1979. "I'm an admirer of CBS News, and this is not conclusive," he 
said in an interview Wednesday. "What this basically says is, 'We've looked 
into it, and we're not guilty.' It leaves open the question of who did the 
investigation and whom did they talk to. This is precisely the kind of case 
that ought to be turned over to an independent news council."

TWO WEEKS AFTER HURRICANE, CHARLESTON IS CONFIDENT OF FULL RECOVERY 
</P>

CHARLESTON, S.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after the fury of Hurricane Hugo, only six out of 10 residents have 
power, the county's 70 schools remain closed and more than 20,000 people still 
are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But city fathers, who had stressed the city's needs in appeals for aid and in 
criticism of federal relief efforts, on Wednesday sought to project an upbeat 
attitude and professed optimism about a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"This gallant city has withstood the century's greatest storm. The bells of St. 
Michael's Church, known by tourists around the world, are ringing again," said 
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., who was seen wearing a T-shirt saying "Charleston/We 
Are Going Strong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Season for Celebration' 
</P>
<P>
"Clean up efforts have been dramatic," said Bill Stottlemeyer, an official at 
the Chamber of Commerce. "This fall is going to be a season for celebration and 
Thanksgiving. We're fighting a national perception that Charleston has been 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
There was some evidence that their new attitude was not simple boosterism. 
</P>
<P>
Food distribution points operated by the Salvation Army were cut back Wednesday 
from seven to two as food reached the saturation point, said Army spokesman 
John Edwards, who added that he expects food distribution to end this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Riley said he may relax or cancel the 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew 
imposed immediately after the hurricane hit. The city's streets are passable. 
Tree limbs and other debris are being pushed back over the curbs, waiting for 
trucks to haul them away. 
</P>
<P>
But there are many signs that Charleston still has much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Shards of glass from broken window panes still litter many downtown sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 power company and telephone repairmen remain in the field, 
working 17 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep going to get the power on," said lineman Charles Grady, who 
looked exhausted. "If everyone left, there wouldn't be anyone to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The most severe problems remain in rural areas where utility lines often are 
pinned down by fallen trees, Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross issued an appeal for more nurses to volunteer to relieve Red 
Cross nurses who have been on duty since the storm. 
</P>
<P>
And homelessness remains a major problem. Although many temporary shelters have 
closed, at least eight remain open under sponsorship of the Red Cross and 
county officials, mostly in schools and churches. 
</P>
<P>
Other people who fled the destruction of Hugo are living with friends or 
relatives, or have jammed dozens of hotels and motels in and around Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army urged continued contributions of money to pay for utility 
bills, temporary housing and medical services for victims. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, while promising that Charleston will be beautiful again and ready for 
visitors by late October, said federal, state and local authorities would 
continue to focus on the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"A disaster always injures disproportionately those who are least well off," he 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
With donations of food, clothing and building supplies arriving from as far 
away as the West Coast, the mayor minimized some delays in distribution that 
have occurred, calling them temporary "glitches." 
</P>
<P>
"We've created a supply system literally overnight, with 50 trucks moving in 
and out every day," he said. "The logistical problems we have solved are 
phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
"There's been so much suffering," said Denise Moore, a pharmacy manager. "But 
everyone has pitched in to help and we're going to make a comeback." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Blazer, chairman of the Charleston Chamber of Commerce, said tourists must 
realize that "90% of the area's hotels and restaurants and many of its 
businesses already are operating as before." 
</P>
<P>
None of Charleston's historic homes were destroyed, although some lost parts of 
their roofs, had windows blown out and suffered water damage. Guided tours of 
many historic buildings will resume in two weeks, Blazer said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Virgin Islands delegate to Congress denounced what he 
called sensational reports of looting that took place after the hurricane 
severely damaged St. Croix, one of the hardest hit of the Caribbean islands. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing mainly for travel writers to promote tourism, Ron de Lugo told 
reporters "we've taken a hell of a beating from other segments of the press." 
</P>
<P>
"This was not portrayed as looting. It was portrayed as rioting. There was no 
rioting, there were no attacks on white communities. Let me tell you you're a 
lot safer in St. Croix on any night, including the days after Hugo, than you 
are in the nation's capital or in a lot of our major cities."

<P>
A state panel set up last year under a first-in-the-nation gun control law 
aimed at ridding Maryland of "Saturday night specials" has banned two weapons 
and approved 627. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 34 pistols, including several small, two-shot Derringers, have 
been tentatively rejected for sale or manufacture in Maryland by the Handgun 
Roster Board. 
</P>
<P>
The approved list includes a semi-automatic Uzi pistol from Israel and the 
Glock 17 from Austria that has some plastic parts that don't show up on airport 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Among other weapons approved are all handguns made by major manufacturers such 
as Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson, as well as handguns approved for importation by 
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who were advocates of the law may be disappointed that more guns 
weren't excluded from the list," said Simon Atlas, a board member. "But that's 
the way the law is written. Certainly, the worst fears the National Rifle Assn. 
had have been laid to rest." 
</P>
<P>
The NRA vigorously opposed the law last year when it was before the 
Legislature. Among those who campaigned for the law were Sarah Brady, wife of 
former presidential Press Secretary James S. Brady, who was shot and wounded 
along with former President Ronald Reagan in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The law makes it illegal beginning in 1990 to sell or manufacture handguns in 
Maryland not approved by the nine-member board of gubernatorial appointees. 
Guns made before 1985 are excluded from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Under law, the panel must consider nine criteria in weighing a particular 
weapon, including concealability, accuracy and quality, to weed out Saturday 
night specials -- the small, cheap, low-caliber handguns often used in street 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The two weapons formally banned are .25-caliber and .32-caliber guns made by 
the L. W. Seecamp Co. of New Haven, Conn. The company no longer makes the 
.25-caliber model. The .32-caliber gun, only 4 1/8 inches long, was not 
considered safe enough to meet the requirements of the handgun law.

57,000 WORKERS STRIKE BOEING IN 7 STATES; SEEK BIGGER SHARE OF RECORD 
PROSPERITY

<P>
More than 57,000 production workers in seven states struck the Boeing Co. 
shortly after midnight Wednesday, demanding a bigger share of the company's 
record prosperity. The walkout threatens further production delays at the 
world's biggest aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
The striking members of the International Assn. of Machinists, 43,300 of whom 
work in the Seattle area, took to the picket lines shortly after midnight after 
overwhelmingly voting to reject Boeing's last contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers make up about a third of Boeing's worldwide work force of 144,725. 
About 106,000 of the Boeing workers are based in western Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Work Continues 
</P>
<P>
While pickets formed rings around Boeing plants from Seattle to Wichita, Kan., 
to Portland, Ore., supervisors and nonstriking workers -- including engineers 
and white-collar workers, who are represented by other unions -- attempted to 
continue production. Industry analysts said the strike would not make an 
economic dent in Boeing for two to three weeks because supervisors can finish 
some nearly completed planes with parts on hand. 
</P>
<P>
No talks were scheduled. Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who joined the talks 
over the weekend, said he wanted negotiations to resume quickly because of the 
number of people affected and the potential impact of a long strike at Boeing, 
Washington's largest private employer. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the company's latest offer is "a negotiating 
position. It's not a take-it-or-leave-it." He said it was likely a federal 
mediator would be asked to supervise talks when they are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing strike is being watched closely by labor and management experts. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace is one of organized labor's last strongholds, and after disappointing 
experiences in auto, aviation and mining strikes this year, "organized labor 
just can't afford to lose at Boeing," said Dan Lacey, an author of several 
labor-management books. 
</P>
<P>
The issues behind the strike are also clear-cut. While many labor disputes have 
featured companies that plead poverty against union demands, the Boeing dispute 
pits a rich company against a union that has not received an increase in its 
base wage since 1982 and contends that Boeing is obligated to make up for past 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Like many companies, Boeing has attempted to replace annual increases in the 
base-wage -- which is the standard for determining pensions and other benefits 
-- with annual lump-sum bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
These bonuses have proven popular with some younger workers but are regarded by 
union leaders as a devious way of avoiding long-term company costs. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's last offer, made during negotiations in Palm Springs, includes 
base-wage increases of 4% this year, 3% in 1990 and 3% in 1991. It also 
includes annual bonuses of 8% of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3% the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing paid bonuses of 12% in 1986 and 5% in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the average machinist making $13.39 per hour, the new offer would mean an 
additional $13,800 in income over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
But union officials said Boeing -- which earned $614 million last year on sales 
of $17 billion and posted a 20% gain in net income in the first six months of 
this year -- can afford far more. 
</P>
<P>
Union spokesman Jack Daniels refused to specify what the union is demanding, 
saying "it doesn't behoove us to bandy that figure about in public." He said 
the union had requested that the federal mediator step in, but there has been 
no response from Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Boeing will show about two weeks' face-saving silence," Daniels said. 
"Two or three weeks they can afford." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said approximately 400 pickets were working four-hour shifts around the 
clock at the entrances to Boeing plants, which stretch across a 50-mile area of 
the Puget Sound from Everett to Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
Pickets in groups of three were holding signs in evening rain Wednesday along 
the thoroughfare surrounding Boeing Field just south of downtown Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists last struck Boeing in 1977 for two months. 
</P>
<P>
The strike hits a company struggling to meet delivery schedules in the midst of 
its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines and leasing companies striving to replace their aging fleets and meet 
a surge in passenger traffic have ordered 736 planes worth $38.5 billion so far 
this year. Although Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, Boeing's 
commercial division has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $70 billion, 
with deliveries extending into the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing strike also is being watched closely by other aerospace companies 
that have traditionally used Boeing's contract as a trend-setter. 
</P>
<P>
The machinist union has a strike fund of about $90 million and will dole out 
benefits of $100 per week for each striker starting in the third week of the 
strike, according to union officials.

EPA SUES 4 CITIES FOR FAILING TO ENFORCE WATER QUALITY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed lawsuits 
Wednesday against four U.S. cities for failure to enforce water quality 
standards requiring industries to treat toxic waste water before releasing it 
into municipal systems. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on the EPA's behalf, Justice Department attorneys initiated action 
against the cities of Detroit, El Paso, Phoenix and San Antonio, seeking court 
orders to force them to meet federal requirements. Continued failure to comply 
could bring fines of $25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EPA disclosed that 57 other cities and towns have been the 
subject of judicial and administrative sanctions for failure to enforce the ban 
against discharge of untreated toxic wastes into their sewage systems. Among 
them is California's Chino Basin area, which was assessed a $200,000 fine by 
the state last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We can, we must, we will do a better job of enforcing our environmental laws," 
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said at a news conference as he and Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced the actions against the four cities. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly characterized the four as "the weak link in the effort to remove toxic 
pollutants from the nation's waterways." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, EPA estimated that a third of the country's nearly 1,500 municipal 
sewage treatment facilities at which pre-treatment programs are required remain 
in violation of at least some of the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The effluent from thousands of industrial sites contains many toxics, including 
chemicals such as cyanide and arsenic and heavy metals such as lead and 
cadmium. Without pre-treatment, such discharges have the potential to corrode 
the pipes of municipal waste treatment systems, endanger workers and even cause 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Besides California, non-compliance actions have been initiated by the states of 
Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Tennessee.

TRANSFUSION AIDS RISK SCALED BACK; 
</P>
<P>
RED CROSS FINDS INCIDENCE DECREASES ANNUALLY BY 30% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The risk of becoming infected with the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion 
may be "fourfold fewer than reported previously," according to a new study by 
American Red Cross researchers published in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The study also cites preliminary data that the AIDS risk to recipients of blood 
transfusions "has been decreasing by more than 30% a year" between 1985 and 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
But AIDS experts disagree about whether the new estimate -- one infected unit 
per 153,000 units of blood transfused -- is likely to be more accurate than a 
previous estimate -- one in 40,000 -- which was published by U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) researchers in the same journal last year. 
</P>
<P>
No matter which estimate is believed, the overall risk of AIDS infection by 
transfusion remains quite small when compared to other commonly accepted risks. 
For example, the risk of being killed in an automobile accident in the United 
States is about one in 5,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimate is "good news," Dr. Jay E. Menitove of the Blood Center of 
Southeastern Wisconsin in Milwaukee said in a telephone interview. The overall 
risk of transfusion infection is "very, very small. . . . We really are now 
dealing at the very marginal edge in terms of reducing risk further." 
</P>
<P>
The various estimates are "not that different," said the CDC's Dr. John W. 
Ward, who led the research team that prepared the earlier estimate. "All of 
them are estimates," Ward said in a telephone interview from Atlanta. "None of 
them are direct measures (of the number of AIDS-infected units of blood that 
escape detection)." 
</P>
<P>
After reading the study, Ward said there is a "possibility" that the AIDS risk 
from transfused blood is decreasing but added "we don't want to decrease our 
vigilance." 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross study is one of three articles on transfusion AIDS 
published in the New England Journal, along with an editorial by Menitove that 
calls on blood banks and public health officials to work harder to prevent 
individuals likely to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
the cause of AIDS, from donating blood. 
</P>
<P>
Among the strategies that are advocated are more explicit questioning of 
prospective donors about their risk of HIV infection and recruiting more female 
blood donors, who as a group are less likely than men to be infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory tests performed on all donated blood to detect the AIDS virus 
are accurate, but not foolproof. As a result, if HIV-infected individuals 
donate blood, some contaminated blood may escape detection. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, most estimates of the risk of becoming infected with 
HIV through a blood transfusion have been in the range of one in 40,000 to one 
in 60,000 per unit of blood transfused. Because the typical transfusion patient 
receives about five units of blood, the actual risk to the average patient 
would be higher. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimate is based on data from 17 million American Red Cross blood 
donations between April, 1985, and December, 1987. It was prepared by a 
research team led by Paul D. Cumming. 
</P>
<P>
Using data on the incidence of HIV-positive blood donations and on the accuracy 
record of HIV blood tests, the researchers estimated the chances that an 
infected unit would slip through undetected. 
</P>
<P>
They estimated that between 67 and 227 HIV-positive blood units "entered the 
nation's blood supply undetected in 1987" out of 20 million units of blood and 
its components transfused annually. Their best estimate was 131 units, which 
corresponds to a risk to a patient of one in 153,000 per unit transfused. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross study also cited a "preliminary analysis" of 1988 data. 
This showed that the "most likely number of HIV-positive units entering the 
blood supply" declined from 368 units in 1985 to 87 units in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the CDC, using a slightly different method, estimated in a 
February, 1988, New England Journal article that "as many as 460 recipients of 
screened blood may become infected annually." This corresponds to a risk to a 
patient of about one in 40,000 per unit transfused. 
</P>
<P>
Ward pointed out that the American Red Cross does not collect blood in New York 
City, large parts of Texas and San Francisco, areas with relatively large 
numbers of HIV-infected people. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of July, there had been about 102,600 AIDS cases in the United 
States, including about 2,700 cases of transfusion-related AIDS, according to 
federal statistics. An estimated 12,000 transfusion recipients in the United 
States were infected with HIV before testing of the blood supply began in 
March, 1985.

CELEBRITY JUSTICE; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN LAWS ARE BROKEN, FAME ISN'T THE SHIELD IT USED TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cynthia Garvey went to jail. The Godfather of Soul is already there. Leona and 
Zsa Zsa are about to receive their sentences. Rob Lowe has already served his. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity justice. Or maybe it's celebrity injustice. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, that meant one lenient set of laws for the famous and a 
harsher set of laws for everyone else. Even now, we think celebrities are no 
more equal in the eyes of Lady Justice than they are to the maitre d' at Spago. 
We expect those privileged enough to enjoy the perks that accompany wealth or 
fame to obey the law. And we know that when they don't, their high-priced 
lawyers and high-placed connections will get them off. 
</P>
<P>
But not anymore. Increasingly, well-known people who get into legal trouble are 
having a harder time getting out of it, judging by the growing list of Who's 
Who offenders -- O.J. Simpson (spousal battery), Eugene Fodor Jr. (breaking and 
entering), Todd Bridges (bomb threat), Sean Penn (probation violations), 
Jan-Michael Vincent (drunk driving), Tony Danza (assault). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Court Time 
</P>
<P>
Some celebrities have spent more time in criminal courts than on the tennis 
courts, or maybe it just seems that way because of all the media attention 
their cases generate. And with so many stars ordered to perform community 
service, perhaps Hollywood has decided to put George Bush's "1,000 points of 
light" program of volunteerism out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Take last Friday, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
While a Beverly Hills jury was ending Gabor's media miniseries, on the other 
side of town David Carradine was pleading no contest to driving under the 
influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
And though no one condones that kind of activity, legal experts say Carradine 
was handed a harsher-than-average sentence, even for a second-time offender: 
three years' summary probation, 48 hours in jail, 100 hours of community 
service, 30 days' work picking up trash for the California Department of 
Transportation, attendance at a drunk driving awareness meeting and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual? Maybe not, according to Hollywood lawyers, publicists and managers. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that officials seek out star offenders just to make examples of 
them? Do courts crack down harder on personalities than their crimes warrant? 
And who really benefits from pursuing a celebrity's case -- the public, a 
politically ambitious prosecutor, or even the celebrity? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worst Kind of Position' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the worst kind of position you can be in is to be a celebrity charged 
with a crime," declared lawyer Harland Braun, whose clients have included 
director John Landis of "Twilight Zone" trial fame. 
</P>
<P>
"Because what would be a normal disposition in a regular case might not be 
available to a celebrity because everyone's afraid of being criticized for 
looking like they were giving someone special treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Weitzman, known as the celebrities' favorite lawyer what with a client 
list including Sean Penn, O.J. Simpson, John DeLorean and Mike Tyson, believes 
that "prosecutors take a harder look at situations where a high-profile 
personality is involved. And (whether) they pursue it sometimes depends on 
whether or not they have a need to satisfy their own ego and get their name in 
the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of spotlights, surely Gabor must be in a special category all her own: 
perhaps the only celebrity in recent memory who relished going on trial for the 
resulting publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said her Beverly Hills prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden 
Fox, "this is the greatest thing to happen to that post-menopausal lady's 
career. But should we just not prosecute someone like this because of who they 
are?" 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Prince Frederick von Anhalt believes a VIP like his wife deserves 
VIP justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rich and famous should be treated differently when they do 
something wrong. They bring the money into Beverly Hills," he declared, vowing 
to spirit away his convicted cop-slapper to a European castle rather than see 
her rot in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Take Their Chances 
</P>
<P>
But those stars who don't have a Bavarian bungalow to flee to must take their 
chances with the law like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the public perception is that a celebrity can get 
off easier. And there is no question that it's absolutely not true," maintains 
criminal lawyer to the stars Robert Shapiro, who has defended Johnny Carson and 
F. Lee Bailey on drunk driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go so far to say that two cases being equal, one involving a celebrity and 
the other not, the ordinary citizen has a much better chance of getting a 
better result." 
</P>
<P>
Just look, Shapiro says, at Jose Canseco's recent brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Oakland Athletics outfielder was ticketed for speeding in his native 
Florida. Then he received four more tickets while driving in Arizona. Last 
April, he was arrested in San Francisco after a passer-by reported seeing a 
semiautomatic pistol on the floor of his parked Jaguar. Most recently, he was 
issued a ticket for speeding through Northern California in his 1989 Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
"I've even had reporters call me late at night at home asking for my reaction 
to Canseco getting stopped for having tinted windows on his car," an 
exasperated Shapiro recalled. "They were all very minor things that would 
ordinarily not cause any attention by anyone. But if you're one of the most 
valuable players in baseball, then they become very important." 
</P>
<P>
According to Shapiro, Canseco lost two major endorsement contracts because of 
the handgun incident, which occurred when Canseco was having an X-ray of his 
injured wrist at an office building owned by the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
"He was charged with a section of the law I and almost everyone else I know in 
the field of criminal law was unaware of: bringing a gun on a public school 
campus, which is a straight felony," Shapiro explained. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also claimed that while "anyone else" would have been released on 
a written promise to appear in court, Canseco had to post $5,000 bail. And, 
Shapiro noted, the seemingly simple case proved "difficult to resolve." In the 
end, Conseco pleaded no contest and received a six-month suspended jail term, 
three years' probation and 80 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
"An ordinary person under those same facts would never be prosecuted like 
that," Shapiro contended. "So obviously you come to the conclusion that 
celebrities can be treated differently." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal attorney Floyd Seigel found himself in a similar situation this summer 
representing Griffin O'Neal, the troubled son of actor Ryan O'Neal, after the 
24-year-old was arrested by Los Angeles police on suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal already had made headlines for his part in the boating death of the son 
of film director Francis Ford Coppola on Memorial Day, 1986, in Maryland. Found 
guilty of reckless boating, O'Neal was given a sentence of 400 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the case's notoriety, Seigel claims the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office was operating under the misconception that the Maryland 
accident was alcohol-related and therefore was seeking a "severe" punishment 
against O'Neal in the form of substantial jail time. 
</P>
<P>
It was only, Seigel says, after he set the city attorney's office straight by 
obtaining the transcripts from the Maryland proceedings that a plea bargain 
could be worked out. Finally, in August, O'Neal's sentence included 160 hours 
of community service, about $800 in fines, a 90-day alcohol education program 
and a 3-month license restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood producer Jay Bernstein, too, believes Stacy Keach "got a bad deal" 
when the actor was ordered to serve a six-month jail sentence in England for 
smuggling cocaine at London's Heathrow Airport in 1984. Bernstein, who produced 
the "Mike Hammer" TV series starring Keach, is convinced the actor was made an 
example of because the drug issue had become a hot topic in British newspapers 
just a few weeks before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a very bad environment," Bernstein recalled. "If it had been Joe 
Keach or Bill Keach or somebody else, they would have just made him pay a fine. 
But it was such a wonderful thing for the authorities to be able to say that 
Mike Hammer does drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the controversy still swirls over whether singer James Brown and 
director Roman Polanski got raw deals with the law. The state Senate in West 
Virginia even passed a resolution urging the governor of South Carolina to show 
some soul and pardon Brown, who was sentenced to a 6-year jail term for trying 
to run over two policemen during a two-state car chase last fall. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Polanski's friends are seeking ways to bring back the 
director from his exile in Paris where he fled an almost certain prison term in 
1978 after pleading guilty in a Santa Monica criminal court to a felony morals 
charge. So far, Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's office hasn't budged, 
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, says USC law professor Martin Levine, is this country's "long 
tradition in law enforcement of looking at cases that have special deterrent 
value. Some agencies specifically go after names so people will read about them 
and feel deterred. It's almost as if officials are delighted to prosecute them 
because of the publicity value." 
</P>
<P>
Still, that doesn't mean stars get worse than they deserve, Martin believes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think celebrities are treated much more equally in the criminal justice 
system than almost any other institution in America. They're more likely to get 
deferential treatment in a restaurant than in jail." 
</P>
<P>
One place where star offenders aren't treated the same as everyone else is in 
the media. Even deputy district attorney Fox acknowledges that "I can't sit 
here and tell you that media notoriety doesn't affect participants in the case, 
including prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, celebrities didn't always have to worry about their foul plays 
making news. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the early days when they were protected by studios, high-powered 
attorneys and well-connected people, celebrities had it easier," said veteran 
Hollywood publicist Lee Solters. 
</P>
<P>
But, starting in the mid-1970s, the rules changed drastically. 
</P>
<P>
"Watergate is what started all this," Bernstein said. "Before Watergate, all 
the celebrities I knew were able to get away with everything except murder. But 
ever since Richard Nixon was caught doing something wrong, that gave the media 
the power to go after everybody. It showed that if you can topple the President 
of the United States, then you can certainly nail a star." 
</P>
<P>
Now the situation is even more complicated, what with the increase in media 
competition and the onset of the computer age. No doubt celebrities may have it 
tougher today because there are so many more magazines, newspapers and TV shows 
competing with one another for the low-down on the highly placed. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win ratings or readers by saying how many happy people there are. 
You have to find the worst-case scenario," Bernstein explained. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawyers acknowledge that they almost always recommend a plea bargain to 
their celebrity clients even when they're confident of an acquittal if the case 
were to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of what recently has been demonstrated, that these court proceedings 
turn into media circuses, celebrities are disinclined to fight charges," 
Shapiro noted. "That's something no ordinary person has to face." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fox maintains that celebrities who do choose a trial have the resources to 
make prosecutions "much more difficult than under normal circumstances. I 
remember that when Johnny Carson was arrested for drunk driving in 1982, he was 
prepared to bring in the manufacturer of the intoximeter from Europe." In the 
end, Carson pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
Also, thanks to computers, reporters need only input a star's name to get the 
electronic equivalent of a rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '40s or '50s or '60s, people could do things that nobody would ever 
know. Now they have computers snapping at their ankles and dredging up all this 
stuff," Bernstein complained. 
</P>
<P>
True, the fact that Fatty Arbuckle's career was ruined by scandal in 1921 when 
he went on trial for manslaughter was the exception rather than the rule years 
ago. In 1942, Errol Flynn weathered charges of statutory rape of two teen-age 
girls aboard his yacht (he was subsequently tried and acquitted). And Robert 
Mitchum's career is still going strong despite the actor's arrest and jailing 
in 1948 for conspiracy to possess marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there are even recent examples of well-known people for whom the 
scales of justice tilt in their favor, though probably none more lopsided than 
Ted Kennedy's escaping a manslaughter indictment for the drowning death of Mary 
Jo Kopechne. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as a signal of changing attitudes about celebrity crimes on the 20th 
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, members of the grand jury that 
investigated Kennedy's role admitted there was "definitely a cover-up." And the 
Boston Herald, aware that the Kennedys are no longer the sacred cows they were 
back in 1969, has called for a new official probe. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the family of the two women killed in a head-on car crash in 
Northern Ireland with movie actor Matthew Broderick said they found it 
"incredible" that serious charges of causing death by careless driving were 
dropped against the star. And they decried the decision to fine Broderick $175 
on a lesser charge as "a travesty of justice." 
</P>
<P>
And Howard Rollins, an Academy Award nominee and star of NBC's "In the Heat of 
the Night" dramatic series, received in 1988 what was considered a 
lighter-than-usual sentence for cocaine possession, driving while intoxicated 
and speeding. A Louisiana judge gave him two years' probation and ordered him 
to make an anti-drug video. 
</P>
<P>
Another piece de resistance of "easy" punishment was that of Geraldine 
Ferraro's son, John Zaccaro Jr., who was convicted of selling cocaine to an 
undercover Vermont police officer. His sentence -- 120 days in jail -- was 
widely criticized as being too lenient. The outcry became even louder when 
officials placed Zaccaro in a special house arrest program that let him stay in 
a posh $1,500-a-month apartment complete with color television and maid 
service. 
</P>
<P>
That issue came up again in the 1987 controversy over where Sean Penn would 
serve his time. Handed a 60-day sentence for a probation violation, the 
punch-prone actor wanted to avoid Los Angeles County's overcrowded central 
jail, filled with hardened criminals. Instead, his savvy attorney, Howard 
Weitzman, got the best cell money could buy -- in this instance, a $50-a-night 
dorm room in the Mono County lock-up in the mountain resort town of Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there doesn't seem to be any reason for attorney Shapiro to make 
any changes in a lecture he likes to give before California trial attorney 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them about the three biggest lies I've ever heard," Shapiro recounted. 
"The first is, 'I'm from the IRS, and I'm here to help you.' The second is a 
little bit off-color. 
</P>
<P>
"And the third one is that, if you're defending a celebrity, then no one is 
going to treat this case any differently than any other."

ARCHITECTURE: ARCHITECTS BUILDING ON THEIR SOCIAL CONSCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in his professional career, architect Arnold Stalk was troubled by the 
plight of the homeless. The fate of families forced to survive on the street or 
crowded into overpriced Skid Row hotel rooms oppressed his soul and challenged 
his sense of responsibility as a neophyte designer. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many architects, who feel they ought to do more than build homes for the 
rich but never come to grips with their troubled consciences, Stalk took 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 he co-founded the Los Angeles Family Housing Corp. as a nonprofit 
agency dedicated to the creation of low-cost housing for economically deprived 
families. Increasingly, LAFHC's projects that range from temporary shelters to 
permanent apartments for the homeless have begun to attract national attention 
as economical yet thoughtfully designed architectural models. 
</P>
<P>
"We could use a multitude of Stalk clones," said John Ochoa, executive director 
of the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the Homeless. "Failing that, we must 
find ways of getting more designers involved in finding clever and attractive 
ways of housing displaced victims of social, economic and political changes 
over which they have no control." 
</P>
<P>
Two recently completed LAFHC projects illustrate how Stalk and his architect 
wife, Michelle, design their way out of lean budgets and rigid building codes 
that regulate everything from the quality of finishes to the sizes of rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Triangle House, on a shabby side street off Brooklyn Avenue in Boyle Heights, 
contains eight apartments arranged in an imaginative complex that could grace 
any upscale Westside neighborhood. The upper level units have mezzanine 
sleeping lofts instead of separate bedrooms to increase the sense of 
spaciousness. And an air of avant-garde elegance, rare in subsidized housing, 
is induced by touches such as the galvanized pipe railings and the eccentric 
skyline silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Style on Minimal Budget 
</P>
<P>
In the Pico Union district, Villa Nueva's 20 apartments are designed on two 
levels around a central courtyard. Its neat, pitched roofs, cross-pane windows 
and fine sand-finished stucco lifts the visual depression of its dilapidated 
downtown district. Intended for families with very low incomes, the publicly 
funded project rents its units for about $250 per month, demonstrating how 
minimal budgets need not dictate mean architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"Architects can do a lot to raise the quality of life for people desperate for 
shelter," Arnold Stalk said. "We can use our expertise as designers to 
dissipate the almost Victorian stigma of charity and ugliness that still clings 
to public housing of any kind. We can create environments that are as pleasant 
as they are cheap." 
</P>
<P>
The Stalks search out potential locations for LAHFC projects by driving the 
streets all over the city. They find funding from a mixture of government 
agencies such as the Community Redevelopment Agency and the federal Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, and from private charities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Privately Funded 
</P>
<P>
As a privately funded project, Triangle House was subject to fewer design 
restrictions and delays than housing built with public money. Its construction 
cost, at $39 per square foot, is roughly half the average cost of $60-$70 for 
most subsidized residential developments, and its completion within a year 
contrasts with an average of three years for publicly financed projects. 
</P>
<P>
Triangle House contractor John Bohling attributes the project's remarkably low 
construction cost to a mixture of professional dedication by the Stalks and a 
plethora of donated materials and services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Collaboration' 
</P>
<P>
"The project ends up a lot nicer than many a Marina del Rey apartment complex I 
have built with twice the budget," he said. "There's less tension and more 
collaboration here, and therefore things go much faster and much happier." 
</P>
<P>
But the Stalks can even create imaginative public housing on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the CRA, Casa Familia, an eight-unit complex on East Adams Boulevard 
completed in 1984, followed a familiar Angeleno architectural tradition of 
two-story townhouses grouped around a courtyard. But in a neighborhood of tough 
streets, the courtyard also served as a relatively safe place for kids to play 
while parents watch from kitchen windows. 
</P>
<P>
Constructed at a modest cost of $50 per square foot, the units rent at about 
$300 per month, way below the market rate for rentals in the crowded area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administers Project 
</P>
<P>
"Although we are in the midst of an urban battle zone, surrounded by dangerous 
street gangs and drug dealers, we have managed to maintain a strong community 
sense in Casa Familia," said Noelle Sweitzer, president of Housing Development 
Services, the contract agency that administers the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Stalks' inventiveness in finding ways to create housing ranges from 
converting historic buildings such as the 100-year-old Strong Mansion, moved 
from its site near the expanding Convention Center earlier this year, to 
conjuring up "quick build" demonstration projects such as the Gentry Village 
apartment complex in North Hollywood, to be erected between this Thanksgiving 
and Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
The architects are also excited by the idea of constructing homes over the 
city's 140 municipal parking lots, which they see as an under-used resource of 
vacant land in a crowded urban scene. 
</P>
<P>
Many architects might wonder how the Stalks can afford to spend so much time on 
homeless housing projects, which pay a professional fee of less than half what 
a designer might command in the commercial housing market. Considering the 
extra red tape involved in any operation controlled by public agencies, plus 
the complexity of the official housing codes, few designers can make a profit 
in this specialty. 
</P>
<P>
The Stalks balance their public work with a practice in custom-designed homes. 
Designers Plus, their private design firm, operates out of the ground floor of 
their Woodland Hills home. The link between the architecture of their designer 
homes and the LAFHC projects is a Cubist simplicity of style and a predilection 
for muscular materials like galvanized steel pipe railings and stark white 
stucco surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Their Dues 
</P>
<P>
"Arnie and I have paid our dues, putting in much sweat and long hours bringing 
low-cost housing projects to completion," Michelle Stalk said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned to punch our way through brick walls of bureaucratic 
obstruction, or find ways around obstacles, while struggling to survive as 
professionals. We feel the profession as a whole should be more involved in 
helping to house the homeless, rather than leaving it up to a few dedicated 
people." 
</P>
<P>
A big beetle-browed man with gentle brown eyes, Arnold Stalk believes most 
architects feel uneasy about this issue, even if they do little or nothing to 
appease their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
"I lecture at SCI-ARC, and find a deep concern among my students about the 
homeless," he said. "I keep telling them, and any other architect who'll 
listen, that we can solve the homeless housing problem, if only we're willing 
to bring our energy and imagination fully to bear. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it's exhausting and unglamorous, and bad for your bank balance. But 
designers simply must get involved. In the long run, much of our professional 
repute depends upon how we respond to this painful human emergency."

GIZMOS, GADGETS AND GIMMICKS: IT'S HOME ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE METCALF, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, the home-electronics industry lives by an uncomplicated rule. 
Essentially, it requires that every few years the industry shall introduce a 
Big, Expensive (But Not Too Expensive!) New Thing that everybody decides is 
necessary to own in order to live a Satisfying, Quality Life. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, the VCR has been the most classic and profitable example. More 
recently it has been the compact-disc player. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Wayman, the snow-haired, avuncular traveling apologist for the Electronics 
Industry Assn., concedes that at the moment there is no such new macro-bauble 
on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
But, he hastens to add, this year there are some pretty smart additions to the 
home-electronics universe. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Wayman, on his annual industry-sponsored Johnny Appleseed tour 
of the country, swept through Hartford bearing several large nylon bags stuffed 
with the latest wave of electronic gewgaws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of New Things 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the industry just now is in search of that one major product to get 
everyone excited," Wayman says, rooting through one of the sacks. "But look at 
all the new things that are coming out." 
</P>
<P>
He extracts a telephone disguised as a blue high-top sneaker. He regards it 
admiringly and lays it aside. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's that . . . ah, here it is." Wayman pulls out a nifty little Sony 
portable unit that's a TV and 8-millimeter video player in one trim chassis 
about the size of a collegiate dictionary. (Come to think of it, you can also 
now buy a collegiate dictionary contained within a little calculator-like 
device with a tiny screen.) 
</P>
<P>
"Portable video," Wayman says, beaming. "That's one thing we think is in the 
future. It's something that's going to catch on." The 8-millimeter video format 
is smaller than the more established VHS format, and it is starting to take 
hold, particularly for camcorders and the new portable devices like the one 
Wayman is toting. 
</P>
<P>
The Sony unit -- predictably dubbed Video Walkman -- reportedly has been 
selling well, despite the $1,000 price tag. One of the airlines now distributes 
the machines to its first-class passengers, and then the flight attendant 
passes around a basket of movie cassettes to select from. 
</P>
<P>
As for camcorders -- the all-in-one video cameras and recorders that now ring 
the stage three-deep at every suburban elementary school pageant in the nation 
-- Wayman believes that they may yet saturate the market the way VCRs have. But 
the price has to slide down to $500 or so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can get there. You already see the so-called VHS-C (C for compact) 
units being discounted to something around $650." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much More to Tell 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- this visit is more to show than to tell, so Wayman is now 
distributing his wares across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
From this assortment, the next wave of home contrivances includes the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
* Video still cameras. These unassuming-looking units take up to 50 pictures at 
a clip and display them on your TV screen. In some quarters, they are 
considered the video generation's answer to home slides. Expensive, though -- 
around $900. 
</P>
<P>
* Waterproof things. Boom boxes, radios and speakers are being waterproofed so 
you don't have to suffer any loss of fidelity even if there's a sudden 
downpour. 
</P>
<P>
* Picture phone. Remember when, back at the 1964 World's Fair, they told us 
that picture phones (with moving images) were just around the corner? That was 
a tad optimistic. But they're getting there, and these latest 
phones-with-screens can transmit a sharp, instantaneous still image over the 
phone line. (The party you're talking to needs a set, too, naturally.) 
</P>
<P>
* Cellular phones. These are already big, of course, among self-important 
business people who feel the need to call their offices and bedevil their 
secretaries while they motor to lunch. But cellular phones (the term refers to 
the areas, or "cells," of reception) are increasingly popular among regular 
people, often as a safety device. Cellular phones are not just for cars, 
either; new models fit in a coat pocket. If they can keep dropping in price, 
they just might be the industry's Next Big Thing. 
</P>
<P>
* Home fax machines. The term "home office" is one that the electronics folks 
would like you to get used to. One of its centerpieces, the industry tells us, 
will be a facsimile machine that you can use for personal correspondence as 
well as business transactions. There is, incidentally, a new portable fax 
machine that you can use in your car (if you're not on the phone). 
</P>
<P>
* Hand-held electronic organizers. These are resourceful little babies, 
resembling overweight calculators, that can store addresses and phone numbers, 
remind you of your wedding anniversary, keep track of your appointments, assist 
you in making travel arrangements, record and store your expense-account 
outlays and rid your thighs of unsightly cellulite. 
</P>
<P>
* Kids' things. The future holds wristwatch walkie-talkies and radios (not that 
today's tykes have ever heard of Dick Tracy), AM-FM necklace radios, and many 
varieties of spelling and math talking minicomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's a "smart" telephone that automatically calls Mom, Dad, police or 
the fire department when you touch a color-coded pad. 
</P>
<P>
* Etc. Look for VCRs that can be programmed by phone, cordless speakers and 
headphones, elaborate car-security devices (such as the plush teddy bear that 
screams for the police when a window or door is jimmied) and hi-fi speakers 
that mount flush to the wall.

GLITTER, HORROR ARE BOOKENDS OF TRYON'S NOVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN McCLURG, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood glitter; New England horror. 
</P>
<P>
For Tom Tryon, actor, and Thomas Tryon, author, those have been the 
irresistible twin magnetic poles on the map of his vivid imagination. 
</P>
<P>
After two best-selling novels about Hollywood's legendary stars -- "Crowned 
Heads" (1976) and "All That Glitters" (1986) -- Tryon the horror master is back 
with "The Night of the Moonbow," published by Knopf ($18.95). 
</P>
<P>
Like "The Other," Tryon's 1971 psychological horror classic, the events in "The 
Night of the Moonbow" unfold in a seemingly innocuous but ultimately sinister 
Connecticut setting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evil in Camp 
</P>
<P>
This time around, evil is lurking not in Tryon's hometown of Wethersfield, 
which he calls Pequot Landing, but in "Camp Friend-Indeed" in northeastern 
Connecticut. Modeled after Camp Woodstock, the YMCA camp that Tryon attended as 
a boy, Friend-Indeed is a Bible camp whose optimistic motto is "Glad Men From 
Happy Boys." But for 14-year-old Leo Joaquim, an orphan with a delicate 
artistic temperament who is struggling to suppress a terrifying secret, camp in 
the summer of 1938 is anything but a carefree experience. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stephen King, Tryon has long mined New England's landscape for his scary 
tales. "Harvest Home" (1973), his second novel about evildoings in bucolic New 
England, probably convinced untold legions of New York advertising men to 
forget their house-in-the-country fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon, who was in bed recuperating from a chill and bronchial infection he 
caught in a drafty New York studio while recording the audio-book version of 
his new novel, recently spoke by telephone from his Los Angeles home about the 
"brooding darkness" of New England rural life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt there is that kind of steely, iron-y, dark, spare, sparse 
Hawthorne-ish aspect of New England which goes back to our Puritan forebears. 
There have been Tryons in the town of Wethersfield since the first 10 
settlers," says Tryon, 63. "There are pockets in the region that just seem made 
for that sort of dark horror story." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now for the Fun 
</P>
<P>
If New England has been Tryon's dark muse, Hollywood has been his "fun" muse. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he got around to writing "Crowned Heads," his first Hollywood 
novel, Tryon had accrued "a lot of inside dope." Mae West had tried to seduce 
him. He turned her into the "Babe" of "All That Glitters" -- and made the 
fictional most of the famous Hollywood story that the wisecracking sex symbol 
was really a man in drag. Fictional versions of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo 
have also starred in his Hollywood novels. 
</P>
<P>
As a young man Tryon was dazzled by the legendary Hollywood of the '30s and 
'40s. After making his Broadway debut in the Joshua Logan musical "Wish You 
Were Here" in 1952, he arrived in Hollywood on an inauspicious day -- April 
Fool's, 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount had a "lovely fish pond with golden carp" which was torn out and 
turned into a parking lot, Tryon recalls of that day. "It was a sign of the 
times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Cardinal Role 
</P>
<P>
The tall, darkly handsome actor appeared in scores of movies and television 
shows, and had the title role in "Texas John Slaughter," the Walt Disney 
series. 
</P>
<P>
And then came "The Cardinal" (1963), his most famous role and the one that, 
thanks to director Otto Preminger's tyranny, eventually drove Tryon from 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very painful experience, and even today it's painful to reflect upon 
or dwell upon," Tryon says of working with Preminger. "He treated all actors 
abominably unless they were so big that they could just stomp on him. He never 
treated John Wayne like that. I saw him literally destroy actors, reduce them 
to babbling idiots." 
</P>
<P>
Tryon, who also keeps a home in New York, stayed in Hollywood ("I left in the 
spiritual sense," he says) but turned to writing. "The Other," a thriller about 
a 13-year-old obsessed with his evil twin, was an instant smash and later a 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
(At a dinner party, Preminger once told mutual friends that Tryon should thank 
him because he was responsible for the former actor's successful writing 
career.) 
</P>
<P>
And although his books hit the best-seller lists, Tryon struggled personally, 
getting hooked on drugs and alcohol. He has been a member of Alcoholics 
Anonymous for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon came clean publicly before it became fashionable to tell all in People 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that if in relating my own experiences I could help anybody, then 
it was worthwhile. And today the problem is so prevalent anyway, you're looked 
at askance if you don't have a history of drugs and alcohol," Tryon says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children's Market 
</P>
<P>
These days, everything seems to be going Tryon's way. After a delay in its 
scheduled publication ("we cut 250 pages"), "Moonbow" is out. In spring 1990, 
Tryon's first children's book will be published by Viking-Penguin. Called "Opal 
and Cupid," it's the story of a girl and an elephant, and Tryon jokes that 
"it's typical children's fare, with sex, money, greed, show business -- all of 
those things that parents like their kids to read so they're then ready for 
Jackie Susann or Jackie Collins." 
</P>
<P>
Happiest news of all, Tryon just heard from Knopf that the first volume of what 
he calls the "big book" has been put on the publisher's spring 1990 list -- 
with the second and third volumes expected to follow the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon has labored for 12 years on "Kingdom Come," which, when 
</P>
<P>
published, may number some 3,000 pages total, and those years account for the 
10-year publishing gap between "Crowned Heads" and "All That Glitters." It is a 
saga of two feuding families in Pequot Landing set between 1826 and 1878. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Publisher's Reprieve 
</P>
<P>
Hearing that the first volume, tentatively called "The Wings of the Morning," 
is due out next year was like being "reprieved from a death sentence," Tryon 
says. 
</P>
<P>
And he says that he is pleased with "The Night of the Moonbow," which he first 
began to write 17 years ago while on vacation in Mexico. But former Knopf 
president Robert Gottlieb, who was then his editor, "felt perhaps that it was 
too close to 'The Other' and that at that point I was repeating myself." So 
Tryon put the manuscript aside for years and just finished it about 2 1/2 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon acknowledges that critics will be tempted to compare "Moonbow" to "The 
Other." Both are about adolescent boys and are set in the same pre-World War II 
era. Both Niles Perry and Leo Joaquim are, to varying degrees, wrestling with 
knowledge hidden deep in their subconscious. But there is at least one very 
important distinction, Tryon says: Niles is a victim, while Leo refuses to be 
victimized. 
</P>
<P>
"The similarities I've made no attempt to disguise," Tryon says of his new 
novel, "but I hope it will stand on its differences."

THESIS AUTHOR FINDS NICHE AT BLACK COLLEGE 
</P>

<P>
While growing up in suburban Columbia, Md., Suzanne Malveaux lived in an 
integrated neighborhood. She attended predominantly white schools. At Harvard 
University, where she graduated with honors last June, her roommates were 
white, yellow and black. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Malveaux said she keenly felt her black identity. She also wanted to find 
out what it would be like "to be a member of the majority for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
To explore both points, she spent a semester at Howard University, going to 
classes, living in a dorm, working at the radio station. 
</P>
<P>
She also gathered material for a senior thesis on students who transferred to 
Howard, one of the nation's best-known black universities. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, her research was summa cum laude at Harvard. The 298-page thesis, 
based on interviews with 50 students who transferred to Howard from 
predominantly white schools primarily for social reasons, was named the best 
undergraduate thesis in sociology at Harvard and won a $1,500 prize as one of 
the best theses in any Harvard department this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large and Diverse 
</P>
<P>
Although she went to Howard looking for a "black university," what Malveaux 
found there was less clear-cut. More than 80% of Howard's students and faculty 
are black. Most of the rest are foreign. Very few are American whites. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Malveaux said in her thesis that Howard is more similar to the 
predominantly white colleges than she and most transfer students expected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cold and Aloof' 
</P>
<P>
Its student body is large and diverse, she wrote, frequently "apolitical" and 
often "cold and aloof." Although most transfer students come "with the explicit 
expectation of meeting a friendlier, more receptive black community," she said, 
"I found that to a newcomer, Howard was not supportive or nurturing. It was a 
large (diffuse) commuter college in the heart of one of D.C.'s most 
economically depressed communities. Registration was a four-day rude awakening 
to Howard's large bureaucracy and defensively scared freshman body." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Malveaux said that she, like most transfer students, "found a niche," based 
not on race but on interests and background. There, she felt comfortable and 
thrived. 
</P>
<P>
By transferring to a predominantly black university, "race becomes much less of 
an issue" for the students than it was at their previous schools, she said. 
They are able to develop as individuals, not "as a representative of the black 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Malveaux said about three-quarters of the transfer students in her survey would 
recommend Howard to their black friends. 
</P>
<P>
But Malveaux said she decided to return to Harvard. "I had gone through three 
years of Harvard, and I enjoyed it," she said in an interview. "I think black 
students should go where they are comfortable and where they are challenged." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Tollett, a professor of higher education at Howard whom Malveaux 
consulted in preparing the thesis, said it confirms his view that black 
colleges provide a congenial setting that allows many black students "to move 
from isolation to the mainstream without the destructive and demeaning 
competition with whites." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Trial Period' 
</P>
<P>
For nearly all of the black students who make up about 7% of Harvard's 
undergraduates, there is a "trial period . . . of proving his-her 'blackness,' 
" Malveaux wrote. "Everyone wants to assert, in one way or another, 'I didn't 
lose it coming here. I didn't lose or give it up to be here. I didn't lose my 
black identity because I'm here at Harvard.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Howard, she said, students have an opposite concern: "How will I stand out 
in this crowd and make a name for myself?" 
</P>
<P>
Malveaux, 22, graduated from Centennial High School in Columbia. Her father, 
Floyd Malveaux, is a professor of medicine at Howard. This coming school year, 
she will be working and studying at the American University in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Malveaux said, what the transfer students most dislike about Howard 
are its administration and living conditions, but that is more than offset by 
positive feelings toward professors and students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polling the Students 
</P>
<P>
Richard Seltzer, a political science professor at Howard, said these findings 
are consistent with a poll of undergraduates he and his classes took several 
years ago. Last spring, criticism of the Howard administration and poor housing 
conditions were key points in the student protest that disrupted the university 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Glazer, a professor at Harvard who was one of the readers of Malveaux's 
thesis, said it "makes the case for black colleges that is the same argument 
made for single-sex schools. . . . They really are places where race or sex 
isn't an issue and students can develop themselves on some other basis." 
</P>
<P>
David Riesman, a Harvard sociologist who served as a thesis adviser to 
Malveaux, said that "one of the virtues of going to Howard is not being forced 
to fit into a mold . . . of what it means to be a black student, which may be 
sitting at the back of the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
The thesis said 55% of the students surveyed said they moved to the front of 
the classroom when they transferred to Howard, instead of sitting in the middle 
or rear. About 68% said they participated more in class discussions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Active Role 
</P>
<P>
Malveaux suggested that the students may take a more active part in class 
because Howard generally has smaller classes than those at the students' 
previous colleges. She said the students may also move forward because they 
have changed majors and are more interested in the subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
But she said the most frequent reason given was that the transfer students feel 
much more comfortable because they are "no longer . . . singled out as a 
minority." 
</P>
<P>
Malveaux said some of students said they felt like "quota fillers" at the 
predominantly white schools, admitted only to show affirmative action. But at 
Howard, she said, most felt proud to be "at home," and comfortable enough, with 
their own race a majority, to develop as individuals.

The final contingent of Cuban troops stationed in Ethiopia arrived in Havana 
aboard ship. The pullout of the 725 soldiers marked the end of the Cuban 
military presence in Ethiopia, which began in 1977 when the Marxist government 
was fighting a war with Somalia. Cuban troop strength in Ethiopia was at one 
time over 10,000. The returning soldiers were given special "internationalist" 
medals and promised preferential treatment in jobs.

The Bogota newspaper that was bombed last month in retaliation for its crusade 
against Colombia's drug lords may have to shut down, according to Luis Gabriel 
Cano, president of El Espectador. He said the 102-year-old, family-owned 
newspaper has begun losing money since the bombing. "If we don't receive some 
support, we cannot continue," added Cano, who is in Washington in part to seek 
support from news organizations. He said the car bomb that exploded near his 
offices Sept. 2 caused about $2.5 million in damage. With a circulation of 
about 200,000, El Espectador is the second-largest daily in Colombia.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOTH SIDES REST IN MCMARTIN TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecution and defense attorneys rested their cases Wednesday in the marathon 
McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, setting the stage for closing arguments 
to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who often expressed fear 
that the case would end in a mistrial, said he now expects the matter to be 
placed in the hands of jurors by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, now in its third year, is the longest criminal proceeding in U.S. 
history. At a cost of $15 million, it is the most expensive case ever tried in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Buckey 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 
64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy involving alleged 
molestations of 11 children at their family owned school. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which began in 1983, soon became the largest child molestation 
prosecution ever. Seven teachers at the prestigious McMartin Pre-School in 
Manhattan Beach were arrested, and it was alleged that hundreds of children had 
been molested over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges against five defendants were 
dropped by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who said there was insufficient evidence. 
The number of children allegedly involved also has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Since the trial began in April, 1987, the jury of 12 with six alternates has 
dwindled because of illness and employment problems. The last alternate was 
used recently to replace an ailing juror.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAID FOR MARRIAGE, RAPE SUSPECT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach postal clerk accused of raping a 10-year-old girl testified at his 
trial that he paid $9,000 to solidify an agreement to marry the girl in the 
future, but denied that he sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray to the God, if I do that (rape the girl), please kill me," the 
defendant Tom Yang, 33, testified through a translator this week in a trial 
before Superior Court Judge Sheila F. Pokras. 
</P>
<P>
Yang said that during an April 11 conversation he offered $5,000 to the girl's 
family for a promise of marriage when the girl turned 18. He said he scraped 
together $9,000 to give to the family after the girl's mother allegedly asked 
for twice the original offer. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's mother has said she accepted some money in exchange for the promise 
of marriage, as is customary in their home country of Laos, but she changed her 
mind and returned the money to Yang, who had rented a room in the family's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found $8,900 in cash in a laundry basket at the family's home 
after the alleged rape was reported by school officials. The incident allegedly 
took place April 15. 
</P>
<P>
The girl now says that she was not raped, but prosecutors are still pressing 
their case against Yang. 
</P>
<P>
Yang remains in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail. He could 
receive up to eight years in prison if convicted.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IBM GIVES COLLEGES, SCHOOLS $20 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IBM will give more than $20 million in equipment and technical support to 
expand the use of computers in teacher training at Cal State campuses and in 
classroom education at elementary and secondary schools throughout California, 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The gift announcement, which was made at a downtown Los Angeles news 
conference, also marked the formal start of a partnership between the Cal State 
system, the state Department of Education and the corporation to improve 
education, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The gift was described as the computer giant's largest single educational 
development donation ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have California be the leader in applying technology to learning 
and teaching," said IBM Western Area Vice President Ronald Kilpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year project will involve an estimated 2,200 IBM personal computers, 
various communications networks, new software and establishment of centers to 
train teachers in the use of technology in the classroom. Officials said they 
expect 12 Cal State campuses and 20 school districts to receive help. A 
committee from the company and the education systems will choose recipients 
soon.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 PRISONERS FLEE VAN DURING TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two prisoners escaped from California Youth Authority officers Wednesday after 
they had been driven from San Diego to a reception center in Norwalk, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the men were able to remove their leg shackles and handcuffs -- 
possibly by cutting them with a metal ash tray. They had been left in a van 
while the two officers who transferred them checked their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The escapees were identified as Tony McGee, 21, and Jake G. Encinas, 19, both 
of San Diego. McGee was serving a sentence for robbery and Encinas had been 
sentenced for auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
When the correctional officers returned to the van, the two men overpowered 
them and fled on foot. One resident near the facility found two jail uniforms 
on his living room floor. Another reported that clothes had been stolen from a 
clothesline, and two bicycles were taken from another home, police said.

COUNCIL OVERRIDES BRADLEY VETO OF BUILDING SLOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday overrode Mayor Tom Bradley's veto of 
a temporary moratorium on building in two pockets of the 10th Council District, 
prompting some city officials to predict chaos in the city's planning process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a planning fiasco for the future," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina after 
the vote. "It's not smart, but it talks to the desperation we all have." 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was proposed by 10th District Councilman Nate Holden last month 
when homeowners alerted him that developers were taking advantage of the 
several months required to approve an interim growth ordinance by rushing to 
demolish single-family homes and erect apartment buildings in the Pico-Fairfax 
and Wilshire-Crenshaw areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overrides Are Rare 
</P>
<P>
Molina was one of 10 council members to enact the ban over the mayor's rare 
veto. According to a Bradley aide, the council last overrode a Bradley veto on 
a non-budget item in 1986. The issue then was the reapportionment of council 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley vetoed the moratorium last month, saying it was illegal and a bad form 
of urban planning. The city attorney's office had not issued an opinion on 
whether the ban was legal when the emergency measure went to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by council members Wednesday, Assistant City Atty. Claudia McGee-Henry 
said it would be difficult to defend the city if the ban were implemented, but 
said it was not illegal per se. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium would automatically expire when a more detailed interim control 
ordinance, which already is in the works, is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Haste Was the Rule' 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's administrative assistant, Anton Calleia, said after the vote that the 
issue was whether to follow due process or whether "by leaning on the Planning 
Department, you can waive all the rules and go on and do it. . . . In this 
case, haste was the rule of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Holden, who unsuccessfully challenged Bradley for mayor in April, said the veto 
was a "pro-development" act by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to take the courage to stand against developers and protect the 
families who take pride in their neighborhoods and want to save their 
communities from being destroyed," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members suggested that the character of the neighborhoods added 
urgency to the question. Both are stable, integrated neighborhoods consisting 
mostly of single-family homes of relatively modest price. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate, however, several members took Director of Planning Kenneth 
Topping to task for allowing Holden to push the ban through in a week. When 
they faced similar concerns in their districts, Molina and others said, they 
were told they had to adhere to a more lengthy process of obtaining an interim 
control ordinance to manage development.

GATES SURE RECORD BUST WILL DRAW ANTI-DRUG RESOURCES TO SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates told the City Council on Wednesday that he is 
certain the federal government will increase its drug-fighting resources in the 
Los Angeles area in light of the discovery last week of nearly 19 tons of 
cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will begin to see a buildup of the DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration), the FBI, Customs and even an enhancement of the Coast Guard in 
this area," Gates told council members during a briefing on the Sept. 28 record 
drug seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said, however, that help may not come immediately and cautioned against 
expecting it at the expense of other significant narcotics distribution areas 
in the country, such as Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take resources from one area where they are doing a minimal 
job," he said, "and spread them so thinly that we're not doing a good job 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Seizure 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar seizure, which included more than $12 million in cash, is the 
largest anywhere, authorities said. Initially, the DEA said 20 tons was found 
stashed in the Sylmar warehouse, but after weighing the contraband the agency 
said the correct figure is just under 19 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and other local and state officials have said the large amount of drugs 
was evidence that Los Angeles has become one of the nation's major narcotics 
distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that seizure, members of California's congressional delegation and 
others had called on the federal government to immediately designate Los 
Angeles an official "high-intensity drug trafficking zone," making it eligible 
for federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said Wednesday that he will ask 
members of a House-Senate conference committee working out a national drug 
spending plan to hurriedly give the designation to Los Angeles, San Diego and 
the other border communities in California. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's move was identical to one by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) on Monday 
asking that the conferees compel the Bush Administration to name the areas as 
drug zones by Nov. 1. Under current law, the Administration has until February 
to make the designations. It has steadfastly refused to move up the date. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hamilton, a spokesman for Bush's drug policy czar, William Bennett, said 
last week there were no plans to send aid to Los Angeles immediately. "We 
believe we need to approach the question of high-intensity drug trafficking 
areas seriously, soberly, systematically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates told the City Council on Wednesday that he had talked to Bennett 
immediately after the Sylmar seizure and was left feeling confident that Los 
Angeles would eventually get the designation. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, DEA agents in Texas, using search warrants, raided five El Paso 
homes belonging to suspects in the case -- including that of Hector Tapia 
Anchondo, 38, son of Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68, of Juarez, the alleged leader of 
the cocaine-smuggling operation. Both men were arrested in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The search of Anchondo's home yielded what agents described as an inventory 
list documenting receipts for hundreds of kilos of cocaine in September. They 
also found a half pound of marijuana and a small handgun.

Paso, Tex., contributed to this story.

ACCREDITING AGENCY TEAM PAYS SURPRISE VISIT TO KING HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of medical investigators from the agency that accredits most of the 
nation's hospitals paid a surprise visit Wednesday to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center to review first-hand reports of widespread health care 
violations at the county-operated facility. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Chicago-based Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) said their four-member inspection team would 
survey reported breakdowns in the areas of nursing, dietary care, infection 
control, quality assurance and administration at King. If severe deficiencies 
are confirmed, the hospital could lose its accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
Federal health care officials have already threatened King with the loss of up 
to $60 million in public Medicare and Medi-Cal funding if the hospital does not 
correct all of its deficiencies by Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
JCAHO officials said the investigation was spurred by a series of articles in 
The Times detailing numerous problems in patient care and administration at the 
hospital and by a state health deparment report in which King was cited for 
massive health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The reports have raised doubts in our mind about the accreditation of the 
hospital," said Donald W. Avant, vice president of accreditation surveys for 
JCAHO. "We're trying to ensure that the hospital is still a credible 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Avant said the investigators would release their findings to the accreditation 
commission with a series of recommendations that could include placing the 
facility on six months' probation while it pursues a series of corrective 
measures. He said the agency, which accredits 80% of the nation's hospitals, 
would release its findings within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
The county has pledged to correct all of the problems at King in order to 
prevent the loss of the hospital's state license and millions in federal 
funding. County health officials are trying to turn the hospital around before 
the Dec. 21 fund cutoff deadline set by the U.S. Health Care Financing 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably if the hospital corrects those deficiencies to the satisfaction of 
the HCFA, it will be enough to also ensure accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
The unannounced 8 a.m. arrival of the inspection team follows the release 
Tuesday of a county health department report which acknowledged serious health 
care deficiencies at the 430-bed hospital in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is that they'll be here through Friday and that they're calling 
all the shots," said Sharon Wanglin, a spokeswoman with the county health 
department. "We are cooperating in every way possible and making as many people 
available to them as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The investigators met with Edward Renford, acting hospital administrator, and 
several other department heads Wednesday and planned to tour the facility 
during the next two days, Wanglin said. Dr. Adella DeLappe, head of the 
inspection team, said she could not disclose the team's findings at this point. 
</P>
<P>
State health inspectors spent two weeks at King in June spot-checking the 
hospital's entire operation after an analysis of Medicare patient deaths 
nationwide ranked King in the bottom 50 of 5,577 hospitals surveyed throughout 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major problems they cited in their report last month was a consistent 
shortage of registered nurses at King, resulting in unqualified nursing 
students and attendants providing "compromised care" to acutely ill patients. 
The investigators also found repeated failures by King's dietary staff to 
assess patients' nutritional requirements, overfilled and uncovered infectious 
waste containers, and poorly serviced medical equipment.

SDSU'S GENTLE BIG BEAR IS GOING HOME TO GROWL; 
</P>
<P>
SAGAPOLUTELE CATCHES FIRE AT DEFENSIVE TACKLE AFTER HIS AZTEC COACHES PUT A 
TORCH UNDER HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his 6-foot-5, 280-pound frame to his amicable manner to hands that are 
almost baby-soft, San Diego State defensive tackle Pio Sagapolutele appears the 
quintessential gentle giant. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, in full football gear, he towers above most other players. He is 
the one the other team would be least likely to tangle with if given a choice. 
</P>
<P>
Off the field and out of his uniform, Sagapolutele appears different. He still 
is as big and strong, but stripped of that equipment, his easy-going manner 
dominates. Substance over size. 
</P>
<P>
"His personalty is kind of a big old happy bear," said SDSU Coach Al Luginbill, 
whose description lacked only the name "Teddy." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is another side to Sagapolutele, one Luginbill particularly values as 
a football coach. This Sagapolutele is a different kind of bear. 
</P>
<P>
"That bear can be extremely aggressive and extremely mean when he cranks it 
down and gets after it," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Sagapolutele who took glee in sacking Utah quarterback Scott 
Mitchell twice last week. The same one who looks forward to causing more 
problems Saturday night when he returns home to Honolulu to play Hawaii and 
chase his former teammate at Marryknoll High School, quarterback Garrett 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows I'm going after him just like I did in high school," Sagapolutele 
said. "I used to cheap shot him all the time in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele allows a light, mischievous smile when he says this. Even when 
talking bad, Sagapolutele is acting good. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not the kind of football player that says a lot of stuff," Sagapolutele 
said. "I just go out and play the game. I do what I have to do. I usually take 
that first blow to see how weak or how strong my opponent is and then take off 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele's personality, combined with his physical ability, is what makes 
him a challenging project for Luginbill and his staff. Bringing out the grizzly 
in Sagapolutele on every down has not always been easy. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele has never been the most dedicated player. He had a reputation for 
giving less than his best in practice. Earlier in the season, Sagapolutele lost 
his starting job for two games after a poor showing in the opener against Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
After four games, Sagapolutele has eight tackles (four unassisted), one tackle 
for a loss and two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not close to where he could be," Luginbill said. "But he has gotten 
better and better each week, and that is all I can ask of him. He has unlimited 
potential. He could be one of the dominant big men in the country if he decides 
that is what he wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Great players have God-given talent, plus an intensity level that is so great 
you just can't block them out." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Sagapolutele is beginning to meet what is expected of him. This 
week, he has a shoulder bruise that might have limited him in practice, but 
instead, coaches are having trouble keeping him out. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a big change," said defensive line coach Ed Schmidt. "He doesn't try 
to get out of sprints or anything in practice anymore. He does what the rest of 
the team does, and he does it well." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is time. 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele, a junior, lost his freshman season because he failed to meet the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s freshman eligibility requirements. 
Circumstance then forced him into the starting lineup last year with little 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were desperate for help on defense, and Sagapolutele was their 
biggest lineman. Despite missing football his freshman year, Sagapolutele was 
starting by the third game. 
</P>
<P>
"We threw him in there because we didn't have anybody else," Schmidt said. "It 
was on-the-job training." 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele had to sit out his freshman season because he did not receive a 
high enough standardized test score to meet NCAA requirements. Luginbill said 
Sagapolutele had the most difficulty with the verbal section of the 
examination, and that trouble was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele (pronounced SAH-gah-POH-luh-tell-ee) was born on the American 
Samoan island of Ilile, the middle of 11 children. His family moved to Honolulu 
when he was an infant. Samoan was spoken in the home; English was a second 
language. 
</P>
<P>
When Sagapolutele was a senior in high school, his father was elected to 
succeed his grandfather as the family chief, and his parents moved back to 
Ilile. Sagapolutele remained in Honolulu with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
He has not seen his parents much since his father took over as chief of the 
family -- a group Sagapolutele estimates at about 2,000. His parents will be in 
Aloha Stadium Saturday night to see him play for the first time in college. 
</P>
<P>
But this game will have more than family pride at stake. The Warrior Rainbows 
(4-1, 2-1 in WAC) are tied for 20th in the United Press International poll with 
Florida State, their first Top 20 ranking since 1981. The Aztecs (1-2-1, 1-1) 
are coming off a 38-27 victory at Utah, their first under Luginbill, and have 
had reasonable success in Hawaii. SDSU has won two and tied two of its past 
five games in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be great to go back and see all my family again," Sagapolutele said. 
"I know there are a lot of Hawaii fans there, but a lot of my friends said they 
will be rooting for me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
For a time after last season, there was a question whether Sagapolutele would 
be making the trip back to Hawaii as an Aztec. 
</P>
<P>
He was upset by the firing of Denny Stolz as coach and the initial decision not 
to retain assistant Ulima Afoa. 
</P>
<P>
Afoa was the coach who recruited Sagapolutele out of high school, and 
Sagapolutele said the two had grown close because of their shared Samoan 
heritage. He considered transferring. 
</P>
<P>
Both said Afoa urged Sagapolutele to remain at SDSU, but it was not until Afoa 
was rehired by Luginbill about six weeks after he was originally let go that 
Sagapolutele said he was convinced to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't happy," Sagapolutele said. "I talked with the coaches at Washington. 
But I realized I would have to go out and prove myself all over again. Then 
when Coach Afoa got hired, I felt much better about the program. I decided I 
might as well finish my career at San Diego State." 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Sagapolutele has had to make some adjustments. Luginbill has 
demanded changes from his "big old happy bear." The transition has not always 
been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele was the first player to run afoul of Luginbill's edict against 
unnecessary penalties. 
</P>
<P>
When Sagapolutele was called for a personal foul late in the third quarter of a 
28-25 loss to UCLA Sept. 16, he was pulled from the game and confronted on the 
sideline by an angry Luginbill. The Bruins went on to score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to yell at me, but I walked away so he didn't get the chance," 
Sagapolutele said. "I thought I would be out for just one play." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Luginbill benched him for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That penalty hurt," Luginbill said. "He was totally dominating the line of 
scrimmage. They never did block him." 
</P>
<P>
Through that and other actions, Luginbill is making an impression. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made the point that if I don't go hard on every play, there is 
always somebody else behind me wanting to play," Sagapolutele said. "They have 
made me work extra hard to get back to No. 1. Now I realize what I have got to 
do. They have taken that point and driven it into my mind."

OPENER AT OAK TREE IS A DAY OF SURPRISES; 
</P>
<P>
MAIDEN PLEASANT TAP WINS FEATURE; AGIRLFROMARS EQUALS TURF RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Surprises were stacked on top of surprises on the opening day of the Oak Tree 
season at Santa Anita Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap, a maiden and the second-longest price on the board, won the 
featured Sunny Slope Stakes and before that, in the first race run on the 
track's new grass course, an unheralded filly matched the Santa Anita turf 
record for 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Agirlfromars, ridden for the first time by Robbie Davis in her 10th start, had 
gone seven races without a win and was on grass only once before. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit the 3-year-old California-bred only once with his whip as she won the 
third race by 1 1/2 lengths in a time of 1:45 2/5, which equaled the record 
that Crystal Water set in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first race on the turf since Santa Anita spent more than $3 
million on a grass course that is a combination of a Bermuda hybrid grass and a 
polypropylene mesh that reduces divots. It looks like a pool table on top, and 
apparently plays just as fast. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Looie Cenicola, who was John Henry's exercise rider, Agirlfromars 
broke out of her slump at Del Mar, winning against maidens going a mile on dirt 
and then beating allowance horses in a 6 1/2-length victory at 1 1/16 miles on 
the grass. 
</P>
<P>
The fractions for Wednesday's race were :22 2/5 for the first quarter, :48 3/5 
for a half-mile and a scorching 1:32 4/5 for the mile, which would have broken 
the course record by 1 4/5 seconds for that distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe we had gone 1:46 or 1:47, so when I looked up at the time, it 
was incredible," Davis said. "The temporary rail was out about 10 feet, so just 
think what she might have run if that hadn't been there. She didn't act like 
she was doing that much, she did it easy and under wraps almost all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is so tight that you could ride without goggles if you wanted. 
There'll be a lot of records set here. There's a spring to the track, and while 
certain horses might like it, it might be hard for other horses." 
</P>
<P>
Agirlfromars, which carried 117 pounds, paid $12.40 to win before a crowd of 
43,639 which bet $7.1 million, an opening-day record. The actual attendance was 
several thousand fewer because many fans went through the turnstiles more than 
once to collect some souvenir mugs. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Water, carrying 116 pounds, tied the world record when he registered 
1:45 2/5. The world record is held by Frosty the Snowman, who ran 1:44 4/5 at 
Woodbine in Toronto on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunny Slope for 2-year-olds, Pleasant Tap, giving Eddie Delahoussaye his 
third win of the day, rallied through the stretch to beat Grand Canyon by 
three-quarters of a length, and it was another four lengths back to 
Doyouseewhatisee in third place. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap, paying $26.80 to win, covered seven furlongs on dirt in 1:22 2/5, 
which was the fastest winning time for the stake in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon was coupled with Nevada in the betting and they went off 11-10 
favorites, with Nevada finishing last in the seven-horse field, just behind 
Express It, who was trying to make the lead at the quarter pole when his right 
rein snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap, a son of Pleasant Colony and Never Knock, a Stage Door Johnny 
mare, was bred and is owned by Thomas Mellon Evans, who collected $46,525 of 
the $80,275 purse. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap's only two previous starts came at Del Mar, where he was sixth and 
third and raced greenly. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 9, when he ran third, Pleasant Tap lost to Grand Canyon by 4 1/4 
lengths going six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Chris Speckert debated whether to run Pleasant Tap in another maiden 
race or in the Sunny Slope. "This horse comes from off the pace, and the way 
the track was playing, I thoughtt was worth a look," Speckert said. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye was back from a two-week vacation, during which time he rode only 
twice, one day winning the Molson Million at Woodbine with Prized. 
</P>
<P>
"This colt has improved, and if he keeps improving he'll be a nice colt," 
Delahoussaye said. "In the stretch, Chris (McCarron, riding Grand Canyon) had 
some horse left, but my horse just dug in and outdueled them."

BRUINS ADD BIT OF GREEN TO SECONDARY, MAKING CORNERBACK GRAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's young secondary got a little younger last week, when freshman Carlton 
Gray started at cornerback in the Bruins' 24-6 victory over California. 
</P>
<P>
A true freshman hadn't started for the Bruins since Jan. 1, 1985, when tailback 
Gaston Green opened in the Fiesta Bowl against Miami. And a true freshman 
hadn't started on defense for UCLA since 1983, when cornerback Chuckie Miller 
did it against Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, though, Gray is not like most freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligent and serious-minded, he finished fourth in his senior class of 198 
last spring at Forest Park High School in Cincinnati, earning better than a 
straight-A average while taking accelerated academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
And athletically, the 6-foot-2, 180-pound Gray is talented enough to draw 
interest from almost all the major college football powers, eventually deciding 
on UCLA after first announcing that he would sign with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
A grandson of Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, Gray won the Dial Award last spring as the 
nation's outstanding high school scholar-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, though, Gray is no different than any other freshman away from 
home for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks ago, in fact, he was so homesick that his mother, Patricia 
Hooks, believed that the youngest of her two sons might pack up and leave and 
show up on her doorstep at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he had that in the back of his mind," she said. "But I told him, 
'You've made a commitment. It's too early to decide to go someplace else.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since, Gray has moved up on the depth chart, making his debut as a 
reserve strong safety and nickel safety against San Diego State, then playing 
those same positions against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, his coaches moved him back to cornerback, which was the position he 
played in fall camp, and into the starting lineup ahead of Randy Beverly, who 
is hampered by a broken toe. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, 18, is expected to start again Saturday night at the Rose Bowl against 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"Football has really helped me get over the homesickness," Gray said. "Since 
I'm playing, I don't constantly think about being away from home." 
</P>
<P>
His mother has noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's settling in," she said. "I can tell the difference in his voice." 
</P>
<P>
Like most first-year Bruins, Gray expected to spend a year on the sidelines as 
a redshirt. Before this season, UCLA had used only four true freshmen in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries, suspensions and poor grades, however, have taken five defensive backs 
out of the Bruins' lineup, and Gray was the first freshman to step forward and 
show that he is ready to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
(Another freshman, Patrick Bates of Galveston, Tex., may start at strong safety 
Saturday night in place of sophomore Matt Darby, who is listed as doubtful 
after pinching a nerve in his neck last week.) 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rees, UCLA's recruiting coordinator, considered Gray one of the nation's 
top five defensive-back prospects last season, but he said that Gray has 
exceeded even the Bruins' high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been advanced in regard to his poise and his understanding of the 
coverages and what's expected of him," Rees said. "He's a very heady player for 
a guy so young. He's very bright, has very good instincts and anticipates very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Coyer (who coaches UCLA's defensive backs) calls it moxie. He says 
Carlton has a great deal of moxie." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a businessman and an elementary school teacher -- his father, 
divorced from his mother, owns a country-music radio station in Vevay, Ind. -- 
Gray also has a great deal of athletic talent. 
</P>
<P>
He was a multisport star at Forest Park, where he gained All-American 
recognition in football and basketball and ran on the school's state champion 
400-meter relay team. Depending on how he feels at the end of the season, he 
may play basketball at UCLA, too. Last November, Gray said, he seriously 
considered signing a letter of intent to play basketball at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
He ultimately chose football over basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt, in the long run, I'd have a better chance to play professionally 
in football than in basketball, because of the numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His goals at UCLA, in order of preference, are to earn a degree, win "not just 
one, but at least two national championships" and earn recognition not only as 
an All-American, but also as an academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he said, his loneliness affected his relationship with his new 
coaches and might have held him back. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't responsive," he said. "I wasn't talking back or anything, but I was 
moping around." 
</P>
<P>
His high school coach, Lou Cynkar, who considers Gray a close friend, said of 
his former student: "Unless you know him well, he stays kind of locked up in a 
shell. He can be funny -- he can be a kid -- but he's a serious kid." 
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, though, Gray has started to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's a little surprised to be playing so much so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest strength is that I've been able to pick up the system and been able 
to recognize formations," he said. "Of course, that comes through help from 
Eric Turner and Matt Darby and Dion Lambert (his teammates in UCLA's 
secondary). They constantly talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
So does his mother, who arrives tonight for a weekend visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've built up a pretty big phone bill," Gray admitted. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a short time, a pretty good reputation, too.

A tree trunk and a sloping green helped England's Wendy Russell make golf 
history with two holes-in-one during the opening round of the British Women's 
Seniors Championship Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Russell aced the 127-yard fourth hole at the Wrexham Golf Club when her tee 
shot, a seven-iron, struck a tree to the left of the green, ricocheted onto the 
putting surface and dropped into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
At the 118-yard eighth hole, Russell sent an eight-iron toward the right of the 
green, hoping to catch the top of a bank and have the ball roll toward the 
hole. She placed the shot perfectly and the ball slid into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite numb," said Russell, who finished with a seven-over-par 78. 
</P>
<P>
Rounds with twin aces are rare, and officials said the feat had never been 
accomplished in a top-level British event.

Free-agent forward A.C. Green is expected to show up by Friday, when the Lakers 
open training camp in preparation for the National Basketball Assn. season. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Fleisher, Green's agent, said Wednesday that contract agreement is so 
close that Green is expected to fly to Hawaii perhaps in time for a team 
meeting tonight. Green is bringing a copy of the contract with him, Laker 
General Manager Jerry West said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers reportedly have offered Green, the club's starting power forward the 
last three seasons, a multiyear contract worth more than $1.3 million a season.

National Basketball Assn. owners agreed to adopt a rule that would give the 
lottery teams with the poorest records a better chance to draft higher. 
</P>
<P>
The new setup will give the team with the worst record of the 11 teams a 
one-in-six chance at the top pick, while the team with the best record chances 
will be one in 66. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA Board of Governors also accepted a proposal for stricter enforcement of

NEWSWIRE: NCAA GROUP MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Presidents' Commission will 
seek to reduce the college basketball season by almost a month, amend freshmen 
academic requirements to make scholarship money available to those from poor 
backgrounds, and force schools to disclose athletes' graduation rates, chairman 
Martin Massengale said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"My belief is these measures will pass at the NCAA convention in January," said 
Massengale, chancellor at the University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Massengale conceded that the presidents are certain to face stiff opposition on 
reducing the basketball season. Besides recommending that the season start 
almost a month later, the commission will sponsor legislation to reduce the 
number of games a school can play each season from 28 to 25, not including 
postseason tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced schedule would include men's and women's basketball and take effect 
in 1991. Currently, practice starts Oct. 15 and competition can begin the 
fourth Friday in November. Under the new proposal, practice will start Nov. 15 
and the regular season will not begin until Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
One argument against the reduced schedule is expected to center on finances. 
Many schools could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in television and gate 
revenue if three games are removed from the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-New Jersey) is proposing legislation that would force 
federally funded institutions to report graduation percentages of scholarship 
athletes. NCAA officials have asked Congress to allow them to devise their own 
plan.

OWNERS OF FAILED RAMONA S&amp;L GUILTY OF FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
CASE SHOWS JURIES CAN UNDERSTAND COMPLEX TRIALS, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the first criminal trial of owners of a failed savings and loan in Southern 
California, a federal jury on Wednesday found two men guilty of bank fraud and 
conspiracy in connection with the 1986 collapse of Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury loudly and clearly sent a message that the public will not tolerate 
looting and stealing of depositors' money by those who own and operate a 
savings and loan association," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein, 
who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Donald P. Mangano Sr., 52, was found guilty on 31 charges of bank fraud and 
conspiracy. His partner, John L. Molinaro, 48, was found guilty on all those 
charges plus two more of causing false entries to be put into Ramona's books. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 13. Molinaro faces up to 165 years in prison 
and $8.3 million in fines. Mangano could receive a 155-year sentence and $7.8 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
"To say the least, it's been a nightmare and quite an education," Mangano said 
after the verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Appeal 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys for Molinaro and Mangano said they would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
During the 11-week trial, the defense argued that Ramona's failure was the 
result of lax federal regulations and not a conspiracy by Molinaro and Mangano 
to rob the institution. They noted that banking laws in the early 1980s were 
changed to encourage thrift owners to invest up to 100% of their assets in real 
estate so they could earn a better return on depositors' money. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reasons the two defendants are in court is because of the failing 
policies of the Federal Home Loan Bank," said Gerald V. Scotti, Molinaro's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which encompassed 350 exhibits of evidence and 35 witnesses, 
illustrated how exacting prosecutors must be to win convictions in those 
complicated thrift fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials have worried that juries might be unable to follow the 
complex transactions surrounding such fraud. For example, a six-month trial of 
the allegedly fraudulent transactions surrounding Dallas-based Empire Savings 
&amp; Loan's collapse recently resulted in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors took encouragement from Wednesday's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro and Mangano bought Ramona and its $55 million in assets for $4 million 
in April, 1984. The thrift was taken over by regulators in September, 1986, and 
subsequently required a $65.5-million bailout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Followed Industry Trend 
</P>
<P>
As was the case with many failed savings and loans, Molinaro and Mangano had no 
experience running a financial institution before buying Ramona. Mangano was a 
real estate developer and Molinaro was a former carpet salesman. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners followed an industry trend by changing the institution's 
business plan from writing single-family home mortgages to riskier real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators alleged in a civil suit filed shortly after Ramona's 
collapse that the two men systematically drained the 57-year-old institution of 
its assets through a series of complicated schemes, including a disastrous 
condominium project in Palm Springs called Cherokee Village. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal trial focused almost exclusively on Cherokee Village, which was 
built with $25 million -- or a quarter of the thrift's assets -- by Mangano's 
construction company. 
</P>
<P>
But Cherokee Village was a flop -- only seven of the 180 condominiums had sold 
by the summer of 1985. So Molinaro and Mangano devised a scheme, prosecutors 
said, to rid themselves of Ramona and its biggest liability -- Cherokee Village 
-- while making a handsome profit at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
They set up several dummy corporations with the help of three friends and then 
sold Cherokee Village to those companies to get the project off Ramona's books, 
prosecutors said. The idea was to make Ramona look healthy to regulators and a 
potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano then became the owner of the corporations and therefore Cherokee 
Village. Once the two men found a buyer, they transferred Cherokee Village back 
to Ramona, depicted in its records as 23 acres of vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona booked a $4-million profit on the bogus deal. Molinaro took a $2-million 
dividend based on the profit. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys told jurors the Cherokee Village transaction was legitimate 
and was done for tax reasons and to protect Mangano's credit worthiness in the 
event the project went belly up. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months after Ramona was seized, Molinaro was arrested in San Francisco 
when he tried to use the birth certificate of a dead man to obtain a passport. 
The FBI searched a bag Molinaro was carrying and found numerous business cards 
from the Cayman Islands, bank records and travel brochures on Eastern Europe 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators also found a notebook containing a handwritten list of at 
least 60 personal reminders such as "consider bouncing (money) on-shore, then 
off-shore again." 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro pleaded guilty to passport fraud and served nearly two years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obviously Pleased' 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has recovered $3 million from accounts Molinaro set up 
in the Caribbean. Molinaro said the accounts contained his personal savings but 
regulators said the money was from Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
Pretrial motions in the civil suit, which seeks the $65 million it cost the 
federal government to shut down Ramona and pay off depositors, are scheduled to 
be heard in December in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we are pleased with the verdict," said Mark Lee, an attorney 
representing regulators involved in the civil case. "If it has an effect on the 
civil trial, it will be a positive one."

SAY GOODBY TO BULLOCKS WILSHIRE; 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW OWNER WILL PUT THE I. MAGNIN NAME ON THE VENERABLE CHAIN OF ELEGANT 
FASHION STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bullocks Wilshire, the stately, 70-year-old specialty fashion chain with the 
landmark Art Deco flagship store in Los Angeles' Mid-Wilshire district, will be 
renamed I. Magnin on Feb. 1, owner R. H. Macy &amp; Co. said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1928 Bullocks Wilshire building, which is listed in the 
National Register of Historic Places, will undergo a multimillion-dollar 
restoration beginning next spring. The store will be known as I. 
Magnin/Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's, which bought I. Magnin and Bullocks Wilshire along with the Bullock's 
department stores in May, 1988, emphasized in a prepared statement that the 
Bullock's name "will not be changed, nor is there any intent to do so in the 
future." In the past, the big New York retailer has put the Macy's moniker on 
other regional chains it has purchased in the Northeast and Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's also said it plans to sell the Bullock's headquarters building in 
downtown Los Angeles and convert the I. Magnin store near the main Bullocks 
Wilshire to office space to house Bullock's corporate employees. All employees 
of that I. Magnin store will be offered positions at other I. Magnin locations, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Merchandise Overlap 
</P>
<P>
Rose Marie Bravo, the 38-year-old chairman and chief executive of I. Magnin and 
Bullocks Wilshire, said in a telephone interview that the name change was 
logical from a marketing point of view. "It just strengthens us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that about 85% of the merchandise bought for Magnin and Bullocks 
Wilshire is identical, up from perhaps 60% when the chains were part of 
Federated Department Stores. Although the stores both cater to upscale 
clientele, Bullocks Wilshire customers have traditionally been older and less 
trendy than I. Magnin's. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Macy's bought the chains, it put them under the same San 
Francisco-based management team. Industry sources say Magnin and Bullocks 
Wilshire have combined annual sales of more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been really streamlining and trying to get the best of what both 
franchises have to offer," Bravo said. For example, she noted that the Magnin 
team admired Bullocks Wilshire's strong men's business and began incorporating 
those merchandising techniques at I. Magnin stores. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bullocks Wilshire opened a boutique featuring Yves St. Laurent's 
Rive Gauche clothing for women because of I. Magnin's success with that line. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo said the company has had good luck with contemporary fashions at Bullocks 
Wilshire that "are not something you would normally think of as (appealing to) 
the core patrons at Wilshire." 
</P>
<P>
"The more contemporary, the more advanced, the better we did with it at 
Wilshire," she said. "That gave us confidence that there was more alike in 
these two companies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance of Name 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bullock's and Magnin have been closely linked since 1944, when 
Bullock's acquired the highly regarded fashion chain. Magnin operated as a 
subsidiary or a division until 1964, the year Bullock's was merged into 
Federated Department Stores. Later, Magnin was made a separate division of 
Federated. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo speculated that a name change will have little effect on customers. 
</P>
<P>
"People come to a store because they love the store, they love the people and 
the merchandise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Farmer, a retail consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., agreed that the name has 
less to do with a store's success than some might think. 
</P>
<P>
"They can name it Who Tied the Pup or Genghis Khan Emporium if they merchandise 
it beautifully," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Retail industry observers had speculated that a name change might be in the 
offing for Bullocks Wilshire. Since last spring, the two upscale specialty 
fashion stores have been doing some joint newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
With 23 stores, I. Magnin is better known nationally than Bullocks Wilshire, 
which has only seven stores, all in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
I. Magnin, founded in San Francisco in 1876 by Mary Ann and Isaac Magnin, has 
17 stores in California, three in Chicago, one in Washington, one in Seattle 
and one in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Allen I. Questrom, former chairman of Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire and now 
president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus in Dallas, said Wednesday that 
he thinks the name change "is a good idea. There has always been somewhat of a 
confusion between Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's. . . . It makes sense from 
the point of view of clarity" both for customers and for Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears of Change 
</P>
<P>
But at the flagship store, the planned name change drew mixed reviews from 
noon-hour customers resting on benches at the main entrance off the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't do this to me," said Sophie Schiller, a Beverly Hills resident 
who has driven often to the main Bullocks Wilshire store over the last 35 
years. "I really don't like I. Magnin because they don't have anything for 
people over 50." 
</P>
<P>
Madelyn Keith of Los Angeles feared that the Bullocks Wilshire stores would 
change. "I'd rather have Bullocks Wilshire. I hate to see that. It won't be the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Sorkin, shopping for perfume with his wife, was more sanguine. "It's 
just one name replacing another," he said.

EQUITY FUNDS LEAD PACK, BOND GROUPS LAG IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>

Mutual fund investors who stuck it out in some of the riskier segments of the 
stock market reaped the biggest rewards in the third quarter. But those 
investing in junk got junky returns. 
</P>
<P>
The top-performing funds and fund groups in the period ended Sept. 30 were 
those investing in international, growth, and health and technology stocks, 
according to the latest survey of fund performance released Wednesday by Lipper 
Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, bond funds lagged, with those investing in high-yield junk 
bonds among the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"Income was not as desirable as growth in this quarter," said A. Michael 
Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, general equity funds on average posted a 9.21% gain in the quarter. 
That was lower than the gains of 10.70% and 11.54%, respectively, for Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial index, with dividends 
reinvested. But it was far better than the average 3% quarterly rise for equity 
funds during the past 10 years, Lipper said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was just a good solid quarter for equity funds, a quarter that investors 
can be very happy with," said Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a 
Chicago firm that tracks mutual fund performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash Hoards a Drag 
</P>
<P>
The strong performance of equity funds was not surprising, given that all major 
stock indexes, including the Dow and S&amp;P 500, set all-time highs during the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Equity funds under-performed the S&amp;P 500 and Dow in part because fund 
managers -- fearing a possible correction -- held high cash positions. Those 
cash hoards dragged down the funds' performance relative to the market indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Health and biotechnology funds were the most impressive group, with a 16.68% 
average gain for the quarter. International funds, aided by strong overseas 
stock markets, came in second with a 13.79% average gain. They were followed by 
global funds that invest in U.S. and overseas stocks (up 11.65%), science and 
technology funds (up 10.29%) and growth funds that invest in companies with 
strong earnings prospects (up 10.03%). 
</P>
<P>
The top individual fund, up 30.64%, was Merrill Lynch Pacific A, a consistently 
strong performer that also ranked No. 2 for the past five years. The fund -- 
which searches for undervalued stocks in Asian markets, particularly in Japan 
-- was aided by gains of about 50% for each of its three top holdings, Fuji 
Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, Nichido Fire &amp; Marine Insurance and Dai-Tokyo 
Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, said portfolio manager Stephen I. Silverman. Each 
outperformed the Japanese stock market, which in turn outperformed the U.S. 
market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We still think each is worth much more than they're selling for," Silverman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magellan Tops S&amp;P 500 
</P>
<P>
(The Merrill Lynch Pacific B fund, whose portfolio is identical to the A fund, 
ranked second with a 30.40% gain. The B version charges an annual sales and 
marketing fee instead of a one-time sales charge, hence its lower annual 
return.) 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter was also another good period for industry superstar Peter 
Lynch, whose Fidelity Magellan fund again beat the market averages with a 
13.16% gain -- despite its lack of flexibility through being the nation's 
largest stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just incredible that he (Lynch) keeps outperforming on such a consistent 
basis," analyst Mansueto said. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan was the only one of the 10 largest stock funds to beat the S&amp;P 
500. The second-biggest fund, Windsor, rose 8.54%, followed in size order by 
Fidelity Equity Income (up 6.49%), Investment Co. of America (10.24%), Fidelity 
Puritan (5.06%), Templeton World (10.20%), Pioneer II (7.37%), Affiliated 
(8.00%), Washington Mutual Investors (9.43%) and Mutual Shares (5.76%). 
</P>
<P>
The worst-performing group was fixed-income funds, posting a measly 0.56% gain. 
These funds, which invest in bonds, were hurt by rising interest rates that 
depressed prices of long-term bonds. The group also was dragged down by 
declines in junk bond funds, ravaged by defaults that sunk the value of junk 
issues, wiping out some or all of their high yields. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the quarter's worst-performing individual funds were junk bond funds, 
led by First Investors Bond Appreciation, which tumbled 7.99%. 
</P>
<P>
What should investors do? 
</P>
<P>
Many experts urge conservative investors to be wary of jumping headlong into 
the quarter's top-performing groups. They are by nature volatile and could 
easily be among the laggards in the current fourth quarter, Lipper said. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is up so strongly this year that a flat quarter would be fine and 
you'd still have a positive year," Mansueto added. "Investors should be very 
satisfied with their gains this year and not get greedy and hope for more."

SEIDMAN SAYS S&amp;L CLOSURE COSTS MAY EXCEED $50 BILLION 
</P>

<P>
L. William Seidman, the government official overseeing the rescue of the 
federal savings and loan insurance fund, said Wednesday that Congress may need 
to spend more than the $50 billion it approved in August to help close 
insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., also predicted that 
it will take a work force of at least 5,000 people to help manage the assets 
seized from failing institutions. Seidman is also chairman of the Resolution 
Trust Corp., the government agency created to handle defunct S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The government is on the verge of closing or selling five large, financially 
crippled S&amp;Ls, a step that will consume about $10 billion of the $50 
billion, Seidman told the Senate Banking Committee. And hundreds of other 
S&amp;Ls may be taken over during the next three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Congress should expect the spending total to rise, Seidman replied, "I 
have no way to know for sure." He said he did not know how many assets will 
wind up in the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also told the committee that the 
rescue price tag is highly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't know exactly whether $50 billion is, or is not adequate," Greenspan 
said. "We do know the federal government is obligated to clean up this mess. 
(We) will do what has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Is Flexible 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the spending figure is not as 
important as Congress' determination to restore public confidence in the 
savings and loan system. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we need $52 billion, maybe we need $48 billion," Brady told the 
committee. "The point is, we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point 
where it is embers." 
</P>
<P>
The $50 billion, approved by Congress as part of this year's S&amp;L bailout 
legislation, represents the cash available to help close or sell crippled 
institutions over the next three years. Some of the funds will be used to pay 
off depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, federal officials may decide to close ailing S&amp;Ls and pay 
off all their insured depositors. In others, it might sell troubled S&amp;Ls to 
healthy financial institutions, with the government keeping the problem assets, 
such as condominiums and shopping centers that were foreclosed when developers 
could not make payments on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 billion will come from the sale of bonds. The ultimate price tag for 
restoring the S&amp;L insurance fund, including interest payments on the 
30-year bonds and premiums collected from the S&amp;L industry, has been 
estimated at nearly $300 billion. It may take the government years to sell the 
assets of the failed S&amp;Ls. Meanwhile, cash will be needed to handle new 
S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp. may be forced to acquire $100 billion in 
hard-to-sell assets from failing S&amp;Ls before these institutions can be 
sold, Seidman noted. "In effect, the RTC must buy, then collect, on these 
illiquid assets," he said. "This ties up the RTC's cash very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
While waiting to sell off the foreclosed real estate and other assets, the RTC 
would still be responsible for handling any new failures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top Financial Institution 
</P>
<P>
The RTC, which is operated by personnel on loan from Seidman's Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., has seized 283 failed S&amp;Ls with $112 billion in assets. It 
has closed 24 small S&amp;Ls and expects to complete the sale of the five big 
institutions by next week. Seidman would not identify the five. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 additional failures are expected during the next three years, 
according to Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp. will become the nation's biggest financial 
institution, the reluctant owner of billions of dollars of seized properties 
and assets of uncertain value. As a result, Seidman said, it will need at least 
5,000 employees and possibly "many more" to manage and dispose of the vast 
portfolio of properties and investments. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC decisions "will be felt in the capital markets and real estate markets 
throughout the country," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of 
the Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeowners and investors are worried about potential dumping that could 
adversely affect property values," Riegle said. Because so much money and 
property is under the RTC's control, vast potential exists for corruption and 
scandal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Brady, a member of the oversight board that will set policy 
and watch over the RTC, said the panel "is as anxious as this committee to 
protect against conflicts of interest, political favoritism and other improper 
actions by employees, agents, independent contractors and all others."

BAKER REJECTS SOVIET BID TO JOIN GLOBAL GROUPS 
</P>

<P>
The United States rejects membership by the Soviet Union in international trade 
and financial organizations because the Soviet economy remains "significantly 
incompatible" with Western institutions, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The former treasury secretary, issuing the most comprehensive prescription for 
change in the chaotic Soviet economy, challenged Moscow to institute six 
reforms to move the Soviet Union from its "socialist market" system toward the 
freer markets of the West. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's remarks at a Senate Finance Committee hearing were the first public 
statements on the subject by a senior U.S. official since Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said last month that Moscow "would like to 
participate actively in the work of the international economic organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union has not formally asked to join, Shevardnadze said it 
wants to "establish contacts" with the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank and to cooperate with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the international financial institutions would mark a major step 
in making the Soviet Union a full-fledged partner in global economic 
policy-making, providing prestige as well as technical advice, loans and access 
to worldwide markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Ease Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Baker reiterated that the United States hopes that Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will succeed in his efforts to restructure Soviet political, economic 
and social systems. But he warned that the collective leadership under 
Gorbachev is finding it "exceedingly difficult" to develop a comprehensive and 
coherent program of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Kremlin is run by "utilitarian, purposeful and determined men" 
who are "not pursuing freedom for freedom's sake," Baker said. While their goal 
is to modernize the Soviet Union, they will not necessarily adopt Western 
values even if their reforms are successful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing Moscow into world financial institutions prematurely, Baker said, 
could reduce pressure for the perestroika reforms to be carried through and 
cause difficulties within the affected organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet economic system remains significantly incompatible with the 
operation of institutions like the GATT, the IMF and the World Bank," Baker 
said. "Furthermore, given the size of the Soviet Union, its membership could 
prove disruptive . . . especially if the long-term Soviet commitment to the 
values represented by those institutions remains uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
The interests of both the United States and the Soviet Union are best served 
"by insisting that trade and other economic relations be conducted on a 
commercial basis," Baker said. "Operating under these terms, we welcome 
mutually beneficial, nonstrategic trade." 
</P>
<P>
Baker listed six changes that the Soviet Union should undertake before it 
increases its international economic involvement: price reform, stabilizing the 
ruble, freer competition among Soviet enterprises, property rights, taxation 
and regulation, and social welfare.

WEST GERMANY MAY HIKE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FRANKFURT, West Germany

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West German interest rates appear set to rise today and, however reluctantly, 
much of the rest of Western Europe may have to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
A general upturn in European interest rates would diminish the attractiveness 
of U.S. dollar-linked investments. 
</P>
<P>
Markets have rarely been so well-primed for a rate rise, widely expected after 
today's meeting of the policy-making council of the Bundesbank, West Germany's 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predict a rise of a half to a full percentage point in the 
Bundesbank's discount and Lombard rates, currently at 5% and 7% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries will have to match any move by the powerful West German bank, 
European bankers and officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"European monetary policy is, for all practical purposes, decided in 
Frankfurt," a senior West German banker said, touching a raw nerve in European 
economic policy relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they want to or not, the others are going to have to join in," a 
Frankfurt-based economist added. 
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank's latest economic report said West German interest rates were 
relatively low, and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has been wondering out 
loud if interest rate levels were consistent with the pace of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation is now just over 3%, but the Bundesbank worries that prices could 
start rising more quickly with the economy surging and industrial capacity 
stretched. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany has often drawn fire from its European partners, who charge that 
the Bundesbank is obsessed with inflation and dictates monetary policy in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
France, which steadfastly rules out a depreciation of its franc against the 
West German mark, would also probably raise rates.

Some Lockheed Debt Ratings Reduced: The investment rating firm of Standard 
&amp; Poor's downgraded its rating of Lockheed's senior debt and preliminary 
shelf-registered debt to A from A plus. S&amp;P blamed the reductions on 
Lockheed's "weakened earnings prospects in a difficult defense procurement 
environment." It cited Lockheed's disclosure this week that it would report a 
$35-million third-quarter loss. S&amp;P asserted that the tight defense market 
would make it difficult for the company to compensate for the loss in earnings 
on the C-5B plane program.

U.S. VEHICLE SALES RISE 8.7% IN LATE SEPTEMBER

<P>
Late-September sales of North American-made cars and light trucks rose 8.7%, 
based on strong sales of General Motors Corp. trucks, as the auto industry 
Wednesday posted what appeared to be its fifth-best model year. 
</P>
<P>
For the 12-month model year ended Sept. 30, domestic and overseas auto makers 
reported selling vehicles at a daily rate of 48,669, down 1.9% from the rate of 
49,603 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Big Three, Ford Motor Co. led car-sale increases over the 1988 model 
year, with a 3.2% rise. GM's car sales were off 1.8% and Chrysler Corp.'s were 
down 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
On the truck side, GM led the model-year charge with sales 6.1% ahead of last 
year. Chrysler's light truck sales were up 1.6% while Ford's were down 1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 model year was the third-best on record, with about 15.6 million cars 
and trucks sold. It's expected that after heavy truck sales figures are 
compiled in several weeks, sales for the 1989 model year will total about 15.4 
million, just under the 15.5 million vehicles sold during 1987, the fourth-best 
model year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Expectations 
</P>
<P>
The best model year in history was 1986, when 16.1 million vehicles were 
purchased. During the past five model years, more than 78 million vehicles have 
been sold in the United States, enough for one new car or truck for every 3.2 
people in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 model year started off with some dire predictions. Analysts forecast a 
souring economy and said the vehicle market appeared nearly saturated. 
</P>
<P>
But cars and trucks continued to roll off assembly lines and into owners' 
driveways. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts persist in saying a dark cloud is looming. There's been concern 
that a spurt of buying in the late summer may have been fueled by concerns 
about price increases on 1990 models -- and that those increases wouldn't be 
softened by buyer incentives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Incentives 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Big Three already has offered incentives on a limited number of 
1990 vehicles. But they are not being offered to consumers at the same level as 
were rebates and low-interest financing deals three or four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, some widespread dealer incentives are in effect, especially at GM.

SKINNER WANTS EARLY ROLE IN AIRLINE DEALS

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Wednesday that he would like 
legal authority to judge airline takeovers before any deal was made but did not 
want a law to narrowly define the terms of acceptable takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Senate aviation subcommittee that he would have preferred to have 
been involved in the Northwest Airlines takeover earlier so he could have 
warned its new owner against giving the Dutch airline KLM such a big stake. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner last Friday approved a takeover of Northwest by Los Angeles financier 
Alfred A. Checchi, but only if KLM's equity were cut to 25% from 57% and the 
Dutch airline's power on the Northwest board were restricted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Considered 
</P>
<P>
He said it would have been simpler had there been a law to enable the 
government to judge prospective leveraged airline takeovers earlier in the 
transaction, adding, "Now we had to move to unwind the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner has expressed concern that airlines with big debts from leveraged 
buyouts might scrimp on safety. He is also concerned about violations of the 
law that bans foreigners from controlling U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Senate and House subcommittees are considering legislation on leveraged buyouts 
and foreign control of U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department cannot block airline mergers outright but does 
have broad authority to issue or revoke an airline's certificates to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said concern about airline 
buyouts and foreign investment is ill-placed and said the government must allow 
airlines freedom to finance such deals. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Airport Operators Council International in Houston, Lorenzo 
said, "I hope we can ease our fears of foreign capital as well as leveraged 
buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of foreign capital, critics fail to consider that the investment 
of foreign equity is reducing the use of debt financing in leveraged buyouts," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Skirt Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said that while a statute enabling him to enter into takeover proposals 
earlier would help him, he did not want narrowly defined takeover guidelines 
written into law. 
</P>
<P>
He said lawyers could find ways to get around the guidelines and said he 
preferred to judge takeovers -- including the planned sale of United Airlines 
to its management and pilots with the backing of British Airways -- on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said his department was working on a broad policy for takeovers, but 
added: "I'm satisfied we're staying ahead on what's going on in the airline 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if foreign countries permitted U.S. ownership, Skinner said that with the 
exception of state-owned airlines, they permitted about the same degree of 
foreign ownership as does U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the House aviation subcommittee about the United deal, John 
Peterpaul, vice president of the International Machinists and Aerospace Workers 
union, said the union has decided against joining the leveraged employee 
buyout, at least as the deal is presently structured. He said the $6.75-billion 
transaction would put the airline too deeply in debt.

HAWAIIAN AIRLINES' UNIONS TO VOTE ON 5-YEAR CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach investor group bidding for ailing Hawaiian Airlines said 
Wednesday that it has reached tentative agreement with all of the carrier's 
unions on new five-year contracts that call for wage freezes in the first 36 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the contracts by the carrier's pilots, flight attendants, 
machinists and other union workers in votes scheduled for this week would clear 
the way for the completion of the sale of HAL Inc., the airline's holding 
company. The buyer is a group headed by attorney J. Thomas Talbot and former 
baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout, which calls for the payment of $22 a share for at least 51% of the 
airline holding company's stock -- at a total cost of $22 million -- is 
contingent on the unions agreeing to wage and working-condition concessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holder Approval Needed 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, Talbot said in a telephone interview, outside shareholders 
have tendered 233,000 shares, and the HAL board has agreed to sell 1.1 million 
shares to his group, HAL Acquisition Inc, giving it control of 68% of the 
holding company's 1,953,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
A subsidiary of Japan Air Lines holds a 20% stake in HAL through the purchase 
last year of a large block of preferred stock. The Talbot group has not said 
whether it will also try to acquire those shares. At $22 a share, buying all 
outstanding shares would cost $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition also is contingent on the Talbot group securing financing and 
on the approval of existing HAL shareholders. The holders are scheduled to meet 
Oct. 23. Talbot declined to discuss the financing arrangements but said they 
are expected to be in place Friday after the unions vote. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the union ratification votes on the new contracts, HAL 
Acquisition has extended the deadline for its tender offer until midnight 
Tuesday, and Talbot said the deadline is likely to be extended through Oct. 23 
if the unions accept the agreements.

ASK THE VET: GIVE YOUR CATS TIME TO FEEL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. We share our home with three indoor/outdoor cats. They have easy access to 
the house through a cat door. We are planning a move sometime in October and 
are very concerned about how to move these cats and what to do with them once 
we are in our new home. I'm afraid to let them go out in fear they may not find 
our new home again. They are not accustomed to a litter box.-Madeline 
Contract,Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
A. Moving pets to a new home will require some planning on your part to prepare 
your cats for a big change in their lives. You should start to train them to a 
litter box by confining them indoors more often, even if it means confining 
them to a room where they are fed and a litter box is available. This way, they 
will be ready for a limited indoor restriction when you get to your new home. 
It may take one or two weeks of patience, but it will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
When you arrive in your new home, keep the cats indoors, maybe even restricted 
mostly to a room with a box and their food. Allow them some time to explore 
their new home without a lot of distraction. This way they will get used to the 
new scents in the house and become familiar with where everything is located. 
After they are accustomed to the new surroundings and all the local sounds, you 
might let them outside in the back yard while you are present. Leave a door 
open as an escape route back into the house. Go and do your yard work while 
they are outside with you, letting them adapt. Once they feel comfortable, you 
might try letting them go out by themselves, but leave an opening back into the 
house. Soon they will feel just as comfortable as they did in their old home 
and will give you no cause for concern. You might check with neighbors who have 
pets to make sure that there are no local problems with pets being outside or 
if there is a neighbor who objects to cats being in his yard. I'm sure they 
will enjoy their new home. 
</P>
<P>
You should talk to your veterinarian to see if sedatives will be necessary for 
the move. It will depend on the type of transportation and the length of the 
trip. Most cats settle down in a car once they have been on the road for an 
hour or so. Do keep them in a carrier to prevent any accidental escapes.

FAMILY LIFE: BREAKING A TRADITION OF CHILD, SPOUSAL, DRUG ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most repeat offenders at Orange County Jail are there as a result of what are 
called "family crisis situations" -- a Sheriff's Department euphemism for child 
abuse, spousal abuse, child endangerment and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
They are people, male and female, who live in a revolving door. They batter 
each other or their children, are convicted and sentenced, serve their time -- 
then go out and do it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pattern they learned very early in their lives because it was the way 
their parents lived. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was that the parents probably weren't jailed for it," says 
Larry Bartosiewski, 42, correctional programs supervisor at the jail, "and one 
of their biggest problems is understanding why they are being jailed for it." 
</P>
<P>
To "enlighten them," as Bartosiewski says, the jail is offering parenting 
classes through Rancho Santiago College, taught by trained family therapists. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, he says, is "to show them some alternatives (to abuse), to show them 
what is and what is not acceptable behavior and to inhibit their potential for 
coming back. The frosting on the cake, of course, is that if we're successful, 
we're also saving some children out there from future harm or even death." 
</P>
<P>
Bartosiewski says one of the first messages instructors must impart to the 
inmates is that while their actions are wrong, they don't make them "bad people 
. . . or their parents bad people." 
</P>
<P>
And once they begin comparing experiences, he says, "emotional chords are 
struck to the point that many of them will actually break down and cry." 
</P>
<P>
For a prisoner "to shed tears in front of another prisoner, to drop the 
incredibly important machismo stance, is absolutely astonishing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If inmate interest in the weekly sessions is an indication, the program is 
assured of success. Bartosiewski is already struggling to accommodate waiting 
lists for both male and female courses. 
</P>
<P>
"What still amazes me," Bartosiewski says, is that despite all the safety 
devices that new cars contain, from seat belts to air bags, "you must pass a 
written examination to qualify to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet to be a parent, all you have to do is perform a natural act." 
</P>
<P>
As a society, we concern ourselves greatly -- as we should -- with all the 
medical aspects of childbearing and bemoan -- as we also should -- the 
disgraceful shortage of prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
But we virtually ignore preparation for child-rearing, apparently believing 
that basic animal instincts will steer us. Consequently, our children become 
us, just as we became our parents, warts and all. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that if we had parents who hugged and kissed and loved us and 
laughed with us and cried with us, we will probably perpetuate that -- and an 
emotionally stable family line will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The downside is, if our parents beat us, we will beat our children . . . and 
the odds are that they will beat their children. And if our parents were aloof, 
unloving types -- too wrapped up in their own lives to pay attention to us -- 
we will most likely be the same way, and so will our children. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the experts say, the latter group is in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine psychologist Zena Polly deals in her private practice with the core 
problem faced by Bartosiewski in jail: breaking the conditioning of our 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
While she applauds parenting classes, whether in County Jail or those 
proliferating in schools, she says a more concentrated effort may be required 
for those most negatively affected. 
</P>
<P>
"All the cognitive training in the world can fall apart under emotional 
stress," she says, "and that is the very time when we are most apt to revert to 
conditioned behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenon (of adopting out parents' behavior) is triggered at an 
emotional level. What we must do is to examine them carefully before we have a 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We should examine those traits we don't like, flush them out, become 
explicitly aware of them and deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
Like parenting itself, she said, the process must be an "unending commitment."

PALOS VERDES COACHES WANT RAIDERS TO WIN TO KEEP ART SHELL'S SON IN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's safe to say that the coaches at Palos Verdes High are Raiders fans, 
especially now that Art Shell has been named head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Shell's son, also named Art, is one of the school's most gifted athletes. The 
6-foot-5 sophomore became the first ninth-grader to start on the varsity 
basketball team last season, and he recently earned a spot on the Sea Kings' 
sophomore football team as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders falter under Shell, resulting in the same fate that befell Mike 
Shanahan, or move to another city, it could result in the family moving from 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
No one at Palos Verdes wants to see that happen, least of all basketball Coach 
John Mihaljevich and football Coach Bill Judy. 
</P>
<P>
"If daddy goes," Judy said, "it probably means the son will follow." 
</P>
<P>
Carson High football Coach Gene Vollnogle said he was initially upset last week 
because his team, unable to find an opponent, had an open date. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the week, however, he considered the bye a blessing because it 
gave the Colts a chance to work on fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to the basics," Vollnogle said. "Now I think we're ready to 
erupt. If we don't, then I'm really going to be mad." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking with tradition, the veteran coach had Carson's first-team offense 
scrimmage the first-string defense every day during practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's sort of a no-no for us," he said. "We usually don't scrimmage during 
the season. In our first two games, the other teams (Bishop Amat and Lynwood) 
were much farther along than us. We laid the foundation for what I hope will be 
a successful year." 
</P>
<P>
The week off also gave Vollnogle a chance to scout Carson's two future 
opponents -- Washington and San Pedro -- and rest some injured players. 
Cornerback Clayvand Thomas, a junior who is considered one of the Colts' best 
defensive players, is expected to start in Friday's Southern-Pacific Conference 
opener at Washington after missing the first two games with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of Chadwick's current football players were members of the 1986 
team that captured the CIF Eight-Man Large Division championship. But Coach Sid 
Grant says the memories are still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen who were on that '86 team are constantly talking about it," he 
said. "I try to put that down." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dolphins are off to a 3-1 start and appear to have their best team 
since the championship year, Grant says he prefers Chadwick to remain in the 
underdog role. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we stay unranked," he said. "Last year were were ranked No. 2 in the 
division. I got excited about it when I shouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
After opening last season with a win and a tie, Chadwick lost a close game to 
Coast Christian, 22-21. "From there," Grant said, "the wheels just fell off the 
wagon." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins finished with a 2-5-1 record. Not a great debut for a new head 
coach, but nothing a little hard work couldn't overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Last year "wasn't a rebuilding situation," Grant said. "We had all the 
components, but things just didn't work out. This year, over the summer we got 
into an extensive program and we did a lot of lifting. We have several guys 
squating over 400 pounds. We had spring practice, which Chadwick hasn't had in 
a while. Those things combined have made the difference. We have a lot of 
dedicated seniors who are willing to work." 
</P>
<P>
Grant says the team has followed the leadership of several seniors, headed by 
All-Prep League guard Kevin Neal (5-11, 200), lineman Brian Suh (6-0, 200), 
all-league linebacker Phil (Stump) Clark, quarterback Jason Ambrose and wide 
receiver John Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Dolphins have received a boost from junior running back Brian 
Lui, who rushed for 163 yards and scored five touchdowns last week in a 47-0 
victory over Coast Christian. On the season, Lui has rushed for 472 yards and 
leads the South Bay with 11 TDs.

"The confidence of the guys is sky-high right now," Grant said. "I think we're 
going to do OK."

Chadwick plays host to Pacific Christian at 3 p.m. Friday, before opening Prep 
League play Oct. 13 at home against rival Pasadena Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste's all-sophomore backfield of quarterback Steve Cooper and running 
backs Dan Sarner and Dan Crofton don't have drivers' licenses yet because of 
their ages, but that hasn't stopped them from steering the Marauders (3-1) to 
three consecutive wins. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's Olympic League opener, Sarner rushed for 161 yards and two 
touchdowns on 27 carries and Crofton added 104 yards on 16 carries in an 18-14 
victory over Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the year, I figured we had a lot of question marks," said Miraleste 
Coach Todd DeAngelis. "But Steve Cooper hasn't made any mistakes. And the two 
running backs, what a gift. I wasn't counting on that." 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste will take a 3-1 overall record and 1-0 league mark into Friday 
night's league meeting with Santa Margarita (3-1, 1-0) at Saddleback College. 
</P>

PREP NOTES -- The Mira Costa girls' volleyball team has been ranked No. 1 in 
the first-ever State CIF coaches' poll. The Mustangs (10-0), who recently won 
the prestigious Tournament of Champions in Huntington Beach, are followed in 
the top 10 by T of C runner-up Corona del Mar, Santa Barbara, Laguna Beach and 
Thousand Oaks . . . Bishop Montgomery's two football shutouts over North 
Torrance, 10-0, and Pius X, 20-0, represent the first time the Knights have 
registered two shutouts in a season since 1983, the year they reached the CIF 
Northwestern Conference final. Matt Burrola's 95-yard kickoff return against 
Pius X last week was Bishop Montgomery's first scoring kick return since 1984 . 
. . the top water polo teams in the South Bay will compete in the two-day El 
Segundo Tournament starting at 3 p.m. Friday at El Segundo and Mira Costa high 
schools. The 16-team field is headed Palos Verdes and Miraleste, ranked in the 
CIF 3-A and 2-A division polls, respectively. Palos Verdes beat Miraleste last 
week, 8-7. Other teams entered include Loyola, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. 
The championship game will start at 7:30 Saturday night at El Segundo.

A NEW ROUND FOR FAIRNESS DOCTRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The broadcast industry's Fairness Doctrine is proving to have more lives than 
"Nightmare on Elm Street's" Freddie. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives tagged the controversial issue 
to a budget reconciliation bill in an effort to force TV and radio broadcasters 
to air opposing viewpoints on controversial issues or risk losing their 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic majority in the House has tried unsuccessfully to revive the 
doctrine three times since the Federal Communications Commission killed the 
regulation two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Broadcasters opposes the doctrine on First Amendment 
grounds. While supporters maintain that it promotes free speech, an association 
spokesman contended that it potentially would restrict speech because 
broadcasters would hesitate to air any controversial issues. DENNIS McDOUGAL

GO EAST, YOUNG BUSINESS PERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After being in Monterey Park for 20 years, Robert Cope's computer services 
business was bursting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Auto-Graphics' cramped quarters in the 700 block of Monterey Pass Road was half 
the space that the $10-million-a-year business needed, Cope said, and, besides, 
it was too far away from Ontario International Airport, which he preferred over 
Los Angeles International to ship products. 
</P>
<P>
The move east to a business park in Pomona was "110% positive," Cope said, 
especially because it meant half as long a commute, against traffic, for his 
150 employees, most of whom live in the eastern San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For Philip Vaughan, a manufacturer of drafting equipment, it was available, 
cheap property that lured him to San Dimas from Pasadena, where there is almost 
no vacant industrial land and where construction costs are among the highest in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way you can go if you have to move," he said. "There's no 
contest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bargain Rates 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the east San Gabriel Valley is becoming a mecca for businesses 
suffocated by the squeeze of development on the west. To some, moving to the 
east means bargain rates for large tracts of industrial and office space. To 
others, it simply means following upscale residential growth that's taking 
place in the bedroom communities of Walnut, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, 
Rowland Heights and Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments predicts that by the year 2010, 
the number of jobs and people in the east valley, from the San Gabriel River 
Freeway (605) east to the Los Angeles County line, will have grown more than 
twice as much over 25 years than in the west valley. 
</P>
<P>
According to a SCAG forecast to be released this month, areas likely to witness 
the most development are San Dimas, where SCAG predicts that the population 
will grow 103% between 1984 and 2010 and where 55% more jobs will be created in 
the same time period; La Verne, where the population and employment will 
increase by 79% and 39%, respectively, and Walnut, where the population will 
grow 250% and jobs 32%. People are already inching their way eastward. Between 
1980 and 1988, population in the east valley grew almost twice as fast when 
compared to the west; in the east, it climbed from 688,055 to 825,900, a 20% 
increase, while in the west it grew 11.5%, according to figures from the Los 
Angeles County Department of Regional Planning. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Center, a senior marketing consultant at the financial consulting firm 
Grubb &amp; Ellis, said that as land in Pasadena, Monterey Park and Alhambra 
becomes more scarce, the area east of the 605 Freeway will become the focal 
point of business activity in the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hub of the Wheel' 
</P>
<P>
"The 605 and Pomona (60) freeways are like the hub of the wheel, with downtown 
as the west rim and Ontario (in San Bernardino County) being the east rim," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Griffin, an industrial broker specializing in sales transactions west of 
the Orange (57) Freeway for Coldwell Banker, said eastward drift is "a natural 
course of business. Since there's a limited industrial base west of the 605, 
most new developments are in Walnut, San Dimas, Glendora. In essence there's a 
greater selection in the east San Gabriel Valley because it's the most recent 
area to be developed." 
</P>
<P>
There are those on the west who insist that it's not a mass exodus, and the 
trickle isn't anything to be alarmed about. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to leave Pasadena," said Bruce Ackerman, executive vice president 
of Pasadena's Chamber of Commerce. "It's not a burning desire to get out of 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Although traditional industrial users may be moving east, "there's no reason 
for the commercial to go out east," said Alhambra Redevelopment Agency 
Executive Director Michael Martin, arguing that successful businesses that can 
afford the higher land prices tend to stay in the west. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the advantages of being in an urbanized area is that most retailers 
looking for quality commercial space like it here because people here are 
willing to spend money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin added that an eastward drift of industrial companies hasn't hurt 
Alhambra's economy because for every business that moves from Alhambra to 
Glendora, there's another moving from downtown Los Angeles to Alhambra, which 
is still relatively inexpensive compared with downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the trend worries cities that are losing the businesses. In 
Pasadena, for example, officials feared that auto dealers, one of the largest 
generators of sales tax revenue, would be lured eastward to Duarte, Monrovia 
and Glendora, which boast shiny new auto malls close to the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
To entice dealers to stay on Colorado Boulevard, the Pasadena Board of 
Directors is offering sales tax rebates of up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope that the incentive will reverse a steady decline in sales 
tax revenue from auto dealers at the same time that the total sales tax revenue 
has gone up. Auto sales tax revenue in Pasadena slipped from $3.03 million in 
fiscal 1986-87 to $2.81 million in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
In the east, cities are providing their own strong incentives. San Dimas' 
Redevelopment Agency has given generous financial support to businesses moving 
to the city. Recent help included issuing tens of millions of dollars in bonds 
for the construction and acquisition of buildings for an engineering firm and 
the Bushnell Division of Bausch &amp; Lomb, the nation's leading manufacturer 
of sports optics. 
</P>
<P>
The upper-middle-class bedroom community of Walnut, although zoned 95% 
residential, is trying to attract businesses to match its burgeoning 
population, which more than doubled between 1980 and 1988. The City Council 
recently created an ad-hoc economic development committee to study ways to 
strengthen the city's commercial base. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora has been slower to attract residents; its population increased by 
22.8% in the same period. But City Manager Arthur Cook said that after a brief 
spurt of growth during the 1960s, followed by a prolonged lull, "the second 
wave of it is coming now, especially with the population growth in the east 
valley. Retail is following that growth." 
</P>
<P>
With construction under way of an auto mall on Allen Avenue for which seven 
dealers have signed contracts, the city anticipates annual sales tax revenues 
to skyrocket $2 million once all nine spaces are filled. 
</P>
<P>
That promise of growth has already brought corporations from Pasadena and El 
Monte to Glendora in search of economic opportunities, Cook said. Caltrol, an 
El Monte-based manufacturer of control devices, is moving its entire operation 
to Glendora, where commercial land, at $15 to $18 a square foot, is half what 
it would be on the west, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Market Is Here' 
</P>
<P>
"The land is cheaper, the rent is cheaper, the market is here, the purchasing 
power is in this area," Cook said. "The economic level of Glendora is higher 
than other areas, but commercial land isn't as expensive as other areas that 
are fully developed." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some in the east say the eastward drift is blowing right 
past them into San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
While Pomona has found a niche in the marketplace for small manufacturing 
facilities of less than 25,000 square feet, larger developers have passed it 
over when looking for places to set up heavy industrial firms, known as "big 
boxes." Retail development is similarly scarce, so that Pomona residents 
typically drive across the county line into Ontario and Montclair to shop for 
clothing and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"Those stores don't exist here," said Ray Bragg, interim operations manager for 
Pomona's redevelopment department. "The downtown Pomona area wasn't able to 
keep up with other communities. The buying public goes for the new and the 
flashy. When Montclair Plaza was built, we sort of lost out to the glitz and 
the flash." 
</P>
<P>
But Pomona, too, is trying to fill the gap in its economic base with more 
retail outlets. Through the efforts of the Redevelopment Agency and the Pomona 
Economic Development Corp., West Holt Avenue is being transformed from a 
run-down, underdeveloped stretch of land into a revitalized light-industrial 
center. Commercial retail centers are sprouting up too, but are mostly 
concentrated near the higher-scale residential areas of Phillips Ranch and 
Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the trickle eastward can best be explained by a combination of factors. 
First of all, houses are popping up fast in the east, whether it's in Walnut 
and Diamond Bar, where the average house costs $300,000, or in Fontana and 
Ontario, where homes are more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobs Follow Housing 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, jobs are following the housing tract boom. Although it's San 
Bernardino County that's witnessing the most rapid growth in the nation, 
according to a recent U. S. Census Bureau report on metropolitan growth, east 
valley businesses are drawing on the neighboring county's expanding employee 
base, according to Center of Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, there's a dearth of higher-skilled jobs in the Inland Empire, 
and mid-income-level residents in the Inland Empire are finding more employment 
in the east San Gabriel Valley's more diversified economy. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices and office rental rates may not be as cheap as in the Inland 
Empire, yet are still considerably lower than anything to the west. And the 
area east of the 605 is a safe distance from gridlock on the Foothill and 
Ventura freeways, yet isn't too far away for businesses that need access to 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Randy Hoffman, former president of Bushnell, was able to sell his 
old building in Pasadena for $22 a square foot and buy space in a San Dimas 
business park for $8 a square foot. On top of that, the city's Redevelopment 
Agency issued $5 million to $6 million in bonds to finance the purchase. 
Hoffman originally wanted to stay in Pasadena, but there wasn't any room along 
Foothill Boulevard to expand and the city couldn't find another site that 
permitted 18-wheel trucks easy access to a distribution facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Good Deal' 
</P>
<P>
So Hoffman decided to move east. "We got a real good deal," he said, adding 
that he would have saved even more money if he went farther east into San 
Bernardino County but would have lost too many of his employees, most of whom 
live in San Dimas, Glendora and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to be out in the middle of nowhere," he said. "We drew a circle 
and said we'd stay somewhere within a 10-mile radius. It was a balance between 
costs and services. We wanted to be within a few minutes of restaurants and had 
to be able to draw on local vendors and printing shops, office supply places 
and banks." 
</P>
<P>
Although the move wasn't a great financial loss to Pasadena -- Bushnell handles 
only a limited volume of retail sales -- it underscored a dilemma facing cities 
on the west that have almost reached the saturation point in development, yet 
aren't able to retain rapidly growing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine percent of the developable land in Pasadena and San Gabriel is used 
up. Ninety-seven percent of West Covina is built on. And only 4% of Monterey 
Park and 2% of Alhambra is undeveloped. In contrast, Pomona is 10% vacant, 
Walnut is 21% vacant and in San Bernardino County, Rancho Cucamonga and Ontario 
are 39% and 26% vacant, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of land in Pasadena is exacerbated by a growth-control ordinance 
limiting future commercial development in the city to a total of 250,000 square 
feet a year for projects of more than 25,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees Higher 
</P>
<P>
In addition, building permit fees in Pasadena are substantially higher than 
neighboring cities for all types of projects. In Monterey Park and San Gabriel, 
temporary building moratoriums have put a hold on residential projects, which 
city officials acknowledge may indirectly slow commercial growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we're concerned when businesses leave Pasadena, especially 
businesses that generate substantial sales tax revenue or provide employment 
opportunities, that are out migrating to areas in the immediate region," said 
Bill Reynolds, Pasadena's director of development. "But when a city's as fully 
developed as Pasadena, we don't have the luxury of having cheap land that is 
readily available and vacant to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Even Pacific Rim businesses, which for the last decade have flocked to Monterey 
Park, San Gabriel and Alhambra because of the cities' large Asian populations, 
are responding to the eastward drift. A recent migration of Asians to Hacienda 
Heights, Rowland Heights and Walnut, where housing is often more affordable and 
available than in Monterey Park, has drawn businesses that cater to the area's 
growing Chinese population. 
</P>
<P>
In Rowland Heights and Hacienda Heights, one need only drive down major streets 
to notice that Asian businesses are popping up. Typically in those areas, once 
a large Chinese supermarket opens in a shopping mall, small businesses and 
restaurants follow. 
</P>
<P>
William Chan, president of Great West Realty in Alhambra, said the area around 
Monterey Park is still an Asian business owner's first choice, but when he 
finds out how stiff the competition is, how expensive land is and how 
restrictive the city's building code is, he often starts looking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition here is too great," Chan said. "There are too many Chinese 
groceries already. There are 200 Chinese restaurants in Alhambra. I for one 
would never develop here."

4 PASADENA PROJECTS OK UNDER NEW INITIATIVE

<P>
An expansion of Jurgensen's Market, two office buildings and a 44-room hotel 
are the first construction projects to pass muster under the city's strict 
Growth Management Initiative, which voters approved in March. 
</P>
<P>
The four commercial projects survived an elaborate screening process and 
secured unanimous approval during a fast and smoothly run meeting of the 
Pasadena Board of Directors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board heard from developers, architects and owners for seven commercial and 
45 residential projects, all of which were halted when the initiative was 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Over Pledge 
</P>
<P>
The projects approved were: the expansion of Jurgensen's Market to a 
three-story shopping and office complex, a 44-unit Travelodge Suites hotel at 
1599 E. Colorado Blvd., a three-story office and restaurant building to be 
called Franklin Court at 2700 E. Foothill Blvd., and a 10-story office and 
residential complex at 200 N. Euclid Avenue, on land owned by All Saints Church 
next to Plaza Las Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Three commercial projects not approved will be considered again by the board in 
a few weeks after they have been examined by the city's Design Review 
Committee. Decisions on the residential projects will be made at the Oct. 10 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The only hitch in Tuesday's proceedings was a dispute over the city's First 
Source Agreement, a pledge developers are required to sign stating that they 
will interview Pasadena residents first for construction and other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, having this requirement in place leaves us open to lawsuits," 
said Tom Muller, an attorney for Jurgensen's. "Anyone who feels they were 
discriminated against would have a wonderful piece of evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Muller called the language of the agreement unclear and said it would be 
impossible to enforce. He also argued that the initiative devised by Pasadena 
Residents in Defense of our Environment (PRIDE) did not specifically call for 
the First Source Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was devised by city staff before the initiative was passed for 
use in the approval process for major city projects. It was adopted by the 
board in November and then applied to the growth initiative after its passage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clarification Ordered 
</P>
<P>
The board, which appeared at first reluctant to approve the Jurgensen's project 
unless the job agreement was signed, decided instead to direct the city 
attorney to clarify the language in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The building projects were evaluated Tuesday as required by the city's Growth 
Management Initiative. It places annual limits on construction of 250 units for 
residential building and 250,000 square feet for commercial projects larger 
than 25,000 square feet each. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Chamber of Commerce, the Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Urban 
League and other groups have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the initiative, 
the city has proceeded with its provisions nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
After its passage, the city stopped accepting applications for development. 
City planning staff members and the board then devised a system for analyzing 
and approving projects already in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Projects on which developers had made substantial progress were allowed to 
continue under a category dubbed "Phase I." Sixteen residential units and 
54,341 square feet of commercial construction were approved under Phase 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Impact 
</P>
<P>
That left 234 units and 195,659 square feet still to be allocated to the 52 
projects grouped under Phase II and considered by the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-point list of criteria was devised for evaluation that included an 
assessment of the project's impact on the neighborhood. But at Tuesday's 
hearing, residents objected to only one residential and two commercial 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Jurgensen's Market expansion appeared to draw the most criticism by 
residents. Under a project called South Lake Market, the two-story Jurgensen's 
Market and office building at 842 E. California Blvd., will be replaced by a 
three-story building that includes a grocery store, office building, shops and 
a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But resident Glen Cass said he and others object to the project because nearby 
streets would be choked with traffic and neighbors would be troubled by noise 
and light from the restaurant. He also brought up environmental concerns, 
saying that underground parking was slated for "gasoline-soaked soil" on a spot 
formerly occupied by a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
The developers argued, however, that the Chevron Oil Co. has agreed to remove 
the soil. They also presented petitions with 400 signatures of residents 
favoring the project. 
</P>
<P>
The board also approved setting aside a 5% "buffer" from the 250,000 square 
feet of commercial space approved yearly to allow for small additions to 
projects because of minor design changes. That would mean almost 10,000 square 
feet would be subtracted from the 250,000 when projects are considered. 
</P>
<P>
Because the buffer, if applied to this year's total, would have put the city 
over the 1989 limit, the board approved "borrowing" the excess square footage 
from the 1990 total. 
</P>
<P>
The board also listened to a parade of developers and building owners Tuesday 
seeking approval for housing projects that range from construction of a home on 
vacant land to the building of a 28-unit apartment complex. But they put off 
deciding on the residential projects until next week. 
</P>
<P>
After the board decides next Tuesday which residential projects can proceed, 
city staff members will begin working on Phase III of the initiative, which 
calls for developers to secure permits before new projects can proceed. A 
number of other procedures are also required by the measure before it 
automatically expires on Dec. 31, 1999.

SUPERVISORS ORDER S. COUNTY WELFARE OFFICE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under fire from local elected officials and private social service workers, the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors has ordered the reopening of the only 
welfare office in South Orange County by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The branch office of the Social Services Agency in San Juan Capistrano was 
closed last Friday after county welfare officials determined that they did not 
have the funds to properly staff the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The closure, however, sparked the anger of many South County residents, who 
complained that county officials were ignoring the needs of welfare recipients 
who live south of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
County welfare officials said that more than 300 welfare recipients a month -- 
many of them young, single mothers -- have been signing up for welfare benefits 
at the South County facility at 32118 Paseo Adelanto, half a block from the San 
Juan Capistrano City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
For the past week, many of them have been forced to travel to the nearest 
welfare office in Costa Mesa, a round-trip journey by bus of up to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of several private agencies that provide services to poor South 
County residents have been scrambling to provide transportation for recipients. 
</P>
<P>
But after receiving calls and hearing complaints over the week, Board Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley urged fellow supervisors on Tuesday to order the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted unanimously to restore the facility, which could be reopened by 
Friday, said Riley, who has been spearheading a drive to establish a large 
welfare office in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Praise the Lord," exclaimed Ellen Gilchrist, head of the Episcopal Services 
Alliance in San Clemente, when she heard the news Wednesday. "I'm so happy they 
worked this thing out." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Riley said that he was "so concerned 
that the need was not being met" in South County. "I'm very excited that this 
went through." 
</P>
<P>
County welfare officials had said that they decided to close the San Juan 
Capistrano office because the three eligibility workers assigned to the 
storefront facility could not provide many follow-up services. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the office has been staffed by two case workers for the Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children program and one Medi-Cal specialist. The three 
workers signed up new applicants and provided basic services. 
</P>
<P>
The move to restore welfare services in South County was applauded by local 
elected officials, who have been fighting to open a full-service welfare office 
in a 6,000-square-foot facility on La Paz Road in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely pleased," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, who 
spent Tuesday morning lobbying Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "I think it's a 
real service not just to residents of San Juan Capistrano but to all South 
County residents," Hausdorfer added. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just wonderful," added San Juan Capistrano City Councilman 
Kenneth E. Friess. "It's certainly reflective of how hard Riley has worked to 
push this through." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the "fight isn't over yet," referring to the proposed 
Laguna Hills facility. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, after ordering the San Juan Capistrano office to be reopened, 
also asked for a detailed report on the cost of the Laguna Hills facility, 
which would be staffed by 25 welfare workers. 
</P>
<P>
That report is scheduled for completion before the board's Oct. 24 meeting. The 
supervisors will vote then on opening the office by Jan. 15, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Griffith, chief deputy director of the county Social Services Agency, 
said last week that the supervisors would consider financing the Laguna Hills 
office during their mid-fiscal year discussions in January. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the supervisors decided not to wait until January because of 
heavy criticism over the closure of the San Juan Capistrano office. He said 
that his office received dozens of calls from residents and some staff members 
from the Costa Mesa welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said that supervisors of the Costa Mesa office have already identified 
enough volunteers to staff the small office in San Juan Capistrano. "It looks 
like all we need is a truck to take the furniture back," he added.

TIP LEADS TO ARREST IN CYCLIST'S HIT-RUN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aided by an anonymous telephone tip, Anaheim police Wednesday arrested a 
46-year-old man on suspicion of the hit-and-run death of a motorcyclist two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police received hundreds of telephone calls from the public after they 
announced last week that their only clue was a parking sticker on a shard of 
glass believed to have broken free from the vehicle that hit 20-year-old 
Christopher Lee Gruber at Crescent Avenue and Dale Street at the Buena 
Park-Anaheim border. 
</P>
<P>
Booked on suspicion of felony hit-and-run was Ebodio Luna Nino, 46, of Anaheim, 
Police Sgt. Richard Zschoche said. Bail was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The department wishes to thank the media and the public for its help," 
Zschoche said. But investigators still need anyone who may have witnessed the 
collision to telephone authorities at (714) 999-1861, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber's friends expressed relief Wednesday that a suspect was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going to bring Chris back and that's all I want, but seeing that 
justice is done will make me feel much much better -- seeing he (the suspect) 
gets what he deserves," said Gruber's girlfriend, Genny Quenzler, 18, counter 
girl at Little Caesar's pizza in Buena Park, where Gruber, a Costa Mesa 
resident, was a manager. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber "was really nice . . . the easiest person to get along with that I've 
ever known in my whole life," Quenzler said. 
</P>
<P>
"He always had fun and it just didn't seem real that he could be just laying 
there and not moving and not alive," she said of her hospital visit to the 
unconscious Gruber, who was pronounced dead hours after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Padilla, 16, another employee at the pizza restaurant where Gruber had 
worked since he was a 17-year-old student at La Quinta High School in 
Westminster, said customers were "pretty excited" about news Wednesday that a 
suspect had been apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real close to him," Padilla said. "Everybody is relieved here." 
</P>
<P>
Flyers offering a $2,000 reward from Gruber's parents had been passed out at 
the restaurant, he said. They carry a reproduction of a newspaper article and a 
photograph of the parking sticker. 
</P>
<P>
Police asked the public's help last week in identifying the parking sticker. 
Newspapers ran photographs of the sticker and police were flooded with calls, 
Police Sgt. Jim George said. 
</P>
<P>
George could not say Wednesday whether the publication of the parking sticker 
by newspapers had led directly to the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
However, hundreds of calls were received from the public concerning apartment 
complexes issuing such stickers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Information from a caller who wished to remain anonymous led investigators to 
an apartment complex in West Anaheim," Zschoche said. "At this complex, the 
vehicle involved was located and the suspect contacted." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that there apparently were no witnesses is puzzling to police, even 
though the fatal accident happened after midnight, because Dale Street is 
heavily traveled. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comprehend it," the dead man's father, Fred Gruber, said last week. 
"We're so sick of such violence. I can't understand why somebody would run over 
him and then not help him." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Gruber and the victim's mother, Golda Gruber, who live in Las Vegas, said 
their son had planned to take draftsman courses when he wasn't working at the 
restaurant.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
FLASHING ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach will allow flashing electronic billboards under a compromise 
adopted by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided earlier this week to allow 25-foot-tall electronic 
reader boards to display ads for large businesses along Beach Boulevard and the 
San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Miller Honda on Beach Boulevard had asked the city to change its code to 
allow 35-foot-high electronic signs, but the Planning Commission rejected the 
request in August. 
</P>
<P>
On appeal, the City Council overturned the commission's decision and voted to 
allow smaller electronic signs with certain restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The signs can be up to 115 square feet, with just 90 square feet for the 
electronic part of the sign. The council also added a provision that the sign 
must be used 10% of the time to display community-oriented messages. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that want signs must get a permit from the Planning Commission, 
which must determine that a sign would not adversely affect people living in 
nearby residential areas, the council decided. 
</P>
<P>
Having a sign will help attract customers to the dealership, said Al 
Parajeckas, vice president of Roger Miller Automotive Group. The dealership 
could have a sign up in four to six months if the city approval process goes 
smoothly, he said.

CITY ASKS EXTENSION ON LAUREL ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have asked the county to extend for a month the deadline for 
public comment on the Laguna Laurel planned community. 
</P>
<P>
The public has until Oct. 14 to submit written arguments on the lengthly 
environmental impact report that was released last month as part of plans to 
transform a 2,105-acre rural canyon area along Laguna Canyon Road into a 
3,200-home community. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and community environmentalists have voiced strong opposition to 
the project, which would be in the heart of the Laguna Greenbelt, a series of 
rocky hills and canyons that surround the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said city officials want the extension so they 
can study the voluminous impact report for possible legal action to block the 
project, which is in the final stages of the permit process. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said that the 
board is considering the request but that it will probably be denied. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that a 15-day extension will most likely be approved. 
</P>
<P>
After the deadline passes, the county Planning Commission is scheduled to 
consider written arguments and schedule public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have requested that the county hold one of the public hearings 
in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the City Council ordered that its staff erect a sign along 
the proposed site to point out to motorists where the planned community would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
The council is also sponsoring a public walk through Laguna Canyon at 9 a.m. 
Nov. 11.

</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER THREATENS TO BACK OUT OF DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alleging a breach of contract, a development company with plans to build an 
industrial park on Capistrano Beach Sanitary District property has threatened 
to pull out of the deal, saying the district is holding secret negotiations 
with another party. 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 28 letter, the developer, Capistrano Beach Partners, accused 
sanitary district officials of negotiating with a private helicopter commuter 
service to lease a part of the property for a landing pad. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, wrote Michael J. Greene, attorney for the developer, "the proposed 
use would be a highly sensitive and controversial enterprise for this area." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to each member of the Dana Point City Council and member of 
the Capistrano Beach Sanitary District board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed parcel is along San Juan Creek, inland from Doheny State Beach. 
The two sides have been negotiating for development of the proposed industrial 
park since October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitary district manager Dennis Erdman called the complaint a 
misunderstanding. He confirmed that the district has talked to the helicopter 
company about using land at the site that is not part of the proposed 
industrial park. He also suggested that the two companies talk, he said.

EXPLOSIONS NEAR CSUF THOUGHT TO BE A PRANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what police are calling a prank, residents of the University Village 
apartment complex near Cal State Fullerton were awakened at 4 a.m. Wednesday by 
seven loud explosions. 
</P>
<P>
A Fullerton police spokesman said no injuries were reported. Residents, 
primarily students, called the police to the Oxford Avenue complex. When 
officers arrived, they also heard explosions. They found nine plastic beverage 
bottles -- seven of which had already exploded -- containing an unidentified 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff Department bomb squad defused two of the containers 
holding the mysterious mixture. The gas had not been identified as of Wednesday 
night. Police are looking for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit did not apparently want anyone or anything to be hurt by the 
blasts, officers said, because the bombs were placed far enough away from the 
apartments to avoid injury or property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials speculated Wednesday that whoever mixed the chemicals must 
have known that they would blow up after sitting for a while and probably did 
it as a prank.

S. COUNTY WATER PLAN DELAYED AFTER SAN CLEMENTE OFFICIAL OBJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South Orange County water district on Wednesday delayed action on a plan to 
limit water distribution next year after a San Clemente city official charged 
that the proposal fails to allow for growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There are already a lot of permits approved" for new homes in San Clemente, 
City Engineer Bill Cameron said. "We're looking at a significant increase in 
water demand next summer." 
</P>
<P>
Cameron voiced his concern as the board of directors of Tri-Cities Municipal 
Water District studied a distribution plan for next summer. The plan proposed 
limiting cities and agencies to the average amount of water they used this past 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Cities suffered a water shortfall in its reservoir in July and August as 
its users consumed more than the district could pump back in. That shortage 
caused San Clemente to implement cutbacks in water use by major developers in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron said San Clemente will need even more water next summer because of many 
new residences being built in the community. But a water district board member 
warned that giving more water to San Clemente means giving less to the 
district's other consumers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to San Clemente, Tri-Cities provides water for the Capistrano Beach 
area of Dana Point and for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and San 
Onofre State Park, both in northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-Cities staff was instructed to consult with Cameron and other San 
Clemente officials about population growth and to report on Oct. 18, when the 
board will reconsider the water distribution plan. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Erdman, board president, stressed that the board should not assume that 
more water will be available next summer. He noted that the district's water 
shortage stems from having only one intake pipe to replenish its reservoir. A 
second pipe is scheduled to be built but will not be in service before early 
1991.

SAN JUAN CITY COUNCIL APPROVES BAN ON RIDGELINE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano City Council has approved a new law that would 
permanently ban any development on a series of rolling hills that wind through 
the historical city. 
</P>
<P>
The ridgeline preservation ordinance, which was adopted by a 4-1 vote Tuesday 
night, prohibits construction or grading within 200 feet of any ridgeline in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze cast the only vote against the ordinance, which 
goes into effect next month. 
</P>
<P>
The council passed the law in response to the shrinking natural landscape in 
South Orange County. Many of the hills and ridges in surrounding communities 
have been terraced and houses built on them. 
</P>
<P>
Protection of San Juan Capistrano's ridge tops until now had been enacted 
piecemeal, with city officials considering hillside development on a 
project-by-project basis. 
</P>
<P>
By relying on the new law rather than separate guidelines set forth in the 
city's general plan -- a developmental blueprint -- city officials can better 
defend the anti-development policy in court, said City Atty. John R. Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a concrete ordinance that sets up what I call a 200-foot rule, 
horizontally from the ridge top, saying that nothing can be built," Shaw said. 
But the law has already been challenged by one local developer, who is angry 
that the ordinance will prevent him from building a multimillion-dollar estate 
on the peak of a hill he owns near Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Maurer, owner of Coral Properties development company, has threatened to 
sue the city, saying he was given verbal permission at a Planning Commission 
meeting in February, 1976, to build the estate. 
</P>
<P>
As part of development plans that included two housing tracts, Maurer asked to 
build a mansion on a one-third acre, hilltop parcel, which would furnish his 
proposed home with a 360-degree view. 
</P>
<P>
Maurer's attorney, Roger A. Grable, has argued that because the home is planned 
atop foundations of the former Belford family house, which was destroyed by 
fire in the 1920s, required grading would not be severe enough to violate the 
ridgeline law. 
</P>
<P>
The council disagreed with that argument last month when it denied Maurer a 
waiver under an interim version of the new law, originally enacted July 18 as 
an urgency ordinance. The final version of the law adopted Tuesday also 
contains provisions to apply for a waiver, which could be granted at council 
discretion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we qualify for the exemption," Grable said. "We have completed 
all available processes for construction of the site. The ordinance . . . would 
not afford us the ability to get approval." 
</P>
<P>
Maurer can apply for a waiver when the ordinance takes effect Nov. 2, Shaw 
said.

FIREWORKS WILL STAY LEGAL IN FULLERTON, COUNCIL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM MCQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Piccolo Petes can shriek and cones can sparkle on the next Fourth of July in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted, 3 to 2, this week to keep fireworks legal, rejecting a 
Fire Department recommendation to ban their private use. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really see that there's an overwhelming community spirit to ban 
fireworks," Councilman Chris Norby said. "I don't favor prohibiting them 
tonight or in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
Three residents asked the council Tuesday to ban fireworks, while seven 
residents or members of Fullerton fund-raising groups asked council members to 
keep them legal. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Richard C. Ackerman and A.B. (Buck) Catlin joined Norby in voting to 
keep fireworks legal, although Catlin said he would like the issue placed on 
the ballot to let Fullerton voters decide. 
</P>
<P>
Banning fireworks is an issue of safety, Mayor Molly McClanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an issue of patriotism," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan and Councilman Don Bankhead said they would like to outlaw so-called 
safe and sane fireworks in Fullerton because they create a fire and safety 
danger to residents. "Safe and sane" is a designation given by the state fire 
marshal to relatively safe fireworks that don't explode or fly through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fullerton was fortunate this year to have only about $700 in damage 
caused by fireworks, McClanahan said, there have been several close calls, 
meaning fires were doused quickly before spreading. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were lucky," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Ron Coleman asked the council to ban fireworks not only because of 
the risks of fires and injuries, but also because residents from surrounding 
cities that ban fireworks have been flowing into Fullerton to shoot them off. 
</P>
<P>
With so many people coming to Fullerton to use fireworks in parks, schools and 
on public streets, the risk has increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton housewife Jean Henderson, 33, told the council that if Fullerton bans 
them, it will force her family to drive to another city on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I have small children, and we love our little home display," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, all but six of the county's 28 cities have outlawed 
"safe and sane" fireworks. Fireworks also are illegal in unincorporated county 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Fullerton, fireworks are legal in Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, 
Orange and Santa Ana. On Tuesday, the Garden Grove City Council will consider a 
city commission's recommendation to ban fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Fire Department's request for the ban, two reports issued by Orange 
County grand juries have encouraged Fullerton to outlaw them. The council 
agreed to look at the issue again if there are more problems with injuries or 
fires from fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also voted unanimously to look into holding a public fireworks 
display next July to give residents an alternative to buying and shooting off 
their own fireworks.

HAWAIIAN AIRLINES UNIONS TO VOTE ON 5-YEAR CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach investor group bidding for ailing Hawaiian Airlines said 
Wednesday that it has reached tentative agreement with all of the carrier's 
unions on new five-year contracts that call for wage freezes in the first 36 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the contracts by the carrier's pilots, flight attendants, 
machinists and other union workers would clear the way for completing the 
acquisition of HAL Inc., the airline's holding company, by a group headed by 
attorney J. Thomas Talbot and former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout, which calls for the payment of $22 per share for at least a 
majority of the airline holding company's stock, or at least $22 million, is 
contingent on the unions' agreeing to concessions on wages and working 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, Talbot said, outside shareholders had tendered 233,000 shares 
and the HAL board had agreed to sell 1.1 million shares to his group, HAL 
Acquisition Inc., giving it control of 68% of the holding company's 1,953,000 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Group Holds 20% 
</P>
<P>
A subsidiary of Japan Air Lines holds a 20% stake in HAL through the purchase 
last year of a large block of preferred stock. The Talbot group has not said 
whether it will also try to acquire those shares. Acquisition of all the 
outstanding shares would cost $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition also is contingent on the Talbot group securing financing and 
on the approval of HAL shareholders. A special meeting of stockholders is 
scheduled for Oct. 23. Talbot declined to discuss the financing arrangements 
but said they are expected to be in place Friday after the unions vote. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the union ratification votes on the new contracts, HAL 
Acquisition has extended the deadline for its tender offer until midnight 
Tuesday, and Talbot said the deadline will probably be extended through Oct. 23 
if the unions accept the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Hawaiian Airlines' five unions could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday, but in a statement issued early in the day, the Assn. of Flight 
Attendants said its negotiating team, as well as negotiators for the Air Line 
Pilots Assn. and the International Assn. of Machinists, had reached tentative 
agreement with the Talbot group. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot said leaders of two smaller unions representing dispatchers and other 
communications workers have also agreed to the pact. 
</P>
<P>
The five unions represent 83% of Hawaiian Airlines' 3,000 employees, and all 
have scheduled ratification votes this week on the proposed contracts, Talbot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Magoon Jr., HAL chairman and majority shareholder, said the contracts call 
for the unions to accept a three-year pay freeze and major changes in working 
conditions -- changes designed to increase worker productivity -- in return for 
job security and wage increases in the fourth and fifth years of the pacts. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents it has filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, HAL Acquisition believes that the new contract, if approved by the 
union members, will save about $6 million over its lifetime. HAL has lost more 
than $30 million in the past 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the acquisition agreement proposed by the Talbot group, Magoon would 
remain as co-chairman of the holding company, sharing the title with Ueberroth. 
Talbot would become chief executive.

Medstone to Report Loss: Irvine-based Medstone International said Wednesday it 
will post a loss for its third quarter ended Sept. 30 because of the voluntary 
cessation of shipment of its lithotripters. The company stopped distribution of 
the machines, which use shock waves to disintegrate kidney stones, because of 
non-compliance with reporting and technical standards of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. The company, which did not specify its quarterly loss, said it 
has received FDA approval to resume shipment of the equipment.

Stock Rise Puzzles Helionetics: Helionetics Inc., a small Irvine defense 
contractor, said it "did not understand" why the company's stock rose sharply 
in unusually heavy trading on Tuesday and Wednesday. More than 40,000 
Helionetics shares changed hands on both Tuesday and Wednesday, contrasted with 
an average daily volume of about 1,000 shares. The over-the-counter stock rose 
62.5 cents per share to $4.125 on Tuesday, then fell 12.5 cents to $4 on 
Wednesday, Helionetics said. Helionetics Chairman Charles W. Jobbins said a New 
York investment firm, Rosenkrantz, Lyons &amp; Ross, recently issued "a 
favorable research report on our company." He said the company has not issued 
any press releases that might explain the stock's recent activity.

CELLULAR PHONE DEALERS SUE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Orange County cellular telephone dealers have filed a $6-million lawsuit 
charging Leo's Stereo and Pak-Cell Inc. with predatory pricing and other 
illegal practices in the sale of mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that Leo's 
and Pak-Cell are selling the phones at a loss but making the money back by 
requiring buyers to sign up for cellular service. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers get hefty commissions from the cellular service providers for signing 
up new customers, but the "bundling" of phone sales with service orders has 
been ruled illegal by the California Public Utilities Commission.

THE GORILLA AND THE GURU: 2 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON BUSINESS LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY SKRZYCKI, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leadership -- and how to create leaders -- has become a hot topic among 
companies that are discovering that there is more to success than balancing the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders are in demand because employees now are "human capital." They don't 
work at their jobs, they are "empowered" to do them. And their boss is no 
longer a manager but a leader. 
</P>
<P>
Since the leadership craze hit, consultants and chief executive officers have 
turned into instant experts. Business magazines have regular columns on 
leadership, training seminars use leadership as a theme and an assortment of 
how-to and inspirational books on leadership is hitting the best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
Two tomes not to be overlooked in the leadership derby mirror the dramatic 
differences in management styles that companies have adopted to weather the 
competitive turbulence of the 1980s. One is the frontal approach to leadership: 
Take charge, be aggressive, ferret out your enemies. The other is kinder and 
gentler: Treat people well and look for the good in them, and they will respond 
in productive and creative ways. 
</P>
<P>
Attila the Hun, meet Max DePree. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun," written by Wess Roberts, a 
human-resources professional at Fireman's Fund Insurance, is a 110-page 
leadership manual based on the life and "work" of Attila, King of Huns, a 
5th-Century brutalizer and bully of men and nations who relished being known as 
the Scourge of God. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Attila as Mystical 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who picked Attila as his metaphorical leader because of the warrior's 
"mystical" qualities, softens Attila's rough edges, painting him as a 
deliberate (if driven) compassionate leader who may have been crude but was 
also wise -- particularly in how he handled subordinates (the Huns). 
</P>
<P>
"Some of his methods may seem brutal in our day . . . but, hey, that's how 
things were done," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these "Attila-isms": 
</P>
<P>
* Do not let your chosen enemy have the advantage in any situation. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not insult unless you mean it. 
</P>
<P>
* For Huns, conflict is a natural state. 
</P>
<P>
* Huns make enemies only on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
* If it were easy to be a chieftain, everyone would be one. 
</P>
<P>
The book got off to a slow start; 16 publishers turned it down before Warner 
Books took it on. Its outlook turned more bullish after it fell into the hands 
of H. Ross Perot, a modern-day corporate Attila, who touts it as a great book 
with timeless principles. The book hit the New York Times best-seller list and 
is being translated into 13 languages. It is also being made into a film for 
business and is available on cassette. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Opposite Approach 
</P>
<P>
If the curious appeal of "Attila" lies in its simplistic pronouncements and 
outrageous presentation, quite the opposite is true of "Leadership Is an Art." 
</P>
<P>
Written by Max DePree, 64, chairman of Herman Miller Inc. -- a designer and 
maker of office furniture -- the book is small and soulful enough to be carried 
around like a prayer book -- and, in some respects, it is. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong spiritual content to leadership," DePree said. "People make 
a decision to follow, but we don't quite know why they do." 
</P>
<P>
DePree has decided that leadership is akin to being in a state of grace: It is 
a sort of gift given to someone who then has the obligation to serve. His 
meditations -- drawn from Luke, the Corinthians, Plato, Gandhi and his own 
experience -- are perhaps more daring in spirit than all of Attila's bluster. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these musings: 
</P>
<P>
* The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
* By ourselves, we have serious limits. Together we can be something wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
* Intimacy is one way of describing the relationship we all desire with work. 
</P>
<P>
* An elegant company frees its members to be their best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Edged Question 
</P>
<P>
DePree also shares novel approaches to performance reviews, in which he 
proposes that some of the "right" questions to be asked are: "What have you 
abandoned?" and the two-edged consideration of "Does Herman Miller need you?" 
and "Do you need Herman Miller?" 
</P>
<P>
DePree also thinks that leaders should have the capacity to weep over the good 
and bad, the happy and sad in life -- and at work. Things that bring tears to 
his eyes include superficiality, a lack of dignity, arrogance, tenderness, good 
news and having to work in a job where you are not free to do your best. 
</P>
<P>
This probably is not the approach Attila would take, but it is all in a day's 
work when you are trying to be a leader at Herman Miller -- rather than chief 
of the Huns.

SHOCK OF THE OLD: NATIONAL GALLERY'S FRANS HALS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Frans Hals' paintings have no precedents. His snapshot informalities and 
democratic kindnesses were entirely original. No earlier Dutch Master dared the 
unconcealed boldness, the watch-me-paint-it vigor, of his swiftly moving brush. 
His markings sing of genius. His sitters look alive. 
</P>
<P>
And yet no free and forceful painter has had a harder time holding his position 
in the pantheon of painters than the portraitist of Haarlem (1581-1666) whose 
retrospective exhibition went on view last weekend at the National Gallery of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
Hals' reputation began its oscillations long before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Hals, when in his 40s, dwelt among the rich. Yet he died in crushing poverty. 
In the winter of 1664, when he was in his 80s, shivering in misery in his 
rented room in Holland, he did not have enough to buy a brick of peat. His 
paintings, for a while, had been as popular in Haarlem as Warhol's in 
Manhattan, but then his reputation crashed. His lifelike, honest portraits -- 
he painted only portraits -- have been variously regarded since as worthless or 
invaluable, as slapdash or sublime. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Clark once scorned them "(all except the last) as revoltingly cheerful 
and horribly skillful." But Manet thought them awesome. So did Whistler and 
Sargent, Cassatt and Courbet. To those who wield brushes, Hals -- a painter's 
painter -- has been a beacon, an exemplar. 
</P>
<P>
But aristocratic connoisseurs have often found his portraits coarse. Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, for example, thought them hasty and unpolished. Marcel Proust's 
Duchesse de Guermantes thought his sitters common; she suggested they be 
viewed, as one might view riffraff, safely, from a distance, from a quickly 
moving tram. Other connoisseurs (on apocryphal information) decided the painter 
was a lowlife-loving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent van Gogh revered him. He loved the way Hals painted "in one rush." He 
loved his subjects too. Hals never painted gods, shepherds in Arcadia, kings or 
martyred saints. "He did portraits," wrote van Gogh, "and nothing, nothing 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Hals painted Gypsy girls and fishwives, young businessmen with money in the 
bank, magistrates and drinkers, urchins and committees, cackling crones and 
cooks. Van Gogh thought his countryman's truthful vision of humanity "worth as 
much as Dante's Paradise and the Michelangelos and the Raphaels and even the 
Greeks." 
</P>
<P>
The market has expressed opinions as diverse. Consider, for example, the 
various values it has placed on Hals' "Willem van Heythuysen" of 1625, one of 
the 60 portraits included in the show. That slightly pompous painting -- or, to 
be precise, its slightly pompous sitter with his silver-pommeled sword, his 
ruff of costly lace and his suit of black embroidered silk -- fairly brags of 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let the sword mislead you. Van Heythuysen was no soldier; he made his 
money in the textile trade, and he made a lot of it. Hals invites us all to 
smile at his yuppiesque pretensions. Harvard's distinguished Seymour Slive, who 
catalogued the show, tells us that van Heythuysen collected "a vast number of 
paintings, expensive furniture and silver, a large library, jewelry," and that 
he also sported, beneath his rich black suit, "red satin underwear." 
</P>
<P>
Hals was in high fashion when the painting was commissioned. He was out of 
fashion in 1800 when it was auctioned in Haarlem for "the trifling sum of 51 
guilders." But then his fortunes changed. After Hals was rediscovered in the 
mid-19th Century (by the Frenchman Thore-Burger, who had also rediscovered 
Vermeer) painters, by the score, began to troop to Haarlem as if to a shrine. 
Hals was back in fashion the next time that the work was sold, from the 
Liechtenstein Collection to the Alte Pinakothek in Munich in 1969. This time 
the same portrait brought 12 million German marks. No single work of art had 
ever sold for more. 
</P>
<P>
Such fluctuating readings and wildly swinging values place a sort of question 
mark above the gallery's exhibit, the first Hals show arranged in a quarter of 
a century. Will the public yawn -- or marvel -- at those matrons in their caps 
of lace, those children with the flying hair, those confident Dutch burghers in 
their somber suits of black? Is the master due for yet another re-evaluation? 
How will 1989 respond to Frans Hals? 
</P>
<P>
If his reputation flags again the fault will not be his. Our time's 
acceleration, the ubiquity of the camera, and abstract painting's triumph must 
surely share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that Hals' greatest innovations -- his suddenness and speed, his 
republican inclusiveness and, especially, the vigor of his emphatic, unsmoothed 
brush strokes -- now seem utterly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
The factors that so moved daring younger painters when Hals was rediscovered 
today seem slightly tame. 
</P>
<P>
Take his suddenness, for instance, his astonishing exactitude, his ability to 
tear an instant out of time -- say, the dawning of a smile, or the quick and 
casual gesture of an arm tossed across a chair back, or the flash of 
recognition in the slightly bleary eyes of the Rijksmuseum's "Merry Drinker" 
who raises up his glass to welcome a good friend (the good friend is the 
viewer) who has just walked through the door. 
</P>
<P>
To seize the passing moment, to make the transitory permanent, is difficult in 
paint. With a camera it's a snap. 
</P>
<P>
Hals's open-minded fondness for different sorts of folks, for young as well as 
old, drunk as well as sober, rich as well as poor, struck a special chord in 
19th-Century Europe as France's Second Empire and other monarchies decayed. 
Courbet, who loved his portraits, and copied them with care, was a radical 
republican. It was far more than the mastery of various shades of black ("Frans 
Hals," wrote van Gogh, "had no less than 27 blacks") that endeared Hals to 
Manet, for Manet, too, made his various countrymen his subject -- the street 
cleaners, the businessmen, the prostitutes, the drunks. Hals, as Thore-Burger 
wrote, had viewed 17th-Century Holland as "a country of equality." Americans as 
various as Whistler, Cassatt, Robert Henri, Frank Duveneck and William Merritt 
Chase, all of whom loved Hals, must have felt some special kinship to his 
all-men-are-brothers tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Hals, observed van Gogh, had glimpsed the one "great simple thing: the painting 
of humanity, or rather of a whole republic, by the simple means of 
portraiture." 
</P>
<P>
Though some of his best-loved and most familiar works -- the Wallace 
Collection's "Laughing Cavalier," the Louvre's "Gypsy Girl," the Frick's 
"Portrait of a Man" and many of his largest multifigure portraits -- were not 
available for loan, the gallery's exhibit, despite its modest size, provides a 
superb survey of his art. 
</P>
<P>
Hals must have painted quickly, and directly on the canvas. Lesser painters 
have to work their portraits up from sketches, but if Hals ever made a drawing, 
none has managed to survive. Looking at his pictures you instead get the 
feeling that he reached into the world and somehow plucked his likenesses -- 
with their granite-like conceptions and quickly darting brush strokes -- whole 
from real life. The man did not need sketches. For Hals the various acts of 
forging forms in color, casting them in light, and orchestrating brush strokes 
somehow became one. 
</P>
<P>
Though van Gogh was convinced that Hals painted "in one rush," and though his 
finest portraits strike you all at once, you should battle through that 
quickness and try to view them slowly, as you would a Cubist work, stroke by 
telling stroke. We read faces instantaneously. Because that sudden recognition 
is built into our brains, the viewer may be tempted to seize these paintings at 
a glance, to get them, and move on. But fight against that hurry. Hals should 
not be gulped. His pictures should be grazed. 
</P>
<P>
Look at how he painted hands, the whiteness of the knuckles, the blood beneath 
the skin. No one has ever painted hands as well as Hals. Watch the way his 
brush manages to catch the stiffness of white linen, the weight of silk 
embroidery, the transparencies of lace. See if you can count, as van Gogh did 
so carefully, his 27 blacks. And Hals, as Slive has noted, had as many whites. 
(Though blacks and whites may rule this show -- the burghers of the time still 
dressed in Spanish styles -- the countless colors of his flesh tones are 
equally remarkable.) 
</P>
<P>
The show is filled with splendid works -- though it does include one clunker, 
the "Fisher Girl" (private collection, New York), which was once in the 
collection of the Brooklyn Museum. The black hat on her head looks like a 
charred pancake. The museum sold it off in 1967. It is easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Dutch Master's multifigure paintings have remained in Holland, but 
three of his most famous are included in the show. One is the "Officers of a 
Company of the Amsterdam Crossbow Civic Guard Under Captain Reynier Reael and 
Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw," the 15-foot-wide canvas that is 
popularly known (because of the skinniness of its 16 sitters) as "The Meagre 
Company." Hals designed it and began it, but it was finished by another. The 
standing figure at the left, all dressed in shades of gray, is surely from the 
brush of Hals. Just look at his boots. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Dutch Master's last, dark and most heart-shattering works, "The 
Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse" and "The Regentesses of the Old Men's 
Almshouse," conclude the exhibition. The "Regentesses" alone justifies repeated 
visits to the show. 
</P>
<P>
Its five old black-garbed women haunt the room like ghosts. Though Hals is 
rightly known for his merriment and brio and warm conviviality, he touches in 
this masterpiece the dark soul-stirring grandeur that only rises in the final 
works of such master painters as Rembrandt, Titian, Goya, Rothko and Cezanne. 
All that is extraneous has been expunged from this great painting. Looking at 
its sitters (they inspired, and they dwarf, Whistler's portrait of his mother) 
you cannot escape the feeling that Hals, who so loved daily life, has here 
accepted death. 
</P>
<P>
The show, in the West Building, will travel in January to the Royal Academy of 
Arts in London, and in May to the Frans Hals museum in Haarlem. It closes in 
Washington Dec. 31.

PREVIN RETURNING AS GUEST CONDUCTOR AFTER BITTER FAREWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The past is present for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. After all the changes of 
the last six months, it is Andre Previn, the controversial ex-music director, 
who opens the season tonight at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and who will 
bring the orchestra to the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule, of course, was set long before Previn's sudden, bitter 
resignation in April and his replacement in August by Esa-Pekka Salonen. He cut 
much of the workload he would have carried as music director, including his two 
weeks at Hollywood Bowl this summer. But he will still lead the orchestra in 
seven weeks of concerts this season, including the first three. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Previn faced the Philharmonic for the first time since his last 
concert on April 30. There was, he reported, no awkwardness to the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicians aren't like that," Previn said. "I felt they were terribly glad to 
see me. I had a very nice time, and so did the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Orchestra members and other observers also found little hint of tension in the 
rehearsal -- which is more than can be said for the Philharmonic management, 
which barred reporters from the rehearsal. (Previn, in resigning, stated: "In 
the current structure of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it has become obvious to 
me that there is no room for a music director.") 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice rehearsal," said cellist Gloria Lum. "It felt very normal, very 
nice and very comfortable. We're used to him. We know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
When Previn entered, musicians reported, they gave him a round of applause. He 
quipped "What's new?" and proceeded to rehearse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an excellent rehearsal," said violinist Guido Lamell. "I believe it 
reflects the things he told us when he left us. He said things had gotten in 
the way of his first priority -- to make music. . . . He didn't say anything 
like that today." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, Lamell added, was generally in "an upbeat mood. It's also the 
first day of school -- everybody's happy on the first day of school." 
</P>
<P>
The subject matter was Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. Previn said that, in its 
subtlety, the work presented a challenge to the orchestra "after 10 weeks of 
playing outdoors," a challenge that the musicians accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Lum concurred. "It's a change for the whole orchestra, just being back inside 
the Music Center for one thing, after the Bowl all summer. And it's nice to be 
thinking of finer points of music again, because at the Bowl you don't." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Previn and the players turned to Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony. 
Previn, in his 3 1/2 years as music director, also opened the previous two 
seasons with Shostakovich on the program, something of which he seemed unaware. 
</P>
<P>
"Have I really?" he asked, when questioned about this propensity to begin the 
season with Shostakovich. "I suppose he's getting to be the great man of the 
20th-Century symphony. The Fourth is a great work, and it's never been done 
here. It's certainly not ingratiating -- it's an ice-cold thing, fairly 
despondent but glorious to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Previn said that he didn't think there should necessarily be anything different 
about a program just because it was the first in the season, other than that it 
should feature the orchestra alone, without the distraction of outside 
soloists. The soloists for Previn's next programs are members of the 
Philharmonic, concertmaster Sidney Weiss and clarinetist Lorin Levee. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Philharmonic programs this season feature in-house soloists, and 
Previn has included several of those in his assignments. "I wanted to make sure 
I kept most of the weeks with orchestra soloists," he said. "I wanted the 
pleasure of working with those colleagues." Previn will also play piano with 
orchestra members in a Brahms program opening the Philharmonic Chamber Music 
Society season at Gindi Auditorium on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Though the orchestra's role in, and feelings about, Previn's departure have 
been ambiguous, the players reached after the Tuesday rehearsal returned the 
compliment. Whatever regrets there were about the way the situation developed, 
all expressed respect for Previn as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances (Tuesday) also reflected a larger truth: Orchestras expect 
different things from their music director than they do from a guest," Lamell 
said. "I think the orchestra is nicer to a guest conductor than to a music 
director, and we were nicer to Andre today than we were when he was music 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes both ways. I was reflecting back on his last words to us, when he said 
various obstacles had arisen, and I think there were obstacles between him and 
the orchestra also, and those obstacles were gone." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Previn is eager to put the acrimony behind him. "I can't say I 
don't regret it happened, but I've gone on." 
</P>
<P>
After his resignation, he went immediately on to a busy summer in Europe. He 
conducted the Berlin Philharmonic -- to which he will return in 1990 and 1991 
-- and the Vienna Philharmonic, with which he is recording a Richard Strauss 
cycle for Telarc Records. 
</P>
<P>
As principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic, Previn led that orchestra in 
a Beethoven series in London. With the Royal Philharmonic, he is recording the 
Beethoven Symphonies, with all completed but Nos. 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Previn is also busy with a television project called "Mozart on Tour." He is 
co-writing and narrating -- in English and German -- 13 one-hour programs, each 
built around a different Mozart piano concerto (with soloists including Alicia 
de Larrocha, Radu Lupu, Murray Perahia and Previn himself), and shot in a 
different city. 
</P>
<P>
The production is by Hellthaler International in association with KCET. The PBS 
station will package seven of the episodes for the United States, tentatively 
to air locally in June and July of 1991, the bicentennial of Mozart's death. 
</P>
<P>
From here, Previn goes on to a European tour with the Vienna Philharmonic, 
which he will also take to Japan in 1991. He returns to Los Angeles for two 
weeks of concerts in both January and April. 
</P>
<P>
His April repertory is based on music he will be recording then with the 
Philharmonic, Dvorak's "New World" Symphony and Mahler's Fourth Symphony. After 
that, his recording work will be with other orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, what would be the point" of recording with the Philharmonic? he asked.

CHUCK MARTIN RIDES NEW O.C. COMEDY WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, let's face it: While a number of prominent comedians have performed 
locally, Orange County isn't exactly thought of as a major spawning ground for 
comedic talent. On that front, the county's one big claim to fame is Steve 
Martin, who as a local lad developed his performing skills at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, though, some aspiring comics who grew up or moved here have 
been joining the ranks of key players on the national stand-up scene. We've 
chronicled the rise of Jerry Miner from doorman at the Laff Stop to his current 
position headlining clubs across the country and writing jokes for Jay Leno. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, attorney-turned-comic Al Lubel developed his craft on local stages 
and went on to become the 1988 "Star Search" $100,000 comedy champion. Several 
local funny folks are following similar paths -- continually writing jokes and 
securing stage time wherever possible in an ongoing quest for improvement, with 
an eye toward scoring a major breakthrough: an appearance on "Letterman," a 
role in a TV show or film, a plum writing job, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Martin, Jim Hope, and Tom Martin are not only steadfastly engaged in this 
battle but seem to be winning it. The connection for this local trio isn't just 
that they are local, or that they work extremely hard, but that their efforts 
have yielded remarkable -- and remarkably quick -- improvement. (It's worth 
noting that two of them began their careers as members of the UCI Comedy Club, 
a campus organization in which students learn to write and perform stand-up.) 
</P>
<P>
In this three-part series, we will meet Hope and the unrelated Martins, find 
out about their first forays into being funny, and look at the ways each has 
come unusually far, unusually fast. 
</P>
<P>
Of this troika of funny guys, Chuck Martin is the furthest along -- and yet the 
youngest: 24. Not coincidentally, he's the only one who grew up wanting to be a 
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I always wanted to do," says 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who will be playing this weekend at Jokers, a new club in Garden Grove. 
"I started watching 'The Tonight Show' in the fifth grade. I would stay up 
every night, and if there was a comedian on I would watch the whole thing 
'cause they were usually on last. But if there was an opera singer or whatever, 
I'd go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would always watch the comics. And it amazed me then how it seemed like 
everything they said was funny. When you watch it, you have no idea how hard 
that is and how many times they've said those things. But it just seemed to me, 
'God, how do they do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
This early interest notwithstanding, he didn't step on stage for the first time 
until he was 21, when he was attending Arizona State and decided to try an 
open-mike night at a nearby comedy club called Finney Bones. 
</P>
<P>
Martin waited that long partly because "you had to be 21 in Arizona to get into 
the bars" but also because "I wanted to be professional about it right from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
A noble ambition, but before that first show, he made one of those classic 
miscalculations endemic to novice comics: In a discussion with the club 
operator about how long his performance would be, Martin felt like he could do 
15 minutes easy, figuring his written material amounted to about an hour's 
worth. Nonetheless, he was asked to perform a five-minute set. "I did every one 
of the jokes, and it came out to about three minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a mere three months after that first open-mike night, Finney 
Bones booked him for a week, leapfrogging Martin over other local comics who 
had been pursuing stand-up a year (or years) longer. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the last time his local peers were flabbergasted (read: irritated) at 
his precocious breakthroughs and gumption. When the Last Laugh comedy chain 
opened a new club in Phoenix, Martin immediately auditioned and got hired for a 
week there, which led to his first road booking at the chain's San Jose venue. 
This triggered some baffled, if not green-eyed, response. "The other guys," 
Martin remembers, "were going 'Gee, how did you do that? ' " 
</P>
<P>
Martin allows that from day one he was pretty confident. Initially, he now 
admits, "it was just stupid confident. Still, I realized right away, and this 
might be one of the keys, that every time I went on stage I had to learn 
something about performing or about the jokes. I would always be thinking about 
it, where a lot of guys there were just playing around. They weren't working. . 
. . Your act is the important thing, not what happens that night." 
</P>
<P>
In the year since he moved to Costa Mesa, he has locked firmly into his 
character, his persona -- itself a notable achievement for someone who has been 
performing for such a short time. Dark-haired and bespectacled, Martin looks 
rather bookish. OK, nerdish. He doesn't necessarily come off like a nerd -- his 
material is too bright and aware for that -- but many sections of his act play 
off that appearance. One of his best lines involves the reaction he typically 
gets from women when he enters a health club: "What's he doing here? Maybe 
they're getting audited." 
</P>
<P>
Martin is a strong middle act everywhere -- including the prestigious, highly 
discriminating Improv circuit. He plans to work the road about 40 weeks in the 
next year and hopes to add more TV credits to his current list: "Evening 
</P>
<P>
at the Improv," "Showtime Comedy Club Network" and "Comedy Express." 
</P>
<P>
He will be on the bill for the grand opening this weekend of Orange County's 
newest comedy club, Jokers at the Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden Grove. He's 
at the Irvine Improv periodically, doing a "guest set" or just watching; his 
next scheduled appearance there is New Year's Eve week. 
</P>
<P>
That's a prized booking, indication of how highly he's regarded there, and that 
his dramatic improvement hardly has gone unnoticed. "He's so good now," said 
Irvine Improv manager Pam Felix. "He's really, really polished -- up there with 
any of our middles." When you consider that most Improv middles have been 
performing many years longer than Martin, and some boast "Tonight Show" or 
"Letterman" credits, that's high praise indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Martin performs on a bill with Dave Coulier and Andy Wayne Friday and 
Saturday at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m. at Jokers/Hyatt Regency Alicante, 100 Plaza 
Alicante, Garden Grove. Admission: $15. Information: (714) 971-3000.

Despite the highest monthly total (969 in July) since March, the number of 
permits for single-family homes issued during the first seven months of 1989 
was the lowest total for any of the last four years. The January-July total, 
5,143, was 31% less than the comparable period of last year, 14% less than 1987 
and 2% less than 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Significant dips in the number of permits issued in the unincorporated areas as 
well as the cities of Tustin and San Clemente made up most of the overall 
decline. The cities of Anaheim and Orange were the scenes of the largest 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the surrounding counties, Orange also had the largest decline. 
Compared to the first seven months of 1988, there were 31% fewer permits issued 
here, compared to a 32% increase in Los Angeles County and smaller decreases in 
the other three counties.

On paper it is Census Tract 423.09. On the ground it is a heart-shaped section 
of South County made up of a collection of separate entities looking for 
identities. Here is an aggregate of neighborhoods and planned communities, each 
with a distinct personality. Postal codes and loyalties tie some areas to 
Laguna Hills to the north or Laguna Niguel to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Many area residents are vociferously lobbying for incorporation. The Laguna 
Hills vote for cityhood was defeated in June, but another attempt may be 
forthcoming. Laguna Niguel's vote is scheduled for Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Bordered on the north by Moulton Parkway and Pacific Park Drive, on the east by 
Interstate 5 Freeway and Crown Valley Parkway and on the west by Alicia Parkway 
and Aliso Creek, this tract is in some ways an exaggeration of the prototypical 
new Orange County. For example, it is heavily white (roughly 90%, in contrast 
with 75% of the county as a whole). Too, it is very affluent, with a median 
household income of almost $75,000 (in contrast with slightly more than $40,000 
countywide). 
</P>
<P>
A wealth of apartment and condominium projects is under way in various sections 
of this tract, attesting to the expected influx of new residents. That is a 
sign of the most remarkable demographic aspect of the area: explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 years ago, this was home to 2,500 people; today there are about 12,000 
residents, an increase of almost 400%. During that time, the rest of the county 
population has grown about 20% 
</P>
<P>
That the area will grow is not a question. What remains unseen is the final 
shape and political resolution of this South County magnet. 
</P>
<P>
Among the civic stars: 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO NIGUEL 
</P>
<P>
The homes at the crest of the hill on the drive south along Crown Valley 
Parkway between Greenfield Drive and Moulton Parkway are the houses of Rancho 
Niguel. There are 1,250 private homes along sidewalks here, with facades 
painted peach, beige or white and all with tile roofs. Along Rancho Niguel 
Road, signs advertise "Exciting New Town Homes" in complexes called Mirador, 
Ventanja, Tampico and Mandeville. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Young, a member of the board of the Rancho Niguel Homeowners Assn. 
(Subdivision 2), says he and his family bought their home for $250,000 two 
years ago and have happily watched the value of their investment appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
The home across the street from his own on Rancho Grande sold this year for 
$410,000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
There is a recreation club at Rancho Niguel (simply called "The Club"), which 
has three pools, tennis courts and other accouterments of the good life, South 
County style. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be a member without living here," he says, but once someone lives 
here, "of course (he or she) will want to be a member." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Niguel has its own movie theaters, a commercial section as well as the 
Marian Bergeson Elementary School within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
NELLIE GAIL RANCH 
</P>
<P>
At the turn from Moulton Parkway onto Pacific Park Drive, a look up to the top 
of the hill holds a pleasant surprise: horses grazing. This is horse country -- 
in fact, zoning is such that the community can accommodate large equestrian 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
The animals -- combined with tall, verdant trees along Nellie Gail Road and 
lots of vegetation -- give the community a distinctly rural feel. "It's a 
frontier community," says Melody Carruth, an outspoken community leader. "We 
pride ourselves on this unique appeal. You are in the country here." 
</P>
<P>
Construction by the Presley Co. began in 1977. There are 1,356 homes on 1,500 
acres, 17 miles of horse trails and five parks (with one to be developed). An 
equestrian center has 64 stalls, and there are five equestrian rings and a 
variety of trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Nellie Gail Ranch is "a very open community because of the parks and the 
trails," says Alan Songstad, president of the homeowners association. "The 
houses at the beginning of the project began smaller, a combination of custom 
and production homes. In the last phase, homes were in the 
3,000-to-4,000-square-foot range. Custom homes ranged from 3,000 to 10,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Equestrian activity is permitted on two-thirds of the lots. Fifteen percent of 
the homes have horses boarded on their own property. The houses range in price 
from upwards of $600,000 to about $2 million. Older homes sell for about 
$400,000 to $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
Nellie Gail is within the Saddleback Valley Unified School District. A site for 
an elementary school on Nellie Gail Road has been proposed. Now, the ratio is 
32 or 33 students per teacher in the district, but the Citizens' Action 
Committee to Save Education and the local PTA boards would like to change this 
ratio to 25 per teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Carruth has lived at Nellie Gail Ranch for 6 1/2 years, and is one of the Ranch 
residents with an eye toward incorporation as part of what would be a city of 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
According to her, this neighborhood is "definitely in Laguna Hills. It has its 
own ZIP code. We worked hard to incorporate the community of Laguna Hills. We 
made the mistake of including Leisure World also, and they defeated the 
proposal on June 6. We're developing a new proposal" for future consideration.

WHO ARE YOU?; 
</P>
<P>
USE OF MAIDEN, MARRIED NAME -- OR BOTH -- CAN OFTEN SPELL CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA HAZLEWOOD, Sara Hazlewood is a free-lance writer who lives in Orange. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do you hesitate when someone asks what your name is or when you come to the 
part of a form where you're asked to identify yourself? If so, you might be 
suffering from an increasingly common disorder called "Women Who Have Kept 
Their Maiden Name but Sometimes Use Their Husband's." 
</P>
<P>
When I decided to retain my name nine years ago, it didn't seem like a 
particularly momentous decision. I had grown accustomed to it and had no desire 
to start all over with a new one. My husband supported me and understood 
completely. We both agreed, however, that there were older relatives who would 
not understand and I would use his name in my dealings with them. In 
retrospect, that is how this nightmare started. From then on it became easier 
to do the same in other situations. And soon I became a habitual name changer. 
</P>
<P>
The first real problem we experienced was when we had children and started 
using baby-sitters. Naively, I gave my name to them without a second thought. 
It was not until they started calling back that the problem surfaced. "There 
isn't a Mr. Hazlewood here," my husband would explain, only to have a confused 
teen-ager insist she had baby-sat for us once. Eventually he learned to answer 
in a noncommittal manner until he learned the purpose of the call. 
</P>
<P>
Things reached an all-time low, however, when my husband was forced one day to 
identify himself as Mr. Hazlewood. I persuaded him to do this in lieu of a 
lengthy explanation to the caller. He did so, with a great deal of 
embarrassment, but refused any further involvement in name swapping. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I relented and started giving my husband's name to baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
Another area of contention is the whole problem of reservations. We are 
continually forgetting what name the dinner reservations are under and what 
name to give the shoe repair service when we go to pick up our shoes. 
</P>
<P>
One of our biggest fiascoes was in regard to airline reservations for a 
vacation to Seattle. My sister, who lives in San Francisco, was boarding there 
and accompanying us on our vacation. She generously donated one of her 
frequent-flier vouchers in order for me to receive a free trip. One of the 
rules was that only a family member with the same last name could use the 
ticket. So she proceeded to make reservations for the two of us under our 
common last name as well as for my husband and two children. Meanwhile, my 
husband, who was organizing the trip, was also making reservations for all of 
us. For the sake of convenience, he had my reservation under his name. So we 
ended up with 10 seats on the plane. One evening an angry airline reservation 
agent telephoned trying to figure out who all these people were. I was going 
through a rather complicated explanation when he finally asked: "Now let me get 
this straight. How many people are really going, and which name is really 
yours?" 
</P>
<P>
Then comes kindergarten with endless forms to fill out. Some do not even have a 
space for my last name; they just assume it is the same as my husband's. 
Sometimes I just use the name that fits best in the space given. No one seems 
to care, and I'm not sure anyone is reading those forms anyway. 
</P>
<P>
I knew I was in the name-changing business for good when I volunteered to work 
in my son's class. He had a very traditional teacher, a no-nonsense sort of 
person whom I could never imagine being "Ms." anyone. When a mother first works 
there she is introduced by her child to the whole class. I did not realize this 
until my son started asking some peculiar questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, what is your name?" he inquired after school one day. 
</P>
<P>
He knows the answer but has trouble understanding why everyone else's mother 
has the same last name as the rest of the family. He became increasingly 
agitated as the day approached for me to go with him. He finally admitted he 
was worried about what name to use when he introduced me. Here is a boy who has 
the only duck-tail haircut in his class, and he was worrying about being 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of being young came rushing back -- the terribly wrong dress I was 
forced to wear, and the unmatched socks I had to wear because one of my five 
sisters beat me to the sock drawer. All those painful moments when the price of 
being different was too high. And so I relented and became Mrs. Slade in 
matters pertaining to school. 
</P>
<P>
I stubbornly cling to my name in the midst of all these compromises. It helps 
that I'm not the only one going through this. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best solution is offered by British royalty. In that vast multitude 
of names that Prince Charles and Andrew pronounce at weddings, there is not one 
last name. As a matter of fact, Queen Elizabeth's husband gave up his last name 
when he married her. There is no chance of that happening in our household. 
Despite the inevitable confusion, I intend to keep my dual identity. My father 
-- who, after six daughters, finally gave up on his dream of having a son to 
carry on the family name -- would be proud.

LIFE ON WHEELS: GRATEFUL TO BE DEEMED WORTHY OF INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, a California auto insurance company was kind enough to permit me to 
write a check for several hundred dollars as a down payment on a year's worth 
of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
This was far and away the most I've ever paid for car insurance. But hefty as 
it was, the check didn't seem like quite enough, somehow. I got the feeling I 
should have enclosed a thank you note as well. The nice young woman who 
accepted the check on the insurance company's behalf kept telling me how lucky 
I was that the company was willing to take my money. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, that seemed to make sense, because we'd just spent nearly an 
hour looking through computers and charts to find one that would. Even then, 
she had to call and get a company employee to tell her it was OK. And this was 
the same company I've been dealing with for three years now. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that after suffering a direct hit from Proposition 103 last year, 
the insurance companies are sort of like wounded bears. They're frightened, in 
pain, no longer able to distinguish between irresponsible, expensive drivers 
and those of us who have been faithfully sending them money year after year 
without ever costing them a penny (aside from the modest expense of preparing 
and mailing our bills and, of course, cashing our checks). They've lost 
whatever trust they once had in humans, and they seem ready to lash out at 
anyone who comes within swiping distance. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, you can hardly blame them. They know that millions of their loyal 
customers turned on them last November, but they have no way of finding out who 
those dastardly folks might be, aside from the fact that most of them live in 
California's eight most populous counties, including Orange County. Places 
where, not coincidentally, auto insurance rates were (and still are) the 
state's highest. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 was supposed to roll back insurance rates 20% from their 1987 
levels. It passed and was upheld by the state Supreme Court. So I was a little 
surprised to get a bill a few weeks ago that was 15% higher than last year's. 
California Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's announcement on Monday 
that she had ordered a freeze of up to six months on increases in private 
passenger auto insurance rates may have made headlines, but it made no 
difference in situations like mine, where rates were already higher. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, I couldn't have paid that bill even if I'd wanted to, 
because it was for my share of a joint policy for which I am no longer eligible 
as a result of a change in family circumstances that I hadn't yet notified my 
insurance company about. When I called and explained the situation, my agent 
told me I'd have to start from scratch, at -- you guessed it -- a higher rate. 
Even though my insurer and I have a longstanding relationship in which, so far, 
I've made no demands, the rules said that history was worthless. I had to be 
treated like a new customer, a veritable stranger. And since Proposition 103, 
my agent explained, most companies in the state are reluctant to take on new 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't just mail in my payment as I'd done in years past, nor could I 
authorize anything over the phone. I had to make an appointment, go to the 
office and fill out an application. I considered shopping around on my own, but 
things seemed complicated enough. So I stuck with the same agent I'd had for 
years, an independent broker who deals with several companies. At least to her, 
I wasn't a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
When I showed up at the office, however, my agent had the day off, but she had 
arranged for one of her co-workers to take care of me. 
</P>
<P>
I answered lots of personal questions, stopping just short of revealing my shoe 
size or whether I'd ever gone all the way on a first date. Did I have children? 
Were they living in my household? With some companies, that made a difference, 
whether the children were old enough to drive legally or not even tall enough 
to reach the gas pedal and the steering wheel at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, they wanted to know what I did for a living, and how I went 
about it. Everything went smoothly until I revealed that I'm a telecommuter, 
working out of my home most of the time with my telephone, modem and personal 
computer. Since that means I spend less time on the road, I figured, 
innocently, that I might get a discount for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh-oh," the woman said, the color draining from her face. She crumpled the 
application we'd been working on and tossed it into the wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I say something wrong?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That company won't insure people who work out of their homes," she said. "They 
feel it's a much greater risk because you're out driving around all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"They've never heard of computers?" I asked, explaining that my in-home office 
helps keep me off the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't take that into account," she said, tapping the keyboard of the 
computer in front of her. Other companies weren't so strict, she explained, but 
in any case, my work arrangements meant I was going to have to pay a little 
more. 
</P>
<P>
After some more keyboard tapping and chart flipping, she determined that my 
best bet would be the company I've had all along. But first she had to call and 
get a special dispensation for me, because I was, after all, a new customer. As 
I watched helplessly, checkbook in hand, she eloquently pleaded my case. After 
a few minutes, the man on the other end acquiesced. 
</P>
<P>
As the woman hung up the phone, I opened my checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait," she said as I uncapped my pen, "you have to sign these forms first." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was time to write the check. "Would you prefer a one-pay, two-pay, 
three-pay, four-pay or nine-pay plan?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that my total premium would be around $1,000, I chose the four-pay 
plan. I handed her the check, she handed me some papers, and I went home, 
relieved and grateful that I had been deemed worthy of car insurance. 
</P>
<P>
So what do you think? Should I send a nice card? Maybe some flowers? Or wait, I 
know: a tip! Let's see, at 15% of my bill, that would be . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nah.

BAKKER GUILTY OF FLEECING HIS TV FLOCK OF $3 MILLION;

<P>
JURY TAKES 10 HOURS TO DECIDE

<P>
Disgraced TV evangelist Jim Bakker was convicted today of fleecing followers of 
$3.7 million so he could surround himself with everything from Rolls-Royces to 
diamonds to an air-conditioned doghouse. A federal jury deliberated only 10 
hours before convicting him on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy for 
overselling time shares, or "partnerships," at his ministry's resort hotels to 
loyal followers of his PTL empire. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old baby-faced preacher could receive up to 120 years in prison and 
$5 million in fines. He was freed on $250,000 bail for sentencing Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Jim Jones Mentality' 
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge Robert Potter said he was nervous about allowing bail because 
Bakker's supporters were "so zealous they have a Jim Jones mentality. They 
think he walks on water, and he is an end-all and be-all." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Bakker diverted donations to live in style, buying fancy cars, 
Rolex watches and homes with gigantic walk-in closets, motorized bedroom 
drapes, gold-plated swan-shaped bathroom fixtures and a $500 shower curtain. 
</P>
<P>
The evangelist and his wife, Tammy Faye, sat silently as the verdict was read. 
As they left the courtroom, supporters broke down in tears and shouted, "Oh, my 
God!" 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Faye sang a hymn on the steps of the courthouse and declared: "It's not 
over till it's over. I have a great faith in the God I've served, and he will 
not let us down." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer George Davis said he will appeal. "There is a court we can go 
to, and we will get justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Criticized 
</P>

"The prosecution did an excellent job. We kept looking for something from the 
defense, and we never saw it," jury foreman Ricky Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker was found guilty of defrauding supporters of $158 million by overselling 
time shares for lodging at his giant Heritage USA religious theme park in Ft. 
Mill, S.C., 12 miles from Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
In return for $1,000, buyers of the time shares, called life partnerships, were 
entitled to three nights of lodging each year for life at park hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged that Bakker sold twice as many time shares as could be 
accommodated at the hotels, one of which was never completed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bakker was convicted of diverting $3.7 million of the money to buy 
luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of its popularity, Bakker's "Jim and Tammy Show" was seen on 
hundreds of cable television stations that had a potential audience of 13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But his empire collapsed after it was revealed that Bakker had an affair with 
Jessica Hahn, a former church secretary in Massapequa, N.Y., a New York suburb, 
and the ministry paid her to hush it up. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker resigned in March, 1987, and his ministry subsequently went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the trial began, Bakker's lawyers said he was unable to continue 
because he was hallucinating and hiding under a couch in their office. 
</P>
<P>
Potter ordered a week of mental tests. 
</P>
<P>
A psychiatrist found he was not mentally ill, saying he had merely suffered a 
panic attack.

DALAI LAMA WINS NOBEL PRIZE FOR PEACE EFFORTS; 
</P>
<P>
'DEEPLY TOUCHED,' TIBETAN SPIRITUAL LEADER SAYS ON RECEIVING NEWS IN NEWPORT 
BEACH 
</P>

Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, was awarded the 1989 Nobel Peace 
Prize today for decades of nonviolent efforts to free his country from Chinese 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
The world's leading Buddhist received the news early in the morning at the Big 
Canyon home of Clifford and Elaine Heinz in Newport Beach, where he is staying 
while attending a peace conference in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply touched to be chosen as this year's recipient," he said. "I hope 
this prize will provide courage to the 6 million people of Tibet." 
</P>
<P>
While he said he hopes his selection will strengthen those pursuing the cause 
of peace, he also accused China of trying to systematically crush the Tibetan 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the imposition of martial law in Lhasa last March, Tibet has been sealed 
off, and while global attention has focused on the tragic events in China, a 
systematic effort to crush the spirit and national identity of the Tibetan 
people is being pursued by the government of the People's Republic," he said. 
"Tibetans today are facing the real possibility of elimination as a people and 
a nation." 
</P>
<P>
In its citation, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee mentioned the Dalai Lama's 
rejection of violence and his preachings of respect for all living things. It 
praised his "constructive and forward-looking proposals for the solution of 
international conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the intent of the award was to deliver a message of support to 
the pro-democracy movement in China. They also indicated the prize might help 
eventually break the deadlock between China, which has occupied the Himalayan 
nation known as the Roof of the World since 1950, and the Dalai Lama, a popular 
leader of an exile government in Dharmsala, India. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the spiritual leader accused the Chinese Communist government of 
"practicing a form of genocide by relocating millions of Chinese settlers into 
Tibet." He said that there are now more Chinese than Tibetans in Tibet. He 
asked that "this massive population transfer be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Newport Marriott Hotel, the Dalai Lama said the students who 
demonstrated in Beijing earlier this year "have given me great hope for the 
future of China and Tibet. I feel that their movement follows the tradition of 
Mahatma Gandhi's . . . nonviolence which has deeply inspired me ever since I 
was a small boy."

ARMED YOUTH HOLDS SCHOOL CLASS HOSTAGE, WOUNDS 1;

<P>
SURRENDERS TO POLICE IN ANAHEIM

A 14-year-old student armed with a shotgun and handgun walked into a drama 
class at Loara High School in Anaheim today, held 36 students hostage for 
nearly 40 minutes and shot one pupil in the face before surrendering, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at the scene identified the suspect as Cory Robb, who is a freshman 
at the high school but was not enrolled in the drama class. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Lopez, 15, was in satisfactory condition at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange after he was shot on the left side of his face. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reportedly Taunting Suspect 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a student in the drama class, was one of several in the class reportedly 
taunting the suspect, believing his threats were a practical joke. Season 
Rodriguez, another member of the class, said Lopez mocked the suspect, saying, 
" 'Oh, we've got a suicidal killer on our hands.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said, "Everybody thought it was a joke. . . . I don't think Cory 
meant to go in there and shoot anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said the armed youth entered the campus choir 
room in an auditorium where the drama students were gathered about 9:30 a.m. 
Rodriguez said the youth appeared calm and said he did not intend to harm 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he just wanted to get even with his (step)father," said Rodriguez, 
adding that suspect said he planned to keep the students "several hours." 
</P>
<P>
After the taunting, the suspect then fired one shot, Rodriguez said. Soon 
after, he released Lopez, who was bleeding but was able to walk out. The 
suspect also released several girls from the classroom and allowed Rodriguez to 
use a telephone in the room to call her father. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Rodriguez said the girls in the class "were crying and 
screaming, and half the boys were getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said officers were en route to the campus when they learned one 
student had been wounded. The ordeal began during first period, and school 
officials, using the campus public address system, advised teachers to ignore 
the school bells and keep students in their classrooms and lock the doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persuaded to Surrender 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said police negotiators, using the telephone into the room, were able 
to persuade the suspect to surrender, and about 10:10 a.m. he walked out of the 
classroom. He was taken into custody for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the youth was armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and a semiautomatic 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Students and parents who gathered in front of the campus in the 1700 block of 
W. Cerritos Avenue said the youth has had problems at home, particularly with 
his stepfather. It was unclear why he went to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Robb attended Ball Junior High School last year. Friends said he was quiet and 
somewhat of a loner, though he was considered friendly. He also had a 
"fascination for guns," said a woman who knows the youth and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists were being sent to the scene to talk to some students, who were 
then expected to be released to their parents. 
</P>

and Bob Schwartz.

BUSH FACES MINOR SURGERY FOR REMOVAL OF CYST ON RIGHT HAND

President Bush will undergo surgery to remove a mycoid cyst from the middle 
finger of his right hand, the White House said today. Bush vowed to keep 
working despite "this awesome burden." 
</P>
<P>
The President, making light of the minor surgery, said there was no need to 
make "a federal case out of it." Asked to raise the finger for a photo, he 
replied, "Don't tempt me." 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will undergo the procedure -- 
expected to take about an hour -- on Friday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The cyst, on the end of his finger just below the nail, has troubled Bush for 
about three years. "It simply has reached the point where it has gotten larger 
and noticeable," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the President, who is left-handed, will be given a local anesthetic and 
remain awake throughout the procedure. He said there will be a biopsy, although 
"clinical observation indicates that the cyst is benign." 
</P>
<P>
"There will of course be a routine pathological examination of the tissue," 
Fitzwater said.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Warner Bros. television executives announced today 
that the two-time Democratic presidential candidate will host a weekly talk 
show to be syndicated nationally beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he will use his international contacts to interview world leaders 
of all viewpoints as well as nonpolitical figures not usually seen on American 
television to create a freewheeling debate on a variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. executives said they hope to line up as many as 100 stations 
around the country once the program is offered for syndication starting in the 
fall of 1990.

SENATE PASSES BILL BANNING FLAG BURNING; 
</P>
<P>
GOP CHANGE MAKES IT VULNERABLE IN COURT, DEMOCRATS SAY

<P>
The Senate today approved a ban on burning or otherwise defacing the American 
flag but added a Republican-sponsored change that Democrats said could make the 
bill vulnerable in any future court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, previously approved by the House, cleared the Senate 91 to 9. It was 
returned to the House for consideration of changes made by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Key votes came on two GOP-sponsored changes in wording that Democrats said 
would skew careful phrasing that was designed to beat back expected court 
challenges to the bill's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amendment Preferred 
</P>
<P>
Republican critics say the bill already is likely to fail such a court test. 
They prefer a constitutional amendment as urged by President Bush after the 
Supreme Court in June overturned the criminal conviction on Texas flag-burner 
Gregory Lee Johnson on the ground that his freedom of speech had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling resulted in a public reaction that fueled congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmishing on the Senate floor, however, was between Democrats seeking to 
push their bill through and Republicans hoping to replace it with the proposed 
amendment. That measure comes up later this month. 
</P>
<P>
In rapid succession, the Senate first refused, 69 to 31, to kill an amendment 
offered by Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) that would make it a crime to 
"physically defile" the flag. It then adopted by a wide margin Wilson's 
measure, which Democratic sponsors said would nudge the bill toward 
constitutional problems on free-speech grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate then voted 53 to 47 to kill a proposal by Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) to exempt flag defacement that took place in private. Sponsors said 
that also could make the measure vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting Against Bill 
</P>
<P>
Those voting against the final bill were Dole and Sens. John H. Chaffee 
(R-R.I.), Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Gordon J. 
Humphrey (R-N.H.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), Howard M. 
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for up to a $1,000 fine and year in jail for anyone who burns an 
American flag or defaces it in any one of several other ways. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law already bans flag burning, but senators say the law contains 
constitutional pitfalls similar to the ones in the Texas statute. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Republicans urge the amendment on the ground that it would settle 
the issue once and for all. It could not be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
Some senators said they detected a distinct cooling of emotions on the issue in 
the months since the Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no grass-roots firestorm for jailing flag burners nor for amending the 
Constitution," Metzenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
But Metzenbaum said enough passion remains that lawmakers are wary of opposing 
a ban.

E. GERMANS TOLD NOT TO USE U.S. EMBASSIES FOR REFUGE

The United States today sent a signal to East Germans seeking to emigrate to 
the West not to use American embassies as a place of refuge. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. embassies are not equipped 
to handle a large number of people hoping to leave their country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our embassies and other diplomatic missions overseas generally do not have the 
capability to handle even a limited number of people . . . especially people 
who have to seek to depart their home country by sitting in at a foreign 
embassy," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen East Germans who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin earlier 
this week left after the government promised to review their cases positively 
and not to take reprisals against them. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher warned people thinking of copying them that there is no guarantee of 
receiving similar assurances from the East German government in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We would also note that people put themselves in a potentially difficult 
situation with respect to their own government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that most fleeing East Germans want to go to West Germany, not the 
United States, but said Washington remains ready to raise the cases of 
individuals wishing to emigrate and other issues of humanitarian concern. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Bush said he was moved by the exodus of East Germans and 
hailed West Germany's handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"America stands with the forces of change," Bush said during a Rose Garden 
ceremony honoring German-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are riveted, and I am moved, by the tens of thousands of East Germans 
sacrificing all that they own . . . to find their way to the West," Bush said 
in his first public comments on the mass exodus. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to praise the actions of (West Germany) in rising to the challenge 
presented by these events," Bush told a small gathering that included 12 
members of West Germany's Bundestag, or Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the day when Germans will not have to climb fences, freeze 
in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a free 
society," Bush said.

Fulton County Judge John Bruner had told Terry, leader of the group Operation

stay out of the Atlanta area and not violate Georgia law.

But Terry, 30, told the judge, "In good conscience, I cannot pay the fine." He

TRUMP IN SURPRISE $7-BILLION OFFER FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES 
</P>

<P>
New York developer Donald Trump today made an unsolicited $7-billion proposal 
to acquire AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, AMR announced. 
</P>
<P>
A buyout at the price proposed by Trump, if actually completed, would be the 
biggest airline purchase ever. 
</P>
<P>
American spokesman Al Becker said the company had received a "unilateral 
unsolicited letter" proposing a $120 a share buyout by Trump, who bought 
Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle service in March for $365 million. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial trading delay, AMR stock opened at $107 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange, up sharply from its Wednesday close of $82.75. The shares 
had settled back to $102.50 by around midday. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the cast of characters, the lack of information right now, I feel like 
(Trump's) got a tough row to hoe," said Kevin Burke, who follows the airline 
industry for First Union Corp., a bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said the $120 offer was at the high end of analysts' estimates of AMR's 
worth. It also came as a surprise, "especially since it was his opening salvo, 
so to speak. You would think he would have a few ducks in reserve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With 58.9 million outstanding common shares of AMR stock, a $120-a-share offer 
would be worth more than $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest airline buyout ever was an investor group's $3.65-billion purchase 
of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, earlier this year. A group led by 
United Airlines pilots and senior management has offered to buy that carrier's 
parent, UAL Corp., for $6.75 billion but the proposal remains pending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus of Attention 
</P>
<P>
AMR has been the focus of heated takeover speculation recently and last week it 
asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate financial wire 
reports about takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's letter stated that his offer was "subject to the execution of a 
mutually satisfactory definitive acquisition agreement," and that Trump 
believes that "the financing necessary for the proposed transaction will be 
obtained within a reasonable period of time." 
</P>

AMR's board of directors will consider Trump's offer "in due course," Becker 
said from AMR headquarters in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Becker stated there has been no change in AMR's policy "that AMR and its 
shareholders will be best served by AMR remaining an independent company and 
continuing the strong partnership among American Airlines, its employees, the 
communities it serves, and the public -- a partnership that has given AMR the 
great success it enjoys today." 
</P>
<P>
AMR also stated that it continues to believe that excess levels of debt in the 
airline industry are not in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Takes 12% Jump 
</P>
<P>
In August, AMR stock jumped 12% as reports circulated that the company had 
retained two investment firms to help defend against any takeover. 
</P>
<P>
News reports said AMR has retained Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman Sachs 
&amp; Co. to advise the Ft. Worth-based company, but AMR would neither confirm 
nor deny the report.

GAMBLING ADDICT? HARRAH'S WILL HELP

<TEXT>
<P>
Harrah's will become Nevada's first hotel-casino to help compulsive gamblers 
break the habit that enriches gaming halls but destroys lives. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel-casino said it will donate $250 a month for the next year to operate 
a hot line for addicted gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
William Sherman, the resort's attorney, said signs soon will be posted telling 
customers and employees where to call for help. The hot line will be operated 
by the Nevada Council on Compulsive Gambling and could go into operation as 
early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Signs listing a telephone number to help addicted gamblers have been posted in 
Atlantic City's 12 casinos since 1987. But casinos in Nevada have ignored the 
problem of compulsive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, the Harrah's corporation owns Harrah's Reno, Harrah's Lake Tahoe, 
Bill's Lake Tahoe Casino, the Holiday Casino in Las Vegas and Harrah's Del Rio 
in Laughlin.

STRAPPED B. ALTMAN JOINS FLOCK OF OTHER RETAIL STORES PUT UP FOR SALE

The venerable department store chain B. Altman &amp; Co., whose Australian 
owner filed for bankruptcy protection in August, is joining a host of other 
well-known retailers on the auction block, the Australian company said today. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker Corp. of Australia's U.S. subsidiary, L. J. Hooker Corp., which also 
owns the upscale Bonwit Teller chain, said it hopes for a "quick sale" of its 
seven Altman stores. The department stores are in New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The Altman chain is the latest among the nation's best-known department stores 
to put up the "For Sale" sign, although industry analysts do not expect it to 
bring top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Altman's will have to compete to attract buyers with retailing stars like 
Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's, as well as Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall 
Field, whose British owner BAT Industries is unloading them as part of an 
attempt to avoid a takeover from Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Suppliers of both the Altman and Bonwit Teller chains had slowed sales to the 
stores as Hooker sank deeper into debt. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker arranged a $50-million line of credit in August with General Electric 
Co.'s GE Capital subsidiary and was forced to pay in advance for goods.

DISNEY CHARACTERS BOMBARDED AS COMPANY OFFERS PARIS SHARES

<P>
Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Pluto met a shower of ketchup and eggs on the 
steps of the Bourse, the Paris stock exchange, today. 
</P>
<P>
The sticky barrage was hurled by about 100 French communist demonstrators 
seeking to spoil a party organized to announce the offer price of shares in 
Europe's Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co., who was in Paris to announce the 
offer price of $11.20 a share, was also a target for the missiles, along with 
people dressed up in suits depicting other Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
The shares are being floated to help finance construction of a new Disney theme 
park on the outskirts of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators yelling "Mickey go home!" and "EuroDisneyland: dirty deal of the 
century!" also showered onlookers with fake $500 bills as Disney executives 
looked on. No police were present. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner said the demonstration had nothing to do with Disney. "Those people were 
asking for more money from the government. These local issues are not related 
to the Disney company." 
</P>
<P>
"Who could possibly be against Cinderella and Snow White? EuroDisneyland is 
going to create 12,000 jobs in France," said Disney's European chief, Frank 
Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to celebrate the share launch with dancing in front of the Bourse were 
called off after the demonstration.

Easy Goer takes a four-race winning streak into the $1,099,000 Jockey Club Gold 
Cup on Saturday against a seven-horse field that includes the only other horse 
to beat archrival Sunday Silence this year. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-mile Gold Cup will be Easy Goer's last race before once again 
confronting Sunday Silence in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Gulfstream 
Park. In all likelihood, Horse of the Year will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Easy Goer must contend with a field, entered today, which 
includes the 3-year-old colt Prized, who beat Sunday Silence in the Swaps 
Stakes one start after Easy Goer beat him at the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer will be ridden by Pat Day. Eddie Delahoussaye gets the ride aboard 
Prized. Also in the field will be three horses Easy Goer already has beaten -- 
Forever Silver, Cryptoclearance and Its Acedemic -- along with Jack of Clubs 
and Impersonator.

GOODEN'S ARM TESTED: NO CANCER 
</P>

<P>
Dwight Gooden had his pitching arm checked for a possible cancerous tumor, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is fine," the New York Mets star told the New York Daily News. 
"There's no problem at all. But for a while, it was in the back of my mind. I 
had no idea what to think." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the scare began when an unidentified man, who claimed to be 
a doctor affiliated with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York, called the Players Assn. last month and said the shoulder injury that 
sidelined Gooden for much of the second half of the season may have been the 
result of a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
After he learned of the call, Gooden said, he discussed the possibility of 
cancer with Mets team physician Dr. James Parkes. Gooden then underwent a 
gallium scan, in which dye was injected into his shoulder to locate a possible 
malignancy. The results were negative, the Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
"They did that scan, and everything is fine," Gooden said. "I'm happy with the 
way Dr. Parkes has taken care of it." 
</P>
<P>
New York Newsday quoted an unidentified club source as saying the Mets did not 
consider a biopsy of the area -- considered the most reliable way to detect a 
malignancy -- because any such exploratory surgery "would probably end Dwight's 
career." 
</P>
<P>
One club official told the Daily News that it is possible Gooden injured the 
arm years ago and that the lesion is scar tissue. There also is the possibility 
Gooden compounded his condition by pitching too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Mets Manager Davey Johnson said, "It was a legitimate scare four or five weeks 
ago, but what I was told was that it was scar tissue."

TORONTO HOPING RETURN TO SKYDOME WILL SPARK TURNAROUND AGAINST A'S

The SkyDome, open or closed, has never looked so good to the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 0-2 to the Oakland Athletics in the best-of-7 American League 
playoffs, the Blue Jays must win two out of three when the playoffs resume in 
Toronto Friday to avoid being eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays moved into the SkyDome on June 5 and lost to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't like it much at first. George Bell said the ball didn't carry. 
Lloyd Moseby said it was hard to judge a fly ball. The pitchers didn't like the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
All that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays finished the season 34-20 in the SkyDome, including victories in 
20 of their last 26 games at home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toronto Hopes for Comeback 
</P>
<P>
Now Toronto hopes to turn the championship series around starting Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The home crowd should help a lot," reliever Tom Henke said. "If we get some 
key hits in the right situations, we'll be right back in it." 
</P>
<P>
In the first two games, the Blue Jays lost because they didn't get the key 
hits. They really didn't get many hits of any kind. In the two losses at 
Oakland, the Blue Jays had 10, one for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto suffered a team-wide letdown at Oakland. Their hitters are being outhit 
.317 to .164. The starters and bullpen have both faltered, allowing 13 runs for 
a 6.19 ERA to Oakland's 2.50. The defense allowed an unearned run in each game, 
and catcher Ernie Whitt is 0-for-10 in trying to throw out baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Several Blue Jays are in slumps. Fred McGriff, who led Toronto with 36 homers, 
hasn't hit one since Sept. 4. His last extra-base hit was on Sept 13. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Mazzilli, the designated hitter in the first two games, has one hit in his 
last 22 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"They are playing more aggressively than we are right now," Toronto outfielder 
Mookie Wilson said. "We just have to get it together and try to bounce back now 
that we are going home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unable to Stop Henderson 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays have been unable to stop Rickey Henderson from running wild on 
the base paths. Henderson has been on base seven times in nine plate 
appearances. He has six steals in the series, breaking the playoff record of 
five previously held by Davey Lopes (1981) and Steve Sax (1988), both with Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the team that won a hard-earned AL East title at home just five days ago is 
hardly glum about its position. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing bad," third baseman Kelly Gruber said. "We could play 
better, sure. But I don't believe I've seen a mistake over there (by the A's) 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later you're going to be flat, something's going to happen. 
Eventually we'll catch some breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Key (13-14) will start Game 3 for Toronto against Storm Davis (19-7).

Jim Rooker had plenty of walks and strikeouts in a 12-year major league 
pitching career, but he has never struck out on a walk like this. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates' announcer hopes to last 12 days on "Rook's 
Unintentional Walk," a 315-mile trek across Pennsylvania that started today in 
Philadelphia and resulted from a quip made during a June 8 broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates seemed on their way to ending a six-game losing streak by taking a 
10-0 lead in the first inning in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose this game, I'll walk home," Rooker, 47, told broadcast partner John 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't have to, but I will," Rooker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates wound up losing 15-11, but Rooker accompanied them home. Back in 
Pittsburgh, so many fans questioned Rooker about the off-the-cuff comment, he 
agreed to walk from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh for charity. 
</P>
<P>
Rooker, who will be accompanied by a support crew in a motor home, plans to 
walk a minimum of 18 miles and a maximum of 33 miles a day, weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
Rooker knows the walk could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have said it in Los Angeles," he said.
