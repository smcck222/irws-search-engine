<P>
Federal agents Thursday seized what they believe is more than 3 1/2 tons of 
cocaine from a propane-filled tanker truck, the largest volume of cocaine ever 
confiscated at the California-Mexico border, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs agents discovered the cocaine 
at 2 p.m. Thursday after spending nearly 30 hours bleeding propane from the 
Mexican tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Agents stopped the northbound truck about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Otay Mesa 
border cargo inspection station after noticing it was nearly 7,500 pounds 
heavier than it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, a Mexican whose name was withheld, was allowed to leave the scene 
because federal officers were unable to readily determine Wednesday whether 
drugs were inside. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hardy, acting district director for the U.S. Customs office in San Diego, 
said his agency was seeking to find the driver, who could face life in prison 
and a $4-million fine if caught, charged and convicted of cocaine smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't hold him an inordinate amount of time," Hardy said. "Right 
now he's at large." 
</P>
<P>
Agents estimated the seizure at more than 3 1/2 tons, although the exact amount 
of cocaine in the Hidro Gas Juarez tanker was uncertain late Thursday because 
heavy fumes slowed the unloading of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure -- which federal officials estimated to be worth $85 million 
wholesale and $425 million at street prices -- is the largest ever in San Diego 
County and the second-largest ever in Southern California. A world-record 21 
tons of cocaine was discovered at a San Fernando Valley warehouse a little more 
than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was loaded with loose bricks of cocaine cut into kilos, some wrapped 
in plastic bags and some wrapped in cellophane. One law enforcement official 
said it is impossible to determine exactly how much cocaine was inside because 
the truck's weight was not known. 
</P>
<P>
"If the truck was filled with steel, the total amount of cocaine could be 
less," the source said. "Then again, it could be a lot more, almost up to 10 
tons. The tanker was loaded to the gills." 
</P>
<P>
The truck's manifest, which shows its destination, indicated the truck had 
nothing more than gas inside. Federal agents became suspicious because of the 
weight discrepancy and held the truck overnight at the border crossing. On 
Thursday, they used narcotics-sniffing dogs, which detected cocaine inside, 
Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents could not get into the truck until 2 p.m. Thursday because of the gas 
and fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Diego Fire Department bomb squad, fire investigation unit 
and hazardous-materials unit checked for explosives inside before agents 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said the U.S. Customs district in San Diego had seized 200 pounds of 
cocaine during the fiscal year ended last week. During the fiscal year before 
that, it seized 3,135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
One drug enforcement official said late Thursday that propane tankers are more 
typically used by smugglers to haul marijuana. Cocaine is usually transported 
in commercial trucks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest-ever drug bust occurred in late September, 1989, when federal 
agents seized almost 20 tons of cocaine -- worth an estimated $6 billion on the 
street -- at a warehouse in the San Fernando Valley community of Sylmar. Agents 
confiscated an additional $12.2 million in cash there. 
</P>
<P>
Seven men were arrested in what Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner later 
said was part of a massive operation that had funneled at least 60 tons of 
drugs into the country during 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Drug Enforcement Administration said the Sylmar seizure 
represented about 5% of the world's annual production of cocaine -- more than 
growers in Peru, the world's largest supplier, can produce in a month. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just powder on the table," Donald Hamilton, a DEA spokesman, said 
at the time. "It's more like powder on the football field." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators later determined that the Sylmar operation was linked to 
warehouses in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, U.S. Border Patrol and Customs agents seized 969 pounds -- or 
0.485 of a ton -- of cocaine worth a street value of $60 million from youths 
who were carrying the drug in duffel bags across the border just southeast of 
Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
That same month, Border Patrol agents seized 767 pounds of cocaine at the San 
Onofre checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The largest San Diego-area border seizure had been in September, 1986, near 
Jacumba, when 1,285 pounds, or 0.64 of a ton, were confiscated.

AIR AMERICA AND DRUGS IN LAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Air America" is an addlebrained aerial comedy that sets out to malign the 
reputations of the former pilots, and crews, of the real Air America, a CIA 
proprietary cargo hauling airline that flew missions, often under combat 
conditions, in Laos during the protracted Indochina conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Cockburn's article charges, by dredging up a book written 18 years ago, that 
Air America was involved in transporting opium out of Laos for distribution in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he claims to be the sole keeper of the "truth" brave enough to expose 
Air America's purported involvement in drug-running to the public. In reality, 
Cockburn's charges are nothing more than blatant fabrications that have been 
investigated many times over the years and found to be bogus. 
</P>
<P>
I am a retired CIA official, and during my long tenure with the agency I served 
for several years in Laos. During my tour in Laos, I flew on many operational 
missions with Air America pilots, and they demonstrated to me that they were 
highly professional and honorable men.

SURROGATE MOM'S CUSTODY CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial missed the main issue: Should surrogacy contracts be legal? And 
should the state protect us from the truth surrounding our birth and 
progenitors? 
</P>
<P>
Surrogacy usually necessitates an adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption experts have been publishing repudiations of their previous support 
for not only the secrecy mandated in the "adoption option" but the necessity 
for adoption itself since we now know that adoptees represent an alarmingly 
high ratio in psychiatric therapy in most psychiatric facilities. Surrogacy 
proponents will undoubtedly retract their views as they accumulate data on how 
desperation and deceit affect parties who had only the best of intentions. 
Alternate solutions for Baby Johnson include shared custody or guardianship 
with visitation by the non-custodial parent. 
</P>
<P>
In August, five California legislators voted out AB-3907, which would have 
permitted adoptees and parents the civil and human right to decide for 
themselves whether they wish to associate. A federal judge in Los Angeles 
denied adoptees and parents on AmFOR's class action challenging sealed adoption 
access to the courts. Meanwhile, adoptive parents in several states have been 
winning suits to return their "unsatisfactory" adoptive children. California 
has taken a giant step backward for mankind.

GERMANY NEEDS TO FACE THIS HONESTLY; 
</P>
<P>
EVIL ARMS DEALS IMPERIL AMERICANS IN THE GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreigners from many countries are desperately seeking permission to leave 
Iraq, but one group of Germans is in no hurry to be repatriated. As Times 
correspondent Mark Fineman reported from Baghdad, a number of businessmen and 
scientists fear that if they return to the Federal Republic they will be 
indicted for contributing to Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of involvement by German companies and citizens in Saddam Hussein's 
crash program to acquire advanced weapons is only now starting to emerge. In 
August, according to the Wall Street Journal, German Economics Minister Helmut 
Haussmann secretly briefed members of the Bundestag about aid provided by 
German companies to Iraq's armaments industries. The activities of at least 170 
companies are being looked into, and criminal proceedings have so far been 
launched against about 25. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's postwar constitution consciously reflects the bleakly cautionary 
lessons of modern German history. Among other things it bans weapons transfers 
to areas of international tension. That prohibition seems to have been evaded 
determinedly by various German firms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings of the secret Haussmann report are that three German 
companies supplied Iraq with the components to build the gas centrifuges needed 
to separate uranium-238 from uranium-235, a key step in producing weapons-grade 
nuclear material. 
</P>
<P>
At least one German company sold Iraq deadly mycotoxins for research to develop 
biological weapons. U.S. officials have revealed that Iraq will have such 
weapons operational within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Five German companies have helped Iraq upgrade its Soviet-supplied Scud-B 
missiles to carry conventional or chemical warheads greater distances. 
</P>
<P>
A German firm was the major supplier for plants that make nerve and mustard 
gases. And now comes news that the German arms industry may have indirectly 
helped Iraq develop a new fuel-air explosive of enormous destructive power. 
</P>
<P>
The greed of German companies -- and the laxity of German officials in 
suppressing this deadly illicit trade -- has helped give Saddam Hussein access 
to powerful weapons that not only threaten Iraq's neighbors but now imperil the 
lives of American and other forces sent to stand against his aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Germans, of course, were not the only villains in building up Iraq's war-making 
capability. The Soviet Union and France especially, though not exclusively, 
contributed to Iraq's potent arsenal. Americans may also have helped. The 
embargo has presumably put a stop to this trade for now, though what harm may 
yet result from what has gone before no one can say. The compelling lesson for 
the future is at any rate clear and unmistakable: Never again can civilized 
countries afford to permit such cynical and greed-driven trafficking in these 
appalling weapons. That is the lesson; the world can only pray now that it 
won't take a hideous experience on a Persian Gulf battlefield to assure that it 
will be heeded.

The best time to guide kids in the right direction is when they're young. The 
worst thing to do is to ignore the reality that more kids watch TV than, say, 
read the classics. 
</P>
<P>
So few people would argue with the notion that children's TV should constitute 
more than a means of selling products to kids. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House is said to be less than enthralled with the action of 
Congress in limiting the amount of TV advertising aimed at children. 
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate passed legislation to limit commercials on children's 
shows to 10 1/2 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on weekdays. 
Since TV stations were freed of ad restrictions in 1984, they were selling as 
much as 14 advertising minutes per hour. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also creates and funds a national endowment for children's 
educational TV -- and requires that the Federal Communications Commission 
review a TV station's educational and informative children's programming as 
part of its periodic license-renewal process. 
</P>
<P>
This should nudge broadcasters to develop new and creative shows -- and help 
address concerns that toy manufacturers dominate the Saturday morning airways 
with programs that are little more than thinly veiled merchandising ties-in for 
products they advertise. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is backed by children's advocacy groups, education associations 
and even the National Assn. of Broadcasters, which in the past has opposed laws 
to set limits on advertising. President Bush, as the self-proclaimed "Education 
President," should sign the bill.

I would much rather laugh at the antics of Mel Gibson and Robert Downey than

Turning a blind eye to the goings-on of our government isn't "American." It

AIR AMERICA AND DRUGS IN LAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Fury Won't Make the Truth Go Away," (Column Left, Commentary, Sept. 20) 
columnist Alexander Cockburn makes the serious charge that I doctored a later 
edition of my book "Air America" to enhance the reputation of the protagonists 
of a second book I was writing. This is completely untrue. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter on opium in my book "Air America" is expanded and updated -- not 
dropped -- to take into account further research. While writing a second book 
on the secret war in Laos -- "The Ravens" -- I inspected numerous documents 
that were classified when I first started my research, and conducted interviews 
with people involved in all aspects of the war. 
</P>
<P>
I concluded that the drug-smuggling in Laos was conducted by high military 
personnel in the Laotian military, and these were the people who profited from 
it. Unable to control their clients' activities, the U.S. government and the 
CIA turned a blind eye. 
</P>
<P>
This view is backed up by Prof. Al McCoy whose "legendary research" Cockburn so 
admires. McCoy states in his book, "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia": 
"Unlike some national intelligence agencies, the CIA did not dabble in the drug 
traffic to finance its clandestine operations." Again, McCoy points the finger 
at the Laotian military. And the professor has not been banned from mainstream 
academia, as Cockburn says, but enjoys tenure at the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Prof. William Leary, at the University of Georgia -- who has 
conducted exhaustive research into Air America -- concludes that "portions of 
the Laotian air force and high officials of the Laotian government" were the 
culprits in the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
A recent article in the New Yorker states that it is still the Laotian military 
today that conducts the drug trade -- under a communist government. 
</P>
<P>
Cockburn seems to have an ideological need to believe the trivialized and 
distorted view of the cartoon version of Air America, which is the movie -- 
described by its own screenwriter as "a fun, zany thing for the whole family, 
with laughs aplenty and big things blowing up." 
</P>
<P>
It is the movie -- and its misguided true-believers -- who are ignoring the 
truth, not those of us -- often from opposing political positions -- who have 
spent years of research in trying to shed light on a complicated and difficult 
subject.

SURROGATE MOM'S CUSTODY CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think that you should have given more thought to your editorial ("Give the 
Baby to the Genetic Parents," Sept. 22) position in the "Baby Boy Johnson" 
case. The problem appears to be more complex than your editorial would 
indicate. Traditionally, the birth mother has custody of a child. But is this 
because she is the genetic parent or because she has biologically supported the 
growing fetus? Until modern technology made it possible to transplant a tiny 
embryo into the womb of a surrogate "mother," this question never came up. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, being a genetic mother does not give one inviolable rights or 
adoptive parents would have no legal standing. But, you say, in this case the 
Calverts never gave up the baby; they had a contract. Well, I seem to recall 
that contracts selling human beings are void, against public policy -- 
something to do with slavery. In any case, what the Calverts gave up was a 
fertilized ovum, not a human, at least according to the laws of California. The 
nurturing, the life blood and the suffering that was required to change that 
blip of protoplasm into a human being was provided by Anna Johnson -- the 
mother. Now, you have decided that the mother should give up her child to the 
"genetic" parents because of some contract. It seems to me that all that can be 
had from Johnson is a refund of the $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder, if Johnson was not a poor black, would you be so willing to take the 
child from her? Certainly, the baby will have more advantages with his 
"genetic" parents. But the bonding of a birth parent is of considerable value, 
too. The point is, I think, that we must outlaw this whole surrogate process 
that treats a birth parent like a vending machine and reduces the mystery of 
human conception to an exercise in contract law.

PERSPECTIVE ON CULTURAL REUNIFICATION; 
</P>
<P>
TO TAINT ALL, DISCREDIT THE BEST; 
</P>
<P>
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AUTHOR CHRISTA WOLF IS PART OF AN ATTEMPT TO ERASE EAST 
GERMAN CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE SCHOEFER, Christine Schoefer writes on German politics and 
literature. She just completed a term as an associate of the Institute of 
International Studies at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christa Wolf, perhaps the most prominent woman writer in post-war Germany, has 
become the eye of a literary storm that threatens the cultural and even 
political identity of the former communist half of the nation. The West German 
literary Establishment, which lavished praise on her work and her role as an 
artist in East Germany for more than 20years, is using Wolf's latest 
publication, a novella titled "Was Bleibt?" (What Remains?) to launch an attack 
on her and all hitherto respected East German authors. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf has published a dozen volumes of fiction and nonfiction in East and West 
Germany, and her works have been translated in several languages, including 
English and Japanese. In 1980, she won West Germany's most prestigious literary 
award, the Buchner Prize. 
</P>
<P>
In "Was Bleibt?" Wolf chronicles a period when she was under surveillance of 
the East German security police. Critics accuse her of opportunism because she 
published the manuscript, which lay in her desk drawer for 10 years, only after 
the communist regime was toppled. They relegate her to the status of a 
privileged state poet, withholding material that might have been offensive to 
the regime. In fact, Wolf repeatedly criticized the East German regime, even 
though she was a party member. She represented integrity and a vision of 
socialism imbued with dignity, justice and tolerance. No doubt, Wolf's critical 
voice helped to shape the process of political self-assertion long before she 
addressed mass audiences at public rallies last autumn. The charge of "state 
poet," certainly misses the mark. But it strikes an extremely vulnerable spot 
because it is by far the easiest way to destroy Wolf's status as a spokeswoman. 
It goes without saying that if one of East Germany's most respected writers is 
discredited, all colleagues who shared her vision will be tainted. 
</P>
<P>
This turnabout of the West German literary Establishment, the vehemence of the 
attack and the suspicious unity of voices in various media is perplexing until 
it is fit into the larger picture of post-Wall German politics. Then, the 
"literary" campaign is consistent with the conservative model of German 
unification, which is intent on replacing East Germany's political and economic 
structures and erasing its culture. Gunter Grass, the most illustrious of 
Wolf's few defenders, made this connection in a recent interview when he 
protested, "We should not repeat in literature that which happens daily in the 
political and especially the economic sphere; namely the colonization of the 
GDR." The literary campaign has yet another version of the "German Question" at 
its core: The cultural and historical identity of the united Germany is at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
By styling Christa Wolf as a state poet, the Western literary Establishment 
extends to the cultural realm what is already accepted in politics and 
economics: the dichotomization of East Germans into victims and perpetrators. 
This all-or-nothing categorization erases those East Germans who shaped niches 
of freedom within the authoritarian social order, criticized the regime and 
finally revolted against it. By identifying exclusively with the victims, West 
Germans engage in the collective psychological maneuver of projecting the 
responsibility for German history onto the communists. Suddenly, people who 
ignored traces of National Socialism in West Germany are finding Hitler's 
legacy preserved in East German communists and, by association, in all those 
who refuse to abandon what might be called an East German identity. But East 
German communism was not, no matter what parallels one can find, Hitler's 
National Socialism. Political repression, corruption and intimidation do not 
add up to Auschwitz, a fact to which Wolf's work testifies. 
</P>
<P>
By discrediting East German literature, the current "literary" campaign erases 
facets of East German reality and history and discourages East Germans from 
finding an authentic identity within the united Germany. Wolf refuses to 
participate in this political, economic and cultural absorption of East 
Germany. Her work preserves the German Democratic Republic in literature. But 
the East was supposed to cease existing Tuesday, except as a nightmare best 
forgotten. West Germany's cultural absorption of the East is yet another 
version of German intolerance to identities other than its own. And literary 
chroniclers like Wolf are perceived as a threat by those intent on presenting 
to the world a Germany healed of its division and unburdened of its National 
Socialist past. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf's indictment by the West German media is almost unanimous. But then, it is 
difficult to find any reporting on East Germany that does not subscribe to the 
agenda of annexation. Beyond the unmistakable irony that voices such as Wolf's 
might finally be silenced just as the communists vanish for good, the current 
West German appropriation of political, cultural and historical reality 
represents a troublesome beginning for the "new" Germany.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: NO ERRORS FOR CBS AFTER ESPN'S BIG BLUNDER IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS' postseason opener Thursday night was a lot better than ESPN's 
regular-season finale Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
CBS didn't really miss anything in covering Pittsburgh's exciting 4-3 victory 
over Cincinnati in Game 1 of the National League championship series, which is 
more than you can say about ESPN in covering Boston's American League 
East-clinching victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Red Sox leading, 3-1, 
ESPN positioned all but two of its nine cameras to get player and crowd 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The center-field camera was used to show the pitch to Chicago's Ozzie Guillen, 
and that left only the high camera behind home plate to follow the ball to 
right field, where Tom Brunansky, blocked from view in a corner of Fenway Park, 
made his big catch. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN missed the live shot of this momentous play and, worse yet, had no 
replays. The cable network was left with nothing but egg on its face. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, it is hoped, learned something: Never sacrifice game action for reaction 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd in Cincinnati demonstrated knowledge of CBS announcer Jack Buck, 
holding up a "Go Crazy, Folks, Go Crazy" banner. That was Buck's radio call on 
Ozzie Smith's home run that gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 3-2 game lead over 
the Dodgers in the 1985 NL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Buck's succinct style works well with Tim McCarver's more animated delivery. "I 
think we're tied," Buck said when the Pirates' Sid Bream hit his two-run homer 
to catch the Reds at 3-3 in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The National League's Game 2 begins at 12:18 p.m. today, and Game 1 of the 
American League championship series, Oakland at Boston, is set for Saturday at 
5:30 p.m. The AL announcers are Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat. 
</P>
<P>
The season is over for the Dodgers, but not for announcers Vin Scully and Jaime 
Jarrin. 
</P>
<P>
Scully will work the World Series for CBS Radio, and Jarrin will work the 
playoffs and the Series for CBS Radio's Spanish-language network. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin's words will go to 40 stations reaching 80% of the 12.8 million 
Spanish-speaking people in the United States, plus 175 stations throughout 
Latin America. The Los Angeles affiliate is KTNQ. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin relishes the assignment. But then he relishes about everything these 
days. Mainly, he is thrilled to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin almost died from injuries suffered in an auto accident at Vero Beach, 
Fla., in March. He had a lacerated liver, a ruptured spleen, broken ribs and a 
collapsed lung. He underwent surgery the night of the accident and again a few 
weeks later to clear an intestinal abscess. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin didn't return to work until the All-Star game July 10, and didn't return 
full time until July 23. 
</P>
<P>
He says he's now about 85%. "There's still some pain from the incisions, but I 
feel pretty good," he said. "My weight is coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin, who lost 36 pounds, dropping to 138 after the accident, is at 158 and 
looking fit. 
</P>
<P>
Add Jarrin: The auto accident isn't the only recent tragedy in Jarrin's life. 
Two years ago, his son James died of an aneurysm at 29. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin has two other sons -- Jorge, the popular traffic reporter for KABC 
Radio, and Mauricio, a student at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Life has been good to Jarrin. The two tragedies made him realize how good. 
"I've learned to appreciate everything just that much more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin, possibly the most popular member of the Dodger organization, came to 
the United States from Ecuador with his wife, Blanca, in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
He got a radio job with KWKW that year and began covering the Dodgers. In 1972, 
he became the Dodgers' No. 1 Spanish-language announcer and was soon called the 
Vin Scully of the Spanish-speaking community. 
</P>
<P>
As Fernando Valenzuela's translator in the early 1980s, he became known to the 
English-speaking community, as well. 
</P>
<P>
While recuperating in the hospital, Jarrin got the chance to listen to Scully 
extensively. "There's no question he is the best," Jarrin said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Spanish-speaking listeners also say about Jarrin. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the baseball playoffs are here and the World Series is next, KABC 
Radio has cut its "Sportstalk" program in half. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, "Sportstalk," which has been running from 4 to 8 p.m., will be 
on the air from 5 to 7 p.m. This is not exactly a good omen for host Ed 
(Superfan) Bieler, and KABC management has reportedly met with other talk-show 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Nahan will continue with his "Stu's Views" segment at 5:45 p.m., and Ross 
Porter will be on three times a week during the second hour with "Dodger 
Focus." 
</P>
<P>
Buffoon Dept.: Just before going on the air, Victor Kiam, the New England 
Patriots' owner who also makes Remington shavers, mentioned to NBC's Will 
McDonough and Bob Costas that he has already bought Christmas advertising on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, it was supposed to soften them up. It didn't work. Costas grilled 
Kiam. 
</P>
<P>
New show: The Rams' Mike Lansford will kick off "Sports Confidential" on 
SportsChannel Los Angeles Nov. 5, and the show is scheduled to move to the full 
SportsChannel America network in December. Janniene Keahl, who works for an 
Orange County cable channel, will be the co-host. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford does a radio show Monday and Friday mornings on KEZY and KORG in 
Orange County, and the TV commercial he does for Smogpros is seen everywhere. 
One thing about that commercial: It's not Lansford's voice. Why? "Beats me," 
Lansford said. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Either USC or UCLA has appeared on ABC every weekend this season, and the trend 
continues. The Arizona at UCLA game will be on ABC Saturday at 12:30 p.m., with 
Brent Musburger and Dick Vermeil reporting. And on Oct. 13, ABC will televise 
USC at Stanford, with the same announcing team. . . . Saturday night, USC's 
7:30 home game against Washington State will be on ESPN, with Steve Physioc and 
Neil Lomax reporting. . . . With KNX carrying baseball Saturday night, the 
Trojan radio broadcast will be on KLAC. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were 6,559 tickets shy of selling out in time to lift the blackout for 
Sunday's home game against the Cincinnati Bengals. So the NFL lineup will be 
Kansas City at Indianapolis at 10 a.m. on NBC, with Charlie Jones and Todd 
Christensen; Green Bay at Chicago at 1 p.m. on CBS, with Pat Summerall and John 
Madden, and the Raiders at Buffalo at 4:30 p.m. on TNT and Channel 9, with Skip 
Caray and Pat Haden. . . . Joe McDonnell's Sunday night talk show on KFI will 
air after the Raider game. . . . The Rams' game at Chicago on Oct. 14 will also 
have a 4:30 p.m. kickoff. TNT is going with 4:30 starts the next two Sundays to 
get a head start on the baseball playoff games on CBS. There will be no TNT 
Sunday night football on Oct. 21 to avoid competing with the World Series. 
Instead, the New England-Miami game will be televised on Thursday, Oct. 18, a 
Series travel day. 
</P>
<P>
John Rooney and Jerry Coleman are the CBS Radio announcers for the National 
League playoffs; Jim Hunter and Johnny Bench are handling the American League 
playoffs. Bench will join Vin Scully for the World Series. . . . Chicago White 
Sox Manager Jeff Torborg will be a studio guest on the CBS-TV baseball pregame 
show Saturday night, and Don Baylor will be on the Sunday night show. . . . The 
Dodgers' Rick Dempsey was Channel 2's postgame guest Thursday night, the 
Angels' Wally Joyner will be the American League guest commentator, and St. 
Louis pitcher Joe Magrane will take over on the National League show Tuesday. . 
. . Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher will be a KFWB contributor during the playoffs 
and the Series. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 announced that KMPC's Jim Healy, along with fellow radio 
personalities Ed Bieler, Lee Hamilton and Gabe Kaplan, would be a part of this 
week's "The John Robinson Show," which airs Saturday at 3:30 p.m. and again 
Sunday at 10 a.m. But Healy said he will not be on the show. He said KMPC sent 
along a mug shot of him, but that was it. . . . Kaplan will do his KLAC 
"Sportsnut" programs from Honolulu next week. . . . Talk about a big dropoff: 
Roy Firestone, possibly the best sports interviewer on television, will be 
replaced by Joe Fowler on the Laker pregame shows on Channel 9 this season. Ted 
Green remains as the producer.

Tim Sweeney, playing in his first regular-season National Hockey League game, 
scored at 1:07 of overtime Thursday night to give the Calgary Flames a 3-2 
victory over the Vancouver Canucks in their season opener at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames' Al MacInnis broke a 1-1 deadlock at 8:15 of the third period, only 
to have the Canucks' Rob Murphy tie it again, forcing overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Makarov scored the other goal for the Flames, and Jim Sandlak had one 
for the Canucks -- both in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Mike Vernon, who faced 26 shots, had an acrobatic night, making 
several saves in the second period to prevent Vancouver from taking the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Andy Moog's goaltending and first-period goals by 
Dave Poulin and Cam Neely carried the Bruins past the Flyers at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are 5-0-1 in their last six openers. 
</P>
<P>
Moog lost his bid for his 10th shutout with 4:09 left when Rick Tocchet knocked 
in a rebound from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Janney made it 3-0 with 7:44 left and Boston's Ray Bourque closed out the 
scoring into an empty-net with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, N.Y. Rangers 3 -- Dirk Graham scored two goals, and Ed Belfour 
stopped 27 shots as the Blackhawks defeated the Rangers at Chicago to win their 
first opener since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chelios, acquired from Montreal during the off-season, scored a 
third-period goal on a 45-foot slapshot at the 41-second mark and assisted on 
both of Graham's goals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Rangers' first loss to the Blackhawks in Chicago since Feb. 19, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago had a 4-1 lead, but the Rangers made the game exciting when Bernie 
Nicholls scored his second goal of the night at 19:14 of the final period and 
Ray Sheppard scored with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 3, Hartford 3 -- Guy Lafleur, Joe Sakic and Mats Sundin scored in a 
5-minute 36-second span of the second period, but the Nordiques had to settle 
for a tie at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
After the Whalers took a 2-0 lead in the first period on goals by Kevin Dineen 
and Pat Verbeek, the Nordiques tied it in the first 2:11 of the second period 
on power-play goals by the 39-year-old Lafleur and Sakic. 
</P>
<P>
Sundin, No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft, scored his first NHL goal to break the 
tie at 5:36 of the second period, but Todd Krygier got the Whalers even later 
in the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers had a man advantage for the final 1:37 of overtime, but Ron Francis 
hit the right post at 2:02, and Quebec goalie John Tanner stopped a shot by 
Kevin Dineen with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, New Jersey 3 -- Brendan Shanahan scored with 15 seconds left in 
regulation to give the Devils a tie with the Red Wings at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey trailed, 3-1, but rallied in Bryan Murray's debut as Red Wing coach 
and general manager. Claude Lemieux started the Devils' comeback by scoring his 
second goal with 8:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Fedyk and Sergei Fedorov put the Red Wings ahead, 3-1, with goals in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Habscheid gave Detroit a 1-0 lead 3:55 into the game with a short-handed 
goal, but Lemieux tied it about six minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Buffalo 3 -- Stephane Richer scored with 3:43 left to give the 
Canadiens a tie with the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo took a 3-2 lead when Dale Hawerchuk fired a short shot past goalie 
Patrick Roy at 6:32 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny and Dave Andreychuk scored for the Sabres, while Russ 
Courtnall and Brian Skrudland scored for Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 7, Toronto 1 -- Dave Ellett had two goals and an assist as the Jets 
routed the Maple Leafs at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Jet rookie goalie Stephane Beauregard had 25 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Reid opened the scoring for Toronto, tipping a shot past Beauregard 1:48 
into the first period, but Paul MacDermid evened the score 31 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Dave McLlwain and Moe Mantha scored before the first period ended, Ellett 
scored twice in the second period and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Minnesota 2 -- Brett Hull, who led the NHL with 72 goals last 
season, scored twice, and the Blues downed the North Stars at Minnesota to 
spoil the debut of Coach Bob Gainey. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 1-1, but Hull scored with 3:37 left in the second period 
and made it 3-1 with an unassisted goal in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gagner's power-play goal gave Minnesota a 1-0 lead in the first period.

LA QUINTA ENDS PACIFICA'S REIGN

<P>
The memories of a loss following a last-second field goal and another when a 
running back fell en route to a touchdown were erased by La Quinta High School 
Thursday night at Bolsa Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Donald Hopkins passed for 233 yards and tailback George Sanchez 
rushed for 127 yards as La Quinta beat Pacifica, 29-6, ending Pacifica's 
four-year winning streak in the eight-team Garden Grove League. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica had won 21 of its last 22 league games and its only loss, 31-17, to 
Bolsa Grande in 1987 was later reversed by a forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta had come close to beating Pacifica the past two years but lost, 
15-14, in 1988 on a last-second field goal and lost, 35-28, last year when 
running back Jason Cherms fell on the 13-yard line on an apparent touchdown run 
late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica (3-2, 1-1 in league) failed to contain La Quinta's potent offense or 
generate any offense of its own Thursday night. La Quinta's defense, led by 
linebacker Joe Slouka, limited Pacifica to 20 yards rushing and 34 yards 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (5-0, 2-0) also intercepted two passes and recovered a fumble in 
defeating Pacifica for the first time in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They outhit us, executed better and wanted to win more than us," said Bill 
Craven, Pacifica coach. "We couldn't contain their passing game and we couldn't 
get anything going offensively. La Quinta deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins completed 16 of 24 passes, one for a touchdown and rushed for another 
before retiring with nine minutes remaining and La Quinta leading, 26-6. 
Afterward, he said an effective running game made passing easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our best running game of the season," Hopkins said. "When we're running 
like we did tonight and the line is giving me that type of protection, our 
passing game is pretty tough to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins threw to four receivers, but his main target was tight end Justin 
Sogoian. Sogoian caught six passes for 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez gained 127 yards in 18 carries and scored twice as La Quinta amassed 
192 yards rushing against a flat Pacifica defense.

Eddie Brown returned an onsides kickoff attempt 55 yards for a touchdown with 1 
minute 32 seconds left to play, preserving Los Amigos High School's 35-27 
victory over Bolsa Grande in a Garden Grove League game Thursday night at 
Garden Grove High. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Wilson's 10-yard scoring run brought Bolsa Grande to within one point at 
28-27, but quarterback Bryan Taylor was sacked on his two-point conversion 
attempt by Los Amigos' Seilala Faamausili. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos (3-2, 1-1 in league) kept the ball on the ground, attempting only 
four passes and completing none. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Ragsdale gained 111 yards in 22 carries, including an 11-yard scoring run 
in the third quarter, and returned an interception 50 yards for a first-half 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande (1-4, 1-2) was led by Maurice Wilson, who gained 199 yards in 24 
carries and scored on runs of two and 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Gomez and Faamausili accounted for Los Amigos' other scores on runs of 20 
and one yard. SCOTT JONES

INTO THE NIGHT: WELL . . . IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO LAUGH

The scene: A launch party (three days after the fact) for the rebroadcast of 
100 episodes of the "The Steve Allen Show" (1956-60) on the HA! comedy channel, 
airing daily Monday through Friday (as of last Monday) at 7:30 a.m. and 7:30 
p.m. After cocktails at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Allen screened some of the 
show's highlights, which, indeed, elicited a steady and vocal stream of ha's. 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: A virtual who's who of pre-"Saturday Night Live" era television 
comedy stars, including Bill Dana, Don Knotts, Milton Berle, Bob Hope, Alan 
Young, Martha Raye, Shelley Berman, Tom Poston, Don Adams, Pat Harrington, Bea 
Arthur and Audrey Meadows, plus Jayne Meadows, Jackie Cooper, Esther Williams, 
Charlton Heston, Gene Autry, Dick Clark, Steve's son and MTM Enterprises 
executive Bill Allen and Zsa Zsa Gabor with her prince, Frederick von Anhalt, 
and daughter, Francesca Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
The buzz: Aching joints; the demise of good taste in contemporary comedy; a 
nostalgic return to kinder, gentler laughs. Bob Hope also mentioned that he is 
in serious discussions with the USO about a trip to Saudi Arabia at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: By Bill Dana, a former "Steve Allen Show" writer and star, "When we were 
working, this country was so up-tight, you couldn't show a close-up of a stork 
on 'Zoo Parade.' " 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "I remember you and my horse remembers you," said Alan ("Mr Ed") Young, 
after Zsa Zsa Gabor asked him if he knew who she was. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Not a single person-in-black, no leather, no Spandex, no minis, no 
Italian suits. 
</P>
<P>
Modesty aside: "This show is a museum of great comedy," said Steve Allen.

HOT TO SHOP: SUNGLASSES THAT ARE A CUT ABOVE

DEAR HOT: I have a whole drawer full of sunglasses. One pair blocks ultraviolet 
light. Another blocks out blue light. I've got a pair that's shatterproof. Then 
I've got some that are good for nothing but style. Has anybody figured out how 
to put all this stuff into one pair of glasses yet? 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT SHOPPER: Swiss Army Brands Ltd., the company best known for making 
Swiss Army Knives that have such doohickeys as scissors and screwdrivers 
inside, has recently applied its more-is-more philosophy to sunglasses. Created 
for the needs of people who like to carry Swiss Army Knives (which is to say 
outdoorsmen and women who prefer to be well-equipped but also travel light), 
the sunglasses have all the features you mentioned -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
Their amber-tinted lenses are coated for scratch resistance. The nose bridge is 
adjustable so it conforms to your face for precision fit so that when you ski 
or bike, for instance, the glasses won't slip down your nose or fly off your 
head. What's more they're lightweight and have detachable leather weather 
shields for extra protection against wind, snow and rain. 
</P>
<P>
The company even claims that when a steel projectile was fired at them from an 
air gun at close range, the lenses withstood the impact. Ouch! As for style, 
the glasses are shaped in classic aviator tradition. They sell for $119, come 
in red or black and are available through Hammacher Schlemmer stores or through 
their catalogue. To order products or get a free Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue, 
call (800) 543-3366.

DEAR HOT: I'm a Liz Claiborne fan and I'm in heaven or hell, I'm not sure 
which. I'm delighted to see so much more Liz Claiborne merchandise on the 
market but I can't tell the difference between Liz Claiborne clothing sold in 
department stores, Liz Claiborne goods sold in First Issue boutiques and things 
sold at Liz Claiborne Concept shops. They could open 50 different Liz stores 
and I'd still be happy but I'd just like to know what the differences are. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT SHOPPER: It is confusing out there for Liz devotees, what with all the 
variations from Liz Wear (very casual clothes aimed at a younger audience), Liz 
Sport (casual weekend wear), Liz and Co. (casual knitwear), Elizabeth (large 
size clothing), Liz Claiborne Collection (styles suitable for the office) and 
Liz Claiborne Dresses (career and casual dresses). 
</P>
<P>
And, lately, the company's been selling this stuff in so many different kinds 
of places! According to a Claiborne spokesperson, First Issue is a nationwide 
chain of stores that sell clothing in the familiar style and quality of Liz 
Claiborne casual sportswear and work clothes -- but simply under the relatively 
new, First Issue label. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that the styles and colors marketed in the First Issue 
stores will never be exactly the same as the Liz Claiborne merchandise sold in 
department stores or in Liz Claiborne retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 37 First Issue stores throughout the country, including one in 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and one in Sherman Oaks' Fashion Square. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Claiborne Concept Shops are boutiques within retail stores, devoted to 
Claiborne clothing, handbags and small leather goods, though you may find 
exactly the same merchandise in stores without Concept Shops. 
</P>
<P>
The first Liz Claiborne Concept Shop in Southern California is located in South 
Coast Plaza at the May Co. and it's devoted exclusively to handbags and small 
leather goods. 
</P>
<P>
We're not holding our breath for Liz Claiborne Concept Drapery Shops, Elizabeth 
Muu-Muus and First Issue Press-On Nails.

Donna Karan shipped her spring '91 DKNY sportswear collection to Los Angeles 
this week to shoot an ad campaign. "We're calling it DKLA, just kidding" said 
Karan's media director, Patty Cohen. The clothes, along with Karan's regular ad 
photographer, Peter Arnell, and her favorite model, Rosemary McGrotha, have 
been skittering from the Hollywood sign and Mann's Chinese Theatre to Muscle 
Beach in Venice shooting ads for February issues of fashion magazines. Karan 
stayed in New York, but gave these last-minute instructions to the L.A. 
contingent: "Just make me smile."

* TRIM, PERM AND A BOYFRIEND, PLEASE: The newest twist in full-service hair 
salons is matchmaking. Daryl Rapoza, the owner of Personne Complet, a Woodland 
Hills hair and body salon, is starting a dating service for her clients 
beginning Oct. 11. Registration in the service is free but when members select 
or accept a date through the service they will be charged $35 for an 
introductory meeting. Membership perks include an optional 10-minute session 
with the salon's psychic counselor and an upcoming singles event.

* FOREVER QUEENLY: Princess Anne of Britain and Queen Noor of Jordan behave 
less, well, royally than Hollywood royalty when it comes to their famous faces. 
Take it from Olivier Echaudemaison, the Paris-based makeup artist who has 
"designed" their makeup for weddings and royal photo ops. Echaudemaison was in 
town for the launch of the new Givenchy cosmetics collection, which he helped 
create. It is now available exclusively at Saks. Between strokes of orange and 
violet eye shadow he did allow that royals never hire him to apply their makeup 
before splashy parties as Hollywood types are known to do. "They don't disturb 
you for that, not like TV stars," he said. "A TV star is afraid tomorrow she is 
not a star, but a royal is royal forever."

* YOU ARE HERE: Melrose Avenue appears to be aspiring to theme-park status. 
Shopping as a recreational sport is so popular on the street that the Merchants 
on Melrose association has printed a colorful brochure and map locating all the 
must-shop stores and restaurants on the famed avenue between Fairfax and La 
Brea. The first run of 50,000 copies is destined for hotel lobbies, travel 
agents and tour guides. They will also be available in the stores. Hopefully, 
the second printing will include tips on parking space.N

* PRESCHOOL PRINCESS: Looking for great Halloween costumes in all the usual 
places? Try an off-beat location, such as the Mt. Washington Elementary School 
(3981 San Rafael Ave). Tomorrow from 12 to 5 p.m., Los Angeles designer Karolyn 
Kiisel-Fraser and a group of mothers are holding a fund-raiser for a future 
preschool in the area. Kiisel-Fraser says she asked eveningwear pros, including 
Bob Mackie and Bill Travilla, for glitzy yardage for the project and was 
originally going to make just a few fairy princess costumes. But "everyone was 
so generous," she has been able to turn out about 50 outfits, ranging from 
charmed princesses to black cats and capes for Dracula. The tentative price 
list is $8 to $35, but could climb higher. COMPILED BY THE FASHION STAFF

SATIRICAL LOOK INTO THE EYE OF THE SPY; 
</P>
<P>
TANGO BY ALAN JUDD, SUMMIT BOOKS, $17.95, 293 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unlikely hero of "Tango," Alan Judd's parodic spy novel, is a pudgy 
Londoner managing an English bookstore in an unspecified South American country 
known for gargantuan beefsteaks, sensual senoritas and volatile politics -- all 
potentially dangerous for the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
Though William Wooding seems blissfully unaware of the fact, the bookstore is 
generally regarded as a front for English espionage, an activity not only 
tolerated but apparently encouraged by the ruling junta. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Wooding seems a blandly apathetic young fellow, complacently sharing 
household chores with his restless wife, compensating for his footling job and 
dreary marriage by overindulging in food, wine and romantic daydreams. He is a 
bumbler, clearly destined for dissolution in an agreeable backwater. 
</P>
<P>
He's actually having lunch in the main market, sharing a communal table with a 
pair of gorgeous girls, when he's recognized by the new president of the 
country, touring the market on a flesh-pressing stroll. 
</P>
<P>
Our hero and the president-elect had attended the same minor public school in 
England, though if the women at the table had been homely, that fact might 
never have come to light. Because one of the girls is sensationally beautiful, 
and because one of the perks of the presidency is first choice of the local 
women, Wooding is warmly greeted by his old acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
By evening, the entire capital city believes that the bookstore manager has a 
direct line to the palace. Within hours, Wooding is summoned to the British 
embassy, where a mysterious Mr. Box is eagerly awaiting him. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Box has been sent to recruit Wooding for the Special Information 
Service, a newly privatized clone of the secret service. An under-utilized 
Briton with free time is just what Box's outfit is looking for, and Wooding 
needs little persuasion to sign on. Spying might be risky, but it's 
considerably more challenging than dusting the office windows, refilling old 
invoices, and faking an interest in his wife's teaching schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of Wooding's life picks up immediately. Box has the full spy kit and 
obviously relishes his work. He's not only a figure of fun with his obsolete 
transmitter and his exaggerated adherence to the rules of the game, but he's 
also eerily plausible. 
</P>
<P>
Wooding quickly shows himself to be a natural at his new profession. Instead of 
dull evenings alone in the flat with his taciturn wife, he's dashing around the 
town, arranging the president's dates with the ravishing Teresa, boyishly 
enjoying the whole business of false names, secret codes and clandestine 
meetings; all to prevent the unstable country from falling into Communist 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, Wooding himself falls in love with Teresa, dismissing as irrelevant 
both his marriage and her current position as the president's mistress, a role 
she reminds him she's fulfilled for scores of lesser lights. He couldn't care 
less, and since Teresa is so sensible, charming and straightforward, we can 
practically see her reformed and married to Wooding, graciously serving tea to 
the vicar and president. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the book, the author balances on the high wire separating farce from 
comedy, regaining his equilibrium just as the entire act seems certain to crash 
into slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
Preposterous as the ensuing events seem, they're firmly grounded in 
contemporary reality, making the resemblance between fiction and fact more than 
coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
Consistently diverting, "Tango" begins as a sendup and ends on a deeper note as 
highly relevant political satire. 
</P>
<P>
Conscientiously minding his declining business, lulled into complacency by the 
ease of his life, eager for the adventure and excitement that have always 
eluded him, Wooding is exactly the sort of man who turns up in a boxed window 
on "Nightline," an inadvertent victim of events not only out of his control but 
utterly beyond the scope of his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is no laughing matter, as the author of this sophisticated 
entertainment subtly reminds us.

Davies Hall to be Overhauled: The San Francisco Symphony has announced plans 
for a major $7 million to $9 million acoustic redesign of Louise M. Davies 
Symphony Hall in San Francisco, fueled by a $3-million challenge grant from 
Gordon Getty. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-seat hall has had a reputation for troublesome sound since it opened 
in 1980. The plan proposed by acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard would create a 
new canopy of adjustable reflectors over the stage and reconfigure the hall to 
a more rectangular shape. Construction is planned for 1992. BETH KLEID

'CINEMA BRAZIL' HAS BARRETO FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Cinema Brazil," which starts today at the Monica 4-Plex with "The Story of 
Fausta," could just as easily have been called "Cinema Barreto," for each of 
the films in the series was either produced by Luiz Carlos Barreto and/or his 
wife Lucy, and five of them were directed by their sons Bruno and Fabio. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bruno Barreto who, with his sly, risque 1987 comedy "Dona Flor and Her 
Two Husbands," put Brazilian films -- and its sexy star, Sonia Braga -- on the 
world map. (Note: "Dona Flor" airs on KCET Channel 28 Saturday at 11 p.m., 
preceded by Carlos Diegues' 1979 bittersweet, terrifically entertaining "Bye 
Bye Brazil" at 9 p.m.). The films are marked by fine cinematography, dynamic 
acting, a concern for social issues and much vitality. Taken as a group, they 
touch upon many aspects of Brazilian culture and society. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six of the series' seven films available for preview, the two finest, 
however, were directed by Walter Lima Jr., a stylish spinner of fables. "O 
Boto" ("The Dolphin"), which screens Oct. 19-25, is a highly sensual retelling 
of an ancient myth in which a dolphin, during the full moon, turns into a man 
in order to seduce the young women of a fishing village; afterward, the 
fishermen find their catch depleted. In short, it's a wonderful myth for men in 
need of reassuring their masculinity: slay a dolphin and you protect both your 
women and your fish. 
</P>
<P>
In this film with its lush aquamarine tones, Lima and his writer Ana Scheler 
nevertheless give the myth a poignant twist. Lima's exquisite "Inocencia" (Oct. 
29-31), the one period film in the series, is another subtle commentary on 
machismo and the status of women. In 1860, a handsome doctor (Edson Celulari), 
traveling in the hinterlands, cures the beautiful young daughter (Fernanda 
Torres) of an ignorant but powerful landowner of her malaria only to fall in 
love with her, thus setting in motion a romance with the potential for tragedy. 
"Inocencia" unfolds with the wit and irony of an Isak Dinesen tale. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno Barreto's "The Story of Fausta" (today through Thursday) launches the 
series smartly with a lively but clear-eyed look at poverty and survival 
starring the Anna Magnani-like Betty Faria, who was the sexy, courageous "Queen 
of Rhumba" in "Bye Bye Brazil's" seedy, tiny carnival. This time she plays a 
vital, 40ish cleaning woman, married to a combative drunk (Daniel Filho) and 
living in a shantytown outside Rio; she pins her hopes for escaping her 
rough-and-tumble existence upon an elderly beau (Brandao Filho) who still has a 
sparkle in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
Barreto's "The Kiss" (Oct. 26-28) is an exceedingly intense melodrama dealing 
with the dire consequences of a young bridegroom (Ney Latorraca) who 
unhesitatingly fulfills the request of a dying youth, struck down by a bus, to 
give him a farewell kiss. The film becomes a devastating attack on a machismo 
characterized by a virulent homophobia. So sure is Barreto's control that he 
even gets away with an ending as neatly schematic as that of a fatalistic 
Cornell Woolrich mystery novel of the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
The three remaining films in the series, including the gangster picture "King 
of Rio" (Nov. 1-3) which was unavailable for preview, were directed by Fabio 
Barreto. His "Luzia" (next Friday through Oct.18) is as misfired (yet 
entertaining in its potboiler way) as his "India, Daughter of the Sun" (Nov. 
4-6), which closes "Cinema Brazil," is stunning. 
</P>
<P>
In the first he tries hard for a contemporary "Duel in the Sun" with a social 
consciousness -- a beautiful but stern dusky-skinned cowhand (Claudia 
Ohana)attracts both a bad feudal landowner (Jose de Abreu) who cruelly exploits 
the peasantry and his good younger brother (Thales Pan Chacon). -- But the 
material is too much the stuff of heady soap opera to sustain the film's solemn 
tone. In the second, a deceptively decent-seeming army corporal (Nuno Leal 
Maia), assigned to investigate exploitation and brutality in an Amazon diamond 
field, commences an affair with a pretty, naive Indian maiden (Gloria Pires) 
with unexpected consequences. Information: (213) 394-9741.

STAGE BEAT: UNEVEN ACTING WEAKENS 'LULU'S' MYSTICAL POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a fine sense of light and shadow in Frederique Michel's staging of 
Kathy Acker's postmodernist reworking of "Lulu" at Waterfront Stage. There's 
also mystery and mysticism and some ageless wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
The Frank Wedekind play and the director are suited to one another. Michel sees 
within the work and illuminates it with her impeccable visual theatricality, 
including the use of a disarming Expressionist film using the same actors, 
accompanying the action, commenting on it, and delicate lighting by Kevin 
Graves and sound by Jeffrey S. Poole. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michel hasn't been able to gather together the actors to fulfill her 
artful realization of avant-garde playwright Acker's design. Barbara Hooper 
does achieve some moments of textual clarity in her final monologue as Lulu, 
and Shaun Irons almost approaches the slick vulgarity of the theatrical 
director son of Lulu's aged husband. 
</P>
<P>
Laura McCann (as the stoic maid and as a witch) and Katherine Burke (as a young 
girl) add delicious moments of ambiguity, but the acting overall misses any of 
the nuances of what could be an exciting dramatic journey. 
</P>
<P>
 At 250 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica; Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; 
indefinitely. $12.50; (213) 393-6672.

Funny 'Rim Shot' Still a Sitcom 
</P>
<P>
Nina Giovannitti's "Rim Shot" at the Complex is about as adult as a sitcom can 
get, but that doesn't keep it from being sitcom writing. Giovannitti knows her 
way around a situation and has a fine ear for comedy built on character, and 
she has Robert Schrock's coiled spring direction to help her. 
</P>
<P>
Stand-up comic Zoe has found a yuppie Mr. Right. Her problem -- and the play's 
-- is that she's suddenly so happy that she's not funny anymore. She's a Method 
comic; a pro would get up and give a good show regardless. As a result, one 
doesn't really care much about Zoe, poor thing. She'd be better get out of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
As Zoe, Giovannitti is funny and touching, especially in scenes with the 
delightful Cynthia Steele as her best friend, who for some unknown reason puts 
up with her. Steve Greenstein is really funny, doing his own material as Zoe's 
boss. Robert Firth, warm and sensitive as Zoe's boyfriend, is also terrific in 
a dream sequence as a "yuppie comic" -- with his own material -- doing Sinatra 
and Sammy Davis Jr.

Evocative 'Spinster' Sags in the Middle 
</P>
<P>
In a tight new translation by Carmen Zapata and Michael Dewell and under 
Margarita Galban's mostly evocative direction, Federico Garcia Lorca's "Dona 
Rosita the Spinster" receives a curiously mixed production at BFA's Little 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Lorca, who could be considered the Tennessee Williams of Spain, once again 
deals with the tragedy of a woman against whom the winds of fate blow the 
debris of her situation. Dona Rosita promises to wait for a man who has no 
intention of waiting for her. Her whole life she waits. It is a heartbreaking 
story, which Lorca has been wise enough to lard with some humor. 
</P>
<P>
In this Theatre/Teatro production, Act I is striking in its spareness and its 
poetry -- though translating verse dialogue is always chancy -- and Act III 
reverberates with the honest beat of broken hearts. Lorca's ironic humor in the 
transitional Act II falls apart in this staging. What should be gentle high 
comedy to match what precedes and follows it is turned into low camp, probably 
following the lead of Liane Schirmer's klutzy convolutions as the widowed 
mother of some of Rosita's spinster friends. 
</P>
<P>
Galban should never have allowed all this self-indulgence. Elsewhere her hand 
is sure and right. Elise Hernandez is memorable as Rosita, from her bubbly 
youth to a maturity anchored in stony bitterness. Margarita Stocker and Peppin 
Valera are strong as her aunt and uncle, and Margarita Cordova just escapes 
letting her staginess mask the high humor of her housekeeper.

Few Surprises in Hollow 'Notes' 
</P>
<P>
Even in a production that appreciated its values, the "American Notes" in Len 
Jenkin's dark comedy at the Court Theater all come from different tunes. His 
"vignettes searching for roots in the American mainstream" are in the "anything 
goes" style of '60s and '70s playwriting, and have a hollow sound today. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Eubanks conducts the notes as if they were Wagner, heavily and 
ponderously. One short scene comes to life, the sad meeting of an oddball pimp 
and his hooker with a client in a motel bar. It's the best writing in the 
piece, and Jim Donadio and Tancy Taylor are both frightening and touching. 
</P>
<P>
Their work shines. The other actors aren't taken by the director beyond the 
surface of the text, a necessary journey in this genre, though Terry Beaver has 
some good moments as Faber, a modern version of Cohan's Vagabond from "The 
Tavern," without his flights of imagination. John Iacovelli's good motel set 
has surprises behind the walls, but there are no surprises in Eubanks' 
direction. 
</P>

A FASCINATION WITH SOCIETY'S OUTCASTS

Borrowing a few riffs from Sam Shepard's idolization of Old West desperadoes -- 
and desperadoes in general -- Thomas Babe's 1977 black comedy "Billy Irish" 
goes Shepard one better. In "Irish," at the 3rd Street Theatre, Babe uses those 
riffs to make a few very lucid points about modern America's fascination with 
bad guys, from Jesse and Frank James, through Bonnie and Clyde, and culminating 
with the cult worship of Charles Manson. 
</P>
<P>
The action explodes on a ruined front porch, all that's left of a Vermont 
farmhouse, in 1976. Brothers Billy Irish and Joe Witness (short for Jehovah 
Witness) consider themselves modern forerunners of a new breed of outlaw, 
spinning their own history out of the same pure imagination that spawned their 
"outlaw" names. Their pipe dream idyll is suddenly interrupted by the arrival 
of a young couple who claim to be the modern Bonnie and Clyde, operating under 
explicit instructions from the "savior," Charlie Manson. 
</P>
<P>
Spiraling to an inevitable conclusion, much of the play is as silly as 
Shepard's untrue West, but Babe's fascination with language and the games that 
can be played with it is often intriguing and generally quite funny. 
</P>
<P>
At his older brother's deadpan suggestion that they "finally get it on" 
together, Billy says, "But we'll have to do unnatural acts." Joe mumbles, "This 
is incest -- we can do anything we want." Babe has an infallible flair for 
making a line say one thing while meaning something else. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is crisp and rife with subtle twists and turns of meaning and 
shading, and requires a close listen to catch all of Babe's convoluted sendups 
and the rough-edged poetry that flows through the writing. Though the shape of 
the playwright's statement has a ring of nostalgia today, much of what he says 
about the public and the media's hero worship of society's mistakes is still 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Mittleman and Grant Brittan are excellent as the brothers, 
particularly Mittleman's kinetic, detailed portrait of Billy, with a mind 
seemingly garbled from 10 years as a junkie, but more lucid in his imagery than 
the others and frighteningly logical in the play's denouement. Juliet Landau is 
often touching as the lost flower child grasping at any affection to salve her 
half-imagined torments, but Lance Brittan barely makes a dent into the 
character of her bubble-headed boyfriend, and he's the only member of the cast 
who looks like he's acting. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Michael Ewers with a keen ear and a solid feel of tension in his 
staging, the production looks very good on Devin Meadows' ramshackle porch. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8142-A West 3rd St.; Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends Oct. 28. $10; 
(213) 447-0534.

JAZZ NOTES: THE CASE OF THE DISAPPEARING SOLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astute listeners might notice a difference between Michael Bolton's recently 
released single of "Georgia on My Mind" and the same song on his multi-platinum 
CBS album, "Soul Provider." 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Brecker isn't happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
CBS edited out of the single a solo by saxman Brecker and replaced it with one 
by fellow saxophonist Kenny G. Brecker -- who has recorded solos on records by 
Bruce Springsteen, John Lennon, Paul Simon and Frank Sinatra -- remains on the 
album's "Georgia" track. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea was for CBS to milk Kenny G's name to enhance sales," said Don 
Lucoff, president of New York-based DL Media, Brecker's press representative. 
"Brecker played a very musical solo, it enhanced the record. If they didn't 
think it was good, they would have replaced him before the album was released." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said a representative of CBS who wished to remain anonymous. "Brecker's 
an incredible artist and his solo was outstanding. It's just that (Bolton's) 
been on tour, opening up for Kenny, they have worked together for years, and on 
the record they simply made a special edit, which is common in our business. 
The edit could have been to make (the single) more topical, to release it for 
radio, to trigger a better reaction in this mode than in the original mode, to 
make it more salable. It could be any number of reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Lucoff was not impressed. "I'd have to say the title of Brecker's new GRP 
release, 'Now You See It . . . (Now You Don't),' has been taken to heart," he 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Brecker's Southland tour dates -- he was to play the Strand in Redondo Beach, 
the Wadsworth Theater in Brentwood and the Smothers Theatre in Malibu last week 
-- were postponed until early next year, said his manager, Darryl Pitt. In the 
meantime, Brecker begins an on-and-off six-month tour with Paul Simon on Nov. 
30 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Pearl, host of KLON-FM's "Nothin' but the Blues" for 10 1/2 years and 
artistic director of that station's Long Beach Blues Festival, wants his fans 
to know that he left the station -- he was replaced in a staff reorganization 
move last week by Bubba Jackson -- for "irreconcilable differences with 
management." In a press release, Pearl said that his listeners' support "has 
made (the show) KLON's most listened-to and best-supported program for most of 
the last decade." To show that he bears no umbrage toward his former air 
partners, he added "To my colleagues, best wishes and continued success."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
VOICES OF DISSENT BEGIN OWN MOBILIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time American soldiers were involved in a lengthy armed conflict, Bill 
Smith waged a solitary campaign to persuade Los Angeles lawyers to defend 
conscientious objectors to the war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
It took three years before he could even find enough attorneys willing to form 
an anti-war legal committee. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Smith again joined the lonely ranks of American war dissenters, 
this time to voice opposition to U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf and to 
form a new committee to counsel soldiers reluctant to participate in the Middle 
East mobilization that threatens to result in war with Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
Like the start of the anti-war movement 25 years ago, the voices of dissent are 
starting out faintly -- at least compared to recent national polls suggesting 
strong popular support for the decision to send troops to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a rumpled lawyer who counseled dozens of conscientious objectors during 
the Vietnam War, was among a small group of the liberal Americans for 
Democratic Action who gathered in a spare West Los Angeles office to counter 
what they described as the Bush Administration's "headlong rush into a 
disastrous war in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
For Smith and his fellow activists, the rhetoric was vintage Vietnam, but with 
latter-day urgency. This time they want to form an organized, outspoken 
opposition to the military buildup before events overtake them. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Smith said, he has begun counseling 20 reservists and National Guard 
members who sought his help to avoid military service in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect we're ahead of the game," Smith said. "Vietnam taught us to speak 
out fast to avoid the quagmire ahead." 
</P>
<P>
But except for a stack of newly mimeographed press releases near the office 
door, there were no trappings of the dissenters' latest cause as they clustered 
in their 3rd Street office. 
</P>
<P>
Mounds of handbills lay piled on an office partition, advertising radical 
poetry readings and rallies against the war in El Salvador and strife in 
Nicaragua -- old business -- instead of the looming new crisis in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A yellow sign -- "May we have your old glasses?" -- urged visitors to donate 
their eyeglasses to Nicaragua. Five dusty spectacles and a blue balloon were 
crammed into a wicker basket. 
</P>
<P>
Bill O'Reilly, 72, a genial ADA supporter and former business executive, noted 
the difficulty in staking out an unpopular political position these days. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel lonely doing this," he said. "You feel like you're sticking your neck 
out a little bit. But we have to start somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Reilly added that much of the early opposition against the Persian Gulf 
buildup that he has seen is emerging in the form of informal political 
discussions among friends and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more people raising questions than you might think," O'Reilly 
said, "especially conservatives who are worried about the impracticality of 
what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to similar reports that much of the early criticism of the 
mobilization has come from isolationist conservatives, Marvin Schacter, a vice 
president of the local ADA chapter, insisted that the activists' thunder has 
not been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"We support involvement in the Mideast, but with the United Nations taking the 
lead," Schacter said. "They are isolationists who want no involvement at all." 
</P>
<P>
Seeming almost eager to take on the government again, Bill Smith appears 
willing to accept help from any and all dissenters -- regardless of their 
political stripes. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is much less hawkish now than they were during Vietnam," he 
said. "We've got veterans' groups questioning the wisdom of the government's 
actions, college students. . . . I tell you, compared to the last time we're 
getting off on the right foot."

WINGS OF TOY PLANE ENTHUSIASTS CLIPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years before the Goodyear blimp was brought down Sunday over Carson by a 
model plane, airborne traffic reporter Jorge Jarrin had his own close encounter 
with a high-flying toy in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out the window," the KABC radio helicopter pilot recalled, "and there 
was a little yellow plane with red stripes on its wing 50 feet in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
Surprised, Jarrin made an on-the-air remark about the radio-controlled 
intruder, but when the little plane began looping and diving around his traffic 
helicopter 600 feet above the ground, he complained to nearby Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin, who has had two such near-misses since 1986, is not the only Southern 
Californian who felt like saying "I told you so" after a model plane punctured 
the blimp, forcing it to make a safe but unscheduled landing. 
</P>
<P>
As the skies above Southern California become more crowded and the once-open 
fields become crammed with development, practitioners of the venerable hobby of 
model airplane flying have found fewer and fewer local places to safely pursue 
their passion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite booming sales, model flying in Southern California "is kind of a dying 
hobby in some ways," said Tom Empey, president of the Torrance-based BIRDs. 
</P>
<P>
Once the largest club of its kind in the United States, the BIRDs, whose 
acronym stands for "Beginners in Radio Drones," have dwindled from 400 members 
in the mid-1970s to 110 today. For four years, they have worked in vain to 
persuade South Bay landowners to lease them a flying field. 
</P>
<P>
While the hobby has been growing nationwide, according to Geoffrey Styles of 
the Academy of Model Aeronautics in Reston, Va., hobbyists in rapidly 
developing areas such as California have had to compete for dwindling open 
space. Although they do not require large runways, they do need unobstructed 
fields in which to perform loops, dives and other maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
In dense urban areas, pilots increasingly have had to fend off complaints about 
the noise and velocity of their planes and occasional accidents. The most 
frequent target of complaints are gas-powered, radio-controlled planes -- the 
highest-flying and noisiest of the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The BIRD club specializes in those and has lost at least half a dozen fields 
over the years to development and noise complaints, said Chuck Beardsley, the 
group's past president. Now, he said, his club must drive 45 minutes or more to 
specialized miniature airfields in the Sepulveda Basin, Fountain Valley's Mile 
Square Park and South El Monte's Whittier Narrows Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay pilots hoping to fly gas-powered planes closer to home have no choice 
but to fly clandestinely from "renegade fields" that often are too small and 
too close to houses for any but the most experienced flyers to navigate, Empey 
and Beardsley said. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of those bootleg fields that model pilot John Moyer of Redondo Beach 
was using last Sunday when his gas-powered, hawk-sized Thunder Tiger punched 
through the letter D on the Goodyear blimp Columbia 1,000 feet over Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pilot was able to guide the dirigible to a safe landing with seven 
people on board, Moyer was arraigned Tuesday in Compton Municipal Court on 
felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon, vandalism and tampering with an 
aircraft, rendering it unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer's attorney said the encounter was accidental; prosecutors said the 
28-year-old man had been intentionally buzzing the airship. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a model airplane had brought down a blimp, but it was not 
the sport's first collision with urban life. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sepulveda Basin -- one of the closest and most popular model plane 
airfields -- toy planes stray at least once a week into the airspace of 
full-sized aircraft taking off from the Van Nuys Airport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, Empey said, hobbyists were kicked off the 
Southwest College athletic field two years ago after an uninsured pilot's model 
plane crashed into a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
In Mile Square Park, rangers last month posted a reminder to fliers that the 
lawnmower-like drone of their gas-powered planes was disturbing homeowners and 
breaking the concentration of golfers. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound just kind of travels everywhere," said Parker Hancock, supervising 
park ranger. "They sound like this: "NYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" 
</P>
<P>
Even those who criticize the sport acknowledge that the overwhelming majority 
of enthusiasts are conscientious. Many hobbyists have turned to quiet, 
electrically powered planes or gliders. Most clubs offer training, and 
legitimate flying fields require pilots to belong to the AMA and carry $1 
million in liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of these people are very safety conscious," Hancock said. "A lot 
of these folks are retirees, and they put a lot of time and resources into 
this." 
</P>
<P>
But Jarrin said that ever since his 1986 airborne surprise, he has been 
expecting an accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of the people who fly are really good. But sometimes a guy 
gets a little carried away or loses control of the plane," he said. "All it 
takes is one guy trying to show off to ruin it for everybody."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THE CRIMES OF SILBERMAN MAY YET RETURN TO HAUNT GOLDING'S 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The common wisdom is that Supervisor Susan Golding survived her husband's 
money-laundering trial without much damage to her chances of being elected 
mayor in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the trial produced no evidence that Golding knew that her husband, 
Richard T. Silberman, was fiddling with what he thought was Colombian drug 
money. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean the case won't return to harass Golding politically. 
</P>
<P>
If it does become an issue, Exhibit A may be a sizzling document filed by 
federal prosecutors in response to Silberman's recent plea of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argue that, after his arrest, Silberman began transferring his 
property and other assets to Golding in an attempt to avoid a massive fine or 
forfeiture of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Golding arranged to swap half-interests in adjoining houses on La 
Jolla Scenic Drive, making Silberman full owner of one, Golding full owner of 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's house was then sold for $920,000, which Silberman said netted only 
$170,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors suspect that the equity in the house retained by Golding is 
"substantially higher" than $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
In short: Golding gets lots of equity, Silberman gets the chance to plead 
poverty. The Golding house is now for sale for $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also transferred his Jaguar to Golding. Later, his son, Jeff, bought 
Silberman's Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said: "The court should not countenance a procedure whereby a 
defendant pleads 'poverty' after transferring away his assets to family 
members." 
</P>
<P>
As an added shot, prosecutors contend that Golding should be held liable for 
Silberman's remaining $1.5-million legal bill. The bill was mailed to Golding's 
County Administration Center office, addressed to both her and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Normally accessible to the press, Golding hasn't been available this week to 
discuss her finances or her political future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buy/Rent/Lease . . . Please! 
</P>
<P>
It says here. 
</P>
<P>
* How cold is the real estate market? 
</P>
<P>
The Jelley Co., one of San Diego's biggest firms, is reduced to handing out 
flyers on downtown street corners to hawk its Mid-City bargains: 
</P>
<P>
"Free phone qualification with no obligation!" 
</P>
<P>
* Forget the package of goodies being arranged by the Convention &amp; Visitors 
Bureau. If San Diego lands the Republican National Convention for 1992, it may 
be the personal ties that count. 
</P>
<P>
Like the fact that Sig Rogich, the Las Vegas advertising executive who is

BURGREEN WANTS NEW ETHICS GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED ON PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acknowledging that members of his department may have had improper contact with 
prostitutes, San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen wants to establish new ethics 
guidelines to discourage officers from any such involvement in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said the move comes in response to findings by the Metropolitan 
Homicide Task Force, the group examining the deaths of 43 women -- mostly 
prostitutes and transients -- who have been slain in the past five years. One 
unit of the task force is investigating possible police corruption, including 
police ties to prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burgreen declined to say what the findings were, he said he is intent 
on making some changes "that address the traditional aspects of police work 
with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There may have been some people who did things that were improper or illegal," 
he said of allegations linking officers to prostitutes. "I think there were 
some things that were going on in the mid-1980s. The only thing you can do now 
is to find those people and prosecute them." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen would not say how many officers may have been involved with 
prostitutes, but sources have told The Times that at least five current 
officers and one former officer were under the task force's investigation for 
their ties to prostitutes Donna Gentile and Cynthia Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Gentile was killed and Maine disappeared shortly after naming police officers 
who were involved with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, police internal affairs detectives looked into allegations that some 
officers had sex with Maine, but could not determine whether the charges were 
true or false. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department has long had a policy that prohibits officers from 
engaging in criminal activity or having a personal relationship with anyone who 
has a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
However, Burgreen said he wants the prostitute issue included in a broad study 
already under way that he says will result in new training programs and 
procedures that stress the perils of police corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is how do we assure ourselves that we are not hiring people who 
are prone to that type of activity and how do we make sure in our training that 
we reinforce those values?" he said. "How do we make sure . . . that we are 
properly watching for those kinds of problems, and even further, how can we be 
proactive to keep those things from happening?" 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen established an office of professional responsibility in March to help 
discourage officers who might consider getting involved with narcotics or be 
tempted to steal drugs or drug money, as has happened in several police 
departments throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The first result of that office's research came last month when the department 
decided to impose mandatory random drug testing on officers who serve in units 
whose members are at high risk of being exposed to narcotics corruption. Those 
units include criminal intelligence, the gang unit, internal affairs, the 
narcotics street team, the narcotics task force and the vice squad. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of police and prostitutes now must be added because of "what we have 
learned through our work with the homicide task force," Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which was created in 1988, is made up of 23 members of the 
Police Department, Sheriff's Department, district attorney's and state attorney 
general's offices. The state is leading the task force unit that is 
investigating possible police corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said any officer involved with prostitutes "will be dealt with 
administratively," but not until the task force has concluded its 
investigation. "You cannot intersperse administrative investigations and 
criminal investigations. You end up screwing both of them up because the laws 
are different." 
</P>
<P>
A police officer can be fired for personal involvement with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said he is most interested in "finding a defendant" in the cases of 
Donna Gentile and Cynthia Maine, both police informants. Gentile testified 
against two police officers in 1985 and shortly thereafter was found murdered 
in East County. Rocks had been stuffed in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Maine served a jail term in late 1985, which was shortened because she gave 
incriminating evidence to the department's internal affairs division that 
linked police and prostitutes, her family said. Two months after she was 
released from jail, she disappeared and has not been found. Her family said she 
had a lengthy affair with police Officer John Fung, now a member of the 
narcotics task force. 
</P>
<P>
Fung has not returned repeated telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Maine's family also said she had contact with former Sgt. Dennis Sesma, Sgt. 
Sal Salvatierra and Detective Les Oberlies. Salvatierra volunteered to allow 
the task force to search his San Diego home two weeks ago. His attorney said 
there is nothing to link his client to Maine's disappearance. Sesma has denied 
wrongdoing. Oberlies could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement source close to the task force said the agency is interested 
only in police involvement with prostitutes who are either dead or missing. So 
far, the source said, the task force has found links only between police 
officers and Maine or Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen and Deputy Chief Mike Rice, who is heading the ethics committee, said 
the public mistakenly assumes it is wrong for prostitutes to work as police 
informants. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't run a police department without associating with prostitutes," 
Burgreen said. "Prostitutes are useful informants. And just because we use them 
as informants doesn't mean police officers kill them." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said he will have the recommendations of his ethics committee ready by the 
end of the year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YEAR'S SENTENCE URGED IN JURY-TAMPERING 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juror who contacted businessman Michael Goland during deliberations in his 
election-fraud trial did so in an attempt to get established in the real estate 
business and deserves at least a year in prison, prosecutors said in court 
documents released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Kuhnke, 32, who pleaded guilty in Los Angeles to contempt of court for 
contacting Goland in an attempt to arrange a verdict in the trial last May, 
told Goland he would "appreciate a show of consideration," a sentencing 
recommendation filed by prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhnke's sentencing was postponed until Oct. 29. Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen 
Mansfield has recommended he receive at least a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
After several attempts to get Goland's attention at the courthouse, Kuhnke 
confronted the defendant in a parking garage and told Goland, "I'm in control 
of your fate." He then tossed Goland a note, which began with the promise: 
"Michael, I can make it happen."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER, SON ARRESTED IN 'SEX PARTY' FOR 200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father and son were arrested Thursday on warrants charging them with felony 
pandering for allegedly organizing a "sexually explicit" party at a Windsor 
Hills banquet hall last month attended by about 200 men and a dozen paid female 
strippers, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Williams Sr., 56, and Allen Jr., 30, were arrested at their home in the 
1100 block of 43rd Place in Los Angeles and are being held in the County Jail 
in lieu of $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said evidence seized in searches of a house in Los Angeles and one in 
San Bernardino County allegedly link the Williamses to similar parties at other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
While checking out a complaint of a disturbance at Ashton's Shatto in the 3700 
block of Slauson Avenue last month, deputies discovered a wild "sex party" 
where naked women were "performing various sexual acts with the men." The 
Williamses were not present at that party, deputies said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISTRIAL DECLARED IN GRAND THEFT CASE OF 
EX-OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 for guilt, a mistrial has been declared in the 
case of a former Compton police officer charged with grand theft for allegedly 
cashing the same paycheck twice, prosecutors said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Perez's mistrial was declared by Superior Court Judge George Trammel 
earlier this week after three days of jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors intend to retry Perez, 54. A new trial date will be selected at an 
Oct. 22 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb Lapin said Perez twice cashed his $1,200 paycheck on 
March 3, 1989. Perez testified that he was not guilty of the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Lapin said that the one juror who voted for acquittal refused to explain her 
reasons for doing so.

BARR SUES 2 TABLOIDS FOR PRINTING HER LOVE LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television comedian Roseanne Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold, filed a 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit Thursday alleging that two national tabloids stole 
four love letters she had written to him and published them earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, in addition to alleging invasion of privacy, took the unusual 
approach of invoking the RICO federal racketeering statute against the National 
Enquirer and the Star. The U.S. District Court lawsuit said the supermarket 
weeklies engaged in a pattern of racketeering and civil rights violations by 
publishing the love letters. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit did not say how Barr and Arnold believe the "intensely personal 
letters" were pilfered, noting only that they were kept "in a private, and 
presumably secure place." 
</P>
<P>
But it attacked the publication of the letters as "despicable, extreme and 
outrageous" and criticized the tabloids for using an "informant enterprise" to 
gather juicy tidbits on celebrities through paid informants. 
</P>
<P>
Star officials could not be reached for comment. The editor of the National 
Enquirer discounted the $110-million suit as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Enquirer Editor and President Iain Calder declined to say 
where the tabloid got the letters, published in February, but he said: "This is 
just another pathetic publicity stunt by Roseanne. She is trashing the National 
Enquirer, but we are in good company." 
</P>
<P>
The legal action is only the latest salvo in Barr's running battle with the 
tabloids, which she says have harassed her on her rise to stardom by running 
stories of drug addiction and family fights, by following her and by paying 
informants for information about her. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's husband was once one of those informants, according to the Enquirer. The 
reports later were acknowledged by Barr herself, who called it "a huge mistake" 
and said Arnold apparently wanted to raise money for their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
Barr and Arnold were in the studio of her weekly ABC-TV sitcom "Roseanne" on 
Thursday and did not want to talk about the lawsuit, according to an assistant 
who did not want to be identified. "They're laying low," the assistant said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Barr's attorney declined to discuss the suit, which in addition to 
damages seeks a court order to prohibit the tabloids from using the letters 
again and to force their return. 
</P>
<P>
The Enquirer ran excerpts from the letters under the headline "Roseanne's Own 
Words of Love -- Excerpts From Letter to Fiance." 
</P>
<P>
Gavin de Becker, who has tangled with the tabloids often in his role as private 
consultant to media stars, said Barr's suit "will be a far more challenging 
courtroom battle than most that (the tabloids) face." 
</P>
<P>
"What makes this significant is that it is not a libel suit, so it's out of the 
domain of the Enquirer's speciality -- which is resisting libel suits," he 
said. "I think they have a very difficult time ahead of them because this 
lawsuit alleges criminal conduct that is clearly not protected by the First 
Amendment."

MURDER SUSPECT OPENED WAY FOR OWN ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS WIFE GAVE INVESTIGATORS X-RAYS THAT HELPED 
IDENTIFY HER CHARRED BODY. 
</P>

<P>
A La Canada Flintridge man who was arrested this week for allegedly murdering 
his wife and setting her body on fire may have unwittingly provided the key to 
his own arrest, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County sheriff's officials said they had no clues to the 
identity of the charred body found in the desert three weeks ago until Don 
Miralle, 46, contacted the county coroner last week. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays provided by Miralle were used to identify the body of Tessie Miralle, 
49, a prominent businesswoman who disappeared Sept. 12 after visiting her 
husband's office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found Sept. 13 but was not identified until after Don Miralle 
called the coroner on Sept. 25. Without Miralle's help, identifying the body 
and finding a suspect "more than likely would have been very difficult," said 
Detective Pierre Ingersoll of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Miralle, a civil engineer, was arrested late Wednesday by San Bernardino 
authorities after he returned home from his wife's funeral. An arrest warrant 
had been issued earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll said Miralle "was very calm and showed no emotion" when he was 
arrested in front of his three distraught children, a college-age daughter and 
two teen-age sons. The children pleaded that their father was innocent, 
Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
Miralle is being held without bail at the Central Detention Center in San 
Bernardino. Arraignment is scheduled for today in Victorville Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said tire prints found near the body were traced to a vehicle owned 
by Miralle. Ingersoll said Miralle had a new set of tires put on his 1990 
Chevrolet Suburban in Pasadena two days after the wife's body was found. He 
said the tires taken off the vehicle and left at a Pasadena tire dealer matched 
the prints found in the desert. Evidence also was found at Miralle's office and 
home, Ingersoll said. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives and coroner's investigators said they initially had few clues and 
little hope of identifying the body, which had been burned beyond recognition. 
A plume of smoke rising out of a remote desert area caught the attention of a 
motorist who discovered the still-smoldering body off a dirt road in the El 
Mirage area, west of Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
A man who described himself as a friend of Miralle said that when he heard that 
a body had been found, he urged Miralle to call the San Bernardino County 
coroner, which gave a big boost to the sheriff's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The body was positively identified Sept. 28 by forensic dentists who used 
X-rays supplied to investigators by Don Miralle. 
</P>
<P>
The friend, who asked not to be identified, said he was shocked when he learned 
Miralle had been arrested. "I still can't believe it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have not found a motive, although they learned that the couple 
had talked about divorce for years. Tessie Miralle had hired a private 
detective last spring to determine if her husband was being unfaithful, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Miralle cried at times and appeared emotionally stricken during 
the funeral Wednesday at St. Bede's Roman Catholic Church in La Canada 
Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people attended a funeral Mass on Tuesday evening at the church, 
where the Miralle family has been active. Tessie Miralle was buried Wednesday 
at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills. More than 300 people, many 
of them community leaders, attended a funeral reception Wednesday afternoon at 
a private club in La Canada Flintridge.

LETHAL SECTION OF I-5 TO GET GUARDRAIL;

<P>
HIGHWAY SAFETY: THE $1.8-MILLION PROJECT BEGAN ALONG A 13-MILE STRETCH OF THE 
FREEWAY NEAR GORMAN. SIX PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN HEAD-ON COLLISIONS THERE THIS 
YEAR.

<P>
Caltrans began a $1.8-million dollar project this week to install a center 
guardrail on the Golden State Freeway along a stretch of road in northern Los 
Angeles County where six motorists have died in head-on collisions this year. 
</P>
<P>
The steel barriers will be placed along a 13-mile stretch of the freeway going 
north from Templin Highway near Castaic Lake to Hungry Valley Road near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Thomas Knox said actual construction could begin any day. 
Contractors began stockpiling rails to be used for the project at a Templin 
Highway storage yard Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the Interstate 5 project, which was approved by the state more 
than a year ago, is expected to be completed by February. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good news because of the accidents we've been having," said Capt. 
Terry Horan, head of the California Highway Patrol's Newhall district, which 
includes the area where the barrier will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
"This will make it safer," Horan said. "The head-on collisions demonstrated the 
need for a barrier. There were fatals; there were accidents where a blown tire 
could send cars into the other side." 
</P>
<P>
The four northbound and four southbound lanes of the freeway -- the major 
artery linking the Southland with the San Joaquin Valley -- are divided by 
guardrails or canyons throughout the Santa Clarita Valley. But the separation 
ends from Templin Highway north to California 138 above Hungry Valley. Along 
this stretch, the northbound and southbound lanes are separated only by a 
36-foot-wide gravel median that dips in the center. 
</P>
<P>
The guardrail project is part of a statewide plan to add safety barriers along 
the entire length of Interstate 5 as increased population and traffic dictates, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers said that in recent years there have been numerous accidents along 
the stretch that were caused when cars crossed the center strip into oncoming 
traffic. Since April, six people have been killed in four separate accidents 
involving head-on collisions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the deaths, the accidents often cause massive traffic snarls on 
both sides of the freeway -- the state's major north-south artery. On Aug. 5, a 
head-on collision in Sunday evening traffic near Templin Highway left one 
motorist dead and delayed weekend travelers more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Steve Cortes, who has patrolled the stretch through open, 
mountainous country, said the area is heavily traveled by trucks and motorists 
making lengthy drives to or from Northern California. He said that several of 
the accidents he has investigated there involved drivers who fell asleep and 
drifted into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to prevent a lot of serious accidents," Cortes said of the new 
center guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
Cortes said that once while chasing a speeding car along the stretch, his 
patrol car blew a tire and veered across the center median and all four 
oncoming lanes. It was 3 a.m. and traffic was light. He and his partner came 
out of it shaken but unscathed.

RULING IN CAMARENA CASE FLAWED, JUSTICE DEPT. APPEAL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: DECISION THAT THE U.S. VIOLATED ITS TREATY WITH MEXICO BY KIDNAPING 
DOCTOR IS 'WITHOUT PRECEDENT,' GOVERNMENT SAYS. DOCTOR WAS INDICTED IN MURDER 
OF DRUG AGENT.

The Justice Department said Thursday that a Los Angeles federal judge made 
serious legal errors when he ruled that a Drug Enforcement 
Administration-orchestrated kidnaping in Guadalajara of a suspect in the 
Enrique Camarena murder case violated a U.S. extradition treaty with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's Aug. 10 ruling "is without precedent in 
U.S. law," according to a government brief seeking to overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The brief, written by Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey, contends that 
Rafeedie's decision misconstrued the treaty and also "brushes aside more than 
100 years of Supreme Court precedents" that a forcible abduction does not 
violate due process. 
</P>
<P>
In a precedent-setting decision, Rafeedie ruled that the United States violated 
its extradition treaty with Mexico when it "unilaterally abducted" Dr. Humberto 
Alvarez Machain from his Guadalajara office on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
"This court lacks jurisdiction to try this defendant," the judge declared, 
ordering the government to return Alvarez to Mexico. But Rafeedie postponed 
issuing the order until prosecutors could appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors immediately expressed objection to the ruling and said that 
if the decision was upheld, it could impede their efforts to apprehend some of 
the remaining suspects in the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
The brief also contends that the extradition treaty is irrelevant to this case 
because the U.S. government did not formally ask the Mexican government to 
extradite Alvarez. Justice Department officials said it would have been a 
futile gesture because Mexico has not extradited any Mexican national to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The brief also contends that the judge's ruling "effectively usurped the 
executive branch's authority to conduct foreign relations with the government 
of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was kidnaped by six current and former Mexican policemen who had been 
recruited by a veteran Los Angeles-based DEA operative named Antonio Garate 
Bustamante. Garate, under the supervision of DEA agent Hector Berrellez, 
arranged for the kidnaping and both men were present when Garate's recruits 
turned Alvarez over in El Paso on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Alvarez was indicted by a federal grand jury on five felony 
charges stemming from the February, 1985, kidnaping and murder of Camarena, a 
veteran DEA agent, in Guadalajara. The indictment alleges that Alvarez 
administered drugs to Camarena to prolong his life so that he could be further 
tortured and interrogated at the home of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro 
Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez has denied committing any crimes but has acknowledged that he had been 
a physician for Caro and that he was at the house when Camarena was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
The Alvarez kidnaping precipitated a major controversy between the United 
States and Mexico. Mexican officials charged that the abduction violated 
Mexico's sovereignty. Not long after the abduction, charges were filed against 
Alvarez by Mexican officials stemming from the Camarena killing. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's lawyers are expected to file a reply to the U.S. government's brief 
by the end of the month. In early September, the American Civil Liberties Union 
undertook representation of Alvarez solely for the purposes of the appeal. The 
ACLU decided to take on the case after his attorney, Robert K. Steinberg, said 
he could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue about the U.S. government essentially going into other countries and 
kidnaping someone is a significant human rights issue," Paul Hoffman, the 
ACLU's Southern California legal director, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Rafeedie denied Alvarez bail in late August on grounds that he 
constitutes a flight risk.

SOCKERS SIGN 2ND-ROUND PICK BANKS, NGUYEN 
</P>

<P>
David Banks, the Sockers' second-round draft pick from Philadelphia Textile, 
signed with the team Thursday morning. The Sockers also announced the signing 
of Thien Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
Both will carry a heavy burden into the season, now only two weeks away. 
Despite having no indoor experience, Banks will be counted on as a main 
contributor on a defense weakened by defections over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was a developmental player last year and played in only 23 games, 
scoring one goal and assisting on four others. He was a part-time player partly 
by choice, often making graduate studies at UC San Diego his first priority. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Ron Newman expects a lot from him, saying Nguyen has the potential to 
become one of the best midfielders in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Banks is still uncertain what his role will be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still fighting for a place as a rookie," he said. "But the boss (Newman) 
told me I could probably come in and play right away. I'm ready. I'm 
confident." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers will be counting on that kind of youthful exuberance. They now have 
14 players under contract, seven of whom have two or fewer years of experience. 
They need to sign four more, plus three developmental players, and all 
remaining unsigned players in camp are rookies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exciting young team, I can tell you that," Newman said. "It's not 
like past Sockers teams that rely on experience, but I think we can put 
everything together and start to win." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest concern remains goalkeeping. The Sockers still have no backup to 
Victor Nogueira, who was the only goalie left in camp Thursday. Assistant coach 
Erich Geyer said Nenad Zigante, who played in Wichita in 1987-89, will be 
brought in today.

<P>
Rudy Suwara coached his 400th women's volleyball match victory at San Diego 
State Thursday as the Aztecs defeated Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 15-8, 15-10, 
15-6. 
</P>
<P>
His first women's victory at SDSU was Oct. 8, 1976, and 10 years ago Thursday, 
he won his 100th match. 
</P>

Including four years of coaching men at UC Santa Barbara and five years with 
the SDSU men's team, he has a record of 564-284-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been lucky to be at a real good school with a lot of support," Suwara 
said earlier this week. "And I've been lucky enough to have a lot of wonderful 
players over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Stephanie Riley (Patrick Henry) had six kills with a .625 hitting 
percentage. Shannon Mathew had seven kills.

CRESCENTA VALLEY WINS BEHIND RARE PITCH FROM MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Miller spends most of his time catching passes for the Crescenta Valley 
High football team. But Thursday night, he found himself throwing one, a 
21-yard scoring strike to Ray Grijalva that gave the Falcons a 
come-from-behind, 7-6 victory over Burroughs in a nonleague game at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The scoring play, which came with 56 seconds left in the third quarter, capped 
a nine-play, 65-yard drive and followed Burroughs' only score of the game. 
Quarterback Aaron Schaefer pitched the ball to running back Jason Schwaiger, 
who flipped it to Miller coming around on a reverse. Miller, the Falcons' 
leading receiver, then hit Grijalva, who had to come back for the ball on the 
one-yard line. Grijalva took it in from there for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Steinlight's point-after was the margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shot in the dark," Crescenta Valley Coach Jim Beckenhauer said. 
"Burroughs was playing tough defense and we had to make something happen. We 
had to use a gimmick to beat them tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs (0-5) had taken the lead when Steve Garza scored on a seven-yard run 
with 6 minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter. The touchdown was set up 
when Marco Cecena intercepted a Schaefer pass at the Crescenta Valley 32. Eddie 
Gavilan missed the conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley is 3-2.

VERSATILE KENNEDY SENIOR KEITH WEST BUBBLES WITH ENERGY AS HE DISTINGUISHES 
HIMSELF THROUGH HIS NONSTOP APPROACH TO FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marathoners have it made. At strategic places along their race route, they 
canreach out and grab a cup of water from a smiling volunteer and never even 
have to break stride. 
</P>
<P>
A similar system is in place on Kennedy High's football team to accommodate 
Keith West, a marathon man in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith has his own special water girl," Kennedy assistant Craig Raub said. 
"There's only one rule: Any time he comes near the sideline, she has to find 
him and get water to him." 
</P>
<P>
West, a senior, does not stand still for long, and sometimes he does not even 
slow down. As the Golden Cougars' lone two-way starter -- he also is their 
kicker and punter -- he only occasionally drops by the sideline to collect a 
few syllables of coaching wisdom before he returns to the field to play 
defensive back and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
A substitute? That's some four-eyed nerd who fills in when the science teacher 
is sick. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only off the field for kick and punt returns," Raub said. "And I'll tell 
you what, with his hands, we're real tempted to leave him out there for that 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (3-0) will showcase West tonight when the Golden Cougars play host to 
rival Granada Hills (2-1) in a Northwest Valley Conference opener at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola routinely raves about West's superior "eye-hand 
coordination" as a receiver. But that's only half the story, or more 
accurately, three-quarters. West's best weapon might be his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season as kicker, West already has nailed a 50-yard field goal, 
easily besting the school record of 43 yards. Last season, as the punter, West 
averaged 38.9 yards and banged out a 79-yard bomb, believed to be another 
school mark. He is averaging 45.0 yards a punt this season. 
</P>
<P>
Testament to the faith that Francola has in West: Earlier this season, he 
allowed the 6-foot, 175-pound standout to attempt a 60-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't get all of it," Francola said, "And it still didn't miss by much." 
</P>
<P>
West, who Francola says has drawn the attention of Pacific 10 Conference 
recruiters as a kicker, said he knew he was inheriting the kicking job and took 
his preparation seriously. West spent hours at the Kennedy field this summer, 
hammering away. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it was clear that he possessed all the tools. Except one. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a tee," West said. "So I just kicked them off the ground. I had 
one day where I made four out of eight from 60 yards. They didn't clear (the 
crossbar) by much, but they went through. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that someday, in a game, I can make one from 60 because my adrenaline 
really gets going." 
</P>
<P>
If anybody should be used to whistling balls off a grass surface, West is the 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, West credited soccer for his success as a kicker. If you can 
connect with a moving target, booting a stationary football is easy, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps with the coordination of my feet," he said. "Plus, it helps because 
soccer is a lot of quick get-offs. You have to get started fast." 
</P>
<P>
Last soccer season, he scored a team-high 15 goals. The Golden Cougars advanced 
to the City Section final, in which they lost to Bell, 1-0. West, a midfielder 
who was selected to the All-City team, had his fingerprints on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"They called a hand ball on me that game that was not a hand ball," West said. 
</P>
<P>
Take note, because this is perhaps the only time West has admitted that he did 
not get his hands on the ball. Last season, West finished third among area City 
players with 29 receptions for 314 yards and four touchdowns. He led all 
returning area City players in receptions and has hauled in 14 passes for 198 
yards in three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as integral as West is to Kennedy's passing game, he first made his mark as 
a defensive back in the team's 1988 opener against Hamilton. As a sophomore, 
West became a starter at free safety, although his initial insertion into the 
lineup was something of a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't expecting to play much, but Alfred Owens lost an ear pad about two 
minutes before halftime," West said of his former teammate, a senior. "The next 
thing I know, Raub is yelling my name, so I popped out on the field. I ended up 
recovering a fumble and he said, 'You're starting the second half.' " 
</P>
<P>
West, a three-year starter and a team captain, has played a prominent role in 
Kennedy's surprising defensive turnaround. After three games in 1989, the 
Golden Cougars were 1-2 and had been outscored, 106-60. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about role reversals. Kennedy has outscored its opponents, 106-2, and is 
off to its best start under Francola, who took over as coach in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw early that Keith was nearly as good as the veterans we had," said 
Francola, recalling West's sophomore season. "When happenstance put him on the 
field, he never came off. He had great instincts, even as a pup." 
</P>
<P>
This year, there has been plenty to woof about. The 1990 Golden Cougars have 
drawn comparisons to Francola's first team in which six defensive players 
landed Division I scholarships. In a season in which Kennedy twice lost to 
powerful Banning -- then ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today -- the Golden 
Cougars nonetheless allowed just 89 points and an average of 80.8 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
In victories over Narbonne, Franklin and Crenshaw, Kennedy has allowed a total 
of 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised," West said. "I knew we were going to be tough because we 
had eight returners on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Francola freely admits that the team's weak nonleague schedule has played a 
part in its overwhelming success -- the two points Kennedy has allowed came 
when a Golden Cougar defender returned an interception the wrong way for a 
safety -- but West confidently predicts more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to take 'em bad this year," West said in reference to 
archrival Granada Hills, whose lone loss has been to defending City 4-A 
champion Dorsey. "I think we'll blow them out in the third and fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"They have all those two-way players." 
</P>
<P>
He should know. But at least playing both ways affords him the chance to back 
up his words. Should something happen to West, however, finding a backup will 
not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of what he's able to do, he'd be real hard to replace," Francola 
said. "If Keith got hurt, we'd have to replace him with the kind of kid that 
everybody else has." 
</P>
<P>
If not four kids. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have a 30-yard punter, a 25-yard field-goal kicker and somebody who could 
probably catch the ball and fall down," Francola said. "We'd feel the crunch." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, sometimes West feels like falling over too. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week against Crenshaw the water girl was too good," West said, laughing. 
"I drank too much water and started cramping up, and I had to take myself out. 
</P>
<P>
"The next play after I leave, Billy Sanders intercepted a ball playing my 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
So far, it is the only blemish on a watershed season.

USAIR TO RETURN A FEW OF PSA'S FAMOUS SMILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USAir, which wiped the smiles off of Pacific Southwest Airlines' jetliners 
after acquiring the San Diego-based airline in early 1988, is grinning once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
USAir won't be painting smiles on its own jet fleet, but the Washington-based 
airline is adding smiles to the noses of nine USAir Express propjets that 
provide commuter service in California, Arizona and Nevada, USAir spokesman 
Larry Pickett said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
PSA folklore credits the first smile to a mischievous maintenance man with a 
paint brush. But former PSA executives have maintained that smile evolved from 
a 1969 advertising campaign that eventually included the airline's "Catch our 
Smile" slogan. By the mid-1980s, only United Air Line's "Friendly Skies" slogan 
commanded more recognition among West Coast travelers than the PSA slogan and 
the smile. 
</P>
<P>
USAir, however, retired the smile after "extensive marketing studies" indicated 
that the smile lost its power outside of PSA's service territory. "A smiling 
plane going into La Guardia might not have the same marketing impact" as a 
smile-bedecked airliner landing at Los Angeles International, Pickett said. 
</P>
<P>
USAir, which is facing increased competition in the Los Angeles-San Francisco 
corridor, believes that the copyrighted smile retains enough recognition among 
consumers to help boost market share for the USAir Express operation that 
Phoenix-based StatesWest Airlines has operated for USAir since July. 
</P>
<P>
"USAir has been feeling increased (pressure) as far as our regional 
operations," Pickett said. "But we're still the major carrier in California 
with more flights than anybody else." Pickett described the smile's return as 
part of a "more energetic marketing approach" by USAir. 
</P>
<P>
StatesWest, which has painted its aircraft to match USAir's red, white and blue 
livery, is "very excited about having the smile," said StatesWest founder, 
chairman and chief executive, Rudy R. Miller. "We're building on a great 
recognition factor that PSA developed." 
</P>
<P>
Miller wanted to use the smile because, like the old PSA, USAir Express is a 
"fun-oriented West Coast customer service attitude." StatesWest actively sought 
USAir's approval to use the PSA smile, a registered trademark that is owned by 
USAir, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising world recalls the PSA smile "as an outstanding and fun" tool, 
according to Bob Kwait, an executive with Phillips Ramsey, a San Diego-based 
advertising agency. Kwait was uncertain, however, if the smile was powerful 
enough to help an airline other than PSA. 
</P>
<P>
The PSA smile's return generated smiles and a few quips from executives at 
Southwest Airlines, the Texas-based airline that has for years advertised 
itself as PSA's rightful heir in the California market where PSA dominated 
because of its low fares, high frequencies and personalized service. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it quite humorous that you can paint smiles on the outside," Southwest 
Vice President Don Valentine said. "I always thought that smiles came from 
within." 
</P>
<P>
Valentine described PSA's smile and the corresponding "Catch Our Smile" 
advertising campaign as "a classic success story." But he cautioned that USAir 
Express' advertising campaign would soon fade away unless the commuter airline 
offers the low fares, high frequencies and personal service that Californians 
now expect. 
</P>
<P>
And, one former PSA executive noted that the smile's marketing power might 
already have faded. "Having taken it off at the acquisition, (USAir) would seem 
to have lost the momentum," the executive said.

HOUSE VOTES TO EXPAND LIST OF CAPITAL CRIMES 
</P>

The House voted Thursday to expand the list of federal crimes subject to 
capital punishment, including major drug crimes during which someone is killed 
even indirectly, and to sharply limit appeals for Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents called the amendments too harsh and complained that members of 
Congress were posturing for their constituents. At one point there were 
sardonic shouts of "Kill! Kill! Kill!" from the Democratic side of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"Would it be possible to bring the guillotine directly to the House floor?" 
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.) asked sarcastically during debate on one amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough day for the Constitution," Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N.J.), 
the architect of a more moderate anti-crime bill, told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George W. Gekas (R-Pa.) retorted that the measure has the support of 
everyone "from the cop on the beat to the man on the street." 
</P>
<P>
The tough law-and-order measures, pushed by Republicans and conservative 
Democrats, were approved as House members worked on an anti-crime bill that 
they hope to pass today or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Three amendments added 12 federal crimes to those that carry the death penalty. 
They include assassination of the President and numerous other federal 
officials, murder by mail bombings, terrorist bombings in planes, trains and 
cars if someone is killed and the murder of a federally protected witness. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-crime bill backed by Hughes, chairman of the House Judiciary 
subcommittee on crime, already had proposed the death penalty for espionage, 
treason and the assassination of a President or foreign official visiting the 
United States. But he cautioned that too broad a list of capital crimes might 
invite the Supreme Court to rule such punishment unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in 1972 invalidated all death penalty laws in place at that 
time. But Congress and 37 states have passed new laws since then to meet 
constitutional objections. Congress has established capital punishment for air 
piracy where a victim has died and for certain drug-related crimes, but no one 
yet has been put to death for such offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes complained that an amendment providing the death penalty in certain 
cases for "drug kingpins" would allow a drug defendant to be put to death if 
the offense contributed to a fatal auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we planning to execute people just because they deal in drugs?" asked 
Hughes, a former prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
House members also approved, by a vote of 285 to 146, a key amendment that its 
sponsor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R -- Ill.), said would prevent Death Row inmates 
from being allowed to "delay, delay, delay." 
</P>
<P>
The current appeals process for capital punishment cases, known as habeas 
corpus, allows prisoners to petition state and federal courts claiming that 
they were denied their constitutional rights. Some Death Row inmates have filed 
repeated appeals, delaying their executions for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Hyde proposal, an inmate would have only six months after his final 
sentencing to file an appeal and would be limited to one state and one federal 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of that amendment was a victory for the Bush Adminstration, which 
protested an earlier Democratic version that would have set a time limit for 
prisoners to file appeals but also would have guaranteed them competent 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Another anti-crime measure adopted by the House would permit the continued 
domestic manufacture of semiautomatic assault weapons as long as all the parts 
are made in America. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration last year banned the importation of foreign-made 
assault weapons, but imposed no restrictions on U.S.-made weapons of an 
identical nature. 
</P>
<P>
"These are weapons of murder," objected Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.). "It doesn't 
matter whether they're produced in this country or in China."

RELIGION: JOHN WIMBER'S MERGING OF SUPERNATURAL POWER AND BIBLICAL PROPHECY HAS 
LED TO A 'BOOM CHURCH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After John Wimber stopped working as a music arranger for the Righteous 
Brothers to become a pastor, he began leading a small prayer group in Yorba 
Linda 13 years ago, preaching from the Gospel of Luke about healing the sick 
and casting out demons. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 months the fledgling church repeatedly prayed over the sick without 
seeing one person healed or a single demon expelled. Many people left in 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Wimber was about to give up when he was asked to pray for a woman with a high 
fever. She eventually jumped up, apparently cured. When the realization of what 
had happened hit Wimber later, he yelled, "We got one!" 
</P>
<P>
That experience galvanized Wimber's convictions that the spiritual gifts of 
healing, speaking in tongues, and "words of knowledge and prophecy" referred to 
in the Bible were still relevant and that he could bash Satan, sin and sickness 
with the ultimate power of God. 
</P>
<P>
A trickle of reported healings became a flood. And in Southern California's 
fertile religious soil, John Wimber's Vineyard Christian Fellowship took root 
as the latest "boom church." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim congregation has grown to 5,000. A network of nearly 300 Vineyard 
churches with about 100,000 followers -- most of them "baby boomers" -- 
stretches across the nation and into four countries overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Vineyard's origins hark back to the hippie-era "Jesus People" movement that 
neighboring Costa Mesa pastor Chuck Smith helped launch in the late 1960s and 
1970s through his chain of Calvary Chapels. But Wimber's emphasis seems to 
reach a different stratum: Younger believers who want to wed an orthodox, 
Bible-believing faith with immediate and palpable spiritual power and emotional 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Vineyard story underscores recent findings of experts on church growth: 
More and more Americans are reaching outside the traditional, established 
denominations to find spiritual identification. Indeed, a high percentage of 
the nation's fastest-growing congregations are either independent or affiliated 
with new and loosely formed movements like Vineyard and the Calvary Chapels. 
</P>
<P>
"I was into organized religion most of my life -- Presbyterian and Evangelical 
Free churches," said Sandy Younger, who has been attending the Anaheim Vineyard 
for four years. "But something was always lacking until I heard John (Wimber) 
preach. It was so different, so down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
Wimber, 56, is the undisputed mogul of what has come to be known as the "signs 
and wonders" ministry. 
</P>
<P>
To Wimber, it's all very simple: A new wave of supernatural power is rolling 
in, based on the Bible message that Jesus' followers would see "signs and 
wonders" from the Holy Spirit certifying his ministry and resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
The cutting edge of the Vineyard, says Todd Hunter, executive pastor of the 
Anaheim congregation, is that "ordinary Christians can be used (by) God to do 
extraordinary things." 
</P>
<P>
So extraordinary, it seems, that Wimber has been accused of fostering excessive 
emotionalism and anti-intellectualism and misinterpreting Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have time to refute all that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wimber's friend, C. Peter Wagner, professor of church growth at Fuller 
Theological Seminary in Pasadena, says the controversial signs-and-wonders 
phenomenon is the "third wave" of evangelical Christian renewal to occur this 
century. The first wave was the rise of Pentecostalism, the movement that 
sprung up in the early 1900s among poorer and less-educated churchgoers. It 
emphasized the "baptism of the Holy Spirit" and speaking in tongues, or what is 
said to be "praise language" not understood by the person who utters it. 
</P>
<P>
The second wave was the growth of the charismatic renewal movement, which 
burgeoned among Protestant mainliners and Catholics in the 1960s and 1970s as 
they adopted spiritual healing and other Pentecostal practices into their 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
The third wave, Wagner and others say, is characterized by an emphasis on 
supernatural manifestations that now appeal to fundamentalists and conservative 
evangelicals. Until recently, these Christians tended to deny modern-day faith 
healings and regarded prophetic "gifts" as theologically suspect. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1989 study by sociologists Robin D. Perrin of Seattle Pacific 
University and Armand L. Mauss of Washington State University, the great 
majority of Vineyard recruits who listed a denominational background had been 
reared in mainline Protestant or Catholic homes. More recent Vineyard recruits, 
however, had left their liberal religious upbringing and had been "circulating" 
among the conservative denominations. 
</P>
<P>
"John began to draw into the Vineyard the boomers of the late '70s," Wagner 
said. "Many were in their teens. When they were meeting (10 years ago) in 
Canyon High School (in Anaheim Hills) the median age was 19." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, the average age is 29 at Vineyard congregations, which are 
composed mainly of middle- and working-class people. 
</P>
<P>
Wimber and his Vineyards hardly reflect traditional church patterns. 
</P>
<P>
At the Anaheim Vineyard, nearly 4,000 worshipers jam into a boxy, flat building 
-- formerly a Pacific Stereo warehouse -- for two Sunday services, morning and 
evening. The crowd, casually dressed and most carrying Bibles, sits on folding 
chairs under long rows of florescent lights. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see a man wearing a tie or a woman a dress, they're probably visitors," 
quipped Kevin Springer, Wimber's publication director. 
</P>
<P>
There are no songbooks; the lyrics are projected on the front walls. Neither is 
there an altar, organ, candles, cross or other religious trappings, a setting 
typical at the other Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the worshipers raise their arms, praising God. Most songs have been 
composed by members and extol spiritual empowerment and an intimate 
relationship with Jesus. A few worshipers kneel along the back wall, their 
heads in their hands, or touch their foreheads to the floor. A young woman, 
barefoot, gracefully dances to the music. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are 70 Vineyard congregations in Southern California, including 
seven in Orange County, this congregation is special because Wimber preaches 
here. 
</P>
<P>
If you expect a Pentecostal fireball delivery, you'll be disappointed. Wimber, 
dressed in cream-colored slacks and a print sport shirt, is talking about 
tonight's special offering for the poor and homeless. No emotion. No big pitch. 
(Later, it's announced that the day's contributions for this project total 
$180,000. That's on top of the $70,000 that comes in each week to run the 
church.) 
</P>
<P>
The Wimbers do not live ostentatiously; their neatly kept ranch house in Yorba 
Linda and moderately priced cars bespeak middle class. Wimber's $80,000 
combined salary and housing allowance are drawn from about $260,000 in annual 
royalties generated from sales of his many books, and lecture and music tapes. 
The balance goes to the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a reward in heaven, not here," intones Wimber, drawing applause during 
his 50-minute sermon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Vineyard staples are ecstatic worship, prophecies, supernatural 
healing and "deliverance from demon activity," Wimber and his 12-pastor staff 
also take social action seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Vineyard has been the meeting place and staging ground for 
Operation Rescue rallies and demonstrations against abortion. Staffer Monte 
Whitaker spearheads the Vineyard's benevolence arm, which distributes food and 
clothing to the area's needy and puts on a Saturday lunch and Bible service for 
about 300 transients and their children from the predominantly Latino 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
While Wimber is quick to admit that "only a few" of the people he prays for are 
healed of physical ailments and that "I am alive today because of the medical 
profession," he and Wagner launched a course at Fuller Seminary in 1982 that 
included an optional "laboratory" in divine healing. The class, popularly known 
as "Signs and Wonders," was the evangelical school's most popular class ever -- 
until a theological ruckus among faculty and trustees shut it down for a year 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The question about how to explain people who aren't healed was foremost in the 
minds of many of the faculty, Presbyterian pastor Ben Patterson wrote in 
Christianity Today magazine at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Satan win one?" Patterson asked. "If so, then Satan holds a commanding 
lead in the game because the majority of people who are prayed for do not, in 
fact, get well physically." 
</P>
<P>
After an evaluation, the class was reinstated, with Wimber taking a 
less-prominent role. And Fuller officials released a 100-page report that urged 
caution in claiming miracle cures and attempting exorcisms of "evil spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Wimber was dramatically converted to Christianity at the age of 29 from a 
show-biz, rock 'n' roll background. After completing three years of biblical 
study at Azusa Pacific University in 1970, he served as co-pastor of a Quaker 
church in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 he began shepherding the little home group that his wife, Carol, had 
started. Soon he was preaching from Luke on signs and wonders. And, after the 
feverish woman jumped from her sickbed, the trajectory of the Vineyard movement 
also shot up. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Vineyard movement is facing the growing pains of an incipient 
denomination. The name has been trademarked, about 500 men have been ordained, 
and two or three women licensed to preach (Wimber doesn't approve of women's 
ordination). Regional and area pastoral coordinators have been established. A 
larger, 200,000-square-foot building in Anaheim Hills is being purchased and 
renovated for $15 million to house the expanding work. 
</P>
<P>
Vineyard congregations typically multiply in one of two ways: An established 
Vineyard pastor and a cadre of his leaders select a new area and begin Bible 
studies and evangelistic meetings or an existing congregation petitions to be 
"adopted." 
</P>
<P>
The newest congregation to officially link with the Vineyard -- after a year's 
probation under Wimber's supervision -- is the 3,000-member Kansas City 
Fellowship. Two congregations that started from scratch this year are in San 
Diego and Oceanside. The San Diego Vineyard, pastored by Ken Blue, has grown 
from several families to 250 members in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Which congregations and which ministers are accepted out of the many that apply 
for Vineyard status is pretty much up to Wimber. 
</P>
<P>
"I wield a lot of authority in the movement," Wimber acknowledged. "But I take 
instruction and counsel well." 
</P>
<P>
The Vineyard has avoided being trampled with major scandal. And Wimber, who 
seems to have gained wide respect, is clearly in control, keeping tabs on his 
staff and what they teach. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust Wimber and the movement," says Charles Kraft, a professor at Fuller 
Theological Seminary's School of World Mission who helps lead the "Signs and 
Wonders" class. "But there are a lot of very young people involved. . . . It's 
in its adolescence." 
</P>
<P>
And if Wimber should die? 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us think the movement would disintegrate," said Vineyard international 
minister Jack Deere, who was fired from the faculty of Dallas Theological 
Seminary three years ago when he refused to renounce his identification with 
Wimber's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no force to hold it together; he's the cohesiveness, the 
central figure."

DEFICIT: BY 254 TO 179, LAWMAKERS IGNORE PLEAS BY BUSH AND CONGRESSIONAL 
LEADERS TO APPROVE $500-BILLION PACKAGE. CUTS COULD GO INTO EFFECT SATURDAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a stunning defeat for President Bush and the leaders of both parties in 
Congress, the House early today rejected the new five-year, $500-billion 
deficit-reduction plan. The vote was 254 to 179. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats scuttled the 
accord worked out by White House officials and top-ranking members of Congress 
in marathon negotiations that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the vote, the process of resolving the nation's budget dilemma now 
is plunged into uncertainty. About $85 billion in spending cutbacks under the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law that would have been avoided had Congress 
adopted a budget resolution are scheduled to go into effect Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication of what steps the Bush Administration will 
take now. Congress is expected to pass a stopgap resolution today to keep the 
government in operation until Oct. 19 and increase the debt limit to permit the 
Treasury to keep borrowing to finance the debt. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush has said that he would veto any further attempts to delay the 
Gramm-Rudman cutbacks if Congress refused to approve the agreement. That would 
effectively shut down government services Saturday and require furloughs for 1 
million federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who had been expected to oppose the budget plan, did so by a 
margin of 105 to 71. Democrats, who had been expected to favor it, instead 
voted against it by a 149 to 108 margin. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing the result, Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), the presiding 
officer, said: "The Conference Report is rejected," then adjourned the House 
until 10 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.), one of the budget summit negotiators, said 
afterward that he had no idea what would happen next in the House. 
</P>
<P>
The rout of the President and the leadership reflected widespread unhappiness 
not only with the tax increases and spending reductions in the budget accord 
but also a resentment by many rank-and-file lawmakers that they have been left 
out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued before the vote that a 12-cent increase in gasoline taxes, 
cutbacks in Medicare and higher taxes on beer, wine, alcohol and cigarettes 
would trigger a recession. And, they said, the burden would fall more harshly 
on middle-income and lower-income Americans than on the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) led the GOP opposition to the 
agreement, pulling many in his party along with him, while liberal Democrats 
attacked the plan as too tilted toward the rich and overly generous with the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Others objected that a handful of lawmakers, meeting with unelected White House 
aides, had crafted the package without rank-and-file lawmakers' participation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asked to buy a pig in a poke," complained Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.). 
"It's sheer folly to impose a $130-billion tax increase when we are on the 
brink of recession." 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is worse than the problem," said Rep. Marty Russo (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, argued that approval of the agreement was essential. As Rep. 
Bill Archer (R-Tex.) said: "This is the best we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, joined by his Cabinet and top White House staff members, put on a 
down-to-the-wire lobbying campaign for the agreement. Some members of Congress 
reported that they had telephone calls from two or three members of the 
Cabinet. Bush himself wrote lawmakers urging that they "do what is right for 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) also wooed members of his caucus by declaring 
after a meeting with President Bush that there would be "flexibility" for House 
and Senate committees to revise provisions of the agreement that caused the 
greatest political pain for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Foley and his lieutenants, working one-on-one to gather support for the plan, 
also argued that a vote for the budget resolution would only move the 
legislative process forward and avoid a chaotic cutoff of government services 
and furloughs for federal employees that was threatened if the House refused to 
pass it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite opponents' charges that the proposed $130 billion in tax increases over 
the next five years would derail the economy and bring on a recession, 
advocates of the accord said that there was no other reasonable choice but to 
endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to hold our nose and vote for this, let's do it because it's best 
for America," argued Rep. James H. Quillen (R-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to pass this budget resolution, we are nowhere," warned Rep. Leon 
E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Commitee. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, replied with equally forceful arguments. "My people have 
been taxed to death. . . . I'm going to vote against this turkey," said Rep. 
James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) argued for passage of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I was personally deeply disappointed with what we achieved," he said of the 
budget negotiations, which he chaired. "But the best thing to do is to go 
forward. We can pass the agreement tonight, try to improve it in the 
committees, and come back to fight another day." 
</P>
<P>
In a rare appearance on the House floor, Speaker Foley delivered the final 
speech just before the vote early today in behalf of the budget agreement he 
helped to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important congressional decisions in your career," 
Foley told the hushed chamber. "We have a chance to let the legislative process 
go forward. . . . If not now, when? If not us, who?" Foley received a standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan had predicted that there would be 
trouble in the world's financial markets if the plan were defeated. Both he and 
Bush have warned that defeat could throw the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, worked out after four months of negotiations between the White 
House and congressional leaders, has run into criticism since it was announced 
from two camps: Conservative Republicans have attacked its call for some 
increases in taxes. And liberal Democrats say that it would cut spending too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Gingrich and dozens of his followers broke with the President to 
oppose the pact, contending that it would destroy jobs and weaken the sagging 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The President spent about an hour Thursday morning with several dozen 
Republican members of Congress, seeking to win them to his side.

Jonathan Foster had barely settled into his seat at a recent press conference 
in Burbank when he was abruptly ordered to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the drill," Foster recalls being told by an aide to Republican state 
attorney general candidate Dan Lungren. "You've gotta go." 
</P>
<P>
Foster reluctantly collected his tape recorder and note pad and marched back to 
his office -- campaign central for Lungren's Democratic foe, San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Foster is not a reporter. He is a spy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to find out about what (Lungren) says sooner or later, so the 
faster we can get our two cents in, the better," said Foster, a veteran of 
campaign espionage, having spied for unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate John 
K. Van de Kamp before joining Smith's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all public stuff. We would never go to headquarters and sneak around." 
</P>
<P>
Foster belongs to a small corps of campaign workers sprinkled among reporters 
at press conferences from Sacramento to San Diego who gather what one described 
as "counterintelligence" on the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
They record speeches, keep track of reporters' questions, collect opposition 
press releases and, above all, carefully document charges made against their 
bosses. A good spy takes notes quickly, carries spare batteries and tape 
cassettes and always knows where to find a telephone to call campaign 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good battlefield experience," said Dee Dee Myers, press secretary to 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein and a former spy for Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. "I haven't 
been out spying much this campaign because I have been with Dianne. But it is 
good training, and it is very useful to the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Although campaign-style espionage lacks the intrigue of a John le Carre novel, 
a well-run network of loyal spies, Myers and others say, can be crucial in 
tight campaigns that are waged in large part through the news media. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to good intelligence gathering, candidates are able to devise damage 
control strategies and put favorable spins on allegations by opponents while 
reporters, fresh from a press conference, are still making sense of their 
notes. When reporters call for a response, it is ready. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as Pete Wilson has a press conference, nine times out of 10 there is a 
reason for a response," said Jonas Hanelin, who keeps an eye on Feinstein's 
Republican gubernatorial opponent. "By being there, it makes it quicker for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Most spies have other jobs in the campaign -- Foster is issues director for 
Smith, for instance, and Hanelin arranges Feinstein's Southern California 
appearances. Ever image conscious, they generally dislike being referred to as 
a spy, secret agent, mole, 007 or any other name that betrays a penchant for 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't Watergate," said James Lee, Wilson's deputy press secretary and top 
spy. "It is hard to do spying when most of the political reporters of the state 
are present. There is not a lot left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Most campaign spies, indeed, are well known -- and generally tolerated -- in 
opposing camps. Myers and Lee talk to each other at events, and Myers said 
Feinstein has an open-door policy at her press conferences. Wilson's campaign, 
in turn, accommodates Feinstein spies. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to stay friendly with other staffers even if they are on the other 
side because you never know if you will end up on the same side as them," said 
Hanelin, who a few months ago was spying on Feinstein, his current boss, for 
Van de Kamp. 'We don't try to hide from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Spying, however, is not always so genteel. Foster said he has been kicked out 
of several of Lungren's press conferences, even though the Smith campaign has 
not restricted access to its events. In such cases, more sophisticated 
espionage techniques become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
At Lungren's recent Burbank press conference, Smith's campaign outsmarted its 
foes by sending two spies: Foster and an unidentified campaign volunteer. 
Foster would not confirm it, but he apparently was intended as a decoy. 
</P>
<P>
When, as predicted, Lungren's aide ejected Foster, the unsuspected backup spy 
clicked on a tape recorder and went to work.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
GARAMENDI SAYS NADER WANTED 'OUTRAGEOUS' TERMS FOR HIS SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Garamendi, the Democratic nominee for state insurance commissioner, 
accused consumer advocate Ralph Nader Thursday of threatening to withhold his 
support unless Garamendi "agreed precisely" with Nader on up to a dozen 
specific insurance issues. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said he had told Nader at a face-to-face meeting in San Diego in late 
June that it was "outrageous to think that he or anybody else should be in a 
position to leverage any individual and I would not agree in advance to (commit 
to) any of his issues." 
</P>
<P>
Nader, in California this week, was unavailable for comment on Garamendi's 
account of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Nader, the nation's best known consumer advocate, was largely credited with the 
passage of Proposition 103, the sweeping 1988 initiative intended to cut 
insurance premiums and strictly regulate the industry. His endorsement in the 
race for insurance commissioner could help either candidate. 
</P>
<P>
During an appearance Wednesday night with Republican insurance commissioner 
nominee Wes Bannister at Cal State San Bernardino, Nader was the first to 
disclose that he had met with Garamendi. But he gave a different account of 
what was said. 
</P>
<P>
Nader was sharply critical of Garamendi during the appearance Wednesday, 
charging that the Democrat has been unwilling to wage a substantive campaign or 
engage in many debates with Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
Although he disagreed with Bannister, an insurance agent, on a large number of 
issues -- including Bannister's advocacy of no-fault insurance -- Nader 
expressed the view that Bannister was waging a more honest campaign than 
Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi is heavily favored over the poorly financed Bannister. But continued 
strife with Nader and Nader's allies in the consumer movement could be a 
problem for Garamendi if he became the state's first elected insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Nader declined under questioning in San Bernardino to endorse either candidate, 
saying the decision should be left to "each citizen in the privacy of the 
voting booth." But he said he was "very skeptical about anybody who avoids 
debate," such as Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi responded Thursday that he is debating Bannister on KCBS-TV this 
weekend, that the debate will be rebroadcast on other stations, and that at 
least three radio debates also are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
But Nader, recalling his June meeting with Garamendi, said he had asked him for 
a commitment to seek an end to certain exemptions for the insurance companies 
in terms of paying state and local taxes in California, and "I could not 
understand his answer." 
</P>
<P>
Nader added, however, that Garamendi committed to supporting an increase in the 
$250,000 cap on malpractice judgments, which was enacted in legislation that 
Garamendi authored. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, asked about Nader's criticisms, said he resents what he termed 
Nader's attempt to "become the arbitrator of goodness." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Nader in our meeting demanded about a dozen specific requirements of me 
and said he would not support me unless I agreed to precisely what he wanted, 
and he wanted that agreement in advance of the election so he could leverage me 
if I won," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that was outrageous," he said. "I told him I'd take his views into 
consideration and act in the best interest of California consumers when I was 
elected." 
</P>
<P>
Another person who was present at the meeting, Robert Fellmeth, director of the 
Center for Public Interest Law, said in an interview Thursday that he did not 
think Garamendi's description of his exchange with Nader was very accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"What Ralph was saying was, 'You've got to take stands,' " Fellmeth said. "What 
is outrageous is candidates running for political office who think it's 
outrageous when someone asks them to take specific policy positions." 
</P>
<P>
During the primary campaign for insurance commissioner, Garamendi was accused 
by Nader and some of his consumer allies of leaning toward insurance company 
positions.

SOVIET UNION / A ROLE REVERSAL;

ARMENIA'S NEW NATIONALIST LEADERS DISCOVER THAT POWER MEANS PROBLEMS

<TEXT>
<P>
The same Armenian nationalists who spent two years fighting the government are 
now trying to govern themselves and discovering how complicated life at the top 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
The Karabakh Committee, Armenia's most famous dissidents, came to power in 
parliamentary elections last spring and are now being appointed ministers, 
deputy ministers and committee chairmen in the republic's first non-Communist 
government since 1922. 
</P>
<P>
The new leadership, headed by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, is now developing 
policies to end seven decades of a Moscow-directed economy and 
Kremlin-controlled politics in the southern republic. The goal is a 
market-based economy with a democratic, multi-party political system and an 
army of its own to protect its people from the neighboring Soviet republic of 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new leaders were eager to take their official posts, the 
transition has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more interesting to be a revolutionary than to do boring government 
work," Ter-Petrosyan, 45, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Babken Ararktsyan, 46, a mathematician whose ardent nationalism took him into 
the streets, still wonders at how he became Armenia's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Makes the Decisions 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel a little silly in this position," he said. "I still feel like 
part of the opposition -- I even feel like I am in opposition to myself." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the decisions on policy will be made collectively by the small circle 
of intellectuals who led the nationalist movement since 1988, Ter-Petrosyan 
said. The Armenian All-National Movement, founded last November by the Karabakh 
Committee and other nationalist groups, controls the republic's Supreme Soviet, 
or legislature, so the new leaders do not expect parliamentary opposition to 
their policies. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous Communist-dominated governments here, the new leaders have 
broad popular support, which they say is vital as the republic suffers more 
hardships on its way to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although the whole Soviet Union is facing political turmoil and economic 
upheaval, Armenia is a special case because of the devastating Dec. 7, 1988, 
earthquake and the continuing ethnic tensions with neighboring Azerbaijan over 
control of that republic's Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Hundreds have 
been killed in the fighting with Azerbaijanis over the last 2 1/2 years, and 
about 250,000 Armenians who have fled their homes in Azerbaijan are seeking 
shelter here. 
</P>
<P>
The strain that conflict places on Armenia's weak economy is huge, Ararktsyan 
said. Periodic blockades of goods that travel through Azerbaijan by road, train 
or pipeline have aggravated Armenia's hardships. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new leaders' frustration with Azerbaijan, they have taken a less 
aggressive approach than they did as dissidents. Instead of criticizing 
Azerbaijanis, Ter-Petrosyan has traveled to Moscow to arrange meetings with 
their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealing With Problems Ahead 
</P>
<P>
"A country is not an apartment," Ararktsyan said. "When you don't like your 
neighbors, you cannot switch countries like you can switch apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Before turning their attention to the economy, the new Armenian leaders had a 
festering, six-month-old internal problem to deal with -- increasingly violent 
nationalist militia groups. As one of his first acts as president, 
Ter-Petrosyan persuaded Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev not to move in 
Soviet troops but to let the Armenian leadership disarm the more than a dozen 
paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
The largest, the Armenian National Army, had shot and killed six people, 
including an Armenian legislator who was investigating whether its men had 
robbed several gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the armed bands were formed as self-defense groups in January after a 
massacre of about 60 Armenians in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. In late 
August, Ter-Petrosyan passed a critical test of his ability to govern when 
leaders of the Armenian National Army surrendered their arms to the republic's 
military authorities and called on their followers to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
But the nationalists admit they have a difficult road ahead of them and their 
public support may decline if they fail to bring food to the stores and build 
houses for the hundreds of thousands of Armenians still homeless because of 
ethnic strife and the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people thought as soon as Ter-Petrosyan sat in his place, everything 
should have been perfect -- enough bread, enough gasoline, enough everything," 
Mager Airapetyan, 36, a construction supply manager, said. "But I say it's 
better to be poor and hungry but to be rid of the Communists."

Just as a Ping-Pong match two decades ago provided the diplomatic pretext for 
improved relations between the United States and China, the Asian Games in 
Beijing appear to have set the seal on improved ties between China and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam sent its aging hero of two wars against the French and Americans, 
Deputy Premier Vo Nguyen Giap, to attend the games, which end Sunday. He was 
the first Vietnamese leader to make an official visit to China in more than a 
decade. A Vietnamese spokeswoman said it was hoped his visit would contribute 
to "early normalization of relations between the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, China opened the so-called Friendship Gate at the border 
between the two countries to receive Giap and Vietnam's athletes. The gate had 
been closed except for prisoner exchanges since the two countries fought a 
brief war in 1979 after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
At a banquet in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Gu Mu, vice chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told Giap last week, "We 
want to see that Sino-Vietnamese relations will be gradually improved until 
they are normalized. This is the wish of the Chinese people." 
</P>
<P>
The groundwork for Giap's visit was laid by an unannounced summit meeting 
between Vietnamese and Chinese Communist party and state leaders, held Sept. 3 
at Nanning, China. At a press conference in Hanoi, the government spokeswoman 
indirectly confirmed that the meeting took place when she said the talks were 
being kept secret at the request of China. 
</P>
<P>
The ostensible purpose of the private meeting was to resolve the longstanding 
differences between China and Vietnam over Cambodia, a dispute in which Hanoi 
supports the regime in Phnom Penh and Beijing supports the Khmer Rouge rebels. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after the secret meeting, for example, that the participants in the 
Cambodia civil war were coerced into meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, where they 
agreed on the composition of a Supreme National Council to help guide the 
country to a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Cambodia issue, China and Vietnam have compelling reasons to 
improve relations. For one, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe has 
left Vietnam and China among only a handful of nations with Communist parties 
struggling to maintain a monoply on power. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in the Soviet Union confront Vietnam with a financial catastrophe 
because of reduced assistance, now estimated at $2 billion a year, as well as 
the ideological difficulty of seeing Moscow, long Vietnam's political 
inspiration, tossing Marxism on the rubbish heap. China has been seeking 
friends in Asia ever since the Tian An Men Square crackdown in June last year 
led to widespread condemnation of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Chinese Premier Li Peng also indicated for the first time that 
China is willing to consider the joint development with Vietnam of the Spratly 
Islands, which both countries have claimed and fought over. (The islands also 
are claimed by Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines.) 
</P>
<P>
As Radio Vietnam noted in a commentary last week, "There are new developments 
never seen in the two countries' relations over the past 10 years."

Egypt has arrested a number of pro-Iraqi Palestinian extremists and seized arms 
and explosives that they planned to use in terrorist attacks, according to 
Interior Minister Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks published Wednesday in the leading Egyptian weekly magazine Al 
Musawar, Moussa said the terrorists include followers of radical Palestinian 
leader Sabri Banna, better known as Abu Nidal. He heads the Revolutionary 
Council of Fatah. 
</P>
<P>
Moussa did not say how many extremists were arrested but said they conspired 
with others and had "planned to carry out subversive operations and assault a 
number of persons they could reach."

Egypt has opposed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and sent troops to join a

Iraq launched a diplomatic offensive Thursday in an effort to punch its way out 
of international isolation, sending a senior official to Jordan to confer with 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and announcing plans for similar meetings 
with European officials. 
</P>
<P>
Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraqi first deputy prime minister, conceded after meeting 
with Kaifu that their talks had done little to bring Iraq closer to Japan, 
which has pledged contributions of $4 billion to the multinational effort to 
dislodge Iraq from Kuwait and to ease the economic hardships brought down on 
some Middle East nations by the crisis. Japan has also sent medical teams to 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the diplomatic front, Yevgeny Primakov, a senior aide to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, arrived in Baghdad with a message from his 
chief. Its contents were not made public, but Primakov was quoted by the Soviet 
news agency Tass as saying that the crisis must be resolved diplomatically in 
order to "avoid a military explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Primakov went to Baghdad from Amman, where he began his Middle East mission 
Wednesday by meeting with Jordanian officials and Yasser Arafat, chairman of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, meanwhile, pulled the aircraft carrier Independence out of 
the Persian Gulf, where it had arrived two days earlier. A Navy spokesman in 
Washington said the Independence had completed its mission. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon reported that the U.S. Navy boarded and diverted a Sudanese 
freighter Thursday in the Red Sea after discovering that its cargo manifest did 
not match its load of unspecified "industrial equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese ship, a 400-foot cargo carrier called the Blue Nile, was headed 
toward the Jordanian port of Aqaba when it was stopped and boarded by a team 
from the American guided-missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
An inspection of the ship's cargo revealed the discrepancy between the goods 
and the documentation, and the ship was ordered to change course. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Nile was the seventh ship diverted by U.S. warships since the naval 
embargo of Iraq began in mid-August. A total of 170 ships have been boarded and 
inspected by officers from allied navies in the Persian Gulf region, 139 of 
them by U.S. personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad's Ramadan, who is believed to rank second only to President Saddam 
Hussein in the Iraqi leadership, insisted at a news conference here that the 
fact that the Kaifu meeting had taken place proves that Iraq is committed to 
finding a peaceful solution to the crisis it created by invading Kuwait on Aug. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rare public appearance for Ramadan, who was accompanied by two dozen 
security men in business suits. He used the news conference to make one of the 
clearest statements yet on Iraq's position in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He linked Iraq's occupation of Kuwait directly with Israel's occupation of the 
territories it seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Also, he said Iraq will 
withdraw the 430,000 troops it has in Kuwait if Israel agrees to withdraw from 
its occupied territories, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Iraq, he 
emphasized, will not withdraw unilaterally from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing what Hussein said in a speech Sunday, Ramadan rejected the idea of an 
"Arab solution" to the crisis, as proposed by Jordan's King Hussein, among 
others. He said that anything short of an agreement that also resolves the 
Palestinian question would be "an aid to American terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Ramadan reiterated the argument that Iraq holds thousands of foreigners against 
their will, some of them some aged and infirm, only as a deterrent to war. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation has occurred to give peace a chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in soft tones and puffing on a thin cigar, Ramadan reverted to 
familiar Iraqi rhetoric when he spoke of the United States. He said Iraq will 
retaliate swiftly against Israel if the United States strikes first. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll make this entire region a cemetery for all aggressors," he said. "We 
have decided not to fire the first bullet -- but if America starts it, they 
will not be able to determine the end of the battle, the size of the 
battlefield, or even where the battle will take place . . . including Israel. 
The age of American terrorism, in which they had time to rule over Arab leaders 
and rob their resources, is over." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, though, Ramadan intended to convey a message of peace, to present the 
Hussein regime as reasonable and committed to resolving the situation without 
resorting to force. 
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that Hussein intends to use diplomacy and the rhetoric of 
peace as tools to probe for soft spots in the embargo that has closed Iraq's 
ports. He assailed what he called the brutality of the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"The coming period," he said, "will witness more active (diplomatic) attempts . 
. . in order to enlarge the dialogue between us and the European community. We 
are confident that, just to ease the American domination, the will for a 
peaceful solution exists in many Western countries, for a solution through the 
path of war has no gain for anyone. The only beneficiaries from war will be the 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Ramadan gave King Hussein a letter from Saddam Hussein, and 
some analysts said it may have contained an attempt to explain what the Iraqi 
leader meant when he said in the speech Sunday that moderate Arab leaders were 
"firmly in the ranks of the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Ramadan had words of praise for the king, who, he said, will play "a very 
active role in opening the door to dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the State Department said the United States has chartered 
another flight for refugees from Kuwait and Iraq next week. A department 
official said that about 100 people, not all of them Americans, are expected to 
be on the flight. He said the Americans are primarily children with 
non-American parents and siblings. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Department said it had completed the refugee airlift 
because it had already evacuated all Americans who had permission to leave and 
wanted to go. At the time, the department said that additional flights would be 
arranged if there was a need for them. 
</P>

The official said Thursday that Iraq has not relaxed its exit procedures but 
that a number of people who have been free to leave all along have now decided 
to do so.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reiterated his assessment that 
while all nations prefer a diplomatic solution, a growing number of U.S. allies

NATO PLANS TRIP-WIRE GERMAN DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: CONGRESS IS TOLD THAT A THIN LINE OF TROOPS WILL GUARD THE NATION'S 
EASTERN BORDER.

In the wake of German unification, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is 
adopting a strategy in which a thin trip-wire line of troops will guard 
Germany's border with East Europe, in place of the shoulder-to-shoulder 
contingents that have been facing the Iron Curtain, a senior Pentagon officer 
told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first Senate hearing on the unification treaty signed by the United 
States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the two former German states, 
lawmakers expressed reservations about its possible impact on U.S. national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush Administration officials remained upbeat about the pact, 
described as "the peace treaty of World War II," there were indications that 
U.S. and German interests already are diverging as a result of unification and 
a separate agreement between Bonn and Moscow governing the withdrawal of Soviet 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Defense and State department officials were pressed at Thursday's hearing, for 
example, to explain provisions of the unification pact that authorize the 
presence of more Soviet troops than U.S. forces on German soil for the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"How does NATO defend borders with Soviet forces garrisoned within them?" asked 
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who presided over 
the hearing. "What will be the mission of American troops? Where will they be 
deployed? Against what threat?" 
</P>
<P>
Other senators noted pointedly that the cost of maintaining the Soviet forces 
will be paid by the Germans under a recent agreement between the two countries, 
while U.S. troops in Germany will remain a financial burden on hard-pressed 
American taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. John Sewall, representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the 
new NATO strategy in Germany as seeking "to transition from forward defense 
toward forward presence." 
</P>
<P>
Forces near the German border will be "smaller, with greater emphasis on 
mobility and versatility than in the current NATO structure, to allow maximum 
flexibility in times of crisis," Sewall said. 
</P>
<P>
The general said that nuclear weapons would "continue to fulfill an essential 
role in overall alliance strategy to deter war," although future emphasis would 
be placed "on making nuclear weapons truly weapons of last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Sewall said that NATO deployments now involve huge contingents stationed side 
by side. 
</P>
<P>
The new doctrine will place a smaller force in position not so close to the 
border, with a larger mobile reserve in the rear ready to move to counter any 
attack. "I'd call it defense of the border, rather defense on the border," 
Sewall said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that the unification treaty prevents any NATO forces from 
being stationed on East German territory. Only German territorial forces, akin 
to border guards and operating outside the NATO structure, may be deployed 
there until Soviet troops are withdrawn by the end of 1994, according to the 
treaty and a separate Soviet-German agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the Soviets leave, only German troops can move into the eastern 
territory. U.S. and other NATO forces will be required to get permission from 
the German government to fly over or conduct ground exercises in the area, said 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James F. Dobbins Jr. Such exercises 
probably will be limited to 13,000 or fewer troops. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions on U.S. forces, Sewall said, "are acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Extended warning time and the virtual removal of possibilities for a 
short-warning attack on NATO countries by the Warsaw Pact dramatically reduce 
the risk associated with these restrictions."

KOHL COMMITS HIS UNIFIED NATION TO EUROPEAN UNITY;

<P>
In a setting heavy with history, Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday addressed 
the first session of an all-German Parliament since the collapse of Nazism and 
affirmed his newly united country's commitment to European unity. 
</P>
<P>
"The completion of German unification provides a great chance -- I'd like to 
say the chance, to accelerate the process of European unity," he said. "Let 
there be no question, we want a political union in Europe, not an enlarged 
customs union." 
</P>
<P>
The statement, made in what was effectively the Kohl government's first state 
of the union message to a united Germany, is likely to further ease worries 
that problems in absorbing the shattered former East region might erode German 
commitment to the ideal of European political union. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl also formally presented plans for billions of dollars in new government 
spending to extend new telephone, electricity and road networks into what was 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor spoke in the 19th-Century Reichstag building, where so much of 
Germany's checkered history has unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the old West German Parliament had held brief, symbolic sessions in 
the Reichstag annually from the mid-1960s, Thursday's sitting was the first 
there by an all-German legislative body since December, 1932, the month before 
Hitler came to power. 
</P>
<P>
After its initial session, the Parliament will return to Bonn, where it will 
stay until a decision is made after elections scheduled for Dec. 2 on whether 
to relocate to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's comments on European unity were considered important, especially to the 
many representatives of Germany's European neighbors who were guests at the 
session. Among them, and introduced at the start, were the commanders of the 
U.S., British and French forces in Berlin, whose presence guaranteed West 
Berlin's security from the end of World War II until last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Through the long years of division, West Germans were among the strongest 
emotional as well as financial backers of the European Community, often 
re-channeling any sense of national patriotism into European idealism. 
</P>
<P>
Germany has by far the largest population in the 12-nation community, and any 
wavering of its commitment would have a significant impact both on the 
integration process itself and the manner in which other member states view 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of this renewed commitment is also important because the community 
plans to set up formal commissions in December to begin substantive work on the 
task of building an economic and political union among the 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
In language more decisive than at any time in recent weeks, Kohl also pledged a 
united Germany's continued cooperation with France in the push for this deeper 
European integration. Strong Franco-German cooperation is considered essential 
to progress in this area, but the close ties in recent months have been 
disturbed by French apprehensions over German unity and a personal rift between 
Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Departing from his prepared text, Kohl described the Franco-German relationship 
as of "existential importance." 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the decisive prerequisites for the progress of the last 30 
years," Kohl said. "For the next five years, it will be more important." 
</P>
<P>
In his hourlong address, Kohl urged Germans to join together to overcome the 
difficulties presented by unification. 
</P>
<P>
He announced plans to spend $4.5 billion over the next 18 months for 1.5 
million new telephone connections in the eastern regions, $6.6 billion for 
local community improvements and a $13-billion, five-year program to modernize 
the electricity network. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing critics among the main opposition Social Democrats who have 
complained about the costs of unification, the chancellor asserted that the 
cost of continued division would have run far more. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone takes these gigantic sums into consideration, isn't it more sensible 
to invest . . . in the unity of our fatherland," he challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sense of occasion that accompanied the Reichstag sitting, the mood 
in the chamber remained remarkably informal and light. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Reichstag is associated with Hitler's years of infamy, Parliament 
never met in the building during his years in power. The final session came six 
weeks before Hitler won the chancellorship in January, 1933. Less than a month 
later, fire swept the Reichstag, and the arrest of a Dutch Communist in 
connection with the incident was used by Hitler to obtain greater law-and-order 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly forced through a law enabling him to suspend basic individual 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting between German and Soviet forces in the final days of World War 
II destroyed the building, which was rebuilt in the late 1950s as a home for a 
future united German parliament.

U.S., SOVIETS TURNING TO NEXT ARMS ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: BAKER, SHEVARDNADZE TO MEET TODAY ON A PACT TO CUT BACK ON LONG-RANGE 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, fresh from 
settling on a treaty to slash conventional arms in Europe, will meet in New 
York today to consider the next item on the superpower arms control agenda -- a 
pact to cut long-range nuclear arms by more than one-third. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be the fourth between Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze in a little more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the Bush Administration hopes to take advantage of the 
current thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations to lock in deep cuts in Soviet armaments, 
in effect making it much more difficult for Moscow to return to the threatening 
policies of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The two on Wednesday began discussing Soviet demands for assurances that the 
United States will not supply nuclear arms to Britain, Baker told a White House 
news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the United States has refused to accept any limits on its 
relationship with Britain, which maintains its own nuclear deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Baker returned to Washington on Thursday to report to President Bush on the 
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty that he and Shevardnadze completed "in 
principle" Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is still the site of the greatest concentration of armed strength in 
the world," Bush said in a brief introduction to Baker's news conference. "As 
Europe is transformed politically, we must also redraw the military map of the 
continent and lift some of the shadows and fears that we and our allies have 
lived with for nearly a half a century." 
</P>
<P>
Baker provided some additional details of the agreement between him and 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
He said the treaty sets ceilings of 20,000 tanks, 20,000 artillery tubes, 
30,000 armored personnel carriers and 2,000 helicopters for each alliance -- 
the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Of those totals, 
the United States and the Soviet Union can have no more than 13,300 tanks, 
13,700 artillery pieces, 20,000 armored personnel carriers and 1,500 
helicopters. Baker said that alliance totals for combat aircraft have not been 
fixed, although the U.S. and Soviet maximums were set at 5,150 each. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that excess equipment must be destroyed, although he conceded that 
both the United States and the Soviet Union expect to save some of the weapons 
by moving them out of Europe before the pact takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Warsaw Pact will have to destroy 19,000 tanks, compared to 4,000 
for NATO.

GORBACHEV ACTS TO END CONTROL OF PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: HE AUTHORIZES MOST OF THE NATION'S ENTERPRISES TO NEGOTIATE THEIR 
OWN WHOLESALE DEALS FOR GOODS TO BE DELIVERED NEXT YEAR.

<P>
The Soviet Union on Thursday took a major step toward ending state control of 
prices, long a barrier to fundamental economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, using his new authority to rule by decree, 
authorized most of the country's enterprises to negotiate their own wholesale 
prices for goods to be delivered next year, freeing the firms from central 
government controls that had limited production and discouraged efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Although regarded as an essential measure for the radical overhaul of the 
Soviet economy, price reform has historically been so sensitive that several 
attempts at economic restructuring have faltered and failed on this issue 
alone, but no other way has been found to make enterprises here respond to 
demand and supply. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev described the measure as aimed at "broadening the economic 
independence and increasing the motivation of enterprises to boost their output 
and production efficiency and create conditions to introduce market relations" 
as the basis of the country's economy in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The decree, as reported by the official news agency Tass, appears to confirm 
the government's broad decision to use the market forces of supply and demand 
to force the Soviet Union's state-owned, centrally planned economy into major 
changes, although perhaps at a controlled pace. 
</P>
<P>
State officials will be allowed, however, to draw up a list of raw materials 
and other products whose wholesale prices will remain fixed, though perhaps at 
different levels, and taxes will be imposed on super-profits to discourage 
price-gouging. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he was acting even before his overall reform plan is ready 
because some elements cannot wait for a consensus to develop; in moving on the 
issue of wholesale prices, however, he probably preempted further debate when 
the package is introduced in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Economists are still struggling, however, to strike a balance between a plan 
calling for the radical transformation of the Soviet economy over 500 days and 
another urging a gradual transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Valentin Pavlov, the finance minister, told Soviet television that the measure 
is a compromise and aimed primarily at halting the accelerating disintegration 
of the country's economy and at increasing the production of consumer goods, 
now in extremely short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlov acknowledged that most wholesale prices will rise -- most prices are 
based on a list worked out in the 1930s and updated periodically by the State 
Price Commission -- but he refused to say whether, when or how they would then 
be passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Many retail prices will be lower than the new, negotiated wholesale prices," 
he said, "and this will require special consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Pavlov sought to focus attention on the improved supplies of consumer goods 
that the government hopes the measure will bring rather than on the inevitable 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that children's goods do not appear in the shops," he said. 
"They are not on sale because enterprises do not want to produce them because 
they are unprofitable. Under the new decree, providing for negotiated prices, 
they won't be unprofitable products." 
</P>
<P>
The decree says that enterprises can sign contracts with each other for 1991 
using negotiated wholesale prices but that they must be based on those outlined 
by the government in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Profits that rise above state-set limits will go to the federal and republic 
budgets through taxes on any super-profits that result from the negotiated 
prices.

A House subcommittee approved a bill Thursday that would put into federal law a 
woman's right to an abortion, as ruled in the Supreme Court's Roe vs.

<P>
Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The language of the bill is drawn directly from Roe," said Rep. Don Edwards 
(D-San Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights. He said that the Freedom of Choice Act is needed to 
preserve the reproductive options women have had since the Supreme Court 
decision was issued in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Five Democrats voted for the bill and three Republicans voted against it. The 
action came after two days of hearings.

</P>
<P>
ARTS: AN EXPERT WITNESS DELIVERS A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING BLOW TO THE 
MAPPLETHORPE DEFENSE. SHE TELLS THE JURY HIS WORK IS NOT FIT FOR A MUSEUM.

<P>
An expert witness delivered the most dramatic and potentially damaging 
testimony against the defense at the Mapplethorpe obscenity trial Thursday when 
she compared two of the photographs at issue to child pornography and said none 
are fit to hang in an art museum. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Reisman, a mass media researcher with links to anti-pornography groups, 
contradicted the testimony of other arts experts who extolled the late Robert 
Mapplethorpe as one of the most important photographers of his time. 
</P>
<P>
In contentious testimony punctuated by frequent objections, she said the seven 
photographs at issue have no artistic value. And the two depicting partially 
nude children are harmful, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"By placing images of children in this day and age that are focused on the 
genitalia in this way . . . on the walls of our museums, what we're doing is we 
are legitimizing the taking of the photos and we are legitimizing the public 
display of the photos and we are . . . putting at risk additional children 
because many people see themselves as photographers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, are on trial on 
charges of pandering obscenity and displaying children in "nudity-related 
material" in connection with a 175-piece retrospective exhibit, "Robert 
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment." This is the first time an American museum or 
art gallery has stood trial on obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which ends a two-year national tour today in Boston, was held at 
the arts center last spring. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Wednesday, Barrie acknowledged that some of the acts depicted in 
the show were "tough, brutal, sometimes disgusting," but he said he brought the 
show to Cincinnati because it was "serious and important." 
</P>
<P>
"Robert Mapplethorpe took a very tough, brutal subject and tried to bring 
beauty to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys tried to discredit Reisman by emphasizing her controversial 
published views concerning homosexuals and art and by noting that her 
professional background is mostly in video and music and includes a stint as a 
songwriter for the Captain Kangaroo television show. 
</P>
<P>
She also listed among her qualifications service on former U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III's commission on pornography and a class she taught at George 
Mason University this year on "sex, violence and the media." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by H. Louis Sirkin, the lawyer representing Barrie, Reisman 
declined to take credit for a quote he read to her that argued that 
constitutional protections should not extend to a gay lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "My opinion would be that anal sodomy is traumatically 
dysfunctional and is definitely associated with AIDS, and I could not support 
that constitutional protections be extended to anal sodomy." 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe was a homosexual who died last year of AIDS. Five of the 
photographs that are being challenged in court graphically depict 
sadomasochistic sexual practices. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony that juxtaposed graphic descriptions of the sadomasochistic 
practices depicted and highbrow aesthetic theory, Reisman applied her working 
definition of art to the images: "Based on the picture's supposed attempt to 
express human emotion or human feeling, the criteria is not met," she said of 
one photograph. 
</P>
<P>
She based her conclusion on the fact that four of the five photographs did not 
include faces. The one that did, a self-portrait of Mapplethorpe involved in a 
graphic act, did not meet her test either because his face displayed no 
discernable emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Reisman's testimony was the first to directly attack the photographs as obscene 
and potentially harmful. Prosecutor Frank Prouty had earlier said that the 
photographs "speak for themselves" and that he only needed to show that the 
Contemporary Arts Center had publicly displayed them. 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments in the trial are scheduled today.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN

The race: Secretary of State. Whose ad? Republican candidate Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores began running a new 30-second 
television ad in Los Angeles and Sacramento Monday that attacks incumbent March 
Fong Eu for violating state campaign disclosure laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the commercial, with analysis by Times staff writer Dean Murphy: 
</P>
<P>
 Ad: Announcer: "Secretary of State March Fong Eu is supposed to enforce 
California's campaign reporting laws. But last year the Fair Political 
Practices Commission found her guilty of 95 separate campaign violations." 
Camera moves from close-up of Eu to an FPPC investigation report with Eu's name 
circled. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: As secretary of state, Eu's office is the depository for campaign 
disclosure statements filed by candidates. Her office enforces filing 
deadlines, but other violations fall under the jurisdiction of the FPPC. In 
March, Eu paid an $8,000 fine to the FPPC for violations involving her 1986 
reelection. The FPPC found 95 reporting violations, but 85 of them involved the 
failure of Eu's campaign committee to individually list radio stations that 
broadcast her political ads. The FPPC found no evidence that Eu had 
intentionally concealed the identities of the radio stations. The other 
violations involved late contributions totaling $11,450 that Eu's campaign did 
not report. Eu has called the violations "inadvertent but not excusable." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Announcer: "Her own office fined her $26,000 for other violations, but she 
cut her fines to just $650. Like a judge fixing his own ticket. After 16 years 
in office, it's time for a change." Camera cuts back to Eu, and closes with a 
close-up of Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: In 1989, three committees associated with Eu's 1986 reelection 
campaign were fined a total of $26,200 by her office for filing late campaign 
reports. Eu's office later reduced the fines to a total of $650, which Eu says 
was in keeping with her policy of cutting or waiving fines for "unwillful" 
violations. Eu, who has the legal authority to reduce such fines, said she is 
required under law to act on all late filings, including those involving her 
own campaign.

DINKINS PLANS TO LAY OFF 15,000 IN N.Y. FISCAL CRISIS 
</P>

<P>
Two days after announcing a $1.8-billion anti-crime plan, Mayor David N. 
Dinkins on Thursday ordered a hiring and promotion freeze and directed budget 
aides to draft a plan to lay off 15,000 city employees. 
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the layoffs would be the biggest since the fiscal crisis of 1975, 
when the city hovered near bankruptcy and about 25,000 employees were let go. 
</P>
<P>
The police hiring plan, which calls for adding nearly 8,000 officers to the 
force, would be exempt from the cutbacks. The anti-crime program would be paid 
for through a host of new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins said the city faces at least a $1.4-billion budget deficit in its next 
fiscal year, which begins July 1, because of an accelerating decline in the 
local economy. He said the hiring freeze and layoffs could cut $915 million 
from that deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"With hard times come hard choices," the mayor said. "We all hope and pray for 
better economic times. Until they arrive, however, I will continue to impose 
strict budgetary discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins said the hiring and promotion freeze would save the city about $115 
million -- $35 million over the rest of the current fiscal year and $80 million 
in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor ordered all agency heads not to approve any pay raises and to 
restrict promotions to positions that have recently been vacated. Among the 
exempt positions will be those mandated by state or federal law.

2 CANDIDATES WILL HONOR $1,000 CAP ON DONATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: SUPERVISORIAL RIVALS SAY THEY WON'T GO AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF 
PROPOSITION 73, DESPITE ITS INVALIDATION BY A JUDGE.

Despite a federal court ruling opening the door to unlimited cash contributions 
in local political races, both candidates for a Ventura County supervisor's 
seat said Thursday that they will not accept contributions of more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to honor the $1,000 limit," said Simi Valley Councilwoman Vicki 
Howard, referring to a Proposition 73 restriction approved by voters in 1988 
but invalidated by a federal judge last week. "I think the voters spoke very 
clearly." 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent for the 4th District seat, Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're adhering to the same limit. I think it's the only thing to do," Davis 
said. "I voted for Proposition 73. I'd be going against my own vote." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that since the original trial court's ruling, which was upheld by 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday, he has received about five 
calls from contributors seeking to take advantage of the decision and give him 
more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'Please don't. We'll just send it back,' " Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he has raised $79,000 since declaring his candidacy in March. Howard 
said her treasurer was out of town, and she did not know how much her campaign 
has raised. Fund-raising reports from all state and local candidates must be 
filed by today. 
</P>
<P>
Several municipal candidates say they do not expect the ruling to affect their 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is not generally the driver" in Thousand Oaks elections, said Judy 
Lazar, a Planning Commission member who is one of nine candidates for three 
City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lazar and incumbent Councilman Lawrence Horner said they would never 
accept a gift of more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's way too much for the kind of election we are waging here," said Horner, 
who expects to spend $9,500 to $10,000 on his campaign. He said he thinks $500 
is the maximum contribution he would accept. 
</P>
<P>
But Oxnard Councilman Manuel Lopez, one of 12 candidates for two seats on the 
Oxnard council, said he would welcome a big contributor or two. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see any of them running around, I'll be only too happy to relieve them 
of any funds they have," Lopez said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not expect the ruling to affect his campaign or any others in 
Oxnard. "Maybe in big cities," Lopez said, "but in smaller communities I don't 
think this will have any bearing." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi, who spent more than $150,000 to defeat Lopez in the 
mayor's race two years ago and is a candidate for reelection in November, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sweeney, spokesman for the politically active Patagonia clothing company, 
said local candidates run a risk in accepting large donations. 
</P>
<P>
"In a local race, any donation of more than $1,000 would come with a lot of 
baggage," Sweeney said. "A $2,000 gift would generate enough bad press to make 
it not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he said, "I don't think there have been that many individuals 
willing to spend that much on a local race." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said Patagonia will take stands on some races before the election but 
would not make any contributions that exceed the old spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Money has less impact in smaller races anyway," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
He said County Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk ousted incumbent Madge L. 
Schaefer last June even though VanderKolk was heavily outspent. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Councilwoman Ann Johs said the ruling will not affect her reelection 
campaign. "I can't think of anyone offhand who would want to give that kind of 
money," Johs said. "Times aren't that easy."

DRAINED-LAKE SUIT GOES TO COUNTY COURT; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: A 'FOREST OF PAPER' HAS SPROUTED IN THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD CASE. 
HOMEOWNERS SAY THEIR PROPERTY VALUES FELL AND THEIR HOUSES WERE DAMAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the seven years since state engineers drained Sinaloa Lake behind a failing 
dam in Simi Valley, two forests have grown: one in the dry lake bed and another 
in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the "forest of paper," which attorneys say has been filed in state 
and federal courts since the homeowners sued the state in 1983 for draining the 
12-acre lake near their homes, arrived in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Sinaloa Lake Owners Assn. sued the California Division of Safety of Dams 
and the city of Simi Valley in July. It is asking for $10 million in damages 
because of alleged property devaluation and physical damage to their houses 
since Lake Sinaloa was drained during heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
The suit against the state and city was filed in Los Angeles County to avoid 
conflict of interest between a local court and the city. 
</P>
<P>
But a Los Angeles judge ruled that the Ventura County court could decide on its 
own whether it would be able to be impartial, said Marlena Mouser, an attorney 
for the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The complex case was born in March, 1983, when heavy rains filled Lake Sinaloa 
to within several feet of overflowing a 30-foot-high and 800-foot-long earthen 
dam. 
</P>
<P>
The suit maintains that a city-owned water line through the dam, which had been 
built by a farmer in the 1920s, had burst and contributed to the erosion. But 
Henry Walsh, an attorney representing Simi Valley, said the line had not been 
leaking. 
</P>
<P>
As the water rose and earth began to fall away from the outside of the dam, 
state and city engineers became concerned that the dam would burst and flood 
downstream properties. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m. March 2, the city ordered the neighborhoods near the dam evacuated. 
But by March 3, the rain had stopped and the state Division of Safety of Dams 
took over the site and ordered the lake level lowered, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuees were allowed to return on March 5, the suit says. By March 8, the 
lake had been lowered by 19 feet, and no more rain was falling. Then on March 
10, officials from the state Division of Safety of Dams ordered the lake 
drained and the dam breached, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't tell us anything; they just drained it," said Robert Ain, who owns 
a lake-front house that now looks out at a mass of trees and brush. "They came 
down on Friday afternoon, set up the lights and worked all night. How would you 
feel if somebody took your lake away from you?" 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley has denied any liability in the case, Walsh said. The city argues, 
he said, that there is no evidence that the pipe in the dam leaked and adds 
that the state alone decided to drain the lake and breach the dam. 
</P>
<P>
The state Division of Safety of Dams argues that the lake had to be drained. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that this was an emergency action and the dam in its 
condition after the slides and the rainstorm was a public nuisance," Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Joel Davis said. "Our point is that homeowners are not entitled to 
reimbursement for actions the state took to protect the downstream property 
owners and the lives of the persons downstream." 
</P>
<P>
As the water table beneath the empty lake bed receded, the homeowners' suit 
alleges, the land beneath the homes settled and some foundations and walls 
cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner William Hull said he has spent about $5,000 to repair cracks in his 
walls and swimming pool caused by the receding land. 
</P>
<P>
The Sinaloa Lake Owners Assn. originally sued the state and city in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles over the destruction of just the lake, alleging 
that the group had not been given due process in the decision to drain it and 
breach the dam. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Edward Rafeedie dismissed the suit in 1986, but on 
appeal, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the due process claims 
and ordered the judge to take up the case again. In March, the U.S. Supreme 
Court refused to hear the state's appeal of the 9th Circuit Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rafeedie is considering a request for an injunction by the homeowners, who 
want the state ordered to rebuild the dam. Rafeedie also is considering a 
motion from Simi Valley to dismiss the due process claims. 
</P>
<P>
And in July, the homeowners filed the suit that was transferred to Ventura 
County Superior Court on Wednesday, guaranteeing that the seven-year-old fight 
will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long, drawn-out fight, but the people in the lake association are 
very determined to set things right," Ain said. 
</P>
<P>
Hull said the homeowners knew that their suit could take years to resolve. He 
said, "I think everyone of us had our eyes open when we went into it."

CAMARILLO STATE HOSPITAL TARGET OF INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of investigators from the state auditor general's office is combing 
through records and talking to patients this week at Camarillo State Hospital 
to determine if mentally retarded children there have abused each other, as 
they reportedly did at a state hospital in Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials say the probe is part of a statewide investigation and are 
confident that Camarillo has no similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that we're doing fine," said Myron Dimmett, Camarillo's 
standards compliance coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
But an aide to state Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) said Thursday that 
abuse among mentally retarded patients appears to be widespread in state 
institutions and that legislators are expecting to find violations at virtually 
every facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is rife with problems," said Peggy Collins, legislative coordinator 
for McCorquodale. "These kids have been physically abusing themselves and each 
other. There are kids who have been beaten up and no one knows what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Once the auditor general's report is completed, it is expected to be the 
impetus for legislative change, Collins said. "This is going to be a major 
issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William Filante (R-Greenbrae) said legislators hope that the audit 
will clearly define how state and local agencies should be spending their money 
to better serve mentally retarded children. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to look at apportionment of money," Filante said. "We should put our 
money where our mouths are and try to do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
The issue at the Sonoma Developmental Center arose last October when a group of 
parents complained that their children had been beaten and sexually molested by 
other patients and routinely deprived of programs mandated by law. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents complained that their children had multiple bruises, and one 
person said a child was restrained and placed in a closet at the Sonoma 
facility. Some also complained that their children had been neglected because 
of understaffing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Department of Developmental Services repeatedly have 
denied that the abuse occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is the same," said Greg Sandin, spokesman for the developmental 
services department. "We deny those charges." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Collins, the center has recently implemented changes to 
address the alleged problems. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, violent children are no longer housed with frail 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation has improved there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Collins and other state officials, the problems at Sonoma started 
after several private facilities were closed and the patients -- many of whom 
were violent -- were sent to the state institution. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma was not prepared to handle the influx of aggressive patients, who 
consequently were mixed with the weaker children, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost need a one-on-one treatment for those type of patients," said 
Joanne Hussey Bovee, chief of staff for Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R-Santa 
Rosa). 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the reports of abuse surfaced at Sonoma, several legislators 
requested that the auditor general's office conduct an investigation of all 
seven of the state facilities for the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Sonoma was not an isolated incident," Bovee said. "That's why 
we asked for the audit. Basically it's a performance audit to figure out how we 
can do things better." 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Sjoberg, acting state auditor general, said the report should be completed 
after the first of the year.

Family and friends planning to send holiday packages to those in the Middle 
East will have to start gift-wrapping well before Halloween this year. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service routinely requires October and November deadlines for 
international holiday mail but with extra troops in Saudi Arabia it moved 
deadlines up one week to ensure prompt delivery, said Felice Cook, director of 
marketing and communication for the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy packages sent to the Middle East by ship, the least expensive route of 
travel, must be sent this week. Airmail deadlines range from Nov. 3 to Nov. 26, 
depending on the type of package. Deadlines for other international packages 
are available in area post offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East crisis should have no effect on domestic holiday mail, Cook 
said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

HOLIDAY GIFT OF PARKING NEAR MALL TO CEASE

<P>
You'd better not cry, you'd better not pout and you'd better not park on the 
residential streets around the South Bay Galleria during the Christmas shopping 
season this year, or Santa will be putting a naughty surprise on your 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to head off a seasonal parking crunch in the neighborhoods around the 
popular Redondo Beach shopping mall, the City Council this week created a 
temporary permit-parking zone on Kingsdale, Firmona and Condon avenues that 
would prohibit non-resident parking from Nov. 15 until Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Affected are the 1800 and 1900 blocks of Kingsdale and Firmona avenues and the 
1900 block of Condon Avenue between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Commercial areas of the 
blocks would be exempt from the restriction and will be posted. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Anderson, who owns a home in the area, told the council that temporary 
restrictions were much-needed in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The parking there is already a problem," he said, and becomes much worse 
during the shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only the shoppers," Councilman Terry Ward said. "The employees also 
were coming into the area and parking on the residential streets." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the neighborhood petitioned the city for the district, complaining 
that they could not get into their driveways because the streets were so 
crammed with overflow Galleria parking. SHAWN HUBLER

MAN SAYS MORTICIAN FELT BEATING WAS JUST

When David Wayne Sconce learned that rival mortician Timothy Waters had been 
savagely beaten, he responded that Waters got what he deserved, another 
mortician testified Thursday during Sconce's preliminary hearing on a murder 
charge in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Waters had spread word among Southern California morticians that the Sconce 
family's mortuary, the Lamb Funeral Home, was violating state funeral home 
laws, testified Donald Richard Gray, a retired mortician. 
</P>
<P>
Gray testified that he was just opening his Aftercare Funeral Services mortuary 
in Van Nuys in 1984 when Waters warned him not to contract with Sconce for 
cremations because the Lamb Funeral Home burned more than one body at a time 
and stole dental gold from the bodies it handled. Gray said he repeatedly 
mentioned the allegations to Sconce, who denied them. 
</P>
<P>
Gray testified that while helping transfer bodies from his station wagon into 
cardboard cremation containers at the Lamb Funeral Home in February, 1985, he 
told Sconce that Waters had been severely beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce is serving a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to paying two men 
to beat up Waters, and another five-year sentence for pleading guilty to 
stealing gold from bodies and conducting multiple cremations. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ventura court, he has been accused of poisoning Waters with oleander to 
silence his allegations about the Lamb Funeral Home operation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fredric Rieders, a Philadelphia-area toxicologist, testified Thursday that 
he conducted extensive chemical tests in 1988 that conclusively proved that 
oleander was in Waters' system and caused his death. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' sister has testified that oleander grew wild near her Zuma house, where 
Waters spent the last weekend before he died. But prosecutors have not 
presented evidence on the specific form of oleander that Waters ingested. MACK

VENTURY COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER MAY SELL LAND TO PARK GROUP

A developer who has waged a five-year battle to develop Besant Meadow in 
Meiners Oaks may sell the property to a land conservancy if he loses his legal 
bid to build on the land. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has mounted a hurried campaign to buy the property to preserve 
its wetlands and create a public park. 
</P>
<P>
"Meiners Oaks is one of the largest urban areas in the county without a park," 
resident Robert Unruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could preserve this as a wildlife habitat, the whole valley would 
benefit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Schuck of Franciscan West Developments in Santa Barbara has asked the 
Besant Meadow Preservation Group to make a bid on his 25-acre parcel if he 
loses his battle with the county to build 50 residences. 
</P>
<P>
Schuck recently petitioned the state Supreme Court to appeal county growth 
controls that impose costly measures on his development plan. 
</P>
<P>
The court has yet to say if it will hear his case. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Schuck's recent interest in selling the land, 20 members of the 
nonprofit conservancy met Wednesday to form several fund-raising committees, 
said Richard Handley, a science teacher who is conservancy president. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group organized five years ago to oppose Schuck's earlier attempt 
to build 150 condominiums on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Now with a five-member board of directors and mailing list of 200 names, it has 
obtained nonprofit status and is working with the Santa Barbara Land Trust to 
orchestrate a drive for grants and donations. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent $100 donations brought the group's treasury to $500, but the 
purchase price could be $1 million or more, members said. 
</P>
<P>
Handley said the first step in the process will be to obtain an appraisal of 
the land's value. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy envisions restoring the wetland stream running through the 
meadow, establishing a bird refuge and creating a park-like village commons 
along Lomita Avenue, said member Michael Krumpschmidt, who is a social science 
teacher at Matilija Junior High School. THIA BELL

BARRIER TO BE INSTALLED ON DEADLY SPAN OF FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
ROADS: THE CHP PRAISES THE PLAN TO PUT A CENTER GUARDRAIL ON THE GOLDEN STATE 
BETWEEN CASTAIC LAKE AND GORMAN. 
</P>

<P>
Caltrans began a $1.8-million project this week to install a center guardrail 
on the Golden State Freeway along a stretch of road in northern Los Angeles 
County where six motorists have died in head-on collisions this year. 
</P>
<P>
The steel barriers will be placed along a 13-mile stretch of the freeway going 
north from Templin Highway near Castaic Lake to Hungry Valley Road near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Thomas Knox said actual construction could begin any day. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors began stockpiling rails to be used for the project at a Templin 
Highway storage yard Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the project, which was approved by the state more than a year 
ago, is expected to be completed by February. 
</P>
<P>
At the California Highway Patrol, the project has been received favorably. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good news because of the accidents we've been having," said Capt. 
Terry Horan, head of the CHP's Newhall district, which includes the area where 
the barrier will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
"This will make it safer," Horan said. "The head-on collisions demonstrated the 
need for a barrier. There were fatals; there were accidents where a blown tire 
could send cars into the other side." 
</P>
<P>
The four northbound and four southbound lanes of the freeway are divided by 
guardrails or canyons throughout the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the separation ends from Templin Highway north to California 138 above 
Hungry Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Along this stretch, the north and southbound lanes are only separated by a 
36-foot-wide gravel median that dips in the center. 
</P>
<P>
The guardrail project is part of a statewide plan to add safety barriers along 
the entire length of Interstate 5 as increased population and traffic dictate, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers said that in recent years there have been numerous accidents along 
the stretch that were caused when cars crossed the center strip into oncoming 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, six people have been killed in four separate accidents 
</P>
<P>
involving head-on collisions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the deaths, the accidents often cause massive traffic snarls on 
both sides of the freeway -- the state's major north-south artery. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 5 a head-on collision in Sunday evening traffic near Templin Highway 
left one motorist dead and delayed weekend travelers more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Steve Cortes, who has patrolled the stretch through open, 
mountainous country, said the area is heavily traveled by trucks and motorists 
making lengthy drives to or from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
He said several of the accidents that he has investigated there involved 
drivers who fell asleep and drifted into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to prevent a lot of serious accidents," Cortes said of the new 
center guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
Cortes said that once while chasing a speeding car along the stretch, his 
patrol car blew a tire and veered across the center median and all four 
oncoming lanes. 
</P>
<P>
It was 3 a.m., and traffic was light. 
</P>
<P>
He and his partner came out of it shaken but unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just fortunate I came through it alive," Cortes said. "My partner and I 
were shaking when we got out. We aged about five years going through that. But 
a lot of people aren't as fortunate."

DEFENDANT WANTS JURORS TO DECIDE HIS SANITY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: ACCUSED OF STABBING HIS 18-YEAR-OLD GIRLFRIEND TO DEATH, CHRISTOPHER 
ROWLAND, 22, SAYS HIS LAWYER AND PROSECUTORS WANT HIM SENT TO A MENTAL 
HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an unusual hearing Thursday in Van Nuys Superior Court, a murder defendant 
who described himself as a fallen angel who has spoken to Jesus complained to 
jurors that his lawyer has joined with prosecutors and the judge in trying to 
lock him away in a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Michael Rowland, 22, insisted to the court that he is mentally 
competent to stand trial on a charge that he stabbed 18-year-old Roberta 
Rosentheim to death in a Van Nuys motel eight days after meeting her. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland disputed the argument of his attorney, Deputy Public Defender William 
M. Thornbury, that he is too mentally unstable to assist in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to proceed to trial as speedily as possible and get this over with," 
Rowland told jurors, who are expected to begin deliberations today over whether 
Rowland is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
"All it is, is an attempt by the D.A. to get their case together. I'm fully 
competent and fully aware of the details of this case." 
</P>
<P>
But later, Rowland told jurors: "If I can put it very briefly, I'm a fallen 
angel. . . . I believe I spoke to Jesus three times. . . . A voice said, 'Be a 
warrior for me and you'll have all you desire.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rosentheim fell in love with Rowland, a drifter, after being introduced to him 
by her brother, who brought Rowland home after meeting him on a bus, family 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
She was killed Feb. 12 in a room at the Chateau Motel on Sepulveda Boulevard, 
where the couple had gone because Rosentheim's family disapproved of the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
If the jury finds Rowland incompetent, he may be housed in a state mental 
hospital until psychiatrists determine that he is able to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Claims of mental incompetency in trials are usually determined by a judge after 
reviewing statements by psychiatrists who have examined the defendant, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rowland took the unusual step of asserting his right to have jurors decide 
the matter, saying they were the best witnesses to his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland appeared composed and articulate during most of an hourlong statement 
in which he accused the Los Angeles public defender's office of dragging its 
heels in its investigation of the killing. He said the office was trying to 
make him appear insane because he had accused it of wrongdoing, and he wanted a 
new lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The public defender's office, Rowland said, wants "to have it on the record 
that I'm insane or I have organic brain damage, to cover up these allegations I 
made" so "the whole case would be shelved." 
</P>
<P>
Thornbury, in questioning his client, said his office had begun an 
investigation into the killing in June. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland said he was unaware of the investigation and had not been interviewed 
by the office. 
</P>
<P>
A psychiatrist testified Thursday that Rowland suffers from paranoid 
schizophrenia and major depression. 
</P>
<P>
A second psychiatrist said Rowland's mental troubles may be related to 
long-term drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, however, said he appeared psychotic when interviewed by the 
psychiatrists because he was taking Thorazine and Stelazine, which are 
anti-psychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so heavily and thoroughly medicated, I was a zombie," he said.

ADVICE ON DUMP GAS IGNORED, OFFICIAL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON: AIR QUALITY ENGINEERS URGED DEEPER WELLS TO CONTROL METHANE 
EMISSIONS FROM ROTTING GARBAGE AT THE LANDFILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A top Los Angeles sanitation official admitted Thursday that the city 
disregarded the advice of regional air quality engineers when it installed an 
inadequate collection system to control methane gas emissions at Lopez Canyon 
Landfill in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"The results were disappointing," Michael Miller, assistant director of the 
city Bureau of Sanitation, told the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
hearing board. 
</P>
<P>
He said sanitation officials realize there may have been a flaw in the design 
of the initial 18 wells the city installed by an AQMD-mandated deadline in 
January of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized the failure," Miller said. "Certain elements were not operating 
efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the city has installed more than 100 additional wells to collect 
methane and other gases given off by garbage rotting underground at the 
northeastern San Fernando Valley dump, Miller said. The sanitation bureau also 
has plans to spend millions of dollars more on additional measures demanded by 
AQMD officials to control the emissions, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD hearing board, a quasi-judicial body, hopes to wind up testimony today 
in hearings it has been holding since April on the emissions problem. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings led to a new agreement aimed at satisfying all three sides in the 
long-running dispute -- city sanitation bureau administrators, regional air 
quality officials and dump neighbors made ill by the emissions -- that has been 
submitted to the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Board members agreed this week to conclude testimony on city efforts to control 
gas emissions today, conduct a public hearing Oct. 18 in Lake View Terrace and 
rule on the agreement Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to wind this thing up," board member James Joyce said. "Some people 
think these hearings have gone on far too long." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Miller said he believes the new agreement will bring the landfill 
into compliance with state laws governing methane gas emissions because it is 
more specific as to the steps the city must take. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the initial wells installed at the dump were shallow -- 25 to 
75 feet deep -- rather than deep wells of 100 feet or more recommended by AQMD 
engineers. "Our engineers believed their system would work," Miller said. He 
refused to answer a question as to which city official made the decision to 
install shallow wells. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, AQMD engineer Robert Pease said there was also a problem 
with the initial system the city installed because the capacity of the flares 
was not great enough to burn off all the gas collected by the wells. 
</P>
<P>
An expanded flare system will be installed by the city, in addition to more and 
deeper wells, Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD engineer Jay Chen testified that he had advised the city to install deeper 
wells because "the first 18 wells were inadequate to control gas emissions." 
Other landfills, including Sunshine and Scholl Canyon, have followed the AQMD's 
advice and have controlled emissions, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't particularly like the locations of the 18 wells" at Lopez, Chen told 
the board. "They are too low." 
</P>
<P>
He said the city also failed to submit all the monthly reports to the AQMD and 
to monitor emissions at the dump as often as required by an Aug. 2, 1989, order 
issued by the hearing board. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said they were disappointed that the city had not installed an 
easily accessible 24-hour telephone hot line to accept public complaints about 
landfill odors, which was required in last year's order. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most infuriating and disgraceful things about all this is the way 
that hot line was installed," board member William F. Banks said. The hot line 
is connected at night to a sanitation facility near Los Angeles Harbor where 
the employees are unfamiliar with Lopez Canyon, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about having to hand out clothespins to the community," board 
member Esther Lewin said about the odors. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials have maintained that the present gas-collection system 
is operating more efficiently, an AQMD inspector was called to the site as 
recently as Saturday morning because of the large number of complaints about 
odors. 
</P>
<P>
"The smell made some of us gag," said Rob Zapple, a Kagel Canyon resident who 
has been a leader in fighting the dump.

SON CONVICTED IN CONTRACT KILLING OF HIS FATHER; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE JURY REACHES AN ACRIMONIOUS VERDICT, FINDING RAYMOND GODLEWSKI JR. 
GUILTY OF THE LESSER CHARGE OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After three days of apparently heated debate, a San Fernando Superior Court 
jury Thursday convicted Raymond Godlewski Jr. of Montrose of second-degree 
murder for hiring a boyhood friend to slay Godlewski's father. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for three days before finding that Godlewski, 24, had 
committed second-degree murder by hiring Gene Marshall Flack, 24, to kill 
Raymond Godlewski Sr. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict means that Godlewski, who planned the murder, was convicted on a 
lesser charge, and faces a lesser penalty, than the two men he hired to carry 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was announced, one juror, who refused to identify himself, 
said the verdict had been "an acrimonious decision and nobody is happy about 
it." He refused to elaborate, saying that the jurors had agreed among 
themselves not to discuss the case with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors sought to convict Godlewski of first-degree murder with the special 
circumstance that the murder was committed for financial gain, which would have 
made Godlewski eligible for a sentence of life in prison without parole. During 
the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Richman argued that the younger Godlewski 
arranged the murder so he could collect a $280,000 inheritance from his father. 
</P>
<P>
But juror Dean Later of Valencia told reporters that the prosecution had not 
produced enough evidence to prove to him that the motive was money. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Kenneth Lezin argued that Godlewski wanted his father 
dead because his father was so violent that the son feared for his life. 
</P>
<P>
Another jury Wednesday convicted Flack and his roommate, Michael Brown, 22, 
both of Palmdale, of first-degree murder for their roles in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Flack shot the senior Godlewski, 45, once in the head on July 4, 1989, at the 
front door of Godlewski's Sylmar home, and Brown drove the car in which Flack 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Flack and the younger Godlewski had been friends since childhood. Prosecutors 
said the younger Godlewski originally offered Flack $5,000 to kill his father 
and later increased the offer to $7,000. According to court testimony, 
Godlewski paid Flack at least $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Flack was also convicted of the special circumstance of murder for financial 
gain. He faces a maximum punishment of life in prison without possibility of 
parole when he is sentenced onNov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Brown faces 26 years to life in prison. Godlewski faces 16 years to life.

COUNCILMAN SAYS EPA MISLED CITY ON SEWAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that federal officials "rushed us to judgment" on a proposed 
sewage-treatment plan, San Diego City Councilman Bruce Henderson charged 
Thursday that the city was misled into thinking it had six months fewer than it 
actually did to oppose the $2.8-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's improperly abbreviated timetable, 
Henderson argued, should "substantially strengthen our hand" at a court hearing 
next month where San Diego will seek to regain a waiver from federal clean 
water standards at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether it was malicious, but the EPA misled us, and that had a 
dramatic impact on the city's decision," Henderson said, referring to the 
council's 1987 vote to abandon its request for a waiver extension. 
</P>
<P>
"We were made to feel that we were up against a very tight deadline, that we 
really had no realistic alternatives," Henderson told a City Hall news 
conference. "Clearly, that was not the case. They have a duty at the very least 
to go back and give us six more months." 
</P>
<P>
Regional EPA officials in San Francisco declined to comment on Henderson's 
charges, outlined in legal briefs filed Thursday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
According to attorney David Mulliken, who represents Henderson in his effort to 
intervene in a federal lawsuit concerning the sewage project, EPA regulations 
give local governments up to one year to appeal the agency's tentative denial 
of a waiver request. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, when the EPA tentatively turned down San Diego's request for an 
extension of its existing waiver in September, 1986, the city was told it had 
only six months to try to change the agency's decision, Mulliken said in the 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
When Mayor Maureen O'Connor met with top EPA officials at the time, they 
painted a bleak picture of the city's prospects of succeeding in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We were led to believe that we were never going to get the waiver, but if we 
played along with (the EPA), there was a chance to get some federal money" to 
help upgrade the Point Loma plant, Henderson said. As a result, the council 
withdrew its waiver request in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The city agreed with the EPA to improve its overall sewage-treatment program, 
setting the stage for the largest and most expensive public works project in 
San Diego history. In addition to upgrading the Point Loma plant, the project 
includes construction of a new South Bay facility and six water reclamation 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
However, growing scientific doubt about the necessity of secondary treatment, 
combined with the politically unpalatable prospect of dramatically higher 
sewage bills to pay for it, have continued to give the council pause over the 
Point Loma project. 
</P>
<P>
Culminating years of controversy, the council voted in closed session this week 
to try to reactivate the waiver it abandoned 3 1/2 years ago. While seeking the 
Point Loma exemption, the city intends to proceed with the other components of 
the overall program. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's court documents, Henderson's attorneys ask U.S. District Judge 
RudiBrewster to suspend the consent decree between the city and the EPA at the 
Nov. 1 hearing and to order an evidentiary hearing on the need -- or lack 
thereof -- for secondary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the cost of preparing for such a hearing might cause the council 
to reconsider this week's decision, Henderson's briefs also ask Brewster to 
order the city, if necessary, to pursue the waiver reactivation request. 
</P>
<P>
Before having an opportunity to offer his arguments in court, Henderson first 
must persuade Brewster at next month's hearing to allow him to become a party 
in the lawsuit, which was filed against the city in 1988 by the U.S. Justice 
Department on behalf of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the federal government accuses San Diego of violating the Clean 
Water Act's requirement that municipalities provide so-called secondary 
treatment to remove about 90% of suspended solids from sewage. The city's 
advanced primary treatment process now removes about 80% of the solids from 
waste water before it is discharged into the ocean off Point Loma.

SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT STUDIES RESPONSE TO 911 CALL BEFORE TRAIN WRECK; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: INVESTIGATION ASKS WHY DISPATCHERS FAILED TO NOTIFY THE RAILROAD 
ABOUT A TRUCK STALLED ON THE TRACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Sheriff's Department was investigating Thursday the actions of dispatchers 
in the moments before a mishap in which a speeding Amtrak passenger train 
slammed into a tractor-trailer loaded with cars that had become stuck at a 
Leucadia train crossing. 
</P>
<P>
In the four minutes before the 2:45 p.m. Wednesday wreck, 911 dispatchers at 
the department's Kearny Mesa communications center received five calls from 
witnesses reporting that the tractor-trailer had become lodged at the crossing 
at Leucadia Boulevard and Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
While a sheriff's patrol unit was notified after the first call, dispatchers 
failed to contact railroad officials in an effort to alert the Amtrak engineer 
that the truck was in his path, sheriff's officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the crux of our investigation," said Sgt. Glenn Revell of the Sheriff 
Department's public affairs division. "If the dispatcher has information that a 
tractor-trailer is lodged across the path of a train, we feel it would have 
been appropriate to notify the Santa Fe railroad. However, that was not done." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, railroad officials said Thursday that, had they been notified even 
moments before the crash, they could well have slowed and possibly stopped the 
passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it depends on getting the information and reaching the engineer 
but, yes, we probably could have got to him," said Bob Harper, a Santa Fe 
railroad assistant regional manager in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of signal crossings north of that area where we could have 
alerted the engineer that there was a big rig in his path." 
</P>
<P>
The engineer of the southbound passenger train was traveling about 88 m.p.h. 
when he spotted the truck 1,500 feet away, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
"He applied his emergency brakes and held on," he said. "The train was probably 
going about 55 or 60 when collision occurred." 
</P>
<P>
The impact sliced the rig in two, spraying its cargo of eight automobiles about 
the intersection like children's toys, tying up both the railway and nearby 
vehicular traffic for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Seven passengers aboard the train were treated for minor injuries at a nearby 
hospital, as well as two motorists involved a minor crash along Highway 101 
moments after the train wreck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The train, which became partially derailed upon impact, sustained more than 
$20,000 in damages, primarily to the lead car, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the driver of the tractor-trailer, who was delivering an 
automobile to a couple who lived nearby the crash site, was issued three 
citations for his involvement in the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
Michael E. Tune of Summersville, Mo., was cited for driving on a route posted 
for no-truck traffic along Leucadia Boulevard between Interstate 5 and Highway 
101, blocking a railway crossing and stopping at a railway crossing, said 
sheriff's Lt. Kathy Fulmer. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Sheriff's Deapartment held a press conference at which it was 
announced that investigators were focusing their attention on the actions of 
the 911 dispatchers and that they were reviewing tapes of conversations with 
witnesses in the minutes prior to the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
Dispatchers received the first call shortly after 2:41 p.m., presumably from a 
motorist with a cellular phone who had noticed the low-slung carrier hung up on 
the tracks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four seconds later, the second caller was told to contact the 
department's non-emergency line. A clerk at a nearby convenience store who 
apparently made the call said he was told by a dispatcher: "We don't handle 
minor traffic accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies who reviewed the tape denied that claim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to see if a mistake was made either because the dispatcher was 
not trained to deal with such an emergency or whether the department needs to 
institute a policy to deal with large vehicles lodged on the tracks -- right 
now, we don't have such a policy," said Sgt. Jim Cooke of the department's 
public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not the dispatcher's fault that truck got stuck on those tracks. It's 
not like she ignored the situation -- a car was sent to investigate the scene. 
It's a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
In many would-be emergencies, patrol cars are first sent to the scene to 
investigate before an ambulance is dispatched, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what happened here," Sgt. Revell said. "If we called the Santa Fe 
Railway every time there was a report of an obstruction, we'd be stopping 
trains every day." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, neighbors at the scene of the wreck said they had seen numerous 
trucks become stuck on the mounded crossing, which they said has become a 
traffic hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in this neighborhood 31 years and I've seen too many trucks get 
stuck there," said one man, who declined to give his name. "That place is a 
time bomb just waiting to go off." 
</P>
<P>
Neither railroad officials nor sheriff's deputies said they have received any 
complaints about the crossing. Nonetheless, in the wake of the accident, 
railroad engineers will investigate the slope of the Leucadia Boulevard 
crossing, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the city and the state have requirements for the grade of such 
crossings," he said. "We'll run a survey on the grade and I suppose the city 
will do the same. Between us, we'll get to the bottom of any problems that 
exist there."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors voted Wednesday to appeal a $55-million judgment won by a 
wealthy San Diego family who sued the county over the price of land obtained 
for a new jail. 
</P>
<P>
County spokesman Robert Lerner said the judgment, which could total $71.5 
million after interest is paid, "has terrible implications." 
</P>
<P>
The board of supervisors ordered the county counsel to appeal the jury's award 
to Roque de la Fuente II and his family and if necessary seek a new trial, 
Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is 525 acres of barren land in the county's outback at the eastern 
edge of Otay Mesa, which the county obtained in September, 1987. The property, 
which the county obtained through eminent-domain laws for a jail, was owned by 
the De la Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides were unable to agree on a purchase price and the De la Fuentes sued. 
Last Friday, a Superior Court jury ruled in their favor and put a $55-million 
price on the property. County officials complained that the jury's price tag 
raised the value of the land by 7,000% over the past five years, from $3,300 an 
acre to $375,000 an acre.

<P>
Saying the evidence just isn't strong enough, federal prosecutors confirmed 
Thursday that they have decided not to prosecute six San Diego County sheriff's 
deputies in the 1988 choking death of a Latino jail inmate. 
</P>
<P>
A "careful review" prompted the conclusion that the deputies lacked criminal 
intent in the death of Albert Varela, 28, of Lakeside, federal prosecutors said 
in a three-paragraph letter announcing the decision not to prosecute the six 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Varela died after a fight with deputies in the downtown County Jail, and U.S. 
Attorney William Braniff said in an interview that the fight "certainly was a 
confrontational situation." But there was not enough proof that the deputies 
acted with the intent to harm Varela, Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the lengthy federal investigation, disclosed Thursday in The 
Times, follows earlier reviews by the Sheriff's Department and the county 
district attorney that cleared the deputies of wrongdoing.10/05/90

A man who held police at bay at the Harbor Island Travelodge hotel during the 
longest SWAT team operation in San Diego history pleaded guilty Thursday to a 
charge of kidnapping with the use of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Joe Dolph, 18, made his plea before Municipal Judge Charles L. Patrick, 
who said that Dolph faces a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison when he is 
sentenced Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Dolph escaped from the "equivalent of a foster home" in Colorado several days 
prior to taking a hostage at the hotel, according to his attorney, public 
defender Marian Modrak. 
</P>
<P>
During the 34-hour standoff, which ended the morning of Aug. 23, Dolph held 
hostage Donald Evans, a 56-year-old night watchman from El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
In the plea bargain agreement negotiated Thursday, charges of false 
imprisonment, receiving stolen property and possession of a firearm were 
dropped, according Deputy Dist. Atty. David A. Stutz. 
</P>
<P>
Modrak said she will ask the judge in the case to sentence Dolph to the 
California Youth Authority.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSES FEAR STREET PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lomita officials this week tried to reassure businessmen who complained at the 
City Council meeting that the yearlong rebuilding of Narbonne Avenue would hurt 
their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Esser, who runs a computer store, warned of a "financial catastrophe in 
this city," adding that the duration of the project would have a devastating 
impact on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County engineers, contracted by the city to administer the project, 
said vehicle access to businesses would be maintained during the work, except 
for three times during the project for three days each. They also guaranteed 
that two lanes of traffic would remain open at all times, except during storm 
drain construction, when one lane would be used. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the 3/4-mile stretch of Narbonne Avenue will begin later this 
month, said city staff. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.7-million project will extend from Pacific Coast Highway north to 248th 
Street, along 10 blocks of small retail stores, professional offices, a 
mortuary and a preschool. 
</P>
<P>
The street will be widened by four feet, sidewalks replaced and the roadway 
rebuilt. Over the years it has developed a crown from buildup of asphalt used 
for resurfacing. Trees will be planted and traffic signal synchronization will 
be improved. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do the best we can to minimize the problems," said City Manager Walker 
Ritter, "but you're talking about a big project, so there's going to be some 
inconvenience. We will work with everybody as best we can." 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the project will be held Oct. 15 at City Hall.

INGLEWOOD AND HOTELIERS DISCUSS PARTY SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
CROWD CONTROL: AUTHORITIES ADVISED MANAGERS TO NIP TROUBLE BEFORE IT ESCALATES 
BY CALLING IN POLICE.

In an attempt to prevent mass gatherings in Inglewood from growing out of 
control, city officials this week convened a group of hotel and club managers, 
including the administrators from an Inglewood hotel where two party-goers died 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
It was the two recent deaths at the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel, which occurred 
within a week, that prompted Mayor Edward Vincent to convene the managers 
Monday and tell them: "We want to eliminate people getting hurt and people 
getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
A week after a man attending a Sweet 16 birthday party was shot in the Days Inn 
parking lot Aug. 25, another birthday party with more than 300 guests erupted 
in fistfights, gunfire and a fatal traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials recommended that managers screen those who book the 
parties and vigorously adhere to occupancy limits in order to reduce the 
likelihood of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to guarantee that nothing bad will happen," said Deputy Chief 
James Butts. But he told the managers that they could reduce the escalation of 
trouble by calling police immediately if fighting starts, if a guest has a 
firearm or if party-goers refuse to leave when ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Butts also said managers should have a secure place from which to phone the 
police. When fighting broke out at the Days Inn party, an employee reported 
that guests seeking safety overran the hotel's front office. 
</P>
<P>
The managers said their main dilemma is predicting the dynamics of a party 
ahead of time, especially when young people sometimes send an adult to book the 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Hong, manager of the Days Inn Park Plaza, suggested that the police could 
run background checks on organizers as a precaution, but Butts said police 
databases are not available for such uses. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Sinaguglia, who runs the Mayflower Ballroom in Inglewood, said one of his 
techniques for avoiding trouble is carefully screening party organizers. He 
said he requires a driver's license and asks the organizers questions about 
their employment and any past parties they have had. 
</P>
<P>
Even if an organizer passes those tests, the party may still not be a sure 
thing. He said he sometimes turns party organizers down for nothing other than 
"a gut feeling."

SENTENCING DELAYED FOR RAPISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach Superior Court judge on Thursday postponed sentencing for two 
former Marymount College basketball players convicted of raping another student 
at the small Rancho Palos Verdes campus. 
</P>
<P>
Bryon Flournoy, 23, and Warren Cox, 20, were ordered to return to court Oct. 18 
after Judge Michael G. Nott discovered that a probation officer had not yet 
filed a sentencing recommendation for the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Nott denied Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Lamb's request that Flournoy and Cox be 
ordered to wait in county jail until they are sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
The men remain free on $50,000 bail each. 
</P>

Jurors convicted the men last month of raping a 23-year-old woman while she was 
visiting their San Pedro apartment in February.

STUDENTS GIVE A LESSON IN AWARENESS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SEEKING TO DEFUSE RACIAL CONFLICTS, THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEIR 
ETHNICITY AFFECTS THE WAY CENTINELA DISTRICT'S TEACHERS TREAT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a bit of role reversal, two student panels fielded questions from teachers 
in the Centinela Valley Union High School District this week to broaden 
cultural awareness and avoid racial tensions that divided the district last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member panels at Leuzinger and Hawthorne high schools represented a 
diverse range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. After discussing how their 
ethnicity affects the way they are treated, the panelists were asked to provide 
suggestions for promoting harmony in the district. 
</P>
<P>
A few students expressed frustration at what they perceived as cultural 
insensitivity by some teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrick Horne, a senior who is black, criticized some teacher material 
selection. "There's not enough about our race in the books. I'd like to learn 
about my people, what they were like and what they did." 
</P>
<P>
The student panels, which met Monday morning, launched the first of what will 
be six days of staff development and training programs scheduled throughout the 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
The training comes as teachers, students and administrators try to make sense 
of the racial divisiveness that erupted into allegations that blacks are not 
treated fairly in the district and led to a two-day student walkout in March. 
</P>
<P>
Once predominantly white, the student population of Centinela Valley today is 
53.4% Latino, 18.4% black and 8.5% Asian. About 80% of the teachers are Anglo. 
Four of the five school board members are Latino and one is Anglo. Many 
students on Leuzinger's panel indicated they would like to put the events of 
last spring behind them. But some teachers' questions made it clear the adults 
were still looking for answers. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you think the perception arose that teachers and staff are uncaring and 
racist and create other problems?" the students were asked. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Tyson, a senior at R. K. Lloyde Continuation High who is black, said he 
believed that some teachers are indeed prejudiced. When they make biased 
statements, he said, "they think other people don't hear it, but then it gets 
around." 
</P>
<P>
But Courtney Day, a senior at Leuzinger who also is black, disagreed: "I think 
there's a stereotypical image in students' minds that all teachers are tyrants, 
so that when things come up and students are primarily wrong . . . they come up 
with these stories, trying to portray teachers negatively.

REDONDO FILES NOISE CHARGES AGAINST EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Redondo Beach has filed criminal charges against Southern 
California Edison for allegedly violating the local noise ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
City Prosecutor John Slawson said Thursday that the seven counts he filed in 
South Bay Municipal Court this week concern noise from Edison's Redondo Beach 
electric plant in September. 
</P>
<P>
He said the charges carry a maximum of $3,485 in penalties and fines. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastian Nola, Edison's South Bay district manager, declined Thursday to 
discuss the case. However, he said Edison is spending $2.5 million to make the 
local power station quieter, installing acoustic housings and panels around 
turbine generators, fans, boiler feed pumps and other loud equipment. Nola said 
most of that work has already been done. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Gould, who lives in a condominium unit facing the power station, 
complained Thursday that loud noise from the plant continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you have a dishwasher on your patio running all the time," Gould 
said. "It's really annoying. I no longer sleep in my master bedroom. I have to 
sleep in one of the secondary bedrooms on the back side of the house. . . . 
Last night the noise even woke me up in there." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, spurred by residents' complaints, decided Sept. 11 to ask 
that Edison be prosecuted. The charges mark the second time the city has taken 
the utility to court over noise. 
</P>
<P>
The city lost the first case last year -- partly, officials said, because their 
measurements did not adequately distinguish plant noise from other sources of 
noise. This time, though, officials said, they are confident that sound 
measurements were carried out correctly. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we have a very solid case," Slawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment has been set for Oct. 23 before Municipal Court Judge Sandra 
Thompson.

DAVID NELSON ON RESAURANTS: WOLFGANG PUCK ADDS MAGIC TOUCH TO DELICIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wolfgang Puck, the celebrated Los Angeles restaurateur, periodically visits the 
celebrated Chino's Farm in Rancho Santa Fe to squeeze the tomatoes and pinch 
the peppers destined to perform star turns on the pizzas at his Spago on the 
Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
For the last few months, however, Puck hasn't been in such a hurry to get back 
on the road after loading his vehicle with Chino's crisp corn, pampered baby 
lettuces and dewy berries. At least every other week, he makes a point of 
stopping in bustling downtown Rancho Santa Fe to visit Delicias, a restaurant 
that unmistakably bears his signature even though he holds but a minority 
interest and has not placed his name on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Principal proprietor Paulo Parviz, a Portuguese restaurateur embarking on his 
first restaurant venture in this country, recruited Puck for his stylish, 
trend-setting approach to contemporary cuisine. Puck, in turn, sent down 
Spago's Serge Falestich to spend a minimum of three days each week creating new 
dishes, training the kitchen staff and -- most unusually for these times -- 
actually cooking for the clientele. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain serendipity to the restaurant's name, a borrowing from this 
community's main drag, Paseo Delicias. To the English-tuned ear, delicias 
connotes "delicious," although the Spanish word actually denotes "delights," 
and if anything it would seem that Delicias aims to be a garden of delights. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this sizeable restaurant has the look of a garden. A great spray of 
flowers some two yards across occupies its own table in the center of the room, 
and satellite bouquets in the same dazzling colors decorate all the tables. The 
tables' floral undercloths are matched by the chair cushions, while 
antique-looking tapestries in more muted colors hang on the walls and, perhaps 
just for the sake of whimsy, a Persian rug carpets the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
But if this is a garden, it is one populated by noisy bees whose cacophonous 
drone echoes off the marble floors and the decorative tile wall that fronts the 
open kitchen. Genteel Delicias may be -- the miniature purse stools placed 
beside womens' chairs makes that point rather neatly -- but at times it has the 
roar of a bus depot in full cry. However, since the cooking presumably inspires 
the relentless buzz, the noise at least becomes understandable. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is written in a matter-of-fact tone that makes for so-so reading; the 
exclamation points are saved for the plates, which is precisely where they 
belong. Chino's contributes its all to the cooking in a way that suits 
Delicias' flowery approach, because Puck and Falestich use vegetables -- 
chopped, shredded, diced and minced -- in painterly fashion, working from a 
palette stocked with the greens of herbs and the rich reds, oranges and yellows 
of fancy peppers and specialty tomatoes. In many preparations, minced 
vegetables seem to double as confetti, or as crunchy rainbows lavishly streaked 
atop a given plate's principal ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
These minced ingredients star by themselves in the chopped salad, a multihued 
mound dressed with a few sauteed shrimp. This makes a light, pleasant starter. 
But the tomato salad -- overlapping rounds of red, yellow and green dressed 
with a vividly herbal vinaigrette -- may eclipse all competitors in the salad 
section. In deference to Californians whose daily regimen dictates greenery, 
there is a plate of choice young lettuces dressed up with sherry vinaigrette 
and shavings of moderately sharp Asiago cheese. 
</P>
<P>
For all its novelties, Delicias shares certain features with the humblest of 
new eateries, namely pizzas and pastas. Everyone has to have them these days, 
it seems, and it is hardly surprising to find them here, because Puck more or 
less invented designer pizza at Spago and also has lavished his creativity on 
pasta. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzas naturally issue from a wood-burning oven (an unwritten gastronomic 
law laid down by Puck governs this point), and they make a fine shared first 
course. A particularly handsome pie paves the lithe crust first with dilled 
creme fraiche (a thickened cream) and then with grilled red onions and smoked 
salmon, decorated regularly with dill sprigs and pearls of salmon roe that 
explode in salty, tangy bursts when crushed between the teeth. The calzone 
takes a luxe turn with a filling of cheeses, shredded basil and wild mushrooms, 
and is flat but so rich that it seems a cheese pastry under its sparing mantle 
of garlicky fresh tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The same tomato sauce gives a fine but not unusual flavor to a dish of angel 
hair pasta. (So many restaurants now serve this particular macaroni that one 
wonders if the heavenly hosts have been plucked bald.) Meanwhile, a touch of 
tomato stirred with chopped herbs into a smooth cream sauce gave an exquisite 
lift to elongated spinach ravioli stuffed with a mince of zucchini, fennel and 
assorted bell peppers. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees gain their character not so much from unusual flavor combinations 
(although these exist) as from simple perfection of cooking. An old French 
saying laments that God sent us meat, but the devil supplied the cooks, a 
phrase too often true. Delicias puts forth the proper attention, with the 
result that seafoods and meats display that succulent quality best, if rather 
haplessly, described as tender and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
A careful pattern of minced tomato and ribbon-cut basil brightened a grilled 
filet of Norwegian salmon that seemed to melt into its underlying beurre blanc 
sauce. A special of Hawaiian swordfish sauced with cracked pepper and Port 
seemed an adventurous essay into the realm of re-thought cuisine, rather like 
creating a swordfish pepper steak. The trick worked, partially because the Port 
added a rich, almost musky flavor to the sauce rather than the sweet tone that 
had been anticipated with some trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
Grilled free-range chicken came off a little less well, since the boned breast 
portion verged on dryness. The flavor was excellent, however, thanks to the 
rosemary-scented natural juices that sauced the meat; this was very much a sort 
of deluxe diet special. In a much more distinctively fowl mood, the 
ginger-honey glazed duck roasted in the Peking style offered the wonderful 
contrast of melting meat upholstered with crackling skin, all doused with an 
enticing sauce flavored with scallions and star anise. 
</P>
<P>
The fairly brief entree list, which presumably will evolve, also offers a fine 
plate of grilled, marinated shrimp and scallops paired with a lush stew of 
saffron-flavored fennel; grilled, pepper-coated tuna with a tricolored tomato 
salsa; a roasted veal chop moistened with tarragon essence and grilled lamb 
chops flavored with fresh thyme. All plates include a handsome arrangement of 
vegetables -- one evening's peppery corn was outstanding -- and sometimes a 
dish of "Delicias fries," tender pommes frites seasoned most unexpectedly with 
rosemary, tarragon and red pepper flakes. The heat comes as more of a surprise 
than the herbs, but the overall effect is welcome; these are good spuds. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's pastry cook turns out a bountiful, well-appointed tray rich in 
such Americanisms as apple and pecan pie, both served with ice cream, as well 
as an elegant cobbler of berries baked under flying wings of pastry, an 
enormously chocolatey fudge cake with whipped cream and berries (surely meant 
to be shared) and a fine creme brulee given a deluxe variation with, again, the 
addition of assorted berries. 
</P>
<P>
The service takes a more casual tone than might be expected at what may be the 
prototype of this decade's grand restaurant, but is pleasant, thoughtful and 
efficient. The wine list offers few enough moderately priced bottles and seems 
a touch on the short side, but complements the menu quite well.

HOW FORMER S.D. DANCER MADE A BREAK FOR THE CLASSICS; 
</P>
<P>
BALLET: EDWARD ELLISON, BILLED AS EDDIE THE SNAKE IN HIS BREAK-DANCING DAYS, 
APPEARS IN A LEAD ROLE WITH SAN FRANCISCO BALLET IN "RODIN."

There's a world of difference between the rubber-limbed gyrations of 
break-dancing and the classic beauty of ballet. But Edward Ellison has 
straddled both worlds with amazing aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Ellison will dance a lead role in the San Francisco Ballet's 
performance of "Rodin." But San Diego's dance world first discovered him at a 
San Diego Area Dance Alliance Festival concert in 1982. He was billed as Eddie 
the Snake in those days, and Ellison lived up to his name. His lightning-quick, 
serpentine moves and slithery grace brought down the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just started formal dance training at Stage Seven then," Ellison 
recalled in an interview from San Francisco Tuesday. "That was my first taste 
of other forms of dance." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Ellison began performing with both Stage Seven and the California 
Ballet. But street dancing was hot at the time, and Ellison was lured off to 
Hollywood to make movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I did 'Breaking II,' and I was making good money," he said. "But then I 
realized while I was in Rome making a film, that I had to make a decision. I 
was 21, and I didn't feel my heart was really in it. After experiencing a 
little bit of ballet with someone like Marius Zirra (his first ballet teacher 
at Stage Seven), I knew that I really wanted ballet. I knew I had to get out of 
there and get back to ballet." 
</P>
<P>
A scholarship to the Houston Ballet Academy in January, 1985, was his ticket. 
After six months, Ellison was accepted to the prestigious San Francisco Ballet 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years later, I was in the company," he said. "In my second year, I got the 
opportunity to do a principal part. That opened doors to other leads." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a major role in "Rodin," a dance choreographed by the late 
Soviet dancemaker Leonid Jacobson, he also will appear in Glen Tetley's 
"Tagore" and company director Helgi Tomasson's "Handel -- A Celebration," the 
companion pieces on the repertory program. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I'll ever get back to San Diego," Ellison said. "Right 
now, I'm just working on my art form the best I can. Possibly, I will get back 
to San Diego some day."

PROGRAM NOTES: Sledgehammer Theatre's next show in the Progressive Stage 
Company space will be Georg Buchner's "Leonce und Lena" Nov. 17. Scott 
Feldsher. Sledgehammer's artistic director, will direct. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tony-award winning director Lloyd Richards will be coming to San Diego a few 
months before he is due to direct August Wilson's "Two Trains Running" at the 
Old Globe Theatre. Richards is the keynote speaker at UC San Diego's conference 
on Cultural Diversity in the American Theatre Nov. 8-11. Writer, director and 
Teatro Campesino artistic director Luis Valdez will appear as the Helen Edison 
Lecturer for UCSD Extension. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Community Theatre will bring Langston Hughes' "Black Nativity" 
back for its third year in a row. It will play at the Educational Cultural 
Complex Nov. 28-Dec. 16 under the direction of UC San Diego professor Floyd 
Gaffney. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Langston Hughes is just one of the many Harlem Renaissance 
characters in "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," the San Diego Rep world 
premiere that will have its first workshop reading this weekend at Newark 
Symphony Hall in Newark, N.J. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Scott, one of the co-producers and co-creators of San Diego's "Suds" went 
to London and got a staff writing job with the British Broadcasting System. The 
television show is the Jonathan Ross Show and is reportedly the British 
equivalent of the David Letterman show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe will need two actors to fill actor Richard Easton's shoes when 
Easton misses two performances of "Hamlet" to take a part in the new Kenneth 
Branagh film "Dead Again." Easton had been playing a double role as the Ghost

Crawford will play the Ghost Oct. 9 and 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Old Globe associate artist Kandis Chappell will play a television producer in 
the fourth episode of this season's "L.A. Law." John Vickery, whose last San 
Diego appearance was as the bloody "Macbeth" at the La Jolla Playhouse, will 
soon get a chance to sink his teeth into something really ruthless; he portrays 
Chappell's lawyer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Theatre League will offer $5 Sneak Preview tickets to the Nov. 7 
dress rehearsal of the North Coast Repertory Theatre's "The 1940s Radio Hour".

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: FOURSOME WENT DIFFERENT WAYS AFTER 
'HOT FLASHES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In their time, they weren't quite as famous as the Fab Four. 
</P>
<P>
But in San Diego in the early 1980s, the enormously popular four funny women 
who called themselves "Hot Flashes" developed a unique brand of humor. 
</P>
<P>
It was feminist humor. It was drawn from life. In fact, it was drawn from their 
lives. And for two years in a row, the group drew summer crowds to the Theatre 
in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
The group broke up in 1985. Since then each Hot Flash has gone her own fiery 
way, and each has continued the unique momentum that brought her to the team. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of the Hot Flashes, Bronx-born San Diego State grad Sherri Glaser, 
30, is about to star in an autobiographical one-woman show, "Family Secrets" at 
the Hahn Cosmopolitan beginning Thursday. Last Sunday the show finished a 
critically acclaimed seven-month run at Los Angeles' Heliotrope Theatre. Glaser 
also is negotiating for a possible Showtime production, a series with Warner 
Brothers and a national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Another Hot Flash, San Diego native Mo Gaffney, 31, just completed a successful 
Off-Broadway run of "The Kathy &amp; Mo Show." Gaffney also wrote the flashback 
scenes in the movie "The Lemon Sisters" and is currently working on a book of 
"The Kathy &amp; Mo Show" with partner Kathy Najimy. She is also developing 
scripts for Disney as possible starring vehicles for herself and Najimy and may 
be collaborating on some of those projects with screenwriter Nora Ephron. 
</P>
<P>
A third, Robyn Samuels, a 38-year-old Los Angeles actress-elementary school 
teacher, is the director of Glaser's solo show. Samuels also has acted at the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
And the fourth, Margaret Gillette, 37, is living in the Madre Grande monastery 
in Dulzura, organizing retreats for women. 
</P>
<P>
The group first got together when Najimy was looking for a feminist comedy 
troupe to perform in the now defunct B Street Cafe which Najimy ran. 
</P>
<P>
"We had planned to do just one show and the rest is 'herstory'," Glaser said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
All remember Hot Flashes warmly as a starting point for professional or 
personal exploration or both. Interviewed independently, each said that the 
friendships and the work had changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
"What we worked with in Hot Flashes and what I continue to work with is real 
life, not stereotypes," Glaser said on the phone from Los Angeles. "Ninety-two 
percent of what I do really happened. That was always our basic work ethic. 
When you write from your own life, you don't have to steal. It touches your 
heart and people feel it too." 
</P>
<P>
In Glaser's current show she plays a mother, father, grandmother and two 
sisters. She's currently working on adding a third sister, or a lesbian lover 
or a husband for of one of the sisters during the course of the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan run. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels said that the seed of at least one of Glaser's characters, the father, 
emerged during a Hot Flashes routine in which all the women played their 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels also appears to be is the one who misses the group the most: "I looked 
on it even then as a time when what I wanted to do and what I was doing, what I 
wanted to say and what I was saying were in sync," she said on the phone from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette, the only one to have left theater completely, expresses no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
She went from Hot Flashes to a group called the Egomaniacs that she co-founded 
with Glaser and Gillette's now ex-husband, Lawrence Nass. Now, to support 
herself, Gillette cleans houses and serves tables at Jimbo's, a health food 
restaurant in North Park. She said it makes sense to her that the four Hot 
Flashes went in the various directions they did. They were always different, 
she said, and while the differences enhanced the act when they were together, 
they were also the reason that the group eventually broke up. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole background has been following different spiritual paths," said 
Gillette. "I was the searcher. Robyn got into the directing and being the 
architect of what was going on on stage. Sheri was the writer -- she was more 
into the processing of personalities. Mo, who was more the entertainer, was the 
spokesperson between us and the world. She was more the stand-up comedienne 
than anyone." 
</P>
<P>
All of them nurse some hope of a reunion someday, although the prospects for a 
reunion for all four of them is more likely to be personal rather than 
professional, they all say. 
</P>
<P>
"I made three very good friends that I will have for the rest of my life," said 
Gaffney from New York. "I saw Sheri's show the last time I was in L.A. and 
we're convinced we are going to work together again someday. I'm glad we didn't 
let go of our relationships."

SERIOUS FUN WITH ISO AND THE BOBS; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: FOUR MAVERICKS WHO MOVE TO THEIR OWN BEAT JOIN FORCES WITH A NEW-WAVE A 
CAPPELLA GROUP TO CREATE A LIGHT-HEARTED MIX OF MUSIC AND MODERN DANCE.

<P>
During the 1970s and '80s, Pilobolus and its offshoot Momix -- the zanies of 
modern movement -- turned dance on its ear with no-holds-barred moves and 
trompe l'oeil theatrical effects. 
</P>
<P>
Now, fugitives from both groups are riding roughshod on new terrain. Daniel 
Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, Ashley Roland and Morleigh Steinberg formed ISO ("I'm 
So Optimistic") and added another wrinkle to the formula. 
</P>
<P>
The four dance mavericks teamed up with a new-wave a cappella group -- the Bobs 
-- that takes doo-wop to the brink and became "ISO and the Bobs." This 
post-modern fusion will dispense free-form acro-dance (dance rooted in 
acrobatics) and musical mayhem tonight at Mandeville Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will kick off a diverse season of dance, which includes an April 
visit from the acclaimed Lewitzky Dance Company, sponsored by UC San Diego's 
University Events Program. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Denver, Ezralow talked about the move from Momix, 
and the group's special bond with the singing Bobs. 
</P>
<P>
"All four of us were Momix," Ezralow said. "We're different as ISO, but I have 
to think the people aren't different. We still have the same hormones and 
chromosonic structure. The faces didn't change. We just tried to change our 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"At Momix, we created a show with Moses (Pendleton)," Ezralow said. "When it 
got stagnant, we realized we had grown as individuals. We needed responsibility 
for ourselves, and Moses had grown to want to do mostly his work." 
</P>
<P>
ISO has not abandoned the cockeyed sense of humor or the double-jointed 
maneuvers and pretzel-shaped configurations that characterize Momix. But the 
new group veers away from prop manipulation, body-disguising costumes, and 
blatant sight gags. 
</P>
<P>
"Serious fun is the best way to describe our dancing," Ezralow said. "Momix 
kind of goes for the gag. We do less of that. When we find ourselves using 
gimmicks, we move away from it." 
</P>
<P>
While the quartet was still part of Momix, they discovered the Bobs and 
realized they were kindred spirits. That association led to "The Serious Fun 
Festival," a collaborative show created in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"ISO is four people, and the Bobs are also four people," he said. "It's eight 
people collaborating. Sometimes the Bobs sing. Sometimes we dance. Sometimes we 
work together. They've dissected dances of ours, and we've worked with their 
sounds. (The program) is tailor made, and very much a collaborative effort. In 
essence, our bodies sing, and their voices dance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something like a cabaret show," he continued, groping for the right words 
to explain ISO and the Bobs. "It's not meant to be serious modern dance, but 
it's good dancing. And their songs are very clever, very humorous." 
</P>
<P>
What makes ISO and the Bobs different from other music and dance combos? 
</P>
<P>
"At a dance show, you can't really start screaming," Ezralow said. "This one 
takes dance beyond the fourth wall. It brings dance into the fourth row, and 
people get involved. That's the element the Bobs bring. We're still set up for 
a proscenium stage, but we'd like to start getting away from it." 
</P>
<P>
The cabaret connotation has had a negative impact, however, particularly on the 
critics. Ezralow recognizes that. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is they don't know what the show is," he said. "They think that's 
not what dance is about. Normally, the crowd jumps to its feet. The music and 
dance are very accessible, but that's not necessarily bad. You can be very 
commercial and very good." 
</P>
<P>
The ISO and the Bobs show has remained pretty much intact since its inception, 
but San Diego may get a little surprise when the production makes its local 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't guarantee it," Ezralow said, "but we're adding a new solo, and we hope 
to show it in San Diego. Although it's a set show, we keep changing it around. 
It's fluid, and it can be flexible. There are about 15 pieces." 
</P>
<P>
The ISO and the Bobs show is only part of the ISO persona. In fact, the group 
will perform in Italy without their musical partners after the San Diego 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"ISO is a collaborative," Ezralow said. "We have our own shows, and sometimes 
we work with the Bobs. As a group, we're now leaning more toward working 
separately. We don't all participate in everything. 
</P>
<P>
"When everybody is a boss, no one's a boss. We're just four creative minds 
doing complementary choreography," he said. "We found we don't all have to cook 
the same stew. We're all growing as individuals and creative entities. Any 
artist shares a voice with the world, until that voice becomes stagnant or 
repressed. In ISO, we won't have to disband. There's room for us to grow."

FALLEN ANGEL: If anyone could gloat over apparent demotion of Angels General 
Manager Mike Port (C1), it's former Angel Bob Boone. . . . The popular catcher, 
once named the team's co-MVP, jumped to Kansas City in 1988, signing for only 
$1 more than his Angels salary. Team owner Gene Autry, shaken by Boone's 
departure, praised Port with faint damns: "I think Mike could be a little more 
friendly with people he deals with." 
</P>
<P>
.. . But Boone, who still lives in Orange County, refuses to crow: "I don't 
hate Mike Port. I'm not sure I can get a deal done with him." . . . And Boone 
soon will be dealing. He said Thursday he'll be a free agent when the Royals 
set him loose this month, but he's not saying whether he would consider 
returning to Anaheim. Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky

OPTIMISM: Apparently it takes a lot of recession talk before Orange County gets 
scared. . . . Last winter, a survey showed that about one in five county 
households planned to buy a new car. 
</P>
<P>
By late summer, that figure had risen to about one in four, despite a year of 
recession speculation. In fact, more than half of those surveyed in August 
thought they'd be "better off financially" a year hence. Only 8% thought they'd 
wind up worse off. . . . But the jury's still out. Surveys taken after the 
Mideast crisis and federal deficit developments have not yet been tallied.

PROP MAKES A POINT OF AIDS PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Cypress College student Joe Gaudio showed up at school on Thursday, he 
didn't expect to be sitting in front of more than 200 students with a condom 
pulled over his head. 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what happened to the 19-year-old freshman when he came to 
watch Suzi Landolphi's zany, energetic and no-holds-barred presentation on safe 
sex and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing, but I knew it was all in the spirit of good fun," Gaudio 
said. "If it helped anyone, then I'm glad. I think people are often afraid to 
talk about sex, and it's something that needs to be talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Landolphi, 40, isn't afraid to talk about sex, as she proved repeatedly while 
working the crowd at Cypress College much like Joan Rivers would work a Las 
Vegas showroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls, the next time a guy says he'd use a condom but they're too small, tell 
him about Joe's head," Landolphi said to the audience of mostly 18- to 
22-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Snappy one-liners, double-entendres and blunt talk about sex are the trademark 
of Landolphi's frenetic, one-woman show called "Hot, Sexy and Safer" which she 
uses as a vehicle to get college students across the country to think about 
safe sex and the realities of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get AIDS through something like spit," she said as she stomped 
across the stage in her bright orange high-top sneakers. "Which is a good thing 
because I spit a lot when I talk. You can't get it from tears or sweat, sharp 
knives, forks, plates or toilets." 
</P>
<P>
But she urged students to use condoms, to know about a partner before sleeping 
with him or her and to abstain from drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to keep your lines of defense strong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Landolphi also called for compassion toward those afflicted with the virus and 
for tolerance of different sexual orientations. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, every one of us will know or love someone who is HIV-positive," 
she said. "We don't have to judge; we need to understand better." 
</P>
<P>
Landolphi will make about 200 appearances this year at college campuses 
throughout the United States. A producer of television commercials, she 
volunteered for the AIDS ACTION Committee in Boston six years ago. Through that 
involvement, she made public service announcements and eventually began giving 
safe sex lectures to high school students. She began touring college campuses 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My real hope is that this will be the generation that will start something 
better than a sexual revolution," Landolphi said. "I hope this will be the 
generation that starts a sexual evolution." The tone of Landolphi's show came 
as a shock to some, but most agreed that her approach had made them think. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit shocked by the graphic manner, but it was language that the 
students can understand. I think she really got through to a lot of people," 
said Garret Drake, student body president. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Taylor, director of student and campus activities, agreed. "I've been at 
Cypress College for 13 years, and this is the first major event dealing with 
safe sex and AIDS," she said. "These are topics a lot of people are 
uncomfortable about but Suzi makes it comfortable." GREG HERNANDEZ

HOLLY-SEACLIFF DEAL NOW UP TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's proposed Holly-Seacliff development agreement with the Huntington 
Beach Co. has cleared a last hurdle before heading for City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted 4-1 this week in favor of the agreement, which 
the council will consider at a special meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, forged during two months of intensive discussions, the company 
will provide the city with 41 acres for a planned linear park. 
</P>
<P>
But least two questions still must be resolved. Officials for the Huntington 
Beach Co., which owns about 90% of the 750-acre Holly-Seacliff area, have 
balked at demands to pay any fees that the city may impose in the future. For 
example, the city is considering establishing a developer fee to create new 
child-care facilities, which, under the existing proposal, the company would 
not be obligated to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Commissioner Victor Leipzig, who voted against the pact, said he 
was concerned that the agreement does not require the company to help pay for 
the proposed northwesterly extension of Garfield Avenue, which would serve up 
to 3,780 homes in the development. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Huntington Beach Co. hope to finalize the agreement by the 
Nov. 6 election, when three City Council members will be stepping down, said 
Bill Holman, the firm's project manager. JOHN PENNER

2 UCI GRAD STUDENTS WIN FELLOWSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two students at UC Irvine's Graduate School of Management are the first 
beneficiaries of Pacific Mutual Foundation's fellowship program for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Saavedra and Leslie Modregon will receive $2,000 each this school year, 
UCI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fellowship program is being funded by a $50,000 grant from the Newport 
Beach-based foundation, and is expected to help a total of 13 graduate students 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in sponsoring this fellowship is twofold: to financially assist 
deserving students and to play an important role in (the Graduate School of 
Management's) efforts to increase the numbers of Hispanic students in MBA and 
Ph.D. programs," said Thomas C. Sutton, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
Saavedra said the fellowship will allow him to "concentrate on my studies 
instead of ways to meet expenses for school." 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old San Leandro man quit his job as a facilities engineer for 
Citicorp Savings to attend UC Berkeley, where he got a degree in manufacturing 
engineering. He is specializing in operations research at UCI and hopes to run 
his own business. 
</P>
<P>
Modregon, 25, of Buena Park, said that in addition to the money provided by the 
fellowship, she was pleased to play a part in the program's minority 
recruitment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of minorities have to struggle to reach the graduate level because of 
finances and the lack of role models in their disciplines," said Modregon, who 
got a bachelor's degree in business administration at Cal State Fullerton. At 
UCI, she is specializing in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Saavedra and Modregon each will receive an additional $2,000, and 
three more graduate students entering the fellowship program will receive the 
same amount, a UCI spokeswoman said. The program will run through the 1995 
school year.

STUDENTS BAKING COOKIES FOR TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handful of Talbert Middle School students have been staying after school 
recently, but not as punishment for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lorraine Leavitt's two home economics classes spent their afternoons 
baking hundreds of applesauce cookies to send to troops in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have been in their place," said 12-year-old Melissa Avalos, a 
seventh-grader. "I feel sorry for them because they don't have cookies or 
anything, and they're probably going to be there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt said the students voted to forgo making French toast and scrambled eggs 
for themselves to buy the ingredients for the cookies. Although some of the 
students did not want to give up their own goodies, the majority ruled, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cookies were baked with a special recipe to withstand the desert heat. 
Chocolate chips, for example, would become very messy, Leavitt said, and the 
cookies might disintegrate into a pile of crumbs by the time they made it 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The cookies baked by the Talbert students contain no eggs and are dense. They 
are flavored with cinnamon, raisins and pecans. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a very firm cookie," Leavitt said. "Somebody said they'd make a good 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
The students wrapped the cookies this week in cellophane wrap, placed them in 
plastic foam meat trays donated by a local supermarket and packed them in a 
large box. 
</P>
<P>
The school's student council has agreed to pay for mailing the cookies to 
Operation Cookie in La Mesa in San Diego County, which will forward them to the 
Persian Gulf. SHANNON SANDS

ERROR CONCEDED, BUT BALLOT WON'T CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The county registrar of voters admits he goofed by letting Saddleback Valley 
school board appointee Roberta Cline list herself as a "governing board member" 
on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But Registrar Donald Tanney said it's too late to change it. 
</P>
<P>
Cline, who was appointed to the school board on July 11, did not inform Tanney 
that she was an appointee when she requested the incumbent designation, he 
said. But school district officials previously had notified the registrar's 
office of Cline's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we made an error here in this department," Tanney said. 
"We had knowledge she was appointed; my staff should not have allowed her to 
use the governing board member designation." 
</P>
<P>
But with the election just five weeks away, it's too late to reprint the 
ballots. The county will issue a public notice correcting the error, and county 
lawyers are trying to determine if the county is liable for the error, Tanney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Registrar officials discovered the mistake after school board candidate Charles 
Wall charged that Cline had violated district election laws and was falsely 
representing herself as an incumbent by using the title. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who was appointed just a few months before the election should not 
have an unfair advantage over the rest of the challengers," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cline said she had never heard of the ordinance and was told by the 
registrar employees to use the title. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I want to mislead anyone," Cline said. Ironically, Cline 
recently received a joint endorsement along with Wall from the district's 
classified employees union. But Cline said she hopes that the endorsement will 
not pair her with Wall in voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to distance myself from (Wall's) campaign. I'm concerned about a 
negative approach from someone who hasn't shown a great deal of involvement in 
the schools up to this point." CHERYLANNE BEALER

D.A. REVIEWING PANEL APPOINTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is reviewing a complaint that the 
City Council acted improperly in appointing Mark Murphy to the city Planning 
Commission last month. 
</P>
<P>
The review is the second this week by the district attorney's office concerning 
the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice L. Evans said his office was 
also considering a complaint that Don Greek, a City Council candidate and 
former planning commissioner, violated state conflict of interest codes while 
serving on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who replaced Greek on the commission, was appointed by the council 
Sept. 18 despite the protests of residents who said that Murphy had missed the 
Sept. 4 filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Following an investigation by the city attorney's office, the council voted 
unanimously to confirm the appointment. Mayor Don E. Smith told residents at 
the time that Murphy's resume had been "lost in the shuffle" but had actually 
been on file for months. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna Crandall said her office had received a request to 
"look into that particular appointment" and the procedures that led to the 
council's selection. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed with the district attorney alleges that Murphy's resume was 
not received by the city clerk's office until Sept. 7, three days after the 
filing deadline. The complaint also states that a City Council agenda made 
available to the public on Sept. 6 already listed the appointment of Murphy, 
though his resume was not received until the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Rahn, a Planning Commission candidate, was one of the residents who 
protested the selection process. "If we were in a competitive bidding 
situation, his bid would've been thrown out for being late and delinquent," 
Rahn said. 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy contends that the city clerk's office has kept a copy of his resume 
in its "skills file" for some time and called the complaint a "classic 
misunderstanding of the process." 
</P>
<P>
"It's no different than any other position that I've been appointed to," said 
Murphy, who has also served on the city's Centennial Commission and the 
Community Video Advisory Board. "All I know is that I followed the rules." 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Marilyn Jensen said candidates for appointed positions are often 
pulled from the skills file and that Murphy, who is a senior sales 
representative for the Apollo Systems Division of Hewlett-Packard in Irvine, 
was not required to submit an updated resume to be eligible for the post. 
</P>
<P>
When Murphy did submit an update, it was "buried under a stack of papers" in 
the city manager's office until it surfaced Sept. 7, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who protested the selection process complained that not all 
candidates were considered equally and that Murphy's appointment was a reward 
for serving as campaign manager for Councilman Gene Beyer, who is running for 
mayor. MARY HELEN BERG

HOMEOWNER IS STUCK WITH SKUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerry Schaffner believes there is a skunk under the deck of his house near the 
San Juan Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Although he hasn't actually seen it, he says he can tell it's a skunk by the 
cat-sized hole it keeps digging in the ground. Schaffner knows the telltale 
signs: Before he moved here two years ago, four of the critters took up 
residence at various times under the porch of his home in Dana Point. One even 
delivered babies. 
</P>
<P>
On those occasions, Schaffner trapped the skunks and called in county animal 
control officers to euthanize them and cart off the remains. 
</P>
<P>
But this time county officers won't come anywhere near. 
</P>
<P>
As of Aug. 1, skunks were removed from the county's list of animals routinely 
killed upon capture. Even though the animals pose a high risk of carrying 
rabies, it has been years since any local skunk was found to be infected with 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
So now animal control officers, mostly busy tracking down potentially rabid 
dogs, turn away the three or four calls they get each day from South County 
residents confronted by skunks. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say it is a dilemma that illustrates the increasing 
urbanization of Orange County -- wildlife on the run. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner, however, views it more as an example of government regulation run 
amok.

"I pay $3,000 in county property taxes and I don't see why I have to co-exist 
with this animal that may or may not have rabies," Schaffner complained. "I am 
caught in a Catch-22. If I trap an animal, I don't know what I would do with 
it. I don't want to keep it and they (county officials) told me if I kill it, I 
would be breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin R. Whelan, chief of field services for county animal control, said his 
officers will come to the aid of people who fear they have been sprayed or 
bitten by a skunk. But he confirms that officials are mostly concerned about 
handling domestic animals, not wildlife. With about 50 officers to cover 21 
cities and Orange County's unincorporated areas, animal control has received 
about 31,000 calls for help so far this year, the vast majority of them 
involving stray dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
The county conducts tests on trapped skunks each year to make sure there is no 
resurgence of rabies, Whelan explained, but the only wild animal that still is 
immediately killed because of its rabies risk is the bat. 
</P>
<P>
Before the skunk was removed from the so-called euthanasia list -- partly due 
to pressure from animal-rights advocates -- officers routinely killed skunks 
with chloroform. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Smith, a spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game, said the 
skunk is a "non-protected" species that may be killed at any time of the year 
under law, like other pesky birds and animals, among them English sparrows, 
coyotes, weasels, opossums, moles and rodents. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said animal control officers are happy to give residents advice on how 
to kill a skunk -- among other things, dry ice can be used to freeze the animal 
or any of several over-the-counter chemical substances can be placed in a trap. 
</P>
<P>
If Whelan chooses to relocate the skunk rather than kill it, that raises other 
problems. Regulations state that an animal may not be removed from its natural 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what that means," Schaffner scoffed. "The skunk will be back under 
the deck the next night where it is warm and dry. I know enough about skunks to 
know they are hard to get rid of and when you have one, there is a good chance 
you'll have a whole family come spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I am going to do. But I am going to have to do something," 
Schaffner said. "This is a sign of a bureaucracy at its pinnacle. They tax you 
a lot for a service and then tell you to do it yourself." GEORGE FRANK

CITY HALL GAG ORDER WINS FINAL APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has given final approval to an ordinance that prohibits 
council members, city officers or employees from publicly disclosing 
information discussed in private meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The council also unanimously passed a resolution that will exempt the city 
attorney and city manager from the new law when "necessary to perform their 
duties." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was proposed in July by Councilman Daniel E. Griset, who said he 
wanted to stop information leaks around City Hall. He particularly objected to 
"calculated" leaks that he said came from closed-door council sessions where 
sensitive personnel matters or pending litigation is discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The council holds at least two closed sessions each month before or after 
regular council meetings. Under the new law, individuals sitting in on the 
closed portion of the meeting can only disclose the content of discussions with 
permission from a majority of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was given preliminary approval by the council on Aug. 6 by a 4-3 
vote. Councilmen John Acosta, Ron May and Richards L. Norton voted against the 
measure. The votes remained the same during the final approval process this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana law is similar to one in Costa Mesa, the only other city in 
Orange County to pass a law which prohibits closed-session information from 
being discussed. GREG HERNANDEZ

CURRICULUM THAT FIGHTS DRUGS, GANGS UNVEILED 
</P>

<P>
A classroom program aimed at curbing rising drug use and gang violence among 
elementary and junior high school students was unveiled Thursday during a news 
conference and reception at the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The program, developed by the county Department of Education and dubbed Project 
YES!, for Yes to Education and Skills, is the first in the state to blend 
anti-gang and anti-drug messages into classroom curriculum, eliminating the 
need for teachers to set aside extra time to deliver prevention lessons to 
students, according to state and local education and criminal justice officials 
on hand for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate answer (to drug and gang prevention) is education," said state 
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on 
Substance Abuse, who was one of five officials who unveiled the project. "Our 
objective is to raise a clean generation of kids . . . who go beyond the slogan 
of 'Just Say No.' " 
</P>
<P>
The program includes lesson plans, teacher training manuals, audiotapes and 
videotapes and interactive computer programs to be used in third-, fifth- and 
seventh-grade classrooms. It was developed over two years under a $400,000 
grant awarded by the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning to the county 
Department of Education, which won a statewide competition to earn the grant. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson themes include "Responsible Citizenship," "Dynamics of Cultural 
Diversity," "Choices and Consequences," "Refusal Skills" and "Success and 
Achievement." Each is designed to educate youths on the pitfalls of joining 
gangs or using drugs and to heighten self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
G. Albert Howenstein Jr., executive director of the Governor's Office of 
Criminal Justice Planning, said the new curriculum has been field-tested 
throughout the state and is available for immediate use. He added that 
education officials expect it will be years before the success of the program 
is determined. 
</P>
<P>
"Changing these values is a marathon -- it's not a sprint," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Education's Media Services Unit will distribute the 
curriculum in a kit at a cost of $299 per grade or $800 for all three grades. 
</P>
<P>
County Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson said the funds should cover the cost of 
packaging and distribution and that any excess money will be used to develop a 
similar curriculum for second-, fourth- and sixth-graders. He added that grades 
three, five and seven were initially chosen because developers of the program 
wanted to reach both younger children and junior-high school students, but 
there was not enough money available to fund more than three grades. 
</P>
<P>
Not Peterson, Howenstein or any of the other state and local officials at the 
news conference were able to provide specific figures on the annual cost of the 
program, despite repeated questioning. Howenstein would say only that the 
project would be funded through a combination of state money allocated for 
drug-prevention programs and federal anti-drug funds administered through the 
state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 local civic leaders, politicians, law enforcement personnel and 
educators were invited to the board room of the County Department of Education 
for the announcement of the program. The audience viewed a videotaped overview 
of the program and heard remarks from a host of officials before being treated 
to an outdoor reception. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Howenstein and Seymour, Peterson was flanked on stage by Robert 
Philibosian, chairman of the California Council on Criminal Justice, and state 
Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk). Each took time to praise Peterson's 
involvement in the program and deliver congratulatory messages from Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the program comes just one month before the November 
election, in which Peterson faces his toughest challenge in his 24 years as 
superintendent from challenger John F. Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the timing of the announcement of the new program was 
coincidental to the upcoming election but added, "It is fortunate it occurs 
now, I admit."

28 HOSPITALS SERVING THE POOR ASK TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of major cuts in government funding, all 28 hospitals that take care of 
the county's indigent have notified county officials that they want to 
renegotiate their contracts, which means many of them may stop providing 
indigent care. 
</P>
<P>
The notification is the latest move in the escalating problem of providing 
health care to the poor in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In August, despite impassioned pleas from doctors, the County Board of 
Supervisors cut the 1990-91 budget of the Indigent Medical Services program by 
about 55%, an amount expected to reach $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the chief negotiator for the 28 hospitals mailed letters to Tom 
Uram, director of the County Health Care Agency, and Supervisor Don R. Roth, 
chairman of the board, saying that the county now has 60 days to negotiate a 
new contract with each hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospitals in the Indigent Medical Services program provide health care to 
24,000 "working poor" who do not qualify for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Uram and Roth were unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said Thursday that if the county doesn't offer more money, the hospitals must 
either absorb major financial losses, cut back services or drop out of the 
indigent-care system. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe by the end of the 60-day period, at least several of the hospitals 
will drop out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's payments to the hospitals dropped by 45% in August and September. 
Under the terms of the existing contract, whenever the payments drop by more 
than 5%, the hospitals can force the county to renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced payments to the hospitals were the result of a state budget cut for 
which the county supervisors refused to compensate with extra local funding. 
The supervisors said they had too little money to go around, forcing them to 
say no to the health-care providers. The total county budget is $3.39 billion, 
a $320-million increase from last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is Orange County has never really funded health care," Langness 
said. "The county doesn't put any of its own money into it." 
</P>
<P>
Russ Inglish, Orange County vice president of the hospital council, said that 
the number of hospitals that drop out of the indigent-care system will depend 
on what new payments or conditions the county health agency offers over the 
next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"This has the potential for having a major effect on the indigent public," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If hospitals drop out, the indigent would face longer lines at clinics and 
fewer services. Doctors worry that it could cause an increase in infectious 
diseases such as measles. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some hospitals may close their emergency rooms, an impact that would be 
felt by all residents, not just the poor, Inglish said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at UCI Medical Center in Orange, which provided care to 10,000 
indigent people last year, estimate that the hospital could lose $4 million in 
the next year as a result of the budget cuts.

2 FAST-FOOD ROBBERS NOW PREY ON MARKETS 
</P>

<P>
Two men suspected of robbing at least 30 fast-food restaurants in the Southland 
during the past five months have apparently started holding up supermarkets and 
drugstores, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same (mode of operation), same suspect description, and same weapons 
being used," Police Sgt. Terry Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
The lastest robbery occurred Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. at a Thrifty Drug Store in 
Buena Park when two men burst into the store, pointed handguns and demanded 
that all eight customers lay on the floor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gunmen took an employee to the back room and told him to open the 
safe, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told the employee, 'If you don't get it right the first time, I'll kill 
you.' The employee said he was pretty nervous but was able to get it open on 
the first try," Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other gunman made another employee open up the cash registers, 
Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fled with about $700, he said. No shots were fired, and no one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the same gunmen robbed an Albertson's Food Center in the 
same area about a month ago, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have had problems catching the gunmen because of their "takeover" style 
of holdups. The gunmen are usually in and out of a store "in a matter of 
minutes," Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
Branum said the gunmen should be considered very dangerous. "It doesn't take 
much to set them off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the gunmen confined their activities to fast-food restaurants. 
During those robberies, they would enter the establishment, order customers to 
the floor and raid the cash registers. Such robberies have been reported mostly 
in Buena Park and Cypress, but have also occurred in La Mirada, Downey, Santa 
Fe Springs, Norwalk and Bellflower in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Police have only sketchy descriptions of the gunmen. In most of the robberies, 
a chrome handgun and a blue steel handgun have been used.

AIDS-STRICKEN TEACHER REMEMBERED AS A HERO;

MEMORIAL: STUDENTS, FAMILY AND FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO VINCENT L. CHALK, WHO 
FOUGHT TO STAY IN THE CLASSROOM.

Vincent L. Chalk, the Irvine teacher with AIDS whose battle to stay in the 
classroom established rights for other patients, was remembered Thursday as a 
hero to his students and an inspiration to family and friends who paid a final 
tribute to his life in an emotional memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people packed the Stricklin/Snively Mortuary, where many 
personally delivered tearful eulogies of the University High School teacher of 
the hearing impaired who died Tuesday of complications from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught great things to all the children in high school," said University 
High graduate Antonio Daverso, 20, who delivered a eulogy in sign language and 
was interpreted for the gathering. "We all miss him and love him so much. We 
have many, many memories. No matter what, he was there for us. We always looked 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
Donny Jacobs, 15, a freshman at University High, lingered long after the 
services had ended, helping to comfort fellow students who had gathered near 
the front of the chapel to admire a photographic display of their teacher. The 
photographs were placed against a backdrop of floral arrangements near the 
chapel's small wooden podium. 
</P>
<P>
During the memorial, Jacobs described Chalk as a mentor who helped others 
overcome their handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to have known him," Jacobs said. "Vince was a good teacher. I can't 
express how much he meant to University High School." 
</P>
<P>
Public attention was called to Chalk's life and career in 1987 during a legal 
battle to keep his position as a teacher in the hearing impaired program. 
Chalk's lawsuit against the Orange County Department of Education resulted in a 
landmark court ruling protecting the job security of AIDS patients in 
government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Vince kept us all aware that we were there to learn, even as adults," said 
Carol Rowland, head of University High's program for the hearing impaired. "The 
strength that he had -- he always followed through. He was always there for the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
In her brief remarks during the service, Rowland recalled a time at a meeting 
of parents and teachers when she became upset and walked into an empty hallway 
with tears in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up behind me, turned me around, put his hands on my shoulders and 
said: 'Stop that! Stop that! Now, go in there and show 'em your stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rowland said she believed that the students were managing to deal with the 
loss. "The kids are good. They are OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who took their turns at the podium included Chalk's sisters, Cindy Haag 
and Jodi Venable, who presented a poem they believed best described their 
brother's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Death is nothing at all," Haag read. "I have only slipped away into the next 
room. I am I. You are you. Whatever we were to each other, we are still." 
</P>
<P>
The service ended with a dramatic sign interpretation of Bette Midler's song, 
"Wind Beneath My Wings."

ERIC DAVIS MISJUDGES FLY BALL, AND REDS DROP THE OPENER, 4-3; 
</P>
<P>
NL PLAYOFFS: VAN SLYKE'S DRIVE GOES OVER LEFT FIELDER'S HEAD, ALLOWING THE 
PIRATES TO SCORE THE DECISIVE RUN.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Davis has spent much of the last seven summers in the Riverfront Stadium 
outfield. He knows the walls and corners and warning track like a homeowner 
knows which doors creak. 
</P>
<P>
So it was quite a surprise Thursday night when, in the seventh inning of a tie 
game in the opener of the National League championship series, the Reds' left 
fielder misplayed a drive to left by Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke, turning it 
into an RBI ground-rule double that gave the Pirates a 4-3 victory over 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I misjudged it," Davis said quietly afterward. "I was playing shallow and the 
ball was hit harder than I thought and I just misjudged it." 
</P>
<P>
From the emptiness in Davis' voice and stare, he has not misjudged what this 
loss has done to the Reds. Even though they trail only one game to none in this 
best-of-seven series, their championship hopes could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Before 52,911 at Riverfront Stadium, they scored three runs in the first 
inning, then blew the lead with their best pitcher, Jose Rijo, on the mound. 
Then they lost the game because of their best defensive player, a three-time 
defending Gold Glove winner. 
</P>
<P>
As if that wasn't enough, the game ended because the Reds could not score in 
the ninth inning even though their first two runners reached base. 
</P>
<P>
With Todd Benzinger on second and Davis on first, Ron Oester bunted but forced 
Benzinger at third, pinch-runner Billy Bates was thrown out on the back end of 
a double steal attempt and Chris Sabo was struck out by Ted Power to end the 
game . 
</P>
<P>
"When we were down 3-0, with Rijo pitching, I really thought we didn't have 
much of a chance," Van Slyke said. "I don't think anybody in the stadium 
thought we had much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is something we have been doing all year. Somewhere, somehow, we 
believe we can pull it out." 
</P>
<P>
Even in unbelievable fashion, which is what happened after an RBI triple by 
Jose Lind in the third inning and Sid Bream's two-run homer in the fourth 
inning tied the score, 3-3. The Pirates might have known something good was 
going to happen, since they were 15-0 during the regular season when Bream 
homered. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh, Gary Redus, batting for winning pitcher Bob Walk, 
hit a one-out single up the middle against reliever Norm Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
With Jeff King batting, Redus stole second. After King flied out, Charlton 
pitched around Jay Bell, walking him to bring up Van Slyke, who was hitless in 
three at-bats with two strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' coaches instructed Davis to play Van Slyke shallow. So Davis moved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"I understood it, with a quick runner on second," Davis said. "It was a good 
move." 
</P>
<P>
On the second pitch, Van Slyke hit a fly ball to left, and everyone assumed the 
inning was over. 
</P>
<P>
"We all turned to grab our gloves and go back to the field," Barry Bonds said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a fly ball," Charlton said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the stadium apparently knew where it was. Except Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I rounded first and saw him backpedaling and I thought, 'Man, maybe he's in 
trouble,' " Van Slyke said. "As an outfielder, you are taught never to 
backpedal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Davis: "After my third step, I knew I was in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
He ran back, back . . . then realized that he could not get back far enough. 
All he could do was turn and watch the ball bounce on the warning track and 
over the fence, scoring Redus. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was on second base, I heard them calling him to move in," Redus said of 
Davis. "I guess that move kind of backfired." 
</P>
<P>
Davis showed no reaction after the play, simply patting his glove and returning 
to his position. In deeper left field. 
</P>
<P>
"What did you want me to do, stand there and rub my head on my shoulder?" Davis 
asked. "Ten times out of 10, I catch that ball. One hundred times out of 100, I 
catch that. Just tonight, I misjudged it." 
</P>
<P>
He has played fewer games in left field this season, 55, than center field, 66. 
But he would not use that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Said Van Slyke: "A slicing ball by a left-handed hitter off a left-handed 
pitcher to left field, coming right at the fielder -- that's the hardest play 
in baseball, if you ask me." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis would also not use that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I misjudged the ball -- that's what you can write," he pleaded. "Nothing else, 
none of those other things. If I make that catch, nobody asks me about those 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
Davis properly noted that the ninth-inning throw to second base by Pirate 
catcher Mike LaValliere might have been nearly as important. 
</P>
<P>
With Davis on second and pinch-runner Bates on first and one out, Davis knew he 
had to get to third before Sabo took any swings. That way, a fly ball could tie 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pirates, who had a conference with just-entered reliever Power, knew it 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"On the mound I told Jim (Leyland, Pirate manager) that if Davis got a good 
jump going to third, I was going to throw to second base," LaValliere said. 
"It's something you don't do very often, but sometimes you don't have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
"When Power lifted his leg to go into his windup and I saw Eric take off, I had 
to throw to second." 
</P>
<P>
The gamble paid off. Davis reached third, but it didn't much matter because 
Bates was thrown out at second. And Davis was stranded on third by Sabo's 
game-ending strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important play of the game for them," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Although in an odd way, the Pirates' true hero may have been Walk. By the time 
he had thrown his first 18 pitches, the Pirates trailed, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this thing was going to be a nightmare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first Red batter, Barry Larkin, walked on five pitches. Billy Hatcher laid 
a perfect bunt down the first-base line, then Hal Morris singled to left, 
scoring Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
Davis then lined a ball into the right-field corner. Morris scored and Bobby 
Bonilla bobbled the ball, allowing Davis to take third. Paul O'Neill then 
doubled to right-center, scoring Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds had won 39 of 52 games this season when they scored in the first 
inning. Leyland came to the mound, there were relievers working in the bullpen, 
and Walk was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Here I am, not even going to get out of the first inning,' " Walk 
said. "In the first game of the playoffs, on national television even. Oh man." 
</P>
<P>
But Walk gave up only one hit and allowed two baserunners over the next five 
innings to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through this before. I knew if I could get through the first inning, 
I would be OK," Walk said. "I always win ugly." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds can only hope they don't always lose this ugly, although today at 
12:18 p.m. PDT, it could get worse. Doug Drabek, the favorite to win the Cy 
Young Award, pitches for the Pirates against struggling Tom Browning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still OK," Davis said. "It's not a two-game series, is it?" 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: FOR ONE NIGHT, AT LEAST, NOBODY IN NHL IS BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the last period of the hockey season is anything like the first period, the 
Kings can go get fitted for rings. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing Bruce McNall would rather be doing next May than be having 
breakfast at Tiffany's when the Stanley Cup playoffs come to an end. But like 
the rest of us, about all Bruce the Boss can do for now is sit back and watch 
and wonder whether another long season will end with another Los Angeles loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the Inglewood season opener Thursday night between the has-been New York 
Islanders and the wanna-be Kings, there was more than just a chill in the air. 
There was hope. Playing shot-a-minute hockey in those 20 minutes, the Kings 
outhustled and outmuscled the Islanders, setting the tone for what turned out 
to be a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky lit the first red light -- which, if I am not mistaken, has been 
written into the National Hockey League charter as mandatory. King Wayne, who 
leads the Kings in goals, assists and autobiographies, got another goal and an 
assist later in the game, christening the new season with his aluminum-shaft 
stick, Excalibur. 
</P>
<P>
It was the start of his 13th NHL season and the end of an interesting 
off-season for Gretz. A horse he owns ran first in a million-dollar race, and a 
book he co-wrote with Rick Reilly had some very interesting things to say about 
the Edmonton Oilers, who have not as yet dismantled the statue of Gretzky that 
sits outside their arena. 
</P>
<P>
What interests Wayne most is where the Oilers and Kings will be at season's 
end. As part of an apparent plan to spot Los Angeles a handicap, similar to 
horse racing, Edmonton is now doing without Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey, 
Jimmy Carson and Grant Fuhr, and is considering a request that Mark Messier 
play with one glove tied behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
The poor little rinky-dink Kings are bound to make it to the Cup finals one of 
these seasons, so how about this season? They close the regular season March 31 
at Calgary, and then the fun starts. Or at least that's the general idea. 
</P>
<P>
While there were hardly wholesale changes on the King roster, the Forum crowd 
Thursday was introduced to Rob Blake, the hotshot 20-year-old defenseman, who 
found himself on a line with Gretzky, Tomas Sandstrom, Luc Robitaille and Steve 
Duchesne at the time of the season's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
Blake is so young that I'll bet Larry Robinson could call him "Toe" without the 
kid understanding why. Robinson, who has a son in college, found himself in the 
same pairing Thursday with Blake, which probably made Larry feel a little like 
Ken Griffey Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings continue to have as many old faces as new, they did use 
rookie winger Francois Breault. Now there's a name for a hockey player. Hockey 
players should all be named Francois and Marcel and Jean-Hyphen-something, if 
you ask me. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings wasted no time putting Blake to work, using him on a power play 41 
seconds into the game, when Rich Pilon of the Islanders decided the season was 
never too young to start tripping people. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes from the end of the first period, the Islanders found themselves 
being outshot, 18-3. That's how frisky the Kings were on opening night. They 
made Tom Webster a happy coach on his birthday, playing with zest and 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
But do they have what it takes to go to the Land Beyond Alberta, or is this 
going to be another of those years when Edmonton or Calgary get to have all the 
fun? The Kings have the greatest player in the game, a generally reliable 
goalie, a team plane worthy of Wonder Woman and an entire season, presumably, 
with Sandstrom and Tony Granato at their disposal, which might make King fans 
forget Bernie Nicholls by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
What they need most to do is be as aggressive on the last day of March as they 
were in the first week of October. Nobody ever accused the Kings of being 
violent cross-checkers or vicious defensemen. They can't just outshoot 
everybody and leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
We shall see. It is only October, and the outlook for winter is bright. Now is 
the season of our content.

As King General Manager Rogie Vachon stared intently at the Forum ice Thursday 
night in the final period of his team's 4-1 opening-night victory over the New 
York Islanders, a fan yelled, "Relax, Rogie! You're looking good." 
</P>
<P>
It may be a little early to relax. Or to form any lasting judgments. 
</P>
<P>
But there can be no argument that the Kings looked good in their 1990-91 debut 
before a sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't only the strong offensive effort. Or the two goals by Wayne Gretzky. 
Or his three points. 
</P>
<P>
Those are to be expected from an offensive powerhouse like the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
No, it was the defensive effort that brought a smile to the face of Coach Tom 
Webster. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the summer planning a new, conservative, stay-at-home defensive game 
plan and the autumn implementing it in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
But until Thursday, he couldn't say for sure whether it would work. 
</P>
<P>
But work it did, at least against the Islanders, admittedly no longer among the 
NHL's scoring machines. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings outshot New York, 44-29, and the Islanders' only goal, scored by 
Derek King, was inadvertently tipped in by the Kings' Kelly Hrudey and Larry 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the preseason talk about the new-look defense centered on 20-year-old 
Rob Blake, touted as a rookie of the year candidate. 
</P>
<P>
He did nothing to disappoint Thursday, playing solid defense and getting a pair 
of assists on power plays while demonstrating a level of poise unexpected from 
someone appearing in his 13th NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a serious candidate (for top rookie honors)," said King owner 
Bruce McNall. "He plays great defense. He gets points. He's everything." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with such praise, Blake simply lowers his head sheepishly and stares 
at the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to make the team," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
For all the concern about the Kings' defense heading into the season, it was 
the offense that struggled to get into gear at the start. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings missed their first 13 shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
And they needed a two-man first-period advantage to finally break through. 
</P>
<P>
With Rich Pilon in the New York penalty box for hooking and Jeff Finley for 
cross-checking, Blake, in the left circle, backhanded a pass to Luc Robitaille 
in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille nearly blew the scoring opportunity, shoveling the puck directly 
into the path of a New York defenseman in front of the net, but it caromed off 
the defenseman's skate to the right corner where Gretzky was perched all alone. 
</P>
<P>
With nine seconds remaining on the two-man advantage, Gretzky slammed home the 
Kings' first goal of the season at the 12:40 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first period, the Kings had run up an 18-3 shot advantage. 
</P>
<P>
They increased their lead to 2-0 in the second period. Bob Kudelski, carrying 
the puck down the right side, froze Pilon with a fancy move and fired a shot 
that goalie Glenn Healy blocked. But the puck came back to Kudelski, who sent 
it across the middle to Scott Bjugstad on the opposite side. Bjugstad 
backhanded the puck past a diving Healy 4:02 into the period. 
</P>
<P>
At the 18:46 mark, Gretzky got his second goal when his shot from the middle of 
the right circle on a power play ricocheted off defenseman Joe Reekie and past 
a helpless Healy. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Granato scored the final goal of the game with an assist from Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Blake was asked what he would have thought a year ago when he 
was still playing collegiate hockey at Bowling Green if he had been told 
Gretzky would be calling him one of the NHL's top rookies 12 months later. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't even answer," he said. "I'd just walk away and shake my head." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Blake had a lot of Kings nodding their heads, as if to say, "I 
told you so." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have bought out the termination contract of right wing Keith Crowder, 
ending his one-year stay with the club. . . . Cortisone shots have given 
defenseman Tom Laidlaw new hope in his struggle to return to the ice. Out since 
March 17 because of a back problem, Laidlaw has been pain-free since taking the 
shots. He's hoping to start contact drills in a couple of weeks and be back in 
the lineup by November. A few weeks ago, Laidlaw, 32, thought his career might 
be over. "I've love to play another 10 years," he said. "If not, I have to get 
on with my life" . . . Defensemen Brian Benning began his three-game suspension 
Thursday, the punishment for his cross check on Jari Kurri in the 
Kings-Edmonton Oilers record-setting brawl Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
New York goalie Mark Fitzpatrick is expected to be released from Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center today after undergoing a biopsy for a swelling 
condition believed to be caused by a virus. . . . Pat LaFontaine, the 
Islanders' top scorer last season, was in the lineup Thursday after refusing to 
play in the team's final two exhibition games. LaFontaine, who will earn 
$450,000 this season with an option year left on his contract, is believed to 
be asking for a $4-million, six-year deal.

AUTRY REDUCES PORT'S ROLE WITH THE ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER A DISAPPOINTING SEASON, OWNER NAMES RICHARD M. BROWN PRESIDENT 
AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than 24 hours after the end of a disappointing season, the Angels 
restructured their front office Thursday by appointing Richard M. Brown as the 
club's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
The move significantly reduces the role of Mike Port, executive vice president 
and general manager. Port, who will report to Brown, remains in charge of 
baseball operations, but he will no longer be the chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
In hiring Brown, owner Gene Autry relinquished a portion of his 
responsibilities. Autry had been president and chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Autry said he and his wife, Jackie, the club's executive vice 
president, had interviewed several candidates for the position before deciding 
on Brown, who has been on the Angels' board of directors since 1986 and the 
club's legal counsel since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Brown will oversee the entire organization and report to Autry, who remains 
chairman of the board. Brown is expected to assume his new duties on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be taking over the corporate responsibilities, the promotions, the 
ticket sales and television contracts," Brown said. "Mike is still the general 
manager and is responsible for baseball operations. He will still be handling 
the scouting and player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"My responsibilities will include a portion of the demands previously handled 
by Mr. and Mrs. Autry and a portion of the corporate administrative duties 
handled by Mike (Port)." 
</P>
<P>
Dan O'Brien (senior vice president for baseball operations), Bill Bavasi 
(director of minor league operations) and Bob Fontaine Jr. (director of 
scouting) will continue to operate in those capacities, but their decisions 
will be approved by Brown, not Port. 
</P>
<P>
Port will now have to clear all trades and other transactions through Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a demotion," said Stan Schneider, a member of the board of directors 
who was involved in selecting Brown as president. 
</P>
<P>
Port has been general manager since 1984 and was promoted to vice president and 
chief operating officer in 1988. He also is on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"With my corporate responsibilities, I have sometimes been stretched thin," 
Port said. "The baseball end hasn't suffered, but sometimes the administrative 
end has. My background is in baseball. I will now be responsible for only the 
product on the field." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who contended for the American League West Division title in 1989, 
finished fourth this season, 23 games behind the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the blame for that reversal was placed on Port. 
</P>
<P>
Port's only significant move during the off-season was the signing of free 
agent pitcher Mark Langston. Even that backfired; Langston finished with a 
10-17 record. 
</P>
<P>
When the Angels got off to a poor start this season, Port did make deals for 
outfielders Luis Polonia and Dave Winfield. However, he was criticized for 
allowing Willie McGee of the St. Louis Cardinals to clear waivers. 
</P>
<P>
McGee, who won the National League batting title, went to the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reich, agent for Lance Parrish, Brian Downing and three other Angel 
players, said he had been hearing rumors that more dire consequences were in 
store for Port and O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been some heat directed at Port by the Autrys," Reich said. "This is a 
big corporation and the baseball team is just a part of the corporation, and I 
think the nature of running a baseball team in this era requires the exclusive 
attention of guys like Mike (Port) and Dan (O'Brien). 
</P>
<P>
"If the reduction of his authority is a product of the Langston deal 
specifically or the disappointing year of the team generally, then I think it's 
unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Player agent Alan Meersand also expects the Angels' front office shuffle to 
have little effect on contract talks involving his clients, pitcher Bob McClure 
and infielder Kent Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen why it's been done," Meersand said. "I don't know 
Richard Brown from Governor Brown. I don't know what he's going to do and I 
don't know how it's going to change Mike Port's role. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with that as long as he (Brown) knows something about 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Port will still be responsible for player transactions, trades and 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I may ask Mike to fill a need on the team, but he will be the one making the 
deals," Brown said. "He will then bring it to me. Myself and the Autrys will 
make the final decision." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's announcement was the Angels' second front office move in the past 
month. On Sept. 12, Michael Schreter resigned from the board of directors to 
join a private investment and consultant company. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider said Schreter's resignation was not related to Thursday's action. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 47, said he hoped to improve communications within the organization. He 
also said he wanted to strengthen the Angels' farm system and expanded the 
club's scouting system to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said much the same thing two weeks ago, when he agreed to a 
two-year contract extension.

ANAHEIM FORECAST IS FOR GRAY SKY SUNDAY; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: AFTER MISSING FIRST THREE GAMES, BIG-PLAY CORNERBACK RETURNS TO LEAD 
DEFENSE AGAINST ESIASON AND BENGALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Try as they might to put his absence out of their minds, Ram defenders learned 
too well in the last few weeks just how dependent they are on Gray's anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the first three games without Jerry Gray, a four-time Pro Bowl 
cornerback, the Ram defensive unit has been playing rudderless football, 
falling easy prey to offenses exploiting the void. 
</P>
<P>
No Jerry Gray meant no big-play man in the secondary, unless you count his 
replacement, Mickey Sutton, who unfortunately for him, is 5-feet-8 on his 
tippy-toes and seemed to trigger big plays against the Rams, not for them. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are clearly relieved that Gray's injured knee is strong enough for him 
to play Sunday at Anaheim Stadium against the Cincinnati Bengals, a team with 
as imaginative and dangerous an offense as there is in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jerry was injured, it hurt us just thinking, 'Well, Jerry's not out 
here,' " safety Anthony Newman said. "We had to go out and play ball, but just 
the sight of seeing Jerry over there at corner or wherever he's at, that feels 
good because we know we've got a player there. Mickey did real well at the 
corner spot, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But Sutton is not Gray. With Sutton in there, the Rams had to shift a lot of 
help to his side, leaving the other cornerback, Bobby Humphery, to fend for 
himself more than they liked, resulting in two touchdown passes thrown against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Without Gray, the Ram defense got stretched beyond comfort, beyond normal 
defensive limits, beyond control. 
</P>
<P>
This defense is too fragile, too deeply planned around his capabilities and 
authoritative presence to lose Gray without major complications. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you have a good corner, a guy you have confidence in who will be 
out there and can cover, it lets you do some other things with other parts of 
your defense in terms of saying, 'Hey, he handles that part. We'll put the help 
somewhere else,' " defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Rams come out of this Gray-less period 1-2, expecting his return to be 
both the emotional and physical boost to push them back to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a kind of a rallying thing, a confidence, a security, 
something there that helps you in crisis, particularly (against) the long pass, 
the play that he can make," Coach John Robinson said of Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"(In) the Redskin (exhibition) game before he goes out, zoom, he intercepts a 
pass for a touchdown. Those things don't happen all that much, but it's nice to 
have happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are careful not to say that everything wrong with their defense this 
season was that Gray was missing and they were missing him. That's too much 
responsibility to pin on anybody, Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur and Robinson talk about the defensive problems in more general terms, 
about linebacker Kevin Greene and defensive tackle Doug Reed finally wiping 
away the rust of their long holdouts and the younger players getting the 
experience to emerge as impact players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't afford myself the luxury of saying, 'Well, if I had another guy or 
whatever,' " Shurmur said. "When it's over, it's over and you go onto the next 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're at the next phase now, and I think we're a better team than we were 
a week ago. Jerry's with us, we've healed some guys up, some of the guys who 
missed training camp have had a couple weeks of practice. I think all those 
things give us a chance to be a better defensive team this week." But the 
coaches also talked about the missing big plays, which they knew Gray might 
have been there to make. In the one game the Rams won, they got their big 
defensive play of the year, a 44-yard touchdown return of an interception by 
Humphery against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
And with games against the Green Bay Packers and the Philadelphia Eagles on the 
line, without Gray, who has 19 interceptions in his career, the big play did 
not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we played good enough to win all three games, but we haven't made any 
plays in order to help ourselves," said Gray, who for the first time in his 
six-year career has been able to watch the defense from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played good enough, but when it comes down to it, you have to make 
plays. It comes down to maybe five, six or seven plays a game, and if you make 
them, you win." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said he understands that his move back into the lineup, just in time to 
defend against the aerial bombs of Boomer Esiason, should give his teammates a 
psychological push. "I hope so," he said. "I think just the emotion, getting 
the guys going and them seeing I'm trying to do the things I could do before I 
got hurt. I think it means a lot to a defense." 
</P>
<P>
Said Newman: "(Gray) is our quarterback back there. He knows what's happening, 
he can communicate. He can tell us what's going to happen before we even see 
it."

BELL NOT TALKING MUCH ABOUT BILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
Tailback Greg Bell, a former Bill, declined to give his old team any bulletin 
board material for the Raiders' Sunday night game in Buffalo. While playing for 
the Rams last season, Bell criticized the Bills, who then defeated the Rams, 
23-20, in a Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
But the normally outspoken Bell is keeping quiet this week. "It's just another 
trip," he said. "It's just another away game. It's been too many years now to 
worry about it. It's a completely different team with a whole new attitude. I'm 
still friends with a lot of those guys back there and I don't have any 
feelings. It's just going to be a hard-fought game." 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Raider defensive tackle Mike Wise, who sustained a sprained 
ankle in Sunday's 24-10 victory over the Chicago Bears, is questionable because 
of a sprained ankle, as is safety Mike Harden, who sat out the Bear game 
because of a neck injury. CHRIS BAKER

The knee injury that has sidelined Mark Rypien could be an expensive one for 
the Washington Redskins' quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien, who damaged ligaments in his left knee in a game Sept. 23, is playing 
out his option after turning down the Redskins' contract offer worth $700,000 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien had turned down a three-year, $2.4-million deal that included $600,000 
in incentives. He's playing for $275,000 this season.

ROBINSON NAMES GARY AS STARTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The inevitable is finally official. The heir has gotten the job. Cleveland 
Gary, finally sound again after back problems, Thursday was named the starting 
tailback for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He's back to where he was before he went down," Coach John Robinson said. "The 
reason we haven't played him is because if you miss a month, it takes time to 
get back to 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that although all three tailbacks -- early-season starter Curt 
Warner and Gaston Green are the others -- will play Sunday, it's likely that 
Gary will carry the load. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the Rams will put newly signed running back Marcus Dupree on 
the injured-reserve list as early as today, giving Dupree four weeks to get 
used to competitive football after a five-year layoff, and freeing a roster 
spot for the activation of cornerback Jerry Gray, who will be leaving injured 
reserve today. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the month (off) would be just about right for (Dupree)," Robinson 
said. "I think he needs more time." 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Ram receiver Aaron Cox, nursing a twitch in his right hamstring, 
did not practice Thursday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Bengal deep threat Eddie Brown probably will not suit up Sunday because of a 
knee injury suffered in Monday night's game. TIM KAWAKAMI

POSITIVE THINKING IS THE POWER BEHIND ORANGE HIGH'S REMMEL; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: PANTHERS' RUNNING BACK GAINED 1,300 YARDS LAST SEASON, BUT THIS 
YEAR, HE'S COMFORTABLE IN HIS ROLE OF BLOCKING BACK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is not a paid advertisement, it's Brian Remmel's philosophy for football. 
Read on and you too shall learn to follow the path to success. 
</P>
<P>
The power of positive thinking? Yes, that's a big part of it. Remmel is a 
regular Dr. Norman Vincent Peale with a dash of L. Ron Hubbard thrown in for 
good measure. He'd have to be, considering the dreadful state of Orange High 
School's football program when he arrived three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Selfless devotion to team? Sure. He's got that too. 
</P>
<P>
Hard work? The only way. 
</P>
<P>
Talent? About 1,300 rushing yards' worth last season. 
</P>
<P>
Discipline? Yes, sir. 
</P>
<P>
Remmel, a senior running back and linebacker, is a good high school football 
player, not the best. What sets him apart is his approach to the game. 
Self-absorption, a dominant personality trait for most adolescents, seems 
absent in Remmel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not how you do, it's how you do as a whole," he said. "If the team's not 
successful, you're not successful. The idea is to be selfless. The score will 
take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
Remmel swears he doesn't know the final score, only whether Orange has won or 
lost when he leaves the field. 
</P>
<P>
He says these things and he sounds very convincing. It never sounds like a 
sales pitch, though it easily could be one. After all, the easiest way to curry 
favor with one's coach is to run for 1,300 yards. The second easiest is to 
repeat the philosophy of one's coach over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Remmel is asked when and where he adopted his "team first, me second" attitude. 
Was he this selfless as a 9year-old playing Junior All-American football? 
</P>
<P>
He smiled, perhaps recalling a selfish moment hidden in the recesses of his 
mind, before answering. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman year we were pretty cocky," Remmel said. "Of course, we were 
undefeated, but I've always been a team player. Some guys think they're the 
whole team. They don't know what they're saying. They've got a whole team 
behind them." 
</P>
<P>
And Coach Tom Meiss, not Peale or Hubbard, has molded Remmel. 
</P>
<P>
Before Meiss, the Orange football program was down in the dumps for the better 
part of 60 years. The drought extended clear back to 1929, the last time the 
Panthers played in a Southern Section championship game. Three consecutive 
losing seasons and five victories in the last 20 games did little to signal a 
change in direction. 
</P>
<P>
Really, it was nothing a new coach, brimming with bright ideas couldn't cure. 
But Orange had tried that and it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Then the school hired Meiss last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy looks like a football coach," Remmel said. "He wears glasses, so he 
looks like he knows what he's doing. When he looks at you, he looks right into 
you. He has the mustache. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have an extra motivational piece when you have a new coach. With 
Coach Meiss, you can be fired at any time if you don't do your job. It doesn't 
matter who you are. He's the most inspirational coach I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Once when Meiss coached at Santa Ana High School, he went a little overboard 
trying to inspire his charges. The Saints were preparing for a big game against 
El Modena, which has a duck for a mascot. 
</P>
<P>
On a rainy afternoon in 1983, Meiss trudged out to practice with a shotgun, 
pumped a few blanks into the air and yelled, "Yep, it's definitely duck-hunting 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana went on to win, but school administrators weren't pleased with his 
stunt. Not long after, Meiss was looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
When he hooked on at Orange, he took a look around and saw greatness in bloom 
where others saw only weeds. 
</P>
<P>
Remmel started last season at fullback, but because of injuries he was moved to 
tailback and was brilliant. He gained 1,300 yards and helped the Panthers reach 
the Division VIII championship game against Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange lost, but Remmel exacted a bit of long-awaited revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Manning, Trabuco Hills' multitalented quarterback, returned a punt for a 
touchdown in the teams' Pacific Coast League game earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Remmel kept a picture of Manning tacked to his bedroom wall. "I swore I was 
going to get him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Remmel unloaded a sharp tackle on Manning. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Remmel has returned to fullback as part of the Panthers' 
seven-back offense. Acen Chiles has rushed for 333 yards, tops among the seven 
backs Meiss rotates. Remmel has gained 136 yards. At that rate, he'll gain 340 
yards in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, Remmel said the change doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"If you rushed for 1,300 yards last year and then you're not getting the ball, 
that's a big consideration for a high school player," Meiss said. "But you have 
to be selfless in order for the team to do well." 
</P>
<P>
So Remmel blocks so Chiles can run for touchdowns, so the team will win. 
</P>
<P>
"The yardage was nice, but without 10 other people backing you up, the yardage 
doesn't come," Remmel said. "You'll find behind every back, there's a good 
line." 
</P>
<P>
So what does the future hold for a team player such as Remmel? He has only one 
goal: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play until I can't play anymore," he said. "Until my body withers or 
somebody tells me they don't want me."

CRIMINAL TYPE HAS TOP CREDENTIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should Criminal Type be voted horse of the year despite his season-ending 
injury the other day, he will be the first horse in five years to win the award 
without having won a Breeders' Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
The last four -- Sunday Silence, Alysheba, Ferdinand and Lady's Secret -- all 
clinched their titles with Breeders' Cup victories, Lady's Secret winning the 
Distaff and the three others the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the first two years of the Breeders' Cup did winners of its races fail 
to win the national title. In 1984, John Henry was voted horse of the year 
after an injury prevented him from running in the Breeders' Cup at Hollywood 
Park. Slew o' Gold lost the Classic and the title by about half a length, 
finishing third (second after a stewards' disqualification) in that slam-bang 
finish with Wild Again and Gate Dancer, who caused the trouble through the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry edged out Slew o' Gold in one of the closest Eclipse Awards votes. 
It took a popular-vote tiebreaker to determine the winner after the Daily 
Racing Form, one of the three voting groups, had favored John Henry; the turf 
writers had sided with Slew o' Gold, and the track racing secretaries had split 
their votes. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Spend a Buck was voted horse of the year, polling 37% of the 
popular vote, even though he was retired at the end of the summer with a leg 
injury. There was a notable lack of competition for the Kentucky Derby winner. 
Proud Truth, who ran fifth in the Derby the only time he faced Spend a Buck, 
won the Breeders' Cup Classic, but still finished 34 votes behind Spend a Buck. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ferdinand won in similar style. Ferdinand, having won only three of 
nine starts, nosed out Alysheba, the Derby and Preakness winner, in the Classic 
at Hollywood Park. With 38% of the total horse of the year vote, Ferdinand was 
a narrow winner over Theatrical, the male grass champion. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type's record is much better than Ferdinand's was. The 5-year-old son 
of Alydar has won seven of 11 starts, and neither different track surfaces nor 
the rigors of travel bothered him. He was winning at Santa Anita at the start 
of the year, he won at Pimlico in the spring and then he won twice in New York, 
sandwiching in a cross-country trip to Hollywood Park, where he disposed of 
Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Different distances have also been no problem. Criminal Type has won twice each 
at a mile and 1 1/8 miles; and once each at 1 1/16, 1 3/16 and 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The premature end to Criminal Type's season, caused by a sore ankle, has opened 
the door for other horse-of-the-year candidates, who must do more winning in 
order to impress voters. 
</P>
<P>
A horse that scores consecutive victories in Saturday's Jockey Club Gold Cup at 
Belmont Park and on Breeders' Cup day Oct. 27 at the New York track would 
naturally get consideration. But who could that be? Sunday Silence, Easy Goer 
and Housebuster preceded Criminal Type to the sidelines, and the horses left, 
with the exception of Izvestia, the Canadian question mark, have shown no 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia will run Saturday in the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows how good he is?" says Wayne Lukas, who trains Criminal Type. "He's 
been winning big up in Canada (eight victories and a second in nine tries this 
year), but let's wait and see what he does against our horses." 
</P>
<P>
Sentimentally, many voters would like to see Go for Wand, the 3-year-old filly, 
win Sunday's Beldame at Belmont and then try to beat males in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic. Only five females have been horse of the year, the last being Lukas' 
Lady's Secret in 1986. Go for Wand, who has already clinched her division 
title, has a trainer, Billy Badgett, who is interested in running in the 
Classic, but an owner, Jane Lunger, who will have to be persuaded. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know if Go for Wand is the best female horse in the country 
yet," Lukas said. Indeed, Go for Wand would have to beat Bayakoa and Gorgeous 
in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, which may be a tougher assignment than running in 
the injury-depleted Classic. 
</P>
<P>
A forgotten horse is Summer Squall, who ran second to Unbridled in the Kentucky 
Derby. Summer Squall's redemption in the Preakness seems a long time ago, and 
although his owners were right to skip the Belmont, the decision may still cost 
him votes. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's only appearance since the Preakness was a Pennsylvania Derby 
victory, little more than a glorified workout, and he is scheduled to run in 
the Meadowlands Cup next Friday. Summer Squall needs a victory in the Classic 
at Belmont, where because of state rules he wouldn't be able to run with the 
anti-bleeding medication he requires. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Somerville, the French import who was scheduled to run in the $500,000 Oak 
Tree Invitational at Santa Anita on Saturday, died Wednesday after receiving a 
vitamin injection. "Horses get these injections 100 times a day without an 
incident," said Brad MacDonald, the American trainer who would have saddled Dr. 
Somerville for Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Invitational, the richest race of the season, has drawn a field of 11, 
including Pay the Butler and Saratoga Passage, who ran second and third, 
respectively, behind Hawkster in the stake last year. Others entered are Live 
the Dream, who could give trainer Charlie Whittingham his 10th triumph in the 
race; Valdali, Rial, Eradicate, Wajd, Delegant, Mehmetori, Marquetry and Soft 
Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess, last year's female grass champion, carries high weight of 120 
pounds, facing five opponents in the California Jockey Club Handicap at Bay 
Meadows Saturday. There will be betting on the race at Santa Anita. . . . 
During a time when many tracks are putting more information into their 
programs, the Daily Racing Form has dropped the Belmont Park past performances 
from its Los Angeles edition. The Form is also discontinuing its Monday and 
Tuesday papers, unless there is racing at a major California track on those 
days. . . . Itsallgreektome is headed for Belmont to run in the Breeders' Cup 
Mile on Oct. 27.

HARNESS BACKERS SUE BOARD FOR POMONA DATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold and Chris Bardis, the two leading proponents of harness racing in 
California, have sued the California Horse Racing Board for racing dates at 
Fairplex Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, filed in Sacramento, Los Alamitos Racing Assn., of which Arnold 
and Bardis are owners, asks the court to overturn a decision by the CHRB that 
denies the group the right to run harness racing three nights a week at 
Fairplex between Oct. 26 and Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The CHRB denied the racing dates at the last meeting, saying that it impacted 
thoroughbred racing, which uses Fairplex as a training site. The proposal to 
race was supported by Ed Allred, who runs a quarter horse meeting at Los 
Alamitos, but a group that represents quarter horse owners and trainers opposed 
the licensing. The proposed Fairplex harness meeting would run at the same time 
as the Los Alamitos quarter horse meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the denial of a license would effectively kill harness 
racing in California as a racing and breeding proposition. It also says the Los 
Angeles County Fair, which owns Fairplex, could profit by as much as $750,000. 
The fair is guaranteed $500,000. The state would also benefit in handle. 
</P>
<P>
The case will be heard Wednesday. JOHN CHERWA

3 KEATING DEALS UNDER SCRUTINY BY FEDERAL GRAND JURY

<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. have 
identified three activities that they said are being investigated by a federal 
grand jury in Los Angeles involving the thrift's $2-billion collapse. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents released Thursday in Washington, Keating and two former 
associates were notified on Sept. 18 that they are targets of the federal 
inquiry. That was the same day Keating was jailed in Los Angeles under 
$5-million bond on separate state charges of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The documents, filed by Keating's lawyers with federal thrift regulators, 
listed three subjects of the federal criminal inquiry: the purchase of a 
Detroit hotel, the use of an employee stock option plan for alleged personal 
gain and a series of dubious land deals. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's lawyers acknowledged in court recently that he is a target of the 
federal inquiry. But the disclosure of the three specific areas of 
investigation is the first confirmation of what the grand jury is examining. 
</P>
<P>
Being identified as a target of a grand jury is not proof of wrongdoing and may 
not result in criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators have blamed Keating for the April, 1989, failure of the Irvine-based 
institution, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking a record $40.9 million in 
restitution from Keating and five associates in connection with Lincoln's 
failure. The OTS has charged in its civil action that Keating and the others 
diverted money from Lincoln through phony tax schemes and dubious land deals. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators have been pressing for a hearing on the civil charges. In a 
response filed Sept. 27, Keating's attorneys asked for a delay until the 
criminal actions against their client are complete. 
</P>
<P>
The state indictment accuses Keating and three others of victimizing investors 
who bought worthless bonds of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental 
Corp. But, according to the documents, the federal inquiry is more 
wide-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said the federal grand jury was sought in a 16-page request 
provided to the Justice Department by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which 
used to oversee thrifts. The request cited three areas of inquiry: 
</P>
<P>
* The purchase of the Hotel Pontchartrain, a downtown Detroit hotel, by a 
Lincoln subsidiary in December, 1985. The subsidiary sold it the following 
March for $38 million to a partnership consisting largely of Keating, his 
family and associates. Another Lincoln subsidiary financed the partnership's 
purchase, an action that alarmed regulators, and the hotel eventually went into 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
* A guarantee by American Continental and Lincoln of a $20-million letter of 
credit issued by Bankers Trust so American Continental's employee stock option 
plan could buy company stock. The ESOP, which also obtained a $3-million loan 
from a local bank, spent $21 million to buy American Continental stock from 
Keating, certain family members, other directors and officers, and the 
brokerage firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, which had acted as broker for much of 
Lincoln's trading in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
* The Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Co. deal, a convoluted 
arrangement in which Lincoln made loans to developer Ernest C. Garcia, who then 
loaned $3.5 million to Westcontinental, a limited partnership in which Garcia 
had an interest. Westcontinental used the money as a down payment on a 
$14-million purchase of raw desert land from Lincoln, but never repaid the 
loans. In a letter, the company asked that the property be returned to its 
rightful owner, suggesting that the partnership was a straw borrower. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, on advice of his lawyers, has refused to talk to the press. He is in 
the Los Angeles County Jail unable to post a $5-million bond while awaiting 
trial on the state charges. Previously, he has denied wrongdoing in the three 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The other two targets of the federal grand jury were identified as Judy J. 
Wischer, the former president and chief executive of Lincoln's parent company, 
and Robert J. Kielty, its former senior vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Wischer is also charged in the state indictment. Kielty is not. 
</P>
<P>
The same three transactions were part of the OTS civil complaint. As a result, 
Keating's lawyers sought a delay in the OTS hearing until the potential 
criminal charges are resolved. Citing his constitutional protection against 
self-incrimination, the lawyers said that Keating would not be able to respond 
to the OTS charges so long as the criminal actions are pending.

identified three activities that they said are being investigated by a federal 
grand jury in Los Angeles in the S&amp;L's $2-billion collapse. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents released in Washington Thursday, Keating and two former

inquiry. That was the same day Keating was jailed in Los Angeles on charges of 
state securities fraud.

The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is seeking a record $40.9 million in 
restitution from Keating and five associates in connection with Lincoln's 
failure. The OTS has charged in its civil action that Keating and the others 
diverted money from Lincoln through phony tax schemes and dubious land deals. 
</P>
<P>
But Keating now says he is broke. The papers filed with the OTS also lowered 
the estimate of Keating's negative net worth to $4 million. In August, as well 
as at a bail hearing two weeks ago, his personal accountant said Keating's 
debts exceeded his assets by $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS has been pressing for a hearing on the civil charges against Keating. 
In a response filed Sept. 27, Keating's attorneys asked for a delay until the 
criminal actions against their client are complete. 
</P>
<P>
The state indictment accuses Keating and three others of victimizing investors 
who bought worthless bonds of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental 
Corp. But, according to the documents, the federal inquiry is more 
wide-ranging. The federal grand jury is looking into alleged bank fraud, 
securities fraud and illegal political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said the federal grand jury was sought in a 16-page request 
provided to the Department of Justice by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 
which used to oversee thrifts. The request cited three areas of inquiry:

Lincoln subsidiary in December, 1985. The subsidiary sold it the following 
March for $38 million to a partnership consisting largely of Keating, his 
family and associates. Another Lincoln subsidiary funded the sale to the 
partnership, an action that alarmed regulators. The partnership refinanced the 
loan, but regulators challenged that transaction as a questionable insider 
deal. The hotel eventually went into foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has claimed that all the deals were aboveboard and that regulators were 
aware of the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
* A guarantee by American Continental and Lincoln of a $20-million letter of 
credit issued by Bankers Trust so American Continental's Employee Stock Option 
Plan could buy company stock. The ESOP, which also obtained a $3-million loan 
from a local bank, spent $21 million to buy American Continental stock from 
Keating, certain family members, other directors and officers, and the 
brokerage firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which had acted as broker for 
much of Lincoln's trading in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has claimed that he and other insiders sold stock to the ESOP at prices 
slightly below those then prevailing. He said the insiders were the only ones 
with sufficient stock to fund the ESOP. 
</P>
<P>
* The Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Co. deal, a convoluted 
arrangement in which Lincoln made loans to developer Ernest C. Garcia, who then 
loaned $3.5 million to Westcontinental, a limited partnership in which Garcia 
had an interest. Westcontinental used the money as a down payment on a 
$14-million purchase of raw desert land from Lincoln but never repaid the 
loans. In a letter, the company asked that the property be returned to its 
rightful owner, suggesting that the partnership was a straw borrower. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has testified in a federal court in Washington that his dealings were 
with Garcia and that he thought Westcontinental was simply a vehicle Garcia 
used to handle the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, the former chairman of American Continental, has refused to talk to 
the press since he was sent to Los Angeles County Jail on Sept. 18. He has been 
unable to post $5-million bond while awaiting trial on the state charges. He 
and three co-defendants are scheduled to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
The other two targets of the federal grand jury were identified as Judy J. 
Wischer, the former president and chief executive of Lincoln's parent company, 
and Robert J. Kielty, its former senior vice president and general counsel. 
Wischer is also charged in the state indictment. Kielty is not. 
</P>
<P>
The same three transactions were part of the OTS civil complaint. As a result, 
Keating's lawyers sought a delay in the OTS hearing until the potential 
criminal charges are resolved. Citing his constitutional protection against 
self-incrimination, the lawyers said that Keating would not be able to respond 
to the OTS charges so long as the criminal actions are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Keating is also one of a number of former American Continental executives named 
as defendants in a $1.1-billion civil racketeering suit brought by federal 
regulators last year. And small investors in the company who claim that he 
defrauded them out of more than $250 million have filed 17 lawsuits against 
him.

AIRLINES LIGHTEN THEIR LOADS; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE BATTLE TO TRIM HIGHER FUEL COSTS, EVEN COLORS AND COLAS COUNT.

<P>
Faced with soaring fuel costs and the threat of shortages, airlines have taken 
or are planning steps to save fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the worldwide embargo against oil from Iraq and Kuwait, the 
carriers are trying to eliminate every bit of extra weight from their planes. 
Supplies of food, soft drinks, wine and blankets are being limited. Exterior 
dirt, which slows planes, is being washed off more frequently. Lighter carpets 
and seats are being installed, and international passengers' right to carry 
duty-free items might be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Most carriers no longer paint their aircraft, cutting weight by about 300 
pounds. Airlines are considering limiting free travel for employees and 
families. There has even been a suggestion -- almost certainly facetious -- 
that crew members be required to diet to get rid of excess weight. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines are also trying to save jet fuel in other ways, such as flying 
slower and taxiing planes with some of their engines shut down. Slower flying 
could have unpopular consequences: Some flights would miss the noise-limitation 
curfews at airports, including Orange County's John Wayne and Washington's 
National. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel costs were crucial to airlines even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
They had already invested massively in more fuel-efficient aircraft and in 
on-board computers that allow flights to be planned at optimum speeds and 
altitudes as well as along the most fuel-efficient routes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Persian Gulf crisis has increased the sense of urgency. "I am concerned 
about the fuel effects of the Iraqi-Kuwait crisis on the traveling public and 
the competitiveness and vitality of the airline industry," Transportation 
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said as he set up an industry task force recently 
to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that transportation is the most petroleum-intensive sector of the U.S. 
economy, accounting for 63% of petroleum consumption in 1989. Of this, jet fuel 
for commercial, military and civilian aircraft accounts for 14%. 
</P>
<P>
Some efforts to conserve are innovative. Others are obvious. A few are 
leftovers of fuel-conservation measures implemented in earlier crises in the 
mid-1970s and early 1980s that are being dusted off. 
</P>
<P>
Such economizing is imperative. Oil prices had been rising all summer but 
surged strongly when Iraq invaded Kuwait and have been going up almost daily 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
Pan American World Airways' experience has been typical. According to Chairman 
Thomas Plaskett, the airline was paying 61 cents a gallon before the 
hostilities but a few days ago was shelling out $1.02. 
</P>
<P>
For Eastern Airlines, which is struggling to lift itself out of bankruptcy, the 
fuel increases are devastating. Martin R. Shugrue, the airline's bankruptcy 
trustee, said Eastern's fuel price has risen from 56 cents a gallon in the 
summer to about 98 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously hurting our recovery efforts," he said in an interview. "But 
this goes far beyond Eastern. It is a very, very serious problem within the 
industry for those of us who don't have deep enough pockets to withstand this 
kind of cost pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Airlines are raising fares to blunt the impact of the fuel price increases. 
They went up more than 5% a month ago and an additional 4.2% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jet fuel accounts for about 15% of an airline's expenses. It is the industry's 
second-largest cost, next to labor. For giant American Airlines, a 
1-cent-a-gallon rise in fuel prices increases costs by $2 million a month, 
Chairman Robert Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
Airline analyst Edward Starkman of the New York investment firm Paine Webber 
Inc. says that as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, "we have taken $1.3 
billion out of our 1990 industry operating profit projection, which now stands 
at a loss of $300 million." 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't one big dramatic thing that is going on to save fuel," says Joseph 
F. McLaughlin, USAir's vice president-flying. "There are a lot of little ideas 
over a lot of flights." His carrier alone, he points out, has 3,000 flights a 
day. "If we can save a very little bit on those 3,000 flights for 365 days a 
year, we have saved a lot of fuel." 
</P>
<P>
The weight of airliners is crucial, and one phenomenon that airlines must 
contend with is that, as planes get older, they get heavier because they are 
patched up and more equipment is loaded on them. Boeing Co., the leading 
manufacturer of airliners, estimates that plane weight increases about a 
quarter of 1% annually. On a Boeing 727, that adds up to 250 pounds a year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Darol Hinton, chief of aerodynamics engineering for Boeing's 
commercial airplane subsidiary in Renton, Wash., each pound added to a Boeing 
727 burns an extra 22.5 gallons a year. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, carrying a single soft-drink can, weighing just under a pound when full, 
costs about $22.50 a year when jet fuel costs $1 a gallon. For United Airlines, 
which has 136 727s in its fleet, carrying one can on each 727 amounts to an 
annual expenditure of more than $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The newer, more fuel-efficient Boeing 757 burns only an extra 12.5 gallons of 
fuel a year for each extra pound, significantly cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
Some other weight-reduction efforts by the airlines: 
</P>
<P>
* USAir may soon ask cockpit crew members to share the five aeronautical map 
manuals each carries. 
</P>
<P>
* SwissAir pilots are spending more time training in flight simulators, rather 
than using planes in flight. This saves about 13.2 million gallons of fuel a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
* Japan Air Lines recently unveiled the world's first fully automatic jumbo jet 
washing machine at Narita Airport near Tokyo. Because the robot allows the 
planes to be washed more frequently, they haul around less dirt. It's too early 
to accurately assess the savings, but one executive said there is a potential 
annual saving of "about $2.4 million by keeping our planes clean." 
</P>
<P>
JAL has also installed lighter-weight carpeting in its 747s, saving almost 200 
pounds on each of the 58 planes, a total of more than 11,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
* Delta Air Lines is examining whether it is carrying too many cans of soft 
drinks on its planes. A domestic 727 flight generally carries 10 cases, each of 
which weighs about 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It has even been suggested that when duty-free items are sold in one country, 
they be delivered later at the destination. "Why do these items have to travel 
in the air with the passenger?" asks Walter S. Coleman, vice president of the 
Air Transport Assn., an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
But cutting weight isn't the only way to conserve fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Most carriers greatly restrict the use of auxiliary power units (APUs) on the 
jets because they burn too much fuel. These units are used for everything from 
air conditioning to brewing coffee and burn as much as $45 in fuel an hour. 
Northwest Airlines won't use its APUs while its planes are on the ground. The 
first pot of coffee on each plane every morning is brought aboard in a thermos 
so it doesn't have to be brewed on board, using the APU. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of fuel an airliner carries also determines how much can be 
conserved. So airlines are making every effort to accurately plan their fuel 
loads. It costs money to carry more fuel than necessary. A flight to Tokyo, 
says Northwest Airlines, will burn 75 gallons of fuel for every 150 gallons of 
extra fuel carried. 
</P>
<P>
Constantly assessing prices to determine where to buy fuel is also a must. For 
example, Northwest says that because fuel prices in Duluth, Minn., are high, 
its flights carry enough fuel to go there from the Minneapolis-St. Paul hub and 
back without filling up. 
</P>
<P>
Pan American World Airways flights to Port of Spain, Trinidad, take along 
enough fuel these days so they don't have to fill up on the Caribbean Island, 
where jet fuel costs $1.27 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel conservation drive has changed some of the fundamentals of the airline 
business. Speed was once a central consideration. If American could boast that 
its New York-Los Angeles flight could make the distance in just a few minutes 
less than Trans World Airlines, it had a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, speed reduced labor costs by reducing wages and overtime paid to 
crew members. But that was when fuel made up a much smaller portion of an 
airline's operating costs. Things are different now. 
</P>
<P>
Some fuel-saving procedures are hardly noticed by passengers. Like many of its 
competitors, American Airlines now taxis its planes on one or two engines. A 
727-200 burns 5.8 gallons a minute when taxiing with all three engines running, 
says Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president of operations. 
Assuming a fuel cost of $1 a gallon, that's $5.80 a minute.

HOW CRUDE OIL PRICES AFFECT AIRLINES . . . AND FARES 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of war in the Mideast has raised the specter of crude oil prices 
of $50 a barrel and higher. The chart below shows how even a small increase in 
the price of crude has a significant effect on the cost of jet fuel . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . . and an increase of a few cents a gallon in the cost of jet fuel costs the 
U.S. airline industry hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In order to recover that cost, airlines raise fares. Even a small fare increase 
would raise billions in additional revenue for the industry. 
</P>

FEDERAL PROBE FORCES OIL FIRMS TO JUSTIFY PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE: THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUBPOENAED DOCUMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS FROM 
INDUSTRY OFFICIALS. THE ACTION MOVES THE INQUIRY TO A HIGHER LEVEL BUT FALLS 
SHORT OF A CRIMINAL PROBE.

<P>
The Justice Department on Thursday escalated its investigation of the soaring 
gasoline prices that accompanied the Persian Gulf crisis, issuing civil 
subpoenas seeking documents and formal explanations from oil companies, 
refiners and marketers. 
</P>
<P>
While the issuing of the subpoenas -- known formally as civil investigative 
demands -- marks a higher level of inquiry in the two-month probe, the fact 
that the government did not seek grand jury subpoenas signaled that it has not 
found signs of criminal antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We aggressively will pursue this investigation until we determine whether or 
not violations of antitrust law contributed to the rise in gasoline prices," 
said James F. Rill, assistant attorney general for antitrust. 
</P>
<P>
The average national price for self-service unleaded gasoline jumped from 
$1.075 per gallon the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait to $1.115 only two days 
later, according to the American Automobile Assn. The current average is 
$1.346, or 27.1 cents more than on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening their probe four days after the Kuwait invasion, government 
investigators have conducted voluntary interviews with representatives of major 
oil companies and independent refiners and marketers and collected statistical 
data on gas prices and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"That phase of the investigation developed substantial information about the 
nature of crude oil and gasoline markets and how they behaved in the wake of 
the Aug. 2 invasion," Rill said. "It also provided us with an opportunity to 
have the parties explain the factors that caused them to raise gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
"With the civil investigative demands, we will be able to examine more closely 
those explanations and also pursue some issues for which we don't yet have 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
While Rill would not detail those issues, they are believed to center on 
whether there was any communication among oil producers and marketers that led 
to the price spurts. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the inquiry, in which the Federal Trade Commission, the Department 
of Energy and various state attorneys general are cooperating, is to determine 
whether there was any collusion in the setting of the higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry officials voiced optimism that the investigation would result in 
no civil or criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"This investigation, we're certain, will conclude, as did similar 
investigations in the past, that the oil industry has priced its products 
responsibly in a chaotic market," John Lord, a spokesman for Mobil Oil Corp., 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar inquiry conducted in Britain, he said, "concluded there was no price 
gouging or fixing -- that the rapid escalation was the result of market 
forces." Lord noted that Mobil had not recovered all of the rising costs it has 
incurred as a result of the Mideast turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon's prices reflect its assessment of competitive market conditions," said 
Les Rogers, a spokesman for Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The information being sought by the government is likely to include documents 
that investigators have reason to believe exist and answers to specific 
questions about the companies' actions in the wake of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
If investigators find any evidence of criminal antitrust violations, they would 
halt the process of seeking answers through the civil subpoenas and move to 
convene a grand jury, according to a former member of the antitrust division.

FIRST EXECUTIVE IN NO INSTANT DANGER, CHIEF SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: FRED CARR SAYS A RESTRUCTURING BEING PLANNED AT THE BIG LOS ANGELES 
HOLDING COMPANY IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.

<P>
First Executive Corp. confirmed Thursday that it is hastening work on a major 
restructuring plan that will involve not only a renegotiation of bank debt but 
also further measures designed to put the life insurance holding company on a 
sound footing. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Carr, chairman and chief executive of the big Los Angeles-based firm, 
confirmed that it has been holding intensive meetings with commercial and 
investment bankers during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the company's first public comment since it was disclosed this week 
that First Executive had notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
it expects to call a special meeting of shareholders, Carr denied in an 
interview that First Executive is in any imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
Carr also strongly denied that negotiations on the restructuring are taking 
place in a crisis atmosphere. "It is true that we are accelerating the 
process," Carr said. But he added: "We have gone about it very tediously" and 
deliberately. He said it isn't urgent that the talks be concluded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, sources confirmed Thursday that the investment banking firm Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. has been involved in the talks on restructuring and may soon 
be hired officially by First Executive to handle part of it. The sources also 
said that Kidder's parent company, General Electric, has been consulted and is 
considering an investment that would be part of the First Executive 
restructuring plan. GE so far hasn't confirmed publicly that it is 
contemplating any role in the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Carr refused to say anything specific about when he expects a plan to be 
announced. "We have been working with the (commercial) bank group and believe 
that they have been very constructive," he said. "We hope that over the course 
of the next few months, we'll be able to present a program to our various 
constituencies." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to give any details about the purpose of the special shareholders 
meeting. As reported, sources have said the meeting will be necessary to 
approve elements of the plan. One source Thursday said First Executive had 
filed preliminary proxy material with the SEC for a meeting as a way to spur 
the banks and other parties to reach an agreement quickly. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive, the parent of Executive Life and Executive Life of New York, 
has been hit hard by the declining value of its enormous junk bond portfolio. 
The parent firm also has disclosed that it may have to suspend dividend 
payments on its preferred stock and might be in danger of defaulting on $275 
million of bank debt. Regulators are refusing to let the parent company 
withdraw profits from the insurance units. 
</P>
<P>
Carr said Thursday, however, that the next payment on the debt, $46 million, 
isn't due until March. He said the company has enough cash on hand to cover it. 
"Because we have adequate funds to meet the 1991 payment, we have no immediate 
concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The true state of First Executive's finances has been the subject of much 
debate, however. On Wednesday, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's again 
substantially lowered its ratings on a variety of First Executive securities 
and insurance.

USAIR BRINGS PSA'S SMILE PARTIALLY OUT OF RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USAir, which wiped the smiles off Pacific Southwest Airlines' jetliners after 
acquiring San Diego-based PSA in early 1988, has reestablished at least a small 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
USAir won't be painting smiles on its own jet fleet, but the airline is adding 
smiles to the noses of nine USAir Express propjets that provide commuter 
service in California, Arizona and Nevada, USAir spokesman Larry Pickett said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
PSA folklore credits the first smile -- an uptilted curve painted just under a 
plane's nose -- to a mischievous maintenance man. But former PSA executives say 
it evolved from a 1969 advertising campaign that eventually included the 
airline's "Catch Our Smile" slogan. 
</P>
<P>
USAir, based in Arlington, Va., retired the smile after "extensive marketing 
studies." But now, the airline, encountering tough competition in California, 
apparently believes that the smile might help boost market share for the USAir 
Express operation that Phoenix-based StatesWest Airlines has operated for USAir 
since July. 
</P>
<P>
StatesWest, which has painted its aircraft to match USAir's red, white and blue 
livery, is "very excited about having the smile," StatesWest Chairman Rudy R. 
Miller said. He said he wanted to use the smile because, like the old PSA, 
USAir Express has a "fun-oriented West Coast customer-service attitude." 
StatesWest actively sought USAir's approval to use the PSA smile, a registered 
trademark now owned by USAir, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising world recalls the PSA smile "as an outstanding and fun" tool, 
according to Bob Kwait, an executive with Phillips Ramsey, a San Diego 
advertising agency. But he said he's not sure the smile can help an airline 
other than PSA.

STUDY SAYS CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT BIG ENERGY HOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California is among the five most energy-efficient states in the country and 
Texas is the most wasteful, according to an "Energy Hog Index" released 
Thursday by a Washington-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
The index, issued by Public Citizen, ranked New York, Arizona, Vermont, 
California and Colorado as states that wasted the least energy, based on an 
analysis of per-capita energy consumption and renewable energy use. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, the largest consumer of energy among the 50 states, ranked as the most 
wasteful, followed by Wyoming, Alaska, Kansas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The group, founded by Ralph Nader, concluded that U.S. energy use would drop 
35% if all states followed the examples of the least wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Becker, an energy policy analyst with Public Citizen and the study's 
primary author, said the index did not examine reasons for the differences. 
That will be the subject of subsequent studies. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "The best states and the worst states all have diverse climates, 
population distributions, geography and size. What strikes us is that the best 
states are the ones that have made a serious commitment to energy efficiency, 
and they're getting a payback now." 
</P>
<P>
Release of the index was timed to take advantage of public interest in energy 
issues since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and precipitated a period of anxiety 
in energy markets. 
</P>
<P>
The study was sent to governors of the 50 states with advice to push for strong 
energy policies to lessen reliance on imported oil from the Middle East. "Our 
message was that the federal government has dropped the ball right now on 
energy policy, so the states need to assume leadership," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
The rankings were based on an analysis of per-capita energy and oil consumption 
and the degree to which the states use sources of renewable energy such as 
hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal and wood. Data was gathered from 
government and industry sources and covered 1988 and 1989, Public Citizen said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Texas, with the nation's third-largest population, used more energy than any 
other state. With 7% of the country's people, Texas consumes nearly 12% of its 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
* The five states that used the least total energy are in the Northeast -- New 
York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont -- despite colder 
climates and longer heating seasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Alaskans used more energy per capita than any other state -- the equivalent 
of about 170 barrels of oil a year. New Yorkers used the least -- about 34 
barrels. The average U.S. citizen consumed about 56 barrels of oil a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Washington state derived the highest percentage of its total energy from 
renewable sources: 53.54%. An Energy Department spokesman attributed 
Washington's high percentage mainly to its high reliance on hydroelectric 
power. 
</P>
<P>
* Kansas had the lowest percentage, 0.28%, from renewable sources. California 
relied on renewables for 13.44% of its total energy. Overall, renewable energy 
sources supply only about 10% of the nation's energy and only 17 states get 
more than 10% of their energy from such sources. 
</P>
<P>
The rankings pleased California Energy Commission officials, who saw them as a 
vindication of the state's energy policies. "The citizens of the state of 
California ought to feel very good about this," said one of the commissioners, 
Richard Bilas, in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed the state's energy efficiency to policies that encourage 
conservation, anticipate energy demand and spur the development of diverse 
energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, however, officials disputed Public Citizen's charge that the state 
has a lax energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely wrong," said Garry Mauro, commissioner of the Texas General 
Land Office and a strong advocate of natural gas and other alternative vehicle 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that no one office of the state coordinated energy policy but 
added that a number of state agencies actively encourage private research into 
conservation and alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the state's inefficiency, in part, on an aging petrochemical 
industrial complex. "The majority of the petrochemical industry is in Texas, 
and a lot of the equipment we have is very old and has been here a long time," 
he said. "As we modernize, I would hope we get much more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Energy Department spokesman Jamie Pound denied that the federal 
government has dropped the ball on energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush asked for an energy policy back in July, 1989, and we've been 
actively involved in the process of building one," he said. "Clearly (the 
Middle East) crisis has focused public attention on the need for that policy, 
but it's on track and scheduled to go before the President in December."

GM ANNOUNCES AGGRESSIVE PRICES ON SATURN CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors Corp. on Thursday announced an "aggressive pricing strategy and 
warranty package" for its long-awaited Saturn compact cars, with base prices 
for the new line starting at $7,995 and ranging up to $11,775 for a sporty, 
two-door coupe. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive model, a four-door sedan, will get 37 miles per gallon of 
gasoline in highway driving and 27 miles per gallon in the city, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has been waiting for Saturn for some time, and these prices put us 
at a distinct competitive advantage against imports," GM president Lloyd E. 
Reuss said Thursday night at a meeting of Saturn dealers in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
GM will unveil the four new models publicly for the first time next Thursday at 
Saturn's final assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. All four are powered by a 
new 1.9-liter, four-cylinder aluminum engine. 
</P>
<P>
To counteract consumer resistence to an unproven model, Saturn will offer a 
warranty package that includes a three-year/36,000-mile warranty with no 
deductible and a money-back "charter buyer" guarantee that allows original 
buyers of 1991 models to return them for a full refund within 30 days or 1,500 
miles if dissatisfied.

Nynex Corp. Settles Claim of Overcharges: The parent company of New England 
Telephone and New York Telephone agreed to pay $1.4 million to the U.S. 
Treasury, cut long-distance rates by $35.5 million and reduce the two telephone 
companies' capital accounts by $32.6 million to resolve allegations they 
overcharged customers through an unregulated purchasing subsidiary. Nynex 
admitted no guilt and the Federal Communications Commission said it made no 
findings of wrongdoing. The FCC investigation centered on an alleged $118.5 
million in overcharges to the companies by Material Enterprises Co.

Milken Hearings Delayed: Federal court hearings in which witnesses are due to 
give evidence against junk bond king Michael Milken have been postponed at 
least until next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings had been scheduled to begin in New York on Tuesday. A judge 
allowed the delay after Milken's defense lawyers complained that they didn't 
have enough time to prepare. Both prosecution and defense witnesses are due to 
testify on whether Milken committed additional crimes, a question the judge 
will take into account when she determines Milken's sentence on the six counts 
to which he pleaded guilty.

Flipper Trainer Calls for Boycott: Richard O'Barry, whose disillusionment as a 
trainer of the dolphin actors known as Flipper made him the best-known activist 
against dolphin captivity, will announce a boycott of all Anheuser-Busch 
products and theme parks on Monday, unless the company closes its 
dolphin-petting facilities at four Sea World sites. The company makes 17 brands 
of beer including Michelob, Busch, Carlsberg, Elephant malt liquor and King 
Cobra malt liquor, as well as Eagle brand snacks. The firm also operates a 
Philadelphia children's theme park called Sesame Place and Busch Gardens, a 
theme park in Florida.

BIG U.S. FIRMS AGREE ON WAY TO CHANGE CHIP TRADE PACT

Ending a longstanding split over U.S. electronics trade policy, the major 
American semiconductor and computer companies on Wednesday announced a joint 
position on renewal of the controversial 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade 
agreement, which expires next July. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal calls for elimination of key provisions in the trade 
pact that effectively fix the price of widely used memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
The computer industry has opposed those provisions, which establish so-called 
fair market values for all imported memory chips, because they have 
dramatically increased the prices companies must pay for such chips. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal instead simply calls for the Commerce Department to implement 
a fast-track investigation if evidence emerges that Japanese companies are 
illegally dumping memory chips on the U.S. market. Chip industry demands that 
foreign firms gain a 20% share of the Japanese semiconductor market, which are 
part of a "side letter" to the current trade agreement, have been retained. 
</P>
<P>
The trade pact was signed in 1986 after years of complaints by U.S. chip 
manufacturers that Japanese companies were dumping -- selling products below 
cost -- to drive American producers out of the memory chip business. But the 
agreement did not achieve the goal of enticing major American suppliers to 
re-enter the market for the most widely used memory chips, called DRAMs. And 
American companies still hold only an 11% share of the Japanese semiconductor 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Although the united front of computer and chip companies should improve the 
chances of the compromise proposal being adopted as a negotiating position by 
the Commerce Department, it still faces tough political sledding. Many 
Administration officials are known to oppose any extension of the trade pact.

AMD-INTEL BATTLE NOW TANGLED IN 2 'WEBBS'; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: A MIS-ROUTED PACKAGE LANDED IN THE HANDS OF INTEL. THE CONTENTS 
PROMPTED A SUIT OVER THE TRADEMARK FOR THE 386 MICROPROCESSOR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An incredible sequence of events involving a mis-routed express package has led 
to a new round of lawsuits in the heated dispute between arch-rivals Intel 
Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices over the rights to build an advanced 
microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
Intel and AMD are already fighting it out in several courts over licensing of 
the technology for Intel's 80386 microprocessor, the brain inside many advanced 
personal computers. And the resolution of the dispute could have major 
implications not only for AMD and Intel but also for personal computer 
companies that use the chips and for other chip makers that hope to clone it. 
</P>
<P>
As the sole supplier of the popular chip -- often just called the 386 -- Intel 
is expected to generate nearly $1 billion in revenue from it, with profit 
margins in the 80% to 90% range. Not surprisingly, several companies, including 
AMD, have been eager to build 386 clones, and personal computer vendors have 
encouraged their efforts because they cannot get enough of the chips from 
Intel. 
</P>
<P>
With two major legal decisions pending, AMD has been coy about its plans to 
come to market with a 386 clone, although it is widely expected to introduce 
one soon. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Intel has revealed that it is no longer in doubt about AMD's 386 
efforts: It said it had come into possession of AMD literature about a product 
line called the AM386, and on the basis of that filed suit Wednesday against 
AMD for trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Intel says the documents had been sent by express delivery to the Sunnyvale 
Hilton hotel, intended for an AMD employee named Mike Webb. But it seems that 
an Intel employee named Mike Webb had also been staying at the hotel, and since 
both Mike Webbs had already checked out, the hotel forwarded the material -- to 
the wrong Mike Webb. 
</P>
<P>
Intel's Mike Webb, in turn, passed the documents on to his boss, who turned it 
over to the Intel legal department, who looked at the first page and found 
logos and references to the AM386. An Intel spokesman said the package was then 
sealed, and no one looked through the rest of the material. Intel filed suit 
against AMD, citing the cover sheet as proof that AMD would use what it claimed 
as a trademark, the 386 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
AMD spokesman John Greenagel said, however, that it was not clear that the two 
Mike Webbs had been in the hotel at the same time. "We think there has been 
some impropriety," he said, and AMD plans to file a countersuit today charging 
Intel with "misappropriation and conversion" of AMD property and asking for $10 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute borders on farce, but there's nothing funny about the 
broader legal battle between the two firms. AMD was the authorized second 
source for the previous generations of Intel microprocessors, the 80286 and the 
8086, and it claims that a broad technology-sharing deal with Intel signed in 
1982 gives it the rights to the 386 as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Intel, which broke with industry practice when it decided to make the 386 
alone without a second source, says AMD did not come up with the comparable 
products required under the technology deal, and thus Intel has no obligation 
to share the 386. An arbitrator who is hearing the dispute issued preliminary 
findings that appear to favor AMD, and a final ruling is expected any day. 
Intel could be forced to allow AMD to make exact copies of the 386, although 
few expect that outcome. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, AMD last year began producing a copy of a different Intel 
chip that uses Intel's copyrighted microcode, the instructions written into a 
microprocessor. Intel sued AMD, maintaining that it had given AMD access to its 
microcode only for internal purposes, but AMD says that claim is absurd. And 
analysts say AMD deliberately introduced the chip to resolve the microcode 
dispute so that it could make the 386. 
</P>
<P>
Making a legal copy of the 386 will be far easier if AMD can use the Intel 
microcode. A trial in that lawsuit is set for February. 
</P>
<P>
Other chip makers, meanwhile, are trying to figure out ways of making a 386 
that isn't protected by microcode copyrights, patents or the special provisions 
against copying chip layouts that are contained in the federal Chip Protection 
Act. Several companies, including Chips &amp; Technologies and two Silicon 
Valley start-ups -- Nextgen Microsystems and Integrated Information 
Technologies -- are expected to soon introduce 386 clones that use several 
chips to perform the same functions, thus avoiding some of the intellectual 
property problems. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it will be almost impossible for Intel to avoid some kind of clone 
competition. Eli A. Sayegh, an analyst with S. G. Warburg in San Francisco, 
says Intel will certainly be hurt, "assuming the clone chips are indeed fully 
compatible." He estimates that they could take 20% of the market within two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But Intel officials note that the company "is not standing still," and will 
continue to improve what is now a 5-year-old product to stay ahead of the 
competition. "Intel is not nearly as vulnerable as people think," said Dean 
McCarron, an analyst with the chip research firm In-Stat Inc.

Blue chip stock prices closed sharply higher Thursday in a wild session driven 
by uncertainty over the federal budget, a surprise bond rally and whiplashing 
computer-trading programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some bad earnings reports caused big stock hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial index closed up 27.47 points, or 1.1%, to 2,516.83. 
Earlier in the day it was down more than 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
The broader market failed to keep pace with the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index inched up just 0.4%; the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite lost 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues slightly outnumbered advances 
in nationwide trading, with 731 stocks rising, 780 falling and 465 unchanged. 
Big Board volume came to a moderate 145.41 million shares, against Wednesday's 
135.49 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some investors bought on the belief that a budget agreement would 
be passed in Congress. House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.), after meeting with 
President Bush in the afternoon, said congressional committees will be able to 
change part of the $500-billion budget-cutting agreement, a statement that may 
assuage opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the budget is expected to nudge the Federal Reserve into lowering 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the Fed is under enormous pressure from the Administration" to cut 
rates, said Bank of America Senior Vice President V. Shannon Clyne. 
</P>
<P>
But whether budget optimism sparked Thursday's surprise bond rally was unclear, 
traders said. Meanwhile, stock investors had to contend with a flurry of 
computer buy and sell programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been roiled by the program people and by what amounts to a great deal of 
uncertainty," said analyst Andrew Riley of Yamaichi International. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* The broad market's weakness may have stemmed from new worries about corporate 
profits. The news was grim. Ingersoll-Rand tumbled 5 7/8 to 33 1/4 after the 
machinery firm said its third-quarter results will be below Wall Street 
expectations. It cited a sudden decline in certain businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Tenneco slumped 4 3/4 to 45 1/4 after a Prudential-Bache analyst cut 1991 
earnings estimates 12% on expectations of softer orders for construction 
equipment. And Hewlett-Packard lost 1 3/4 to 29 1/4 after the computer company 
said domestic orders slowed in September from August. 
</P>
<P>
* High-tech stocks overall continued to be weak. Sun Microsystems lost 1/2 to 
19, Microsoft fell 1 5/8 to 64 1/8 and AST Research gave up 3/4 to 16 3/4. 
Digital Communications plunged 4 3/8 to 10 5/8 after it reported quarterly 
earnings off 63%. 
</P>
<P>
* Elsewhere, Carnival Cruise Lines dropped 1 3/4 to 12 after Alex. Brown and 
Montgomery Securities cut earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
* Toro Co., which said it expects to post a loss for the quarter ending Oct. 
26, fell 2 3/4 to 12 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the market bright spots, Ralston Purina rose 2 1/8 to 105, Lilly gained 
2 3/8 to 75 1/8, Humana rose 1 to 45 and Time Warner added 2 1/8 to 74 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks finished lower in thin, volatile trading amid rebounding oil 
prices and widespread fears that war would finally break out in the Mideast 
after a two-month standoff. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index ended down 571.20 points, or 2.5%, to 22,278.19. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-day today, the Nikkei was up 785.75 points. 
</P>
<P>
London stock prices also weakened as the market struggled for direction in the 
absence of fresh news. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 16.6 points at 2,070.4. In 
Frankfurt, Germany, stock prices fell in thin, lackluster trading. The DAX 
index dropped 22.54 points, or 1.6%, to 1,422.35.

Bond Prices Leap in Slow Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose sharply in quiet trading as the market awaited the release of 
employment figures for September. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 27/32 point, or about $8.43 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.79% from 8.87% Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were somewhat at a loss to explain Thursday's advance. Many were 
doubtful that buyers were motivated by the outlook for the pending federal 
budget-cutting pact. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts did report some technical buying, as traders adjusted their positions 
before the Labor Department's employment report comes out early today. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.19%, down from 9% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The drop was due to technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds rose 1/32 point to 88 25/32. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 7.76%.

Crude Oil Prices Slump Late in Day 
</P>
<P>
U.S. crude oil prices, led by a late selloff of gasoline, skidded downward in 
late trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange after being up earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Crude was supported earlier as markets anticipated that an Iraqi speech at the 
United Nations would not match the conciliatory tone of President Bush's 
address earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for November 
ended the day down 39 cents at $36.93 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
It traded as high as $38.25 and as low as $36.30 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"A late selloff of gasoline pulled crude down 30 to 50 cents in the last 15 
minutes of trading," said Kirk Kinnear of the Phibro division of Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
On the Merc, unleaded gasoline for November delivery fell 2.28 cents to 90.86 
cents a gallon.

Pork Belly Rally Loses Momentum 
</P>
<P>
A powerful three-day surge in pork belly futures prices peaked on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange as buying interest sparked by a surprising government 
hogs-and-pigs report exhausted itself. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork bellies for delivery in February closed above Wednesday's closing 
price but below the day's high of 64.9 cents a pound, which represented a gain 
of nearly 12% since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, livestock futures were mixed, precious metals 
retreated and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Pork bellies settled 0.65 cent lower to 0.25 cent higher, with February up 0.25 
cent to 64.45 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Pork bellies had risen the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday in reaction to last Friday's surprisingly low 
hogs-and-pigs inventory news. 
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department report included an estimate of the number of pigs 
born during the summer that was 2% lower than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Most market analysts had expected summer farrowings to be unchanged or even a 
little higher than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metal futures, which have shadowed crude oil's moves since the Persian 
Gulf confrontation began, fell on New York's Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Gold finished $1.60 to $2 lower, with October at $392.30 an ounce; October 
silver lost 2.2 $4.67.

FGS Insurance Agency Inc., a controversial marketer of high-risk auto insurance 
policies, said Thursday that it has filed a damage claim against the state 
Department of Insurance, Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and four other agency 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Department currently is attempting to cancel FGS's license to 
market auto insurance in California, claiming that the Irvine-based company has 
systematically defrauded customers. 
</P>
<P>
The company has denied the state's allegations and maintains that the 
department is conducting a vendetta against FGS because it formerly was owned 
by Coastal Insurance, a high-risk auto insurance company that filed for 
bankruptcy and was ordered liquidated last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the damage claim, FGS named senior investigator Dennis Ward, investigators 
Hazel McRay and Kim Harrison-Woods and Bruce Wiener, chief counsel for the 
department, as defendants along with Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
FGS says that it was damaged because the department established a toll-free hot 
line for agency clients and that callers are told that the company provides 
inferior service and that the state will revoke its brokerage and agency 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that since filing a complaint against FGS in April, the 
Insurance Department "has disseminated false and misleading press releases" and 
threatened to investigate insurers who do business with FGS. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, FGS claims that department investigators have entered its premises 
without permission and have threatened to seek revocation of the licenses of 
FGS employees who request legal advice during interviews. 
</P>
<P>
FGS President Alan Greenberg said that most of those activities have been 
halted but that FGS has lost thousands of potential customers because of the 
state's actions. 
</P>
<P>
The claim, submitted to the Insurance Department, is an administrative prelude 
to the expected filing of a $40-million civil suit by FGS against the 
department, said Greenberg. A damage claim must be filed and acted on by the 
state before a civil suit for damages can be instituted. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier FGS suit asking for a court order enjoining state regulators from 
harassing FGS was filed Sept. 7. On Aug. 14, former FGS executives were among 
those named in an Insurance Department suit asking for $66 million plus 
punitive damages to be paid the state for alleged racketeering, fraud and gross 
mismanagement in the Coastal failure. 
</P>
<P>
The new suit will be based on FGS's claims that "the Insurance Department and 
its employees have engaged in and condoned a pattern of unlawful misconduct 
against FGS," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Department officials said Thursday that they had not yet seen the 
damage claim and would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the state filed a complaint against FGS claiming that the agency in 
1989 and earlier had violated state insurance laws. Among the charges were that 
FGS: 
</P>
<P>
* Failed to tell customers they were being placed in the state assigned-risk 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
* Failed to tell customers who financed premiums through a plan provided by FGS 
that the interest rates would run from 20% to 40% while much less expensive 
plans were available from the state. 
</P>
<P>
* Aided unlicensed insurance companies to do business in California by 
marketing their policies. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings to revoke FGS license began in September but have been postponed until 
February.

William &amp; Clarissa Inc., a fledgling maker of children's toiletries, said 
Thursday that it has hired an investment banker to raise additional capital to 
support its growing marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which sells a full line of children's products -- from tear-free 
shampoo to cologne -- under the Kids William &amp; Clarissa label, said it had 
hired The First Boston Corp. to explore ways to raise the needed cash. The 
alternatives include "seeking a corporate partner or private placement to 
institutional investors," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past year, the company has grown rapidly and its products are now 
being sold in more than 16,000 supermarkets, drugstores and other retail 
outlets. With the bulk of the distribution effort finished, President Mary 
George said the company now needs to promote the line more. 
</P>
<P>
The company has advertised in parenting magazines, she said, but wants to 
expand with more full ad campaigns in some areas. She said the company hopes to 
raise $5 million to $10 million within the next four months to support a 
campaign that would include television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing an advertising test in a few markets," she said. "We need 
additional capital to build on the momentum." 
</P>
<P>
The company said that First Boston will act as financial adviser in an effort 
to maximize shareholder value. William &amp; Clarissa's stock closed Thursday 
at 75 cents, down 25 cents in trading on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco area businessman founded the company several years ago, naming 
it after his own two children. The firm sold its products to department stores. 
When George and her management team moved to the company last year, they 
decided to move into the mass market as well. 
</P>
<P>
The company raised $5.7 million and developed a line that appealed to parents 
as well as children. The products are hypoallergenic, contain no animal 
ingredients and are not tested on animals. Research showed that many parents 
wanted higher quality for their children, and that children want their own 
distinct products. 
</P>
<P>
The Kids William &amp; Clarissa line consists of 16 personal care products, 
including shampoo, liquid soap, cornstarch powder, bubble bath, sun block, lip 
balm and cologne. George said that the tear-free shampoo has been the biggest 
seller.

JOSEPH N. BELL: SHE'S LIVED ON THE EDGE AND SURVIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Debbie Reynolds is very much in the public eye these days. "Postcards 
From the Edge" -- a film made from the partly autobiographical novel by her 
daughter, Carrie Fisher -- is playing at a number of Orange County theaters, 
and Reynolds plans to visit here early in November as the centerpiece of a 
fund-raiser for the candidacy of Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) for the 
office of lieutenant governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a lot of acrobatic backing-and-filling by both Fisher and her 
mother to make it clear that the boozy, sometimes self-righteous character 
played by Shirley MacLaine in "Postcards From the Edge" is not drawn from 
Debbie Reynolds. All of this has brought back in rather vivid Technicolor a 
surrealistic evening I spent with Reynolds more than a decade ago, when I was 
covering Hollywood for several national magazines. 
</P>
<P>
I did half a dozen "scrapbooks" of entertainment luminaries (Bob Hope, John 
Wayne, Lucille Ball, among others) in which I collected a pile of personal 
photographs from a mixture of sources, then flashed the pictures on the people 
I was writing about. They invariably responded with a warmth and depth that 
probably couldn't have been tapped in any other way. 
</P>
<P>
I did one of these scrapbook articles on Debbie Reynolds. In the process, I 
hung out with her while she was putting together a nightclub act in a Los 
Angeles rehearsal hall and also at the house she shared with Harry Karl. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening with her that came vividly to mind when I saw "Postcards From 
the Edge" took place in Reno. I had already been through the photographs with 
her, and I had gone to Reno to watch the nightclub act I had seen evolve in 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
I watched her work the audience at a dinner show and marveled at the waves of 
love that came back to her. She kissed bald men and called them Charley and 
their wives Mary, and she walked across table-tops talking to children and 
picking up names to use later in her act. And then she went back to the stage 
to work -- singing, clowning, dancing, mimicking. God, how she worked. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, I picked my way through a cluttered backstage, past a hard-eyed man 
I later discovered was her bodyguard, into a neoplastic dressing room where she 
had changed to a robe and was sipping consomme. I remember her as tiny and 
still Dresden-pretty but also surprisingly tough, with authority in her voice 
and hard lines around her eyes when she thought on certain things. 
</P>
<P>
After two hours of talk, she got back into her sequined dress -- "boobs up, 
stomach in" she told herself -- for the midnight show and invited me to wait in 
her dressing room for more talk. 
</P>
<P>
She was back at 1:15, and three hours later, Debbie Reynolds -- unwinding over 
a now-dead bottle of wine and chain-smoking furiously -- was still going 
strong. The theater had long since emptied out and the bodyguard was dozing on 
a chair outside her dressing room. And although I was totally wiped out, I had 
seen some layers peeled back on the last of the Girl Scouts in the high-octane 
world of cabaret entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
I still have my notes of that conversation, although I ran out of tape about 2 
o'clock, and after that the notes are sketchy because we were two people 
talking over a bottle of wine. And her vulnerability, so carefully protected 
most of the time, had been allowed to emerge cautiously and finally to sit in 
almost casually on our conversation. 
</P>
<P>
She told me about the poverty of her childhood and adolescence, about selling 
awesome amounts of Girl Scout cookies by walking five miles to the neighborhood 
in which Bing Crosby and Bob Hope lived, about slugging her only date in high 
school when he tried to kiss her, about her shock at winning a Miss Burbank 
contest (she just wanted to be a gym teacher), which got her a movie contract 
when she was 16. 
</P>
<P>
She insisted that no studio mogul ever made sexual demands on her ("maybe I 
wasn't sexy enough") and still feels the pain of the 18-hour rehearsal days 
when she had to hold her own with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor in "Singin' in 
the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
When the studio gave her "vitamins" to keep up her strength, her parents 
stopped it. "They were vitamins all right," she told me, "with speed in them. 
They already had Judy Garland hooked, and they would have had me if my parents 
hadn't stepped in." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the evening, she talked almost dispassionately about her marriage to 
Eddie Fisher and the pain of her humiliation when he left her with two small 
children for Elizabeth Taylor. She married a shoe tycoon named Harry Karl on 
the rebound because he was "wise and strong and kind," and she ended up raising 
his children and then losing her savings and working a Herculean schedule to 
pay off his gambling debts after she divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
She tried TV first, but quit a series rather than work for a cigarette sponsor 
(partly because she was addicted to smoking, herself). Then she resurrected an 
old chestnut of a show called Irene and made it work, before turning to 
nightclubs, which was where I found her in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Even early that evening, her talk was straight, but only after the theater 
emptied and the wine took hold did she allow some of the bitterness and anger 
she felt into the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids have gone through it all with me," she said "I've never shielded them. 
They were on the road with me all during Irene and saw their mother go to 96 
pounds. They didn't think I'd make it, but I told them I would -- and I did. 
They were my support. Without the children, I don't think I'd have wanted to 
make it. But if I'd given up, where would they have been? Their father 
certainly wouldn't have taken them. What kind of example has he been?" 
</P>
<P>
She admitted some head-to-head confrontations with Carrie when Reynolds offered 
advice that often wasn't sought. She recalled telling Carrie when she took off 
with Gucci luggage on her first acting assignment: "It's everything you told me 
you didn't want. You said you were leaving here because all your friends were 
Beverly Hills Gucci Pucci. So remember that line -- and take my speckled black 
luggage and be understated for a change." 
</P>
<P>
She told me about other, similar, incidents that seem to provide an undertone 
for "Postcards From the Edge." 
</P>
<P>
This is caught most powerfully in the movie when the daughter (played by Meryl 
Streep) is asked to sing at a party, and when she finishes, she throws the 
spotlight to her mother, an aging actress. The crowd cheers as MacLaine sits on 
the piano, hikes up her skirt to show off some fine legs, and sings Stephen 
Sondheim's "I'm Still Here" from Follies: 
</P>
<P>
 Good times and bum time, I've seen 'em all, and my dear, 
</P>
<P>
 I'm still here. 
</P>
<P>
 Plush velvet sometimes, sometimes just pretzels and beer, 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm still here. 
</P>
<P>
 I've stuffed the dailies in my shoes, strummed ukuleles, 
</P>
<P>
 Sung the blues, 
</P>
<P>
 Seen all my dreams disappear, but I'm here. 
</P>
<P>
 Black sable one day, next day it goes into hock, 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm still here. 
</P>
<P>
 Top billing Monday, Tuesday you're touring in stock, 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm here. 
</P>
<P>
 First you're another sloe-eyed vamp, then someone's mother, 
</P>
<P>
 Then you're camp, 
</P>
<P>
 Still someone said, "She's sincere," so I'm here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
That had to be written for Debbie Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
As dawn began to break over the Nevada hills behind Reno that morning 13 years 
ago, I wrote down Debbie Reynolds' parting words: "Success can either destroy 
you or make you a better person. But you have to be very strong. If you don't 
have your own inner strength, you can't make it. You just can't. You go insane 
or become a drunk or get on pills and drugs. I watched them all. I was there. 
But I was never chewed up by it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still doing what I've always done, only more so. I think it's just 
self-will, self-determination. My parents were like that. So is Carrie. I never 
want to be poor again. So now I'm 45 and I don't have $20,000. You think I 
haven't learned the hard way? I've lived it. But I want to survive. I'm going 
to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Prophetic words from a tough Girl Scout. I haven't talked to her since that 
night in Reno, but I think I saw a lot of Debbie Reynolds in "Postcards From 
the Edge." 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to add a small clarification to my column of Sept. 28 about the plight 
of the Grove Shakespeare Festival. I quoted some remarks of director David 
Herman that I said were made before the Garden Grove City Council when they 
were actually delivered at a meeting of festival supporters that followed the 
council session. 
</P>
<P>
There were also some semantic complaints from Councilman Raymond T. Littrell 
(who was not identified in my column). He said that funds were denied, not 
withdrawn, that the denial of funds didn't directly force the company to close 
down, and that his comment about Garden Grove being a hard-hat community was 
made earlier and not at the meeting in question.

<TEXT>
<P>
The devotees start staking out their lucky chairs in the Edison High School 
cafeteria about 3:30 every Monday afternoon. They come with their lucky charms, 
their snack food and vacation pictures, their cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
By 5 p.m., chatter and smoke fill the room. Most of the 240 or so people are 
regulars. They split into their usual cliques and gab about families, or the 
money they almost won the night before. 
</P>
<P>
The first round of games starts at 6:30. From that point on, no one budges. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the auditorium suffered a power outage one night and the devotees 
played on, using their cigarette lighters to illuminate the cards. A few weeks 
ago, a pregnant woman went into labor during the "Early Bird" set. She stayed 
until intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Over the ensuing four hours, 26 people (more, when ties occur) yell the magic 
word: 
</P>
<P>
"Bingo!" 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dykes whoops with joy as she rockets from her lucky chair waving her 
lucky red dauber, which is an oversized felt-tip pen used to mark the calls. 
The crowd does not exactly share her enthusiasm, although it quickly regains 
its optimism -- there's always the next game. 
</P>
<P>
Floor manager Dan Campbell, a volunteer for the football team's booster club, 
counts the $250 kitty into Dyke's eager palm: "$20, $40, $60. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes is one of an estimated 21,000 bingo fans in Orange County and Long Beach, 
according to the monthly Bingo Bugle. Nearly every city council in the area has 
voted to allow the game of chance as a fund-raising device for nonprofit 
organizations. Bingo was legalized in 1976 through an amendment to the state 
constitution, but it is regulated by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
"I play as often as I can get away with it -- three or four nights a week," 
Dykes, 53, says. "My husband thinks it's a game for little old ladies. He 
doesn't like bingo; I don't like golf." 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach housewife spends $70 to $100 per bingo venture: "Shhh, 
don't tell my husband that. I use his money to play, but when I win, it goes 
into my account. 
</P>
<P>
"I play only because it's for a worthy cause, yep. I'm being tongue-in-cheek, 
in case you couldn't guess," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, however, Dykes' five-year romance with bingo is not solely for love 
of money; her occasional $250 bounties have yet to fulfill any champagne wishes 
and caviar dreams. "I'm still in the red," she says, "but I'm about to break 
even any day now." 
</P>
<P>
The land of opportunity for bingo aficionados was expanded in January when 
Garden Grove's City Council finally approved the game -- five years after 
Westminster and Huntington Beach became the county's first inductees. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan cast the only dissenting vote, saying, 
"I don't think it's the way to teach our children about how to make money." 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said he is "philosophically opposed to gambling, including the lottery" 
-- though, he admitted with a chuckle, "I buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Their (the booster clubs') argument is that you can only sell so much candy 
and wash so many cars to raise money," the mayor said. "I'm sympathetic with 
that. I just wish there were a better way to do it than bingo." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach and Costa Mesa continue to hold out. 
</P>
<P>
"The school board doesn't think that a form of gambling is an appropriate 
activity to have on school facilities," said Tom Godley, assistant 
superintendent of budget facilities for the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But bingo fans need not worry about a shortage of arenas for their sport. On 
any given night in Orange County, eight to 10 schools, churches and clubs 
conduct the game. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo mushroomed in the '80s when charitable organizations were forced to 
pursue fund-raising more aggressively due to federal cutbacks, said Roger 
Snowden, president and founder of the Seattle-based tabloid Bingo Bugle. "The 
Reagan Administration gave bingo a big shot in the arm," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six states have legalized bingo, and about 58,000 Americans a week 
partake of it, Snowden said: "About $5 billion a year are wagered on bingo, and 
about 25% of that is returned to charities." 
</P>
<P>
John Healy, editor of the Orange County-Long Beach edition of Bingo Bugle, has 
watched his newspaper's circulation grow from 15,000 to 21,000 over the past 
four years. New bingo locations constantly crop up in the county, making 
organizations increasingly competitive for a slice of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
The Bugle, available free at games, is stuffed with advertisements such as the 
one for Buena Park High School: 
</P>
<P>
"OVER $16,000 PAID NIGHTLY . . . $1,000 CASH DRAWING . . . FREE COFFEE &amp; 
SNACKS . . . UNIFORMED POLICE . . . FOUR TV MONITORS. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Because bingo in California is operated by individual cities rather than by a 
state board, the total revenue brought into Orange County can only be 
estimated. "About 2,000 people a night play, and they probably spend about $50 
each," Healy said. That totals about $100,000 a night or $36.5 million a year. 
After costs, some $9 million goes to the various organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"In five years, we've paid out $1 million to the clubs," said Nancy Wyckoff, 
Edison High bingo president. The wealth is divided among 26 booster clubs for 
activities ranging from basketball to the student senate. 
</P>
<P>
By state law, organizations that conduct bingo games must rely on an 
all-volunteer staff -- with the exception of cafeteria workers, security guards 
and accountants. Each of the booster clubs at Edison drafts one parent per 
bingo night to sell cards, empty ashtrays and pass out popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum booty that a single card can reel in is limited by law to $250, 
though door prizes and drawings can pay up to $1,200. Most organizations keep 
grand prizes a bit below that amount to forgo paperwork; the IRS requires 
winners of $1,200 or more to fill out forms on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
One-dollar "pull tabs" produce about half of Orange County schools' bingo game 
income. The tabs -- which pay from $1 to $250 -- are similar to lottery 
tickets, except they can be sold only during bingo games. 
</P>
<P>
On the recent Monday night at Edison High, early arrivals passed pregame down 
time plucking their way through stacks of pull tabs. 
</P>
<P>
"I won $100 off a pull tab!" enthuses Jan Petrow, a San Diego loan underwriter 
who was in Orange County on business. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, avid fans seek out their hobby while traveling through alien 
territory. "I was sitting in my hotel room and I thought, 'I'm so bored -- I'll 
go find a bingo game,' " Petrow says. 
</P>
<P>
She plays three or four nights a week in San Diego. "I guess I have the 
gambler's spirit," she shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
Edison High's basic game package costs $15, which provides a total of 48 cards 
-- six for each of eight games. But rare is the person who stops at $15. Most 
buy "early bird" and "late bird" packs for another $5 each. Most buy a dozen or 
so pull tabs. A lot buy two or three game packages. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody concentrates on only one card at a time, like in the old days. Daubers 
have replaced pinto beans and buttons as card markers. And disposable paper 
sheets, each illustrated with three to six cards, have replaced the reusable 
single cards. The two innovations make multiple-card scanning the norm. 
</P>
<P>
With impressive hand-eye coordination, one woman on this particular night 
simultaneously supervises 18 cards each game -- wielding a dauber in each hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen people play 24 cards at a time," Wyckoff says. 
</P>
<P>
Phil and Elena Navarra of Costa Mesa scoff at such tactics. "We don't play 80 
million cards like some people, so that we can visit with our friends," says 
Elena, 78. "We come here mostly to socialize." 
</P>
<P>
Still, such altruism does not preclude the Navarras from bringing along their 
good-luck doll, Drucilla -- nor from claiming the same good-luck table every 
night. "Nobody better sit down here or else they get killed," warns Phil 
Navarra, 76. 
</P>
<P>
"Bingo players are superstitious people," observes widower Bill Gruble, 75, who 
religiously attends the Edison games with his best friend, Diana Poundstone. 
"If you're on a losing streak, you switch to a different color of dauber or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach buddies exchange a "lucky handshake" before braving a new 
set of games. "I always wear the same jewelry," says Poundstone, 66. She and 
Gruble sit in Edison's nonsmoking room, linked by television monitors with the 
bingo emcee across the hallway. It holds half as many participants as the 
bustling auditorium where the smokers congregate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the minority," Gruble says. "But some of the people over there are 80 
years old -- it's hard to tell them that smoking is bad for your health." 
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before winning her $250 bonanza, Barbara Dykes had been cursing 
the five-letter word soon to become her victory cry. 
</P>
<P>
"Who invented bingo? I'd like to kill him. Or her," she grouses, puffing 
another cigarette. "He's as bad as R.J. Reynolds." 
</P>

'IN' WEAR FOR THE CLUB SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: THERE'S NO REAL DRESS CODE FOR L.A. NIGHT LIFE. BUT BASIC BLACK SEEMS 
TO WIN AN ENTRANCE TO VERTIGO WHILE THE MAYAN SEEMS TO OPT MORE COLORFUL GARB.

"Usually I just waltz right in," said Helen Pegadiotes impatiently as she stood 
outside the Vertigo club in downtown Los Angeles. But Pegadiotes wasn't 
waltzing or doing any kind of dancing last Saturday night as she waited with 
about 30 other hopeful nightclubbers to be let into the local hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, the 23-year-old broadcast journalism student from Long 
Beach, clad in a simple short black dress, caught the eye of the doorman, who 
lifted the velvet cordon for her and her escort to pass inside, ahead of others 
who had waited for nearly half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent selectivity of the Vertigo, and of the nearby Mayan nightclub, has 
resulted in separate legal actions being brought against the two clubs. On 
Wednesday the Mayan was found guilty of practicing arbitrary discrimination, 
which is prohibited under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. And the state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department is seeking to suspend Vertigo's liquor 
license on the same basis. 
</P>
<P>
Neither club has a specific dress code, so no one knows for certain the ins and 
outs of their admissions policies. From this vagueness sprang the two 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The owner and president of Vertigo, Jim Colachis, maintains that his club 
reserves the right to extend some patrons preferential treatment over others so 
long as it does not discriminate on the basis of sex or race. 
</P>
<P>
His staff members, he said, generally look for people who have made an effort 
to dress up for the night or for those dressed in an "interesting manner." 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply a question of, 'We're too full (inside) and you seem to have done 
a better job at looking interesting tonight than the next person,' " he 
explained in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, "night life attire" is required at the Vertigo, but its definition 
is fairly fluid. Black seems the color of choice. The doormen look favorably on 
classically dressed guests, with men in jackets and women in short, sleek 
dresses, general manager Glyn Samuel said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then you'll have your people in fashion jeans," he added. "You know, $200 
jeans with holes (in them). And leather jackets and stuff like that. We do shy 
away from jeans, but if someone wears a pair of jeans right, it can be very 
fashionable." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a fairly smooth stream of people entered the trendy club on 
Boylston Street. But without any kind of systematic line, it was impossible to 
tell what rhyme or reason determined who got in first and who had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 p.m., several knots of people had gathered outside, jockeying for 
strategic positions in the front of the crowd and anxiously awaiting the 
doorman's sign of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kotel, a 23-year-old Angeleno dressed in black slacks, leather jacket 
and buttoned-up white shirt, was still hoping for entree although he and two 
friends had already spent an hour and a half presenting themselves for 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
He turned away after being passed over again. "They only let the girls in," he 
muttered, clearly disgruntled. But he kept waiting, as did a number of others 
who didn't make the first cut. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them took it in stride and in fact seemed to expect no less. "It's like 
that all over New York, and the same in Europe," noted Pegadiotes. 
</P>
<P>
Two miles away on Hill Street, patrons dressed like Kotel were apparently 
having no trouble getting into the Mayan, despite the accusation of 
discrimination upheld against the club this week. The flow into the old Mayan 
Theatre was steady, impeded, it seemed, only when the cashiers had too many 
people to handle. The wait was minimal, although, like the Vertigo, there was 
no line of any sort. 
</P>
<P>
A fair scattering of jeans and more colorful clothes was an instant tip-off 
that any unwritten dress code is less formal than at the Vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's really casual. I don't know how else to put it," doorwoman Beverly 
Reyes said. "Guys come in loud shirts, baggy jeans, really Euro-looking." 
</P>
<P>
Women wear dresses but with colorful patterns rather than basic black, said 
Reyes, sporting a soft, fake leopard-skin dress. 
</P>
<P>
"People call up and say, 'What should we wear? Should we wear black?' " she 
said. "That's so out. The weirder the better. If you're out at night, you want 
to forget about the daytime. . . (so) you might as well dress the part."

BEHIND THE WHEEL / MERCEDES 190E 2.3: ONE SHARP STARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz -- following the laudable lead of Jaguar and BMW in producing 
entry-level wheels that don't require a third mortgage -- has recycled the 190E 
2.3 as its starter car. 
</P>
<P>
With a base price of $28,050, this four-door Mercedes minor actually costs 
$1,570 less than the 190E 2.3 of 1988, the year of the great marketing bollix 
that caused its temporary disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
It also carries more standard equipment -- an anti-lock braking system and 
height-adjustable seat belts, as examples -- than its 1983-1988 ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
And, in moving closer to Granada Hills and away from Beverly Hills, the 190E 
has not been cursed by plastic wheel covers, a Marconi radio or other Woolworth 
trappings standard on too many budget-sensitive products. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it comes blessed with cast aluminum wheels, cruise control, 
driver-side air bag, central door locking, power windows, automatic climate 
control and great noise from an Alpine sound system identical to those 
installed in larger and pricier Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a new suspension system, the car slinks just low enough to have lost 
the pug-nosed Tonka look that blighted earlier 190s. It appears longer 
(although chassis length and design is unchanged) and certainly is much 
smarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lower body cladding has been added. The front air dam and rear valance have 
been resculptured to further serve the aerodynamic aesthetes of the '90s. 
(Technical note: Such Buck Rogers bodywork makes virtually no contribution to 
the handling of the car.) 
</P>
<P>
In short, the car has lost absolutely nothing -- not even that secure squat and 
lovely lumber so typical of Mercedes handling -- while staying within walking 
distance of affordability. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes spokesman John Chuhran said the new 190E 2.3 offers "high quality, 
high durability, high safety . . . all the strong features of a Mercedes-Benz 
for the person who has a difficult time coming up with the money for a 
higher-priced model." 
</P>
<P>
That higher-priced model is the 190E, with a 2.6-liter engine and a sticker 
price of $33,700. Then comes the highly popular 300E, with a base of $47,200, 
and on up through sticker stratosphere to the Mercedes 500SL at $89,300. 
</P>
<P>
The 190E 2.3, Chuhran continued, definitely was not introduced as a counter to 
Lexus and Infiniti, the Japanese-built high-performance luxury cars, which, at 
$40,000, are underselling the best from Jaguar, BMW and Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
It was introduced, he continued, to serve customers lost in recent years as 
fluctuating exchange rates and higher production costs drove the Mercedes' 
price beyond many suburban reaches. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is show that we are not exclusively in the high end 
of the market and that we have a commitment to the entry-level end of the 
luxury car market," Chuhran added. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes hasn't always been quite so altruistic. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes-Benz 190E was introduced in 1983 and became a two-model series in 
1986. One sold with a 2.3-liter engine; the more expensive version came with a 
2.6-liter engine. 
</P>
<P>
The 190E 2.3 became a huge seller and, in 1988, was second in U.S. sales behind 
the Mercedes-Benz 300E sedan. 
</P>
<P>
The bean counters, however, saw the 190E 2.6 moving up fast. With the 
smaller-priced 2.3 out of the way, they reasoned, buyers would automatically 
switch to the big-bucks 2.6. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
With the 2.3 discontinued in 1988, sales of its big brother did, indeed, 
improve. But they still fell more than 20% short of the previous year's 
combined sales for the 2.3 and 2.6. 
</P>
<P>
So this year, with BMW and Jaguar pioneering the vogue for defrilling cars 
without damaging their souls (and with auto sales limping just about 
everywhere), Mercedes-Benz has reissued the 2.3. 
</P>
<P>
At 2,987 pounds (only about 400 pounds heavier than, say, the Mazda 323), the 
190E 2.3 isn't a heavyweight. Nor is its four-cylinder, 2.3-liter engine, 
producing 130 horsepower (five horsepower less than the oomph produced from the 
smaller engine of the BMW 318i), a powerhouse. And, in the obvious interest of 
keeping production costs down, the 2.3 does not follow today's trend of 
multivalve engines. 
</P>
<P>
So for the undisputed privilege of driving behind Mercedes' century-old 
tridentate emblem, be prepared to dawdle a little during your daily commute. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway entrances are fine, if you bury the gas pedal. Passing is no big deal, 
if thoughts are kept ahead of the traffic flow and the five-speed gearbox 
(automatic transmission is a $900 option on the 190E) is worked briskly. Once 
rolling, however, the car settles in to that flat, purposeful, wonderful lope 
so suggestive of a velvet tank. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mercedes will concede that its 190E 2.3 really doesn't like to be 
thrashed. 
</P>
<P>
There's an indecent amount of travel built into the clutch and gas pedals, 
which isn't conducive to crisp shifting and smooth applications of power. The 
multilink suspension is designed to temper the lumps and maneuvering forces of 
civilized surface street travel, not the dog legs of Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the car will survive any demand and configuration imposed upon it. 
</P>
<P>
But expecting it to handle extremes with gobs of verve is rather like asking 
Prince Charles to fix the plumbing. He could do it. But it's a job better 
handled by others and certainly beneath his dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Internally, little has changed on the new 190E; Mercedes has never seen a need 
to get drastic about anything. At least not more than once in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Instruments are large, analogue and visible. The steering wheel is 
leather-covered but not adjustable, in keeping with the firm European belief 
that a correct driving position is obtained by adjusting the seat, not the 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The gearshift is precisely at hand, of just the right heft, and that adds much 
to a sense of instinctive shifting. As always, the click of every knob, every 
lever, every switch, sends out the Mercedes message of substance and quality. 
</P>
<P>
There's enough wood to remind us of the olde worlde craftsmanship of the 
Teutons, and the polish is about nine feet deep. The dash and upholstery are 
vinyl. But as anyone with a 20-year-old Mercedes will tell you, that's the best 
and actually a better warm-weather fabric than leather. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the 190E's magnificent cruise control (in German, 
Geschwindigkeitsregler, and you don't get more magnificent than that) 
functioning like a simple hand throttle of yore. The lever goes up to 
accelerate and set the speed. Down to decelerate and establish a new pace. Over 
to cancel. Simple. Fumble free. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes' free thinking is evident in other cockpit areas. The glove box latch 
is set to the far left of the lid -- so the driver can reach it when traveling 
alone. Only the passenger-side mirror is electronically adjustable -- because 
the driver's mirror is always within close reach for manual adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
From inside, the 190E feels to have more room than its exterior suggests. In 
the rear, thanks to some hollowing out of the front seat backs, there is indeed 
more knee space than in the old 2.3. 
</P>
<P>
The raison d'etre of Mercedes-Benz, of course, is building top-quality cars 
that allow safe, comfortable and precise travel with a maximum of solid set and 
a minimum of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
They are adult cars dripping tradition. Styling is kept close to timeless 
because a Mercedes vehicle will hang tough for a decade, at least. They are 
tight and solid and the doors slam like a Chubb safe because superb engineering 
to microscopic tolerances is a Mercedes norm. 
</P>
<P>
On the move they are expected to be a little scholarly, somewhat dignified, 
driver-friendly, prestigious and respected by valets and neighbors everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The renewed 190E 2.3 is such a hardy, classic vehicle.

L.A. DESIGNER-ENTREPRENEUR HAS HIS FOLLOWING OF HAT LOVERS 
</P>

<P>
Glenn Hill's mission in life is to convince hat lovers they don't have to motor 
to department stores to find a chic chapeau. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, Hill has been creating original headpieces for a loyal 
clientele in his Leimert Park shop. Last Saturday, Hill's loyalists sipped 
coffee for an early morning show where models glided through Franklin's 
restaurant, around the corner from Hill's shop, called Mattie's Place after his 
grandmother. Hats included some of Hill's custom designs, as well as several by 
Don Anderson, Bellini of New York and Jack McConnell, also carried in his 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Drama is the big news for fall '90. Outlandish Saturn-inspired shapes, colorful 
plumage, amoeba-patterned rhinestones and yards of horsehair all add to the 
textural emphasis of the season's hats. Though fall's spice colors -- nutmeg, 
saffron and cinnamon -- figure into the seasonal scheme, bright hues of 
emerald, violet, peacock blue, canary yellow and fuchsia caught the eye of 
Hill's patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"My customers like really high-profile hats, and they don't mind paying a lot 
of money for that attention," says Hill. His prices start at $30 for a Kufi, a 
fez-like style of African origin, and escalate to as high as $600 for 
extravagant custom designs. Hill also does a brisk wedding headpiece custom 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old entrepreneur graduated from L.A.'s Fashion Institute of Design 
and Merchandising in 1976, but he learned basic hat-making from a tailor. He 
perfected his craft through trial and error making hats for his grandmother and 
her friends. Eventually, Hill's hobby grew into a business, though he continues 
to work as a Delta Airlines flight attendant while partner Steven McGrew tends 
the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hill's trims and materials for his custom designs come from New York 
millinery supply houses. Hill also makes frequent pilgrimages to Dallas, 
Philadelphia and Montreal for headgear. For all his travels, Hill says it's the 
Los Angeles attitude that appeals to him because the Southern California woman 
is into no-rules dressing. Fashion mores, such as wearing straw hats in summer 
only and wool in winter only, don't apply here. A hat by Sandra of New York 
featuring both materials proved a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the seasonlessness of this place, women wear straw in December if 
the weather calls for it. It's the 'I wear what I feel like wearing' attitude."

PAT ROBERTSON STEPS UP NEA BROADSIDES; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: AS THE HOUSE NEARS A COMPROMISE ON RENEWING THE ARTS AGENCY, THE 
TELEVANGELIST INCREASES HIS ACCUSATIONS OF NEA INVOLVEMENT IN AN ADULTS-ONLY 
PUPPET SHOW.

<P>
As House leaders moved Thursday toward a resolution of the protracted National 
Endowment for the Arts controversy, TV minister Pat Robertson has tried this 
week to reinvigorate the conservative assault on the embattled federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Robertson blanketed members of Congress with letters urging an end 
to federal support of "obscenity, pornography and attacks on religion," and, on 
Thursday, the Virginia minister took to his electronic pulpit to tell his TV 
viewers that Congress is out of step with the public on the NEA issue. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who sought the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination, has been one 
of the NEA's most consistent attackers, both on his "700 Club" television 
program and in newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
His latest broadsides have centered on an Atlanta puppet show last month that, 
he charged, featured simulated oral sex and may have been supported by the NEA. 
The charges have come as the House of Representatives is preparing for a 
crucial floor vote next week to renew NEA funding for another three years. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for a Senate vote soon, however, are far less certain.

Key House leaders Pat Williams (D-Mont.) and Tom Coleman (R-Wis.) on Thursday 
unveiled an NEA compromise that contains no restrictions on the kinds of art 
the NEA can support and over time transfers 35% of NEA money to state arts 
councils -- up from 20% now -- but far less than the 60% that Coleman once 
urged. 
</P>
<P>
The Williams-Coleman compromise allows the NEA to take back money it gives in 
grants for work later judged obscene by a court and bars endowment support of 
work that qualifies as obscene under existing U.S. Supreme Court decisions. It 
calls on the NEA to consider "general standards of decency and respect for the 
diverse beliefs and values of the American public" in making grants. 
</P>
<P>
But Robertson would like to see Congress abolish the agency altogether. Ralph 
Reed, executive director of Robertson's Christian Coalition, said Robertson's 
letters and Thursday TV appearance were a coordinated effort to try to wipe out 
support for the arts endowment in the House and Senate. "The NEA is going to 
find its support on Capitol Hill is really crumbling, especially against the 
background of the budget crisis," Reed said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress votes for this, they're out of touch with America," Robertson told 
his viewers Thursday. "There shouldn't be one (tax) dollar spent on oral sex in 
a puppet show." 
</P>
<P>
NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer -- apparently concerned that Robertson's puppet 
show crusade has begun to gain political momentum -- held an Atlanta press 
conference Thursday where he demanded that Robertson "apologize to Congress and 
the people of Atlanta" for distorting the NEA's role in the puppet show. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the time has come for fairness," Frohnmayer said. "I believe the 
time has come for honesty and for truth." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer has publicly accused the evangelist of misrepresenting the NEA and 
its grants, and once demanded -- and got -- equal time on the Robertson show to 
rebut the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The puppet show episode grew out of a Sept. 21 performance at the Arts Festival 
of Atlanta by puppeteer Jon Ludwig, who is associated with Atlanta's Center for 
Puppetry Arts. The center received more than $132,000 in NEA support last year. 
The NEA also gives money to the Georgia Council for the Arts, which gave the 
festival some state funds. But documents produced by the NEA and the festival 
this week appeared to show that there was no direct link between NEA support 
and the controversial show, titled "Zeitgeist." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy arose after a local Methodist minister, the Rev. John Norton, 
complained to festival officials that some children slipped past security 
officers and attended the performance, which was labeled adults-only. Norton 
distanced himself from Robertson's use of the dispute to reignite the larger 
NEA controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a strong fan of the arts and sorely regret that the arts in Atlanta got a 
black eye," Norton told The Times. "Others have attempted to use this incident 
as a forum. These same persons and groups have attempted to bring all of this 
into a national issue that will soon be brought before Congress. It was never 
my intent that this become a forum for (Robertson's) issue." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer accused Robertson of practicing "guilt by association" and contended 
the NEA had faxed Robertson background materials on the extent of NEA 
involvement in the puppet show before Thursday morning's broadcast, but that 
Robertson ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
Even Robertson appeared in his television broadcast to back away from the 
direct charge that NEA money had been involved in the puppet show. "I wasn't 
there. I didn't see (the show)," Robertson said. "Now, the minister (Norton) is 
backing away from it (Robertson's allegations of an NEA link.)" In a video 
report, a "700 Club" announcer also acknowledged denials that federal money was 
directly involved. "That may be so," the soundtrack said.

ART MUSEUM REJECTS CONTROVERSIAL WORK; 
</P>

EXHIBIT: THE DISPLAY 'FLAGS' IN LAGUNA BEACH WILL INCLUDE 19 OF THE 20 WORKS OF

PORNOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE PHOTOS, WON'T BE SHOWN.

<P>
The Laguna Art Museum, whose director has vowed to "abide by the rules" to 
secure a hefty sum of National Endowment for the Arts grants, has excluded a 
potentially controversial work from one of its current installations. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "Flags," includes 19 of 20 American flags that political artist 
Mark Heresy has fashioned out of such materials as bullets and buckshot shells, 
cut currency and human hair. But the 20th flag, "Freedom of the Press," a Stars 
and Stripes replica constructed of photos from porno magazines, has been left 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum is Orange County's largest NEA grantee this year, having 
been awarded six grants totaling $222,500. Recipients of 1990 grants have been 
required to certify that they will not produce or present work that the NEA 
might consider obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Charles Desmarais on Thursday angrily defended the museum's 
omission of the flag and insisted that its exclusion was "absolutely not" 
influenced by fear of losing NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum's decision to display all but one of Heresy's flags was "a 
matter of selection" and that the excluded work was not specifically singled 
out. "I don't care if there were 50 flags," he said. "It's the job of the 
museum to make choices. . . . We didn't omit things. We select what we believe 
to be valuable and important to include (in any exhibit) for our public." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he considers "Freedom of the Press" to be not valuable and 
important, Desmarais responded, "You can draw your own conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Heresy said his flag works are an attempt to illustrate his view of America's 
bent toward censorship, militarism and materialism by infusing artifacts 
representative of those attitudes into the fabric of the nation's symbol of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of the pornographic magazine flag, he said, underscores the 
message he hopes to portray in the piece -- that America pretends to stand for 
freedom of expression yet institutionalizes censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"It just reinforces what the piece says," said the 25-year-old artist from Los 
Angeles. "It's very much about hypocrisy. It's a very cynical piece." 
</P>
<P>
Heresy said, however, that he doesn't fault the Laguna museum for leaving out 
the flag. Instead, he said, he is "encouraged" that the rest of the exhibit was 
accepted at all by a museum in a predominantly conservative county. 
</P>
<P>
He credits Bolton T. Colburn, the museum's curator of collections. Colburn 
"really stuck his neck out on this," Heresy said. "It gives me hope that we can 
still do art and say something without (being censored) too heavily." 
</P>
<P>
Some arts groups throughout the country have rejected NEA funding this year 
because of the obscenity stipulation, which they have criticized as 
government-sponsored censorship. Desmarais has ardently defended his museum's 
acceptance of the grants, contending that refusing the money would be to 
acquiesce to the pressure of conservatives whose criticism of a handful of 
works they consider sacrilegious or obscene prompted the anti-obscenity pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials recently sent to the NEA an acceptance form for a $150,000 
grant along with a letter that objected to the certification but said "we will 
abide by the rules," as Desmarais put it last week. 
</P>
<P>
The "Flags" installation is scheduled to remain on display at the museum 
through Dec. 16. "Freedom of the Press" remains at the Zero One Gallery in 
Hollywood, where the other flags had been before they were moved to the Laguna 
museum last month.

<P>
Carl St. Clair, the new music director of the Pacific Symphony, can drop some 
heavyweight names. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Leonard Bernstein, New York Philharmonic music director Kurt Masur, 
Boston Symphony music director Seiji Ozawa -- St. Clair says he can "pick up 
the phone at any time (and) have a question answered or talk with them about 
this or that." 
</P>
<P>
But there are other names he'll mention, nowhere near as familiar, that can 
tell you a lot more about this 38-year-old Texan. 
</P>
<P>
Take Robert S. Pool, for instance. Or Donn Laurence Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Who? 
</P>
<P>
Pool gave St. Clair a job in the governor's office when he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
"He hired me because I had blisters on my hands," St. Clair recalls. "He looked 
at my hands and said, 'What's wrong with your hands?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said I had blisters from building a fence, digging post holes and things 
like that. And he told me, 'That's why I hired you. Anybody who could work that 
hard and do this kind of labor certainly could work in the governor's 
correspondence room. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Pool always helped me when I was a starving student at the University of 
Texas. He helped me, and all he ever asked was that when I had the opportunity, 
I would help somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
"And I remember that, and I try to live that because he lost nothing by helping 
me, but I gained everything. I always feel that if I can help other people, I 
only gain from that." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Mills, chairman of the music department at Chapman College in 
Orange and founding director of the fledgling Capistrano Valley Symphony who 
died of meningitis in February. 
</P>
<P>
Mills had conducted the Texas All-State Orchestra in which St. Clair, then a 
17-year-old from the tiny farm community of Hocheim, Tex., played trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
It was not only the first orchestra St. Clair ever played in. "It was the first 
orchestra I ever heard," St. Clair told The Times in January, when he came to 
guest-conduct the Pacific as one of eight who were trying out for the music 
director's slot. 
</P>
<P>
"I often wanted to tell (Mills) how important that was to me," St. Clair said 
at the time. Last month he said he had been happy to learn that the remark got 
back to Mills before his death. St. Clair said he returns to conduct the 
All-State Orchestra "whenever they ask." 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair's first concerts in his new position will be Tuesday and Wednesday at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
He was the youngest of the eight announced candidates, and his appointment 
ended a search that began in February, 1988, when founding music director Keith 
Clark resigned after a bitter power struggle with the orchestra's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Lawrence Foster, claimed to have been the front-runner and 
said the Pacific had offered him the job in December but withdrew the offer 
after talks broke down over salary, rehearsal demands and residency 
requirements. The orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair has declined comment on the Clark and Foster episodes. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair's guest-conducting stint began under particularly trying 
circumstances, as he faced last-minute changes in program and soloist. Only 
days before the concert, soprano Benita Valente was engaged to replace Jill 
Gomez, a British soprano who could not enter the country because she lacked a 
visa. (Gomez and her British agent later would fault the Pacific management for 
the problem. The management would blame her American agent and the heavy 
workload at the Los Angeles immigration office.) 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, St. Clair had to make some fast adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez was to have sung selections from Joseph Canteloube's "Songs of the 
Auvergne" and "Dove sono" from Mozart's "Le nozze di Figaro." Instead, Valente 
chose to sing Mozart's "Exsulatate, Jubilate" and three of Mahler's 
"Ruckert-Lieder" -- none of which St. Clair had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
There was yet another surprise waiting for him: St. Clair had expected to 
conduct the Overture to Mozart's "Die Zauberflote." But when he got on the 
podium to start the rehearsal, he found the score for "Figaro," the result of 
some apparent miscommunication between his agent and the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Maestro," one of the musicians ventured hesitantly, "we have the 'Figaro' 
Overture. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair reportedly responded: "Even though I'm upset, that doesn't mean you 
can't call me Carl." 
</P>
<P>
Several musicians cite that response as part of what most impressed them about 
the candidate. As it turned out, St. Clair would conduct both the Overture and 
the Ruckert Songs from memory. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to insist that the musicians call him by his first name. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long but steady road from southwestern Texas to Boston, where until 
this summer St. Clair was one of two assistant conductors of the Boston 
Symphony -- and from playing first trumpet in a high school band to sharing the 
prestigious, $150,000 1990 Seaver/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors 
Award with Florida Symphony music director Kenneth Jean. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair studied conducting with Walter Ducloux at the University of Texas at 
Austin and taught music for 10 years at Southern Illinois University at 
Edwardsville and for eight years at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he became a conducting fellow at Tanglewood, Mass., the summer home of 
the Boston Symphony, and the following January he became one of the orchestra's 
assistants along with Pascal Verrot. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1989, he toured with Bernstein and conducted various 
orchestras in East Berlin, Leningrad, Milan, Paris and Rome, among other 
cities. This past August, he stepped in to take over for an ailing Bernstein at 
Tanglewood and later conducted in South America, Vancouver and Houston, among 
other places. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair has a three-year contract with the Pacific and will lead six pairs of 
classical concerts each season at the Performing Arts Center and two concerts 
each summer season at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
He holds two other positions as music director -- of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) 
Symphony and the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. -- one of which he 
must drop this year because of his contractual obligations to the Pacific. He 
says he has not yet decided which will go. 
</P>
<P>
He has not made radical departures in programming for the new season, but he 
has experimented a bit in rearranging traditional order. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it's very boring to have an overture, a concerto and symphony; 
overture, concerto, symphony," he said. "Standard, I think, is a dangerous word 
when it involves an art form which is always changing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to make each program a little different so that every time that 
someone comes to the hall, it's not, 'If I'm five minutes late, I'm going to 
miss the overture.' You might miss a whole Mozart symphony if you miss the 
first piece." 
</P>
<P>
Recent local press stories have chronicled his arrival in Orange County -- 
buying a townhouse in Turtle Rock, purchasing furniture -- in almost painful 
detail. St. Clair said he hasn't read them. And while he doesn't "avoid press," 
he added that "most of the time," he doesn't read reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"If the performance is good or not good, I'm usually the first one who knows 
that," he said. "If (a critic) doesn't or does agree, then that's (his or her) 
job. It's not my job. My job is to know whether I did a credible job or knew my 
music, knew the music as well as I could and conducted it as well as I could. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm always listening to things. If someone says this or that, I'm always 
aware, and I would think through it. Learning is important to me. I'm not 
beyond learning." 
</P>
<P>
He said he's particularly looking forward to learning with the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to develop a musical relationship with the musicians of this 
orchestra," he said. "And that's about to happen. It takes time. It has to 
happen as it happens. It's like a relationship with a person, place. This just 
happens to be a group of people. 
</P>
<P>
"But through music we will find one another, and that will begin to be the 
relationship which will help us take future steps. The first thing is to meet 
one another in the music. That's always a tremendous thing. It creates 
tremendous emotion."

FEITELSON'S SERENE AND ANXIOUS FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feminine curves slither through the figurative and abstract works of Lorser 
Feitelson, one of Southern California's seminal modernists. A modest survey of 
his paintings and graphic work at Tobey C. Moss Gallery reveals his suave 
handling of line and fascination with the image of woman as tantalizer and 
nurturer through six decades of stylistic change. 
</P>
<P>
Feitelson was born in Savannah, Ga., in 1898 and reared in New York. He was 
mostly self-taught. Galvanized by the European art he saw in the Armory Show of 
1913, he made several trips to Paris during the '20s to check out the scene. In 
"Two Figures: Kinetic Organization" (1919-20), repeated concentric silhouettes 
in vivid colors give a proto-Art Deco look to a pair of Jazz Age flappers with 
elongated torsos, perky breasts and licks of spit curl. 
</P>
<P>
After working through a Neoclassic style indebted to Picasso and Andre Derain 
-- and lavish in depictions of the statuesque female form -- Feitelson found 
his voice as a Surrealist in the early '30s. By then he was living in Los 
Angeles, and Europe was far away. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the irrationalist dream imagery of the European Surrealists, 
Feitelson's orderly, contemplative scenes of female nudes and symbolic objects 
-- eggs, the moon, pieces of fruit -- were serene symbols of a sensual and 
fecund universe. 
</P>
<P>
In the '40s, the artist started playing with what he called "Magical Forms." At 
first they retained a Surrealist aura, as in the giant abstract "male" and 
"female" shapes that dominate a desolate landscape at dusk in "Tree Form." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, these eccentric forms became bold, flat silhouettes that locked 
into solid-colored fields. Aggressively pointed shapes in precarious balance 
and the restless competitiveness between the shapes and the equally vivid 
"negative space" around them evoke the anxieties of the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
"Magical Space Forms" of 1961 is indeed magical in its tension-filled 
construction of looming, oblique black forms on a white ground. These five 
monoliths touch each other only at two points, evoking contradictory qualities 
of mass and weightlessness -- and a corresponding sense of the vulnerability of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
During the last decades of his life (he died in 1978), Feitelson reduced his 
forms into ever-more-streamlined contours -- shapely ribbons of color that 
glide through the air with space age velocity. In an untitled painting from 
1971, a vertical line of bright blue rimmed in rust red and peach briefly curls 
in on itself -- the sexual imagery and tension is unmistakable -- before 
rushing off the gleaming white expanse of the canvas. 
</P>

<P>
The Human Comedy: The idea of presenting Diane Arbus' photographs of the 
unbeautiful people in tandem with flattery-be-damned portraits by four 
well-known photographers who preceded her was born of necessity -- not enough 
Arbus images were available to fill the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
But the resulting parallels and differences give the exhibit a depth of field 
infrequently seen in gallery photo shows and reaffirm how disturbing and 
provocative the world of Arbus' subjects -- our world -- really is. 
</P>
<P>
German photographer August Sander, who wrote that he wanted to present "only 
the honest truth about our time and people," embarked in the 1920s on a project 
of individually documenting representatives of the different walks of life -- 
from circus performers to politicians -- represented in his native Germany. 
</P>
<P>
If the unsmiling farm children Sander photographed in the Westerwald in 1913 -- 
arrayed stiffly with their playthings: a doll, a whip, a toy horse, a dog -- 
look strange to us, that's because today's children are old hands at the ritual 
of photography, and they live in a casual world where adult concerns have 
filtered through the cloistered innocence of the childhood represented here. 
And back then, nobody was urged to smile for the birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Brassai (born Gyula Halesz in Hungary) photographed the night life of Paris 
during the 1920s and '30s. His camera lingered on lovers and strangers, all 
enveloped in the mystique of going out on the town in search of a good time. 
However pensive or awkward individuals may appear no one seems grotesque or 
pitiable. 
</P>
<P>
In the work of Viennese emigre photographer Lisette Model, who was Arbus' 
teacher, New York in the 1940s and '50s is full of people who may not have been 
fashion plates -- folks with jowls, flab, smeared lipstick, gnomelike bodies -- 
but who clearly retained the zestful independence of urban dwellers back when 
New York was still a liveable place for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
Tabloid photographer Weegee (ne Arthur Fellig; his nom de camera was derived 
from his knack for turning up when something criminal was going down, as if he 
had access to a Ouija board) was Johnny-on-the-spot in New York for murders, 
fires and general mayhem. In one image, a skinny transvestite raises his skirt 
in a "cheesecake" pose while he and his more frightened-looking buddies are 
hauled away in a paddy wagon. 
</P>
<P>
But Arbus removed the sideshow aspect as well as the soothing aura of universal 
brotherhood and bonhomie. Returning to the posed format Sander favored -- under 
radically different cultural circumstances of media sophistication, social 
mobility and moral uncertainty -- she made images that are at once 
uncomfortably confrontational and devoid of helpful answers.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: PASADENA'S TRA FIORE: THE MORE THINGS CHANGE . . .

In the late '70s and early '80s, upscale Los Angeles restaurants looked mostly 
to France for inspiration. Even as they experimented with local ingredients and 
explored other cuisines -- especially Asian -- chefs here followed the rigorous 
rules of French cooking and presentation. 
</P>
<P>
(No California chef was considered fully trained until he or she had cooked in 
France for at least a month or two.) 
</P>
<P>
By the late '80s, many Los Angeles chefs had switched their alliances to Italy. 
As it turns out, a lot of people believe Italian cuisine is better suited to 
Los Angeles' lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the announcement earlier this year that Pasadena's well-loved Cafe 
Jacoulet would close for a few months and reopen as Tra Fiore surprised a lot 
of people. Instead of contemporary California-French food (with a few Asian 
touches), there would be northern Italian. Instead of beurre blanc, pesto. 
</P>
<P>
But judging by Tra Fiore's first weeks, Cafe Jacoulet's former regulars 
shouldn't worry. The restaurant may look different (beautiful and 
expensive-looking dark woods set off the white open spaces of the dining 
rooms), and the menu may be full of Italian-sounding dishes, but the food at 
Tra Fiore seems a lot like the food served at Jacoulet, only with the French 
dish names translated into Italian. Even the chef is the same. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the familiar Jacoulet-inspired dishes: tuna sashimi layered between 
won-ton skins and avocado with a mustard-sesame dressing; sesame-seed ravioli 
filled with John Dory mousse. It seems some things don't change as easily as 
others.

CITY GRILL: A CORNER OF WILDNESS IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Reggae Night in the World Trade Center. Tight, funky rhythms echo weirdly 
through the empty plaza, mingling with the suave swoosh of elevator doors and 
the flapping of banners of many lands. 
</P>
<P>
The City Grill is the little corner of wildness in the red marble monumentality 
of this imposing Long Beach complex. It looks cartoony inside: Red-orange 
fluorescent lights curve around the margins of a turquoise ceiling spotted with 
mirror panels, and something like a miniature section of Stonehenge stands in 
the middle of the floor. Photographs and paintings, all involving bicycle 
handlebars, adorn the non-smoking section. 
</P>
<P>
And there is often live music for the outdoor dining section, such as the 
reggae band pumping away in the vastness of the half-dark plaza. Could it be 
that there's excitement in the food as well? 
</P>
<P>
Could be. The menu is as eclectic as the idea of world trade itself: Italian, 
Chinese, Cajun, you name it. There are cruets of virgin olive oil and balsamic 
vinegar at every table, in little cruet-caddies that also hold flyers 
advertising Winemaker's Night dinners. Nevertheless, a reassuring homeyness 
hovers over everything. 
</P>
<P>
There are more ambitious-sounding dishes listed but the best single thing here 
is the chili, available either as an appetizer or an entree. It's a powerful, 
impressive, brooding sort of chili, more Mexican in style than Texan: strips of 
tender steak in a mahogany-dark sauce of ground ancho and pasilla peppers (and 
no tomato at all, so far as I can tell). It's only moderately hot but full of 
the bricky-chocolatey perfume of the peppers; a concentrated mouthful, too 
noble to deserve adulteration with the pots of onion, cheese and sour cream 
that accompany it, though the corn bread is a handy way of sopping up all the 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the appetizers are not quite in this league, but certainly solid. A 
grilled green pasilla pepper is filled with shrimp, corn and goat cheese. A 
couple of crab cakes made with a mixture of Louisiana and ordinary blue crab 
come in a lemon butter sauce that has a sharp mustard burn. You can get 
filo-wrapped goat cheese flecked with basil, or cheese ravioli topped with 
smoked fish. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees run the gamut from plain pot roast to a semi-nouvelle dish of lamb, 
sliced up (not exactly with surgical neatness, it must be said) and arranged 
with some good Dijon sauce, resting against a little dike of ratatouille with 
about half a dozen more vegetables on the plate. The best of the vegetables are 
the roughly fried new potatoes with rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
The gumbo has a suspicious look, served as it is with lemon wedges, but it 
turns out to be pretty good. There is a proper scoop of rice in the middle of 
an earthy broth full of crab scallops and shrimp, plus some peppery smoked ham. 
There's even a little bit of okra, which California restaurants rarely think to 
include. 
</P>
<P>
Where there's Cajun food these days there is likely to be Southwestern as well, 
of course. The specials might include lamb with chipotle pepper sauce and 
sweet-sour chunks of cactus flesh. 
</P>
<P>
The few Chinese dishes on this menu, which goes into great detail about their 
ingredients, have a rather denatured flavor. Stir-fried beef tips, with its 
combination of honey, sherry, vinegar, cilantro and vegetables, somehow comes 
out tasting Southwestern. Authentic or not, though, they're fun, particularly 
the "mahogany duck" varnished with honey, soy and plum sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts feature one stab at haute cuisine, a very creamy creme brulee, but 
here the homeyness of the City Grill really takes over. Peach-strawberry 
cobbler has an odd crust, like the surface of a cake doughnut, and a load of 
thick whipped cream on top. It's an unfair match, though -- the strawberries 
totally overpower the peaches. Better are the soda fountain treats: a 
macadamia-and-chocolate brownie topped with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream, 
hot fudge cascading down it, and a sundae with two flavors of gelato in a world 
of chocolate sauce and whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
This is an interesting restaurant for a World Trade Center, where you'd expect 
something a lot less imaginative. Good work, Long Beach, not least for the 
reggae band. 
</P>
<P>
 City Grill, 1 World Trade Center, Long Beach, (213) 499-7040. Lunch 11:30 
a.m.-2:30 p.m. Monday-Friday; dinner 5-10 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday. Full bar. 
Validated parking underground at Ocean Avenue and Daisy Street. All major 
credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$63.

CBS MAKES SEASON'S FIRST CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS, off to a fast start in the 18-day-old fall TV season, moved quickly 
Thursday to keep its momentum by yanking the low-rated "E.A.R.T.H. Force" and 
also pulling the sitcom "Lenny" until it finds a better time slot for the 
blue-collar comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Streamlining its schedule as it prepares to broadcast up to three weeks of 
baseball's Major League baseball playoffs and World Series, CBS also postponed 
the Oct. 25 debut of another series, "Sons and Daughters," and moved several 
other shows to new time periods. 
</P>
<P>
"E.A.R.T.H. Force," a series about a team of environmental protectors that 
debuted Sept. 16, apparently became the season's first cancellation as CBS 
announced that it "has been placed on hiatus" and "had its last regularly 
scheduled broadcast" last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Lenny," another new show, CBS said that it definitely will 
return to the schedule in a different time period. It had aired Wednesdays at 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the baseball playoffs a possible make-or-break period during the new 
season for CBS, the network -- which has finished third in prime time for the 
past three years but is a solid second thus far into the 1990-91 season -- 
appeared to be dumping or moving its ratings deadwood in preparation for a real 
run at No. 1 NBC. 
</P>
<P>
In a key move, CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky also pulled Dan 
Rather's successful "48 Hours" from its new late-night Saturday slot and gave 
it the important 8-9 p.m. time period opening the Wednesday lineup, starting 
Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"48 Hours" did well last season against NBC's 8 p.m. Thursday powerhouse, "The 
Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "48 Hours" will lead into two other series upon which CBS is depending on 
Wednesday: the reliable ratings entry "Jake and the Fatman" and "WIOU," an 
upcoming new show about a local TV news operation, which many observers feel 
may be the network's best freshman program. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also made moves to strengthen its Thursday and Saturday lineups. On 
Thursday, "Top Cops," a reality show about police stories, switches from an 
hour to a 30-minute format and goes up against "Cosby," "The Simpsons" and 
"Father Dowling Mysteries," beginning Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursdays, CBS will move its comic-book entry "The Flash," which has 
started stronger than expected, out of direct competition with "Cosby" and "The 
Simpsons." It will follow "Top Cops" from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., with CBS hoping 
the carryover last half-hour of the show will draw viewers away from NBC's 
"Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out CBS' Thursday lineup will be "Doctor, Doctor" and another reliable 
ratings winner, "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, CBS has revamped its 9-11 p.m. lineup after dumping "E.A.R.T.H. 
Force" and moving "48 Hours." Starting Nov. 17, "Wiseguy," with Steven Bauer 
replacing Ken Wahl, will be a weekly entry. Beginning Nov. 24, it will be 
joined by "Broken Badges," a series about an undercover crime-fighting unit.

'GOOD MORNING AMERICA' HOLDS ITS LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's "Good Morning America" continued its lead in the morning ratings race 
during the past three months, figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
During July, August and September, "Good Morning America" had an average 
audience of about 3.9 million homes each weekday morning. NBC's "Today" show 
averaged about 2.9 million, and CBS' "This Morning" averaged about 2.1 million.

KABC-AM RETOOLS AFTERNOON SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Dodgers season is over, KABC-AM (790) is putting more drive into 
its afternoon drive-time programming while cutting back on sports. 
</P>
<P>
The weekday changes, instituted Thursday, revolve around the troubled 
"Sportstalk" program hosted by Ed (Superfan) Bieler, which has not been as 
successful in its ratings as station officials had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Bieler, who had a four-hour show from 4 to 8 p.m. last year when the Dodgers 
ended their season, was cut back to a two-hour show, from 5 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Kaplan, the self-proclaimed "Motor Mouth to the Stars" who currently hosts 
a Sunday show on KABC, has been given the 7 to 9 p.m. slot to dispense 
automotive advice. Talk-show host Ira Fistell, who had been on from 8 p.m. to 
midnight, will now be heard beginning at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Dueling Bills," the one-hour political commentary show featuring 
Bill Press and Bill Pearl, has been expanded by an hour, and will air from 3 to 
5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
KABC also said Thursday that it is shaking up its weekend lineup: 
</P>
<P>
* Steve Edwards, the co-host of "A.M. Los Angeles" on KABC Channel 7, has been 
signed to host a Sunday talk show from 10 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
* Peter Tilden's Saturday show, which aired from 3 to 5 p.m., has been moved to 
10 a.m. to 1 p.m., with "The Pet Show" moving to a 1 p.m. start and "The Food 
Show" to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* Restaurant critic Elmer Dills' Sunday show, which airs from 4 to 8 p.m., will 
now end at 7. 
</P>
<P>
* Another new show, "Electronic Goodies and Gadgets with Steve Kruschen," will 
debut Sunday from 7 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fox, operations director for KABC, denied that the changes in the 
weekday afternoon schedule were made in response to the disappointing showing 
of "Sportstalk." He said that the conclusion of the Dodgers season allowed the 
station to add "some interesting personalities." 
</P>
<P>
"We have wanted to expand the 'Dueling Bills' to enable them to be more 
flexible," Fox said. The show will add a weekly segment in which listeners 
could call in with "the most outrageous news story of the week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We also wanted to bring Leon Kaplan on because his Sunday talk show is so 
popular," he said. "People have been clamoring for more Leon. He's a 
down-to-earth individual that people really seem to like."

<P>
SILVER LAKE: THE RELIGIOUS ORDER THAT OWNS THE ESTATE PLANS TO KEEP AND REPAIR 
IT. THIS DECISION IS A RELIEF TO NEIGHBORS AND PRESERVATIONISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending two years of speculation, an order of nuns has announced that it will 
scrap plans to sell a five-acre mountaintop estate in Silver Lake that was once 
the home of a Los Angeles oil heiress during her marriage to a silent movie 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Having failed to find a buyer, the Mexico-based Franciscan Missionary Sisters 
of the Immaculate Conception has decided instead to repair the 
earthquake-damaged mansion as a retreat and training facility for nuns. The 
home for girls -- which was the primary use of the house from 1929 until it was 
damaged in the October, 1987, earthquake -- will not be reopened because the 
four nuns who ran the facility are either aged or infirm. 
</P>
<P>
Although the decision put to rest the fears of both neighbors and historic 
preservationists that the wooded property would be subdivided, it also leaves 
the religious order burdened with a restoration project that could cost more 
than $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I have joy and at the same time I have fright," said Sister Benigna, the 
spunky but elderly nun who supervised the girls' home for decades and now is 
responsible for raising the money for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
In an understated letter announcing the change of plans, Sister Benigna asked 
neighbors and supporters for help in financing the restoration of the 1922 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I said, 'Oh, we can do it.' Now, I wonder if they are that much 
willing to help or able to," the nun said, referring to people who live near 
the mansion as well as a group of volunteers affiliated with the order. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-Italian-style villa, which commands a 360-degree view of the city 
from the highest point of Micheltorena Street, was declared uninhabitable after 
several cracks appeared in its unreinforced masonry walls during the 1987 
quake. The handful of girls living there were moved to other homes and the four 
nuns moved into a converted stable on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the anticipated cost of the repairs, the leadership of the 
Franciscan Sisters decided to sell. The proceeds were to be used to build a 
preschool to serve poor families in the San Fernando Valley, an attorney 
representing the order said. 
</P>
<P>
However, residents of the steep neighborhood around the property objected when 
Los Angeles developer John Rizzo negotiated an option to buy the property for 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The residents circulated a petition and wrote to the order's provincial 
headquarters in San Fernando and to Archbishop Roger M. Mahoney opposing any 
change in the use of the site. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the Los Angeles Conservancy successfully pressed to have 
the property designated a historic-cultural monument on the virtue of its 
architecture and unusual history. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion had been the home of Daisy Canfield Danziger, the daughter of oil 
magnate Charles A. Canfield, and silent film star Antonio Moreno during their 
brief, illustrious marriage. Moreno at the time was second only to Valentino in 
popularity as a Latin screen lover. In a report supporting the nomination, 
historian Portia Lee described the mansion as the setting of lavish Sunday 
gatherings that mixed Moreno's Hollywood acquaintances with the Canfields' 
society connections. 
</P>
<P>
The social life at the mansion ended abruptly in 1928 with the breakup of the 
marriage, but the villa was converted to a girls' home and was maintained 
almost without change by the Canfield family charity. In accordance with their 
father's will, Daisy Canfield and her two sisters deeded the estate to the 
Chloe P. Canfield Memorial Home, a training facility for girls established in 
their mother's name. 
</P>
<P>
When the foundation was dissolved in the early 1950s, the Los Angeles Catholic 
Archdiocese bought the property and deeded it to the Franciscan Sisters who 
continued to run the girls' home until the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, opponents of the estate's sale considered legal action to enforce 
the original deed requiring the property to remain a facility for girls. 
However, when it was designated as a monument by the Los Angeles Cultural 
Heritage Commission in August, 1988, developer Rizzo dropped his plans without 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher J. Anderson, an attorney who represented the sisters, said at the 
time that they intended to continue looking for a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, the Micheltorena property has become like an expensive antique 
automobile," Anderson said then. "Collecting and fixing up antique cars and 
homes is something for the rich." 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy offered to help the sisters find a developer who was committed 
to preserving the house as part of a development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next six months, several inquiries came to the conservancy, said 
preservation officer Teresa Grimes. Proposals included building homes around 
the Canfield-Moreno house, restoring it as a bed-and-breakfast business or a 
hotel and -- in a concept put forward by actor Billy Barty -- converting it 
into a home for little people. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes said all the potential buyers were referred to the sisters' real estate 
agent, but none pursued their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone was prepared to pay $6.5 million," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the estate fell off abruptly in the spring of 1989, Grimes said. 
Since then, the order maintained complete silence on the disposition of the 
property until Sister Benigna's letters went out last month. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, Sister Benigna organized a $20 a person fund-raising event 
that included dinner and tours of the house. The event raised about $4,000, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that and the requests for donations, Sister Benigna said, she has no 
comprehensive plan for raising the money. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just planning on God, divine providence and the good will of the 
people," she said.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: NOW WHAT WAS IT THAT THE ALEX THEATRE NEEDED SAVING FROM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, a willowy Hollywood type who had recently moved to Glendale 
had a mega-vision for his new community. 
</P>
<P>
He saw sleepy Brand Boulevard awakened by searchlights and limousines. He saw 
Hollywood celebrities mingling with Glendale's movers and shakers, gathered to 
witness the story of the city's most treasured cultural artifact and, in the 
same act, to commence its rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
There would be a cast of 50 on the stage of the Alex Theatre, where live 
performances hadn't been seen for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a Broadway-style revue, they would sing and dance the story of the Alex 
itself. It would be a two-night sellout at $50 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Shipton, the man who foresaw all this, said he would write the script 
himself, choreograph the dance routines, direct the show and do it all with 
volunteers, so the Alex would get the money. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there was one more thing, Shipton said, immune to self-doubt: Bob Hope 
would be there in person. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who would fall for a line like that has got to be some kind of sap. But, 
at the appointed time last week, it turned out exactly as Shipton said. He had 
neglected only one detail, that Hope would deliver a monologue just for the 
Alex. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a shame the way they're turning big, beautiful theaters into cold 
complexes with multiple screens," the comedian said. "It's like the Japanese 
buying the White House and turning it condo. . . . I think Glendale, the state, 
everybody should get behind this campaign and try to save this very valuable 
landmark. And I'm happy to help." 
</P>
<P>
When Bob Hope speaks, Glendale listens. To ask around town this week, it's hard 
to find anyone who remembers just what the 65-year-old vaudeville palace and 
movie hall was being saved from -- certainly not the wrecker's ball. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, four of whom missed the show while touring dams up north, 
remember with absolute clarity that they were always for saving the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
"My support of the Alex Theatre is non-wavering," Mayor Larry Zarian said 
Tuesday. "I feel strongly that the Alex Theatre is not only historic, but it is 
a part of Glendale and it must remain." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Glendale Historical Society, the civic group that started the "Save 
the Alex" movement, became vague on just what the danger was. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt the City Council wasn't sure what they were going to do 
with it," said Andrea Humberger, president of the society, soft-pedaling the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The enemy, then, was indifference, indecision, uncertainty. Those crept into 
the picture, all agree, some years ago when an Orange County arts consultant 
advised the city to replace the Alex with something better -- a municipal 
theater built for the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
The report became gospel for some in City Hall, but the Glendale Historical 
Society -- the same group that has single-mindedly battled the city to a 
standstill over a dilapidated Victorian house -- thought nothing could be 
better than the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the historical society issued a position paper saying the Alex 
could be restored for performing arts at much below the cost of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
"The next phase was you had to go somewhere from issuing a position paper," 
Humberger said. "That's how we came up with the idea of a show." 
</P>
<P>
The historical society proved better at fighting City Hall than producing 
shows, however. 
</P>
<P>
The plan languished until Shipton, a former New York dancer then directing in 
Hollywood, came looking for a way to become involved in his new community. 
</P>
<P>
In volunteer organizations, those who say they can perform get the chance. 
Shipton's objectives were clear: prove that the Alex can handle a large live 
show, demonstrate that the community cares and raise, say, $50,000 to pay for a 
renovation and marketing plan. 
</P>
<P>
With no budget for talent, Shipton put together a volunteer chorus line that 
looked as ragged as an elementary school class photo. Through months of 
rehearsals, he molded the short ones and the heavy ones, the tall ones and the 
awkward ones into a dancing machine that focused on a few good voices and a few 
good legs. 
</P>
<P>
His story was devilishly good. Ostensibly, the history of the Alex, it was more 
subtly a nostalgic look at life in Glendale through the tumult of the last six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The community cared. For a moment after Hope arrived Thursday night, a near 
stampede enveloped the city's top financiers, developers, commissioners, school 
trustees, society matrons, a county supervisor and state senator. The only 
person who wasn't ecstatic as the bodies kept squeezing into the already packed 
foyer was a worried-looking fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
No one went away displeased. What the show lacked in dazzling athletics, it 
made up in warmth, verve, schmaltz and, of course, numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a 50-member cast on the stage and it was sensational," boasted David L. 
Smith, a member of the historical society. 
</P>
<P>
When it ended, there was a standing ovation, at least partly inspired by the 
20-foot-wide doughnut-shaped galactic starship that floated out from the 
balcony during the "Star Wars" scene. 
</P>
<P>
And, this week, there is no indifference or uncertainty to be found about the 
Alex.

CITY EXTENDS CREDIT TO EXPAND MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their first declared action to expand the Glendale Galleria, city officials 
on Tuesday endorsed a bookkeeping move to extend an additional $4.16 million in 
credit in city funds to the Redevelopment Agency to purchase downtown property. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used by the agency to buy three properties south of the 
shopping mall, between Broadway and Colorado Street, Central Avenue and Orange 
Street, said Jeanne Armstrong, redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
The agency already owns about half of the property in the area, but had not 
announced plans for any specific development. Armstrong said a comprehensive 
report on expanding the Galleria will be presented to the agency within six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Major stores reportedly contemplating locations in the expanded Galleria 
include Robinson's and May Co., and possibly a new and larger Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the city has loaned funds to the Redevelopment Agency to purchase 
property and make improvements downtown, such as street and sidewalk 
renovations along Brand Boulevard. The money is repaid to the city from the $8 
million to $9 million in property taxes earned annually by the agency from new 
development. The five City Council members also serve as agency directors. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loan brings the agency's indebtedness to the city to a record $27.5 
million.

COUNCIL OKS $500,000 FOR COURT FIGHT OVER CITY PARKING GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday authorized spending up to $500,000 on 
legal fees in its lawsuit against the builder of a city parking garage that was 
completed more than a year later than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which seeks more than $1.43 million, accuses Taylor Woodrow 
Construction Corp. of New York of fraud and breach of contract in construction 
of the $7.1-million multilevel garage at 115 N. Maryland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The parking garage was completed last November. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow last month filed a countersuit seeking about $4.9 million from 
the city, which the contractor blames for delays in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The city in June hired Los Angeles attorney Irwin E. Sandler, a veteran in 
construction litigation, to represent it. Sandler said Tuesday that the amount 
of damages sought by the city may be increased significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted 4 to 1 to allocate the legal funds. Councilman Larry 
Zarian dissented, saying the sum was too large and the lawsuit too risky.

MAN ROBBED WHILE FEEDING STRAY CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Echo Park man was stabbed and robbed early Saturday morning in the 4000 
block of Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Margolis, 49, told police that he was feeding stray cats in the area 
near Sunset Boulevard and Sanborn Avenue when he was approached by two 
assailants who demanded that he turn over his money, Detective Maria Rivas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis told police that one of the two assailants demanded his money and 
pushed him. Margolis said he pushed the man back. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant pulled a knife and once again ordered Margolis to turn over his 
money and forced him to the ground, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis tried to run away, but the assailant stabbed him several times in the 
lower back before the two men escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis got to a business where he was given assistance, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis was taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where earlier this 
week he was in serious condition.

The Clock Ticks: More than 6 million Californians will be unable to vote in the 
Nov. 6 general election unless they register by Tuesday, Secretary of State 
March Fong Eu is warning. There were 13,169,309 people registered in the state 
as of Sept. 7, which is 68.4% of the 19,244,902 people eligible to vote. 
Registration materials are available at county election offices, many libraries 
and other public offices or by calling 1-800-345-VOTE.

Debate cycle: There may be more action outside the KNBC studios than inside on 
Sunday when Democrat Dianne Feinstein is to meet Republican Pete Wilson in the 
first of two televised debates. Dennis Thompson, the Libertarian candidate for 
governor, is so angry at being excluded that he promises to arrive at the 
Burbank studio and demand entrance. Thompson and whose army? He vows to arrive 
in a convertible accompanied by "100 Vietnam Veteran motorcyclists." 
</P>
<P>
Running scared: The Los Angeles Chapter of the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons seems to have capitalized on the "throw the bums out" fever sweeping 
political life. The group invited candidates in eight contested congressional 
races to speak at an issues forum. While the challengers agreed, all but two 
incumbents initially balked. "They didn't want to give the challengers 
credibility," said spokesman Lee Weinstein. That began to change after the 
distribution of some scathing press releases and a reminder that the November 
ballot contains two ballot measures that would limit terms of incumbents. Four 
have now signed on and Weinstein expects others to follow. "They may be a 
little nervous, at least I hope so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion vote: The California Abortion Rights League has begun a statewide 
effort to persuade 200,000 to 300,000 abortion rights supporters to cast their 
votes with absentee ballots. The effort is intended to demonstrate the 
political clout of California's abortion rights lobby and will give the league 
a valuable mailing and phone list from which to target candidates who do not 
agree with its position. Among the prime targets is Republican lieutenant 
governor candidate Marian Bergeson, who openly opposes legalized abortions. 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FACT 
</P>
<P>
* It cost supporters of the 13 initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot about $1 per 
signature -- totaling out to about $1 million -- to qualify their measures for 
the ballot, according to the California Commission on Campaign Financing. That 
is an increase of nearly 2,200% during the last 14 years.

PARK ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE QUIMBY ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Quimby Act, passed in 1965 and authored by San Bernardino County 
Assemblyman John P. Quimby, requires developers to set aside 2.5 acres of 
parkland for every 1,000 residents or donate money to parks departments if they 
build within a one-mile radius of a park. Here's a list of land in the city of 
Los Angeles acquired through the Quimby program since February, 1976.

BRINGING HOCKEY BACK TO SAN DIEGO IS NO EASY TASK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dudes and dolls wearing jams and bikinis may cause a commotion in the dead calm 
of a Midwest winter, but it's business as usual when you live in the 
sun-drenched West. 
</P>
<P>
Don Waddell arrived in San Diego from Michigan in June, and it didn't take the 
Gulls general manager long to conclude that his most successful marketing 
promotion -- a beach night -- would wash out here. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our most successful contest in Michigan," Waddell said. "It draws a lot 
of people and attention and sold the rink out every year we did it in February. 
Here, it probably wouldn't draw as many people as in Flint." 
</P>
<P>
Given Waddell's workload, the promotion was a minor issue in the bigger 
picture. Still, it was a gentle reminder that minor league hockey operations in 
a minor league city are as different as those in a major league city as the 
cities themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"In a major market, things are more complex," Waddell said. "Start with the 
media. (In Flint) I had one newspaper and three TV stations to work with. Here, 
there are so many more. I have to spend a lot of time to take care of 
everything they need." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper coverage varies dramatically from market to market. 
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, the Arizona Republic's hockey writer doesn't travel with the team 
and files 12- to 15-inch stories for home games. From the road, they are 4-6 
inches. The paper runs an average of two feature stories a month and a 30-inch 
hockey notes column, including NHL information, on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
The Peoria Journal Star is running a special hockey section, with eight stories 
devoted to the Peoria Rivermen. In addition to its 15- to 18-inch game stories 
-- for both home and away games -- the paper runs a hockey notes column on 
Tuesdays and at least one feature a week. Its writer travels with the team 
occasionally. Dealing with the media is only a small part of the battle to 
survive in a big city. Of the 11 teams in the International Hockey League, six 
are in markets where they compete with the loyalties of fans of major league 
professional teams. The IHL season, which runs from early October to early 
April, creates a tremendous overlap, and minor league hockey is always forced 
to share the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
The problem multiplies for clubs in cities with highly visible college programs 
as the prospective fan base shrinks further. 
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, the Golden Blades compete not only against the Jazz but 
against Division I basketball, according to Mark Kelly, public relations 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big college basketball state," Kelly said. "We have Utah State, 
Utah, BYU and Weber State, and they're all within a radius of 65 miles. Sure we 
have our niche, our crowd, but when push comes to shove, in the media, for 
example, the Jazz get No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee, the Western Division's oldest member, is in its 13th year in the 
IHL. General Manager Phil Wittliff said the franchise's success can be traced 
to the commitment of owners Lloyd and Jane Pettit, who had the Admirals' 
17,900-capacity Bradley Center built -- the NBA Bucks also play there -- and to 
management's ability to get fans out to the rink. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is marketing," Wittliff said. "We have to create a reason for them 
to come out and see a hockey game rather than anything else. One of the hardest 
things is creating an interest in the players because of the name-recognition 
problem. We're in competition with baseball and football for that." 
</P>
<P>
Wittliff said the importance of public appearances can't be discounted. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had players and coaches making hundreds of personal appearances," he 
said. "We go from Kiwanis club to speaking to preschoolers, and I wouldn't want 
to say who was more important. We're trying to create as much publicity as we 
can. It's a continual battle." 
</P>
<P>
Waddell said that in Flint last year, his players made 137 appearances in a 
185-day season. The possibilities in a city the size of San Diego more than 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
"We could do that many and more," he said. "It's very important to get the 
players out in the community." 
</P>
<P>
In the smaller markets, where they are the only game in town, hockey players 
don't have as much territory to cover, and they are as high profile as their 
major league brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Take Muskegon, Mich., population 38,775. Lumberjacks owner and General Manager 
Larry Gordon said his players are well-known and well-loved in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The players care about the community, and the community cares about them," 
Gordon said. "Everyone recognizes them on the street, and their pictures are in 
the paper every week. They're held in very high esteem here. Because of the 
support, they want to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said the small pickings of activities in the town keep the team focused, 
and enables him to keep a watchful eye on their social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a lot of distractions," Gordon said. "There are no beaches and 
no Disneyland. If you get a bad apple, you can catch them right away. In a 
small town, you hear about everything before it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Gulls can expect to lure more than transplanted Easterners or 
Midwesterners or the occasional curiosity seeker, they must educate the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our support is coming from transplants, people who know hockey," 
Kansas City General Manager Tom Rieger said. "The next step is to convert 
non-hockey people. We've got to get them here and to learn the game. We have 
'How to Watch Hockey,' booklets, clinics at the rink, and we talk to groups." 
</P>
<P>
Said Milwaukee's Wittliff: "Americans don't understand hockey like they do 
basketball, baseball and football. They don't play hockey. That's one of the 
battles we have." 
</P>
<P>
Like Kansas City, Milwaukee passes out a rule book at games, and players give 
clinics. Waddell said similar plans have been put on the back burner simply 
because he hasn't had time, but he would like to see them implemented next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Along with San Diego and Albany, Kansas City is a new kid on the IHL block. The 
Kansas City situation mirrors San Diego's more than anyplace's, because both 
have professional baseball, football, soccer and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City drew 5,200 to an early exhibition game, a tribute, Rieger said, to 
the city's hockey fans. To keep the numbers up, however, an advertising blitz 
is a must. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chiefs and Royals have been here forever, and soccer has been here 10 
years," Rieger said. "We're after the winter sports dollar, and now they have 
to make a choice. We're new in town. That's giving us an advantage. Our direct 
competition is the soccer team, but we haven't heard from anyone that they 
haven't bought hockey tickets because there's a direct conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Waddell said the success of the Sockers might work in the Gulls' favor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about an area with a draw of 2.5 million people," he said, "The 
more people we can introduce to the Sports Arena and sporting events, the more 
it's beneficial to both of us. If someone comes out to watch a soccer game 
Thursday, there's a better chance they're more likely to come out and watch us 
Friday."

A jury today acquitted an art gallery and its director on obscenity charges for 
exhibiting sexually graphic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts Center, smiled as the verdict 
was read. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators in the courtroom shouted and applauded, and Barrie hugged his 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of four men and four women returned the verdicts of innocent after only 
a few hours' deliberation in the nation's first obscenity trial of an art 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery and Barrie were acquitted on misdemeanor charges of pandering 
obscenity and using children in nudity-related material. Barrie could have been 
sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000, and the gallery fined $10,000, 
if convicted on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor charges stemmed from the exhibit "Robert Mapplethorpe: The 
Perfect Moment," which appeared in Cincinnati for seven weeks last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Prouty, an assistant city prosecutor, said in his closing argument that 
five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men and two that showed 
children with their genitals exposed were enough for convictions. The charges 
were based on those seven pictures in the 175-photo exhibit.

A 6-foot, 240-pound woman was jailed for grabbing her daughter's 64-year-old 
kindergarten teacher by the throat and throwing her to the classroom floor, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Benita McCrae, 30, was being held on $10,000 bail on suspicion of assaulting a 
school official. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter was turned over to the county Department of Children's Services, 
Detective Gary Barthelmess said. 
</P>
<P>
McCrae took her 5-year-old daughter Thursday morning to Toluca Lake Elementary 
School, where the child was newly enrolled. McCrae told the teacher that she 
wanted to spend the entire day in class with the child. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher, Marjorie Swanter, said she would not allow an all-day visit but 
said the mother could stay for 20 minutes. An argument ensued and, Barthelmess 
said, McCrae "grabbed the . . . teacher by the throat and threw her to the 
ground."

THOMAS RETIRES AMID CHARGES OF MISMANAGEMENT

Los Angeles Zoo Director Warren Thomas, who replenished animal collections and 
renovated exhibits at the Griffith Park zoo only to see his 16-year tenure 
repeatedly marred by administrative controversies, announced today that he was 
retiring from his post. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 59, gave no immediate reason for his decision. Mayor Tom Bradley said 
that Thomas' retirement was voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo director had been targeted by an investigation by city auditors and 
embattled by federal inspectors' reports that animals had been living in filth 
and substandard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Jensen, assistant general manager of the Department of Recreation and 
Parks, said Thomas believed that "the recent developments at the zoo . . . 
denigrated himself and the zoo and he felt the need to retire." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said Thomas' retirement was accepted "with some concern and sadness. He 
built one of the greatest animal collections . . . in the world." No plans have 
been made for a replacement, but a decision will be made "in the very near 
future," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief press statement, the zoo director said: "I will leave with a variety 
of emotions, one of which will be, of course, sadness." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said Thomas' retirement "closes the books" on his turbulent tenure at 
the zoo. But City Councilman Joel Wachs disagreed, vowing to hold public 
hearings on allegations of financial irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
City auditors are investigating Thomas' use of a bank account that sources told 
The Times was set and controlled by him without the knowledge of his superiors. 
The account was established with miscellaneous fees that film companies and 
other firms paid for using the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations about the bank account surfaced as Thomas was defending the zoo 
from criticism by federal Department of Agriculture inspectors about the 
animals' "unheard of" living conditions. The department cited the zoo for more 
than three years of chronic health violations. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors who combed zoo grounds last July found rodents jumping out of feed 
bags, gorillas living in inadequately ventilated barns, sanitation and drainage 
problems and toxic substances stored with food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and other city officials said that most of the conditions had since been 
remedied. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a zoologist and veterinarian who ran city zoos in Oklahoma City and 
Omaha, was named in May, 1974, to take over the Los Angeles zoo. The facility 
had been beset by reports of poor conditions and called a "graveyard" by one 
city panel after the deaths of several animals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he was accused of mishandling the disappearance of 200 ivory pieces 
entrusted to the zoo, then later cleared by a country grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1986, Thomas was fired by the city for problems with his purchase and 
sale of animals and for his alleged use of ethnic slurs against zoo employees. 
Thomas appealed the action and in December, 1987, he was reinstated by a 
federal judge who ruled that his civil rights had been violated.

In a strong, firm voice, Charles H. Keating Jr. announced this morning in 
criminal court that he is "absolutely not guilty" of 42 state securities fraud 
charges stemming from his company's bond sales at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, former chairman of Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., appeared 
relaxed and confident as he and three co-defendants completed their 
arraignments in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The other three, all former executives, also pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
After the brief hearing, Keating waved to several family members and friends as 
he was led back to the Los Angeles County Jail, where he has remained since 
Sept. 18. He has been unable to post a $5-million bail set by a Superior Court 
judge. Keating is waiting for the state Supreme Court to act on his request to 
lower the bail. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner assigned the case to Judge Lance A. Ito. 
Ito, a Los Angeles County prosecutor for 10 years, was appointed to the 
Municipal Court bench in 1987 and elevated to the Superior Court last year. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment represents the first criminal charges brought against anyone 
since the collapse of American Continental and Lincoln in April, 1989.

The Communist Party leadership said today that annual Revolution Day 
festivities will go ahead next month, raising the risk of another humiliation 
on Moscow's Red Square for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Any attempts to deprive our multinational people of its main state celebration 
is illegitimate and unfounded," the Communist Party's secretariat said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Radical politicians have called for the cancellation of civilian festivities 
Nov. 7 in Moscow and have urged people to channel their efforts instead into 
patching up the city ahead of the harsh winter. At last year's Revolution Day 
parade, about 10,000 Muscovites organized an alternative demonstration during 
which they called on the Communists to surrender their monopoly of power.

Tropical Storm Klaus gained strength off Antigua today and was upgraded to a 
hurricane after leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the 
Caribbean island of Martinique. 
</P>
<P>
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus had sustained winds of 80 
m.p.h. this morning, up from 60 m.p.h. earlier. 
</P>
<P>
It remained stalled 30 miles off Antigua but was expected to start moving 
again. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain whether Klaus, the sixth named hurricane of the season, would 
reach the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the northwest and to 
be north of Puerto Rico and east of the Bahamas. Beyond that, it's too early to 
say," the Hurricane Center said.

Iraq's foreign minister today accused the United States and its allies of 
bringing "the entire world to the brink of a devastating war" in a quest to 
gain control of the Middle East's oil. 
</P>
<P>
In the prepared text of an oft-postponed speech, Tarik Aziz said the U.N. 
Security Council was hypocritical when it penalized Iraq for its invasion of 
Kuwait while allowing Israel to continue occupying Arab lands seized in the 
1967 and 1973 wars. 
</P>
<P>
He proposed that all Middle East problems -- "Palestine, Lebanon, the gulf and 
others" -- be considered on the same basis. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi envoy was to read the Aziz speech to the General Assembly tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Aziz said America and its allies "are seeking to gain control over the oil 
reserves in the gulf so as to have a free hand in manipulating the needs of the 
world, and especially the needs of the peoples of the Third World, for this 
important commodity." 
</P>
<P>
He accused Iraq's foes of mobilizing "fleets, aircraft and ground forces in the 
region in a way that has no parallel in contemporary history, thus bringing the 
entire region, nay the entire world, to the brink of a devastating war." 
</P>
<P>
In other Persian Gulf action today: 
</P>
<P>
* Iraq allowed four Germans to leave the country after talks in Baghdad between 
a former high-ranking East German official and the Iraqi government. The move 
was seen as a gesture to the newly reunited nation. About 300 Germans remain in 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
* The State Department said in Washington that about 300 Americans and 
foreign-born family members have signed up for an evacuation flight due to 
leave Kuwait next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers will arrive at Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina on 
Thursday after an overnight stop in London. The flight will be the first U.S. 
government-sponsored charter to evacuate Americans and their family members 
since Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
* In London, British officials said Baghdad has asked foreign companies to 
provide lists of their employees who are older than 55 and trapped in Iraq or 
Kuwait.

SHARP DROP IN CRIME PROMPTS POLICE TO LIFT SOWETO CURFEW

<P>
Police today lifted a 10-day-old, nighttime curfew in the black township of 
Soweto because a sharp drop in political violence and crime no longer made the 
restrictions necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Police imposed the 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew Sept. 25 in Soweto and other nearby 
townships to halt black factional fighting around Johannesburg that has claimed 
800 lives in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
Only scattered incidents have been reported in recent weeks, and Law and Order 
Minister Adriaan Vlok said serious crime in Soweto had dropped by about 
two-thirds compared to the 10 days before the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Vlok praised residents in Soweto for "outstanding cooperation" with the police. 
</P>
<P>
The curfew will remain in effect in several other townships, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress, the leading black opposition movement, had 
opposed the curfew, saying it was implemented to weaken the normal 
organizational activities of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments today, Nelson Mandela and other ANC officials met leaders 
of five black homelands at Mandela's home in Soweto. However, Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu homeland and head of the conservative Inkatha 
movement, declined to attend.

The Bell Atlantic consortium withdrew its winning bid to buy 60% of the

</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the public works ministry said late Thursday that a consortium 
led by the Italian telephone company Stet will instead take over the northern 
half of the company. That group is composed of Stet, France Cables et Radio, 
Perez Companc and Morgan Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Telefonica de Espana and Citicorp won the bid to buy the controlling 
interest in the southern half of Entel. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Entel is part of a larger plan by Argentine President Carlos Saul 
Menem to privatize money-losing state-owned business.

An Australian bank today offered an $8,300 reward in an effort to catch the 
source of rumors that the bank was near collapse. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Brisbane-based Metway Bank said he believed the bank had been 
the target of a deliberate and malicious campaign that should not go 
unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not see why the company should be exposed to this sort of scurrilous 
lies," the spokesman said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The reward would be paid for information leading to the conviction of the 
culprits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nervous depositors lined up at branches of Metway this week when rumors began 
circulating about the bank's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank, Australia's central bank, stemmed the rush Thursday when it 
assured depositors that Metway is sound and that speculation about its 
stability was unfounded.

Swedes were in an uproar today over their king's unprecedented comment that the 
Swedish work ethic leaves something to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that we maybe should think about the Swedish work ethic and try and 
improve it in one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
I assume we're all aware that it is not the best," King Carl XVI Gustaf, 44, 
told Dagens Industri in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish monarch rarely speaks out on political or controversial matters. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction came swiftly. Some people agreed with the king but others suggested he 
was speaking for himself and his acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if he ever tried to work himself," said librarian Anna Simkutte, 
labeling the royal comment "utmost rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that the king makes his statement from the circles where he dwells 
himself," labor federation spokesman Staffan Kellerborg said.

BRITAIN TO LINK POUND TO OTHER EMS MONEYS

<P>
Britain said today it will tie the British pound to other currencies in the 
European Monetary System, ending its long opposition to linking its economic 
policy with the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
The change will take effect Monday and will mean that Britain will have to 
adjust its economic policies and interest rates to ensure that the pound stays 
within a certain range against the other currencies in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The EMS already includes almost all 12 members of the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has been the main opponent of a linked currency system. Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher has said that it would restrict the government's ability to 
set economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over whether to join the EMS has also become a symbol of how much 
power Britain is willing to give up as it moves closer to integration with its 
fellow European Community nations. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Treasury today also said Britain will cut interest rates by 
1 percentage point to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about inflation, Britain has among the highest interest rates of any 
of the EC nations. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was greeted favorably in the financial markets. The bellwether 
Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares soared 59.6 points 
in afternoon trading to 2,1300. The British pound also rose sharply.

No charges have been filed against Nebraska quarterback Mickey Joseph in 
connection with his arrest on suspicion of criminal mischief Sept. 27, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't file anything at the moment because we have witnesses who are 
uncooperative and contradictory in their statements," said Lancaster County 
Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Heavican. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, 22, was arrested after trying to enter a second-story apartment through 
a window. 
</P>
<P>
Cornhuskers Coach Tom Osborne and Joseph's attorney have said the incident was 
a misunderstanding that developed when Joseph tried to enter his girlfriend's 
apartment to get his course syllabus and accidentally broke the window. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, the girlfriend's roommate told officers there had 
been a domestic dispute going on for several hours before the incident 
occurred.

PIRATE BULLPEN MAKES OFF WITH BOOTY

<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates' no-name bullpen saw all the pre-playoff attention that 
Cincinnati's "Nasty Boys" relievers got and it made them -- well, nasty. 
</P>
<P>
All of the analysts, all of the advance scouts, many of the National League's 
players and managers agreed the one big advantage the Reds had over Pittsburgh 
was the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
So why couldn't the Reds hold a 3-0 lead? Why did Nasty Boy left-hander Norm 
Charlton give up the winning run in the Pirates' 4-3 victory Thursday? And why 
did Pittsburgh's who-are-these-guys bullpen by committee pitch three scoreless 
innings? 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't gotten a lot of respect all year," said rookie Stan Belinda, 
who retired all six hitters he faced. "It really didn't bother us. But Jimmy 
(Leyland) rested us before the playoffs and we're real strong." 
</P>
<P>
Down the stretch, Leyland used right-hander Vicente Palacios, recalled after 
postseason rosters were frozen on Sept. 1, as his closer. That took the 
pressure off a bullpen that slumped during the dog days of August and a 
six-game losing streak in early September. 
</P>
<P>
Until what Belinda called "that little rough spell," the bullpen of Belinda, 
Ted Power, Bill Landrum, Bob Kipper, Bob Patterson and, until he was traded, 
Scott Ruskin, led the league with a 21-7 record. They finished 28-18 with a 
2.96 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
Leyland is grooming Belinda, a side-arm throwing right-hander with a 90-m.p.h. 
fastball, as his closer of the future. And, like most young pitchers who rely 
on heat, Belinda (3-4, 3.55 ERA, eight saves) can be awesome or awful. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of managers wouldn't have used me in the situations Jimmy did," he said. 
"But he had enough guts to use me in tight situations. He built up a lot of 
confidence in me. I came in there pumped up tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Reds owner Marge Schott makes Charlie Finley, the stingy former owner of the 
A's, seem like a big spender. Schott, who counts paper clips, really aggravated 
the visiting Pirates when playoff tickets were allotted. 
</P>
<P>
Each player received one ticket in the second-level seats and the rest in the 
upper-level seats, a long distance from the field. The Pirates were seething 
over the shabby treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should sit Marge under the scoreboard clock (in center field) when 
the Reds come to Cincinnati," bullpen Coach Rich Donnelly said. "Our people 
have been treating opposing people well all year. This isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
The players were even tougher on Schott. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky our tickets aren't on the roof of the hotel overlooking the 
stadium," pitcher Bob Walk said. 
</P>
<P>
"Marge Schott is the cheapest human being put on the earth," infielder Wally 
Backman added. 
</P>
<P>
"If her cars are anything like her personality, they're all probably lemons," 
catcher Mike LaValliere declared, referring to Schott's auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
The Game 1 winner has won 13 of the previous 21 NL playoffs. The Pirates also 
won Game 1 in the 1972 playoffs but lost a five-game series to the Reds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had been 0-6 against Cincinnati when one of the Nasty Boys -- 
Charlton, Rob Dibble and Randy Myer pitched. But the Bucs have won their last 
five games in Cincinnati. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have lost four straight playoff games against Pittsburgh, including 
the last three in the 1979 playoffs.

BASEBALL: SWEEP OF THE RED SOX LAST MONTH SENT A MESSAGE TO AL CHALLENGERS.

<P>
Looking ahead to the playoffs, the Oakland A's wanted to send the Boston Red 
Sox a message one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
They did it by ending the Red Sox' 10-game winning streak and sweeping a 
three-game series in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a big message by getting swept," said Oakland's Rickey Henderson. 
"That puts it in their minds that they have to play better against this club. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they know how good we are. They'll probably go back to the drawing 
board now." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox didn't have time to return to a drawing board. They went into a 
tailspin, losing 15 of 21 games, including eight of 10 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
They blew a 6 1/2-game lead and fell 1 1/2 games behind Toronto. Then they 
rallied, winning six of their last eight games to capture their third AL East 
title in five years on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Now Boston's pick and shovel crew, swept by Oakland in four games in the 
playoffs two years ago, get another shot at the Athletics' elite cast in the 
best-of-7 AL playoffs starting Saturday night at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa insisted the law of averages caught up 
with the Red Sox in the sweep, the A's are confident after beating the Chicago 
White Sox by nine games in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're playing to our level, we feel nobody can beat us," said Henderson, 
who hit .516 (16-31) against Boston this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland is a team that knows it will win," says Chicago's Bobby Thigpen, who 
set a major league record with 57 saves this year. "They play these things with 
your mind. It's just the way they act. Nothing fazes them." 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics have awesome power and pitching. Mark McGwire hit 39 home runs 
and Jose Canseco 37, although bothered by a bad back much of the season. Rickey 
Henderson hit .325 with 28 homers -- as the leadoff batter. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we're the underdogs," said Dwight Evans, winding down his 18th season. 
"We know our work is cut out for us. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's been like that for us all season. We just know we're the little guys. 
It's a little like David and Goliath." 
</P>
<P>
Comparative records demand that Oakland, the preseason pick, remain the 
favorite to win a third consecutive pennant. 
</P>
<P>
The A's had a 103-59 record this year, the Red Sox 88-74. Oakland was 56-28 
against the East, Boston 38-46 against the West. 
</P>
<P>
And the A's won eight of 12 games with the Red Sox, including four of six in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me who's the stronger ballclub, we all know the answer is Oakland," 
said Toronto's Mookie Wilson. "But the stronger ballclub doesn't always win." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs conceded "there are a lot of teams that are better than us on paper," but 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"When we beat them, they go back to the locker room and say, 'How did they beat 
us?' It was the little things. This is one of the most fundamentally sound 
teams I've ever been on."

The Texas Rangers exercised a $3.3-million contract option on Nolan Ryan for 
the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolan has made a tremendous contribution to the Rangers the last two years, 
and we are looking forward to his being with the ballclub next year," General 
Manager Tom Grieve said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 43, was 13-9 with a 3.44 ERA in 30 starts in 1990. He led the American 
League with 232 strikeouts and held opponents to a .188 batting average, lowest 
in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan had a strong second half despite failing to get run support and winning 
just two of his last 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched his record sixth no-hitter against Oakland on June 7 and became the 
20th pitcher to reach 300 victories with a win July 31 in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and the Rangers agreed on terms for the 1991 option last April.

MIAMI ONCE AGAIN MAY TAKE SPOILER'S ROLE AS BOWDEN SEEKS HIS 200TH VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plot calls for one of football's most respected coaches to earn his 200th 
career victory by beating a school that has twice denied him the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Reviews are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up, said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who will try for No. 200 
Saturday against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs down, Hurricanes Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't get it this game, I'm sure he'll get it some other game," 
Erickson said. "I'd prefer he wait a week or two." 
</P>
<P>
The game didn't need the anticipation of a Bowden milestone to sell out the 
Orange Bowl. With Florida State (4-0) ranked second and Miami (2-1) ranked 
ninth, the hype would have been high anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seminoles say the chance to give Bowden No. 200 against his chief 
tormentor is tantalizing. 
</P>
<P>
Bowden, 60, is 6-10 against Miami; he's 193-62-3 against all other teams. 
Losses to the Hurricanes cost him a No. 1 finish in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of reaching 200 against anybody are long. Ten major college coaches 
have done it, and only one is active -- Penn State's Joe Paterno, who has 221 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of beating the Hurricanes are long, too. They have won 33 in a row in 
the Orange Bowl. They haven't lost two games in one season since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is stopping them," Bowden said. "They can get 50 points as 
easily as they can get 25. It's a game of inches when you play them -- you miss 
one inch, and they put it in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
A Florida State victory would strengthen its bid for a national title and move 
the Seminoles into first place should top-ranked Notre Dame slip at home 
against Stanford. The Cardinal gave the Irish (3-0) a tough game last year 
before losing 27-17 and played 12th-ranked Colorado tough in its season-opener, 
losing 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
A loss probably would drop Florida State several spots in the rankings. No. 3 
Michigan figures to have little trouble at Wisconsin and No. 4 Auburn should 
roll at home against Louisiana Tech. No 5 Virginia and No. 6 Tennessee are 
idle. 
</P>
<P>
Other games involving Top Ten teams have No. 7 Oklahoma at Oklahoma State, No. 
8 Nebraska at Kansas State and No. 10 Florida at home against Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets you hyped up," Stacey Satterwhite, an Oklahoma State defensive tackle, 
said of the game against the Cowboys' arch-rival, Oklahoma.

COOL CHARM GIRL GOES FOR 3RD IN ROW AT LOS ALAMITOS

Cool Charm Girl will be gunning for her third straight win when she takes on 
archrival Doodlin and three others in the $10,000 distaff pacing invitational 
feature tonight at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the 12-race program is the $8,000 second leg of the Rising Star Series 
for fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
Bonny Bo Scot, victorious in the opening leg of the series last week, will 
tackle Viking Princess, Margarets Chance, The Princess, Vance on Ice, Miss 
Surmo, Perede, Mexicali Lady and Black on Black as she goes for her ninth 
career win. 
</P>
<P>
Cool Charm Girl won in her initial Los Alamitos start on Aug. 24, and on Sept. 
21 she beat Doodlin while posting a lifetime best 1:55. That mile was also the 
fastest ever paced at Los Alamitos by a member of the distaff set. 
</P>
<P>
Doodlin missed by only 2 1/4 lengths in that loss to Cool Charm Girl, while 
pacing her own mile in 1:55 2/5. Rick Kuebler will once again handle the 
driving chores tonight.

CANADIAN CHAMP IZVESTIA EYES GOLD CUP

<P>
The Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes: In horse racing, they are 
known as the Triple Crown. Not to Roger Attfield and his 3-year-old colt 
Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
To them, the triple crown is the Queen's Plate, Prince of Wales and Breeders' 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Attfield will send Canadian Triple Crown winner Izvestia against a 
field of five others in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park with an eye on 
another big American prize, the Breeders' Cup Classic at Belmont on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup also will be the aim of two other favorites Saturday in a big 
weekend of racing at Belmont Park -- Deposit Ticket in the Champagne for 
2-year-old colts and Meadow Star in the Frizette for 2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Sunday, Go For Wand, last year's 2-year-old filly champion and the top 
3-year-old filly in the country this year, is expected to go in the Beldame. 
Sunday's program also includes the Turf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Already considered by many the best 3-year-old colt in North America, Izvestia 
has a shot at Horse of the Year if he performs well in the Gold Cup and 
Breeders' Cup. He was made an early 8-5 favorite for Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia has won his last eight starts, including three on turf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very rare that a horse is successful on both surfaces," said Attfield, 
who also trained 1989 Canadian Triple Crown winner With Approval. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the field will be Steinlen, who was switched from Sunday's Turf Classic 
to the Gold Cup because of the injury to Horse of the Year front-runner 
Criminal Type. Criminal Type, 5-year-old winner of seven stakes races this 
year, has a tender left foreleg and will be sidelined the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-2 co-second favorites are Thirty Six Red, winner of the Gotham and Wood 
last spring at Aqueduct, and Flying Continental, winner of the Strub and San 
Fernando last winter at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field will be made up of Lay Down and De Roche. The 3-year-olds 
-- Izvestia and Thirty Six Red -- will carry 121 pounds. The others will carry 
126. 
</P>
<P>
If all six go, the race will be worth $838,500, with $503,100 going to the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup will be run at 1 1/4 miles for the first time this year to make it 
the same distance as the Breeders' Cup Classic. The Gold Cup had been run at 1 
1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit Ticket, trained by Jeff Lukas, will face a field of 12 other 
2-year-olds in the $500,000-added Champagne. Deposit Ticket had won three 
straight graded stakes until he was upset by Eastern Echo in the Futurity on 
Sept. 15 at Belmont. Eastern Echo will miss the Champagne, however, after 
breaking a bone in his right front ankle while training. He was retired. 
</P>
<P>
The Champagne will be run at one mile, one furlong longer than any of Deposit 
Ticket's previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
Meadow Star, trained by Leroy Jolley, will be the favorite in a field of seven 
2-year-old fillies for the $250,000-added Frizette at one mile. Meadow Star has 
won all five of her career starts, including the Matron last Sept. 16 at 
Belmont.

"People say to me, 'When are you going to retire, Maxene?' I say, 'Well, when I

</P>
<P>
While in Nebraska she will make speeches, including one at a dance to raise 
money for senior centers. 
</P>
<P>
"I love doing these things," Andrews said. "I talk to them (senior citizens) 
about not getting old, if you know what I mean. Just because you've passed that 
mark, you don't have to think that the world is leaving you behind."

ELLA FITZGERALD HASN'T RUN OUT OF SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At age 72, singer Ella Fitzgerald says she still enjoys performing because she 
has something to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to feel like I can give people something they know and want and maybe 
something that's new to them," Fitzgerald said in a telephone interview from 
her home last week. 
</P>
<P>
When she performs, the "first lady of song" gives more than a simple musical 
retrospective of five decades on stage. She also surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"I even did a rap in a concert in Washington," she said. "I was just messing 
around, and they seemed to like it. Sometimes people will ask for a song, and I 
try to do it." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be surprised how many young ones there are there," she says of her 
concerts. "They tell me their parents have my records and that's how they 
learned." 
</P>
<P>
She still loves adoring fans at sold-out concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you thrive on. Sometimes when I'm out, I'll sing to children, and 
their mothers will say, 'Oh my gosh! She's listening to you,' " Fitzgerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the tour buses stop and people wave, and if they catch me outside, I 
take pictures with them. I love that. If people take the time and want to meet 
you, I think's it wonderful."

A movie theater bowed to pressure from town officials and canceled the showing 
of "Henry and June," the first film rated NC-17, the designation that replaced 
the X rating. 
</P>
<P>
Showcase Cinema was to have started screening "Henry and June" today. The film 
based on the diaries of Anais Nin chronicles her affairs with writer Henry 
Miller and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"They can call it whatever they want to call it," Anthony Taurasi, chairman of 
the town's board of selectmen, said Thursday. "If it walks like a duck and 
quacks like a duck then it's a duck. Let's call it what it is." 
</P>
<P>
The Motion Picture Assn. of America replaced the X rating with the NC-17 rating 
on Sept. 26. NC-17 means no one under age 17 can be admitted to the films. 
</P>
<P>
Selectman Frank Geishecker told the Patriot Ledger of Quincy on Wednesday that 
he would consider revoking the theater's license if the film was shown. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not censors," he said. "The censoring is done by the rating bureau. All 
we care is that we preserve the community standards of the town of Dedham. That 
is our mission; that is our job." 
</P>
<P>
Both selectmen admit they have not seen the film released by Universal 
Pictures. Directed by Philip Kaufman and starring Fred Ward and Uma Thurman, 
"Henry and June" received the NC-17 rating because of two lesbian sex scenes 
and a shot of an erotic drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Korf, chief executive of Showcase Cinema's parent company, National 
Amusements Inc., said he pulled the film from the Dedham theater because of 
complaints from the two selectmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I pointed out very strongly this film wasn't rated X," said Fred Mound, 
president of distribution for Universal Pictures. "There was extreme pressure 
coming down. Obviously, I'm very disturbed by it." 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA switch was made exactly to avoid these situations, Mound said. The 
association changed the designation because the X rating carried the stigma of 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Korf said National Amusements had decided to show NC-17-rated films because the 
new rating means they cannot be confused with hard-core pornography films. 
</P>
<P>
Taurasi said that Showcase Cinema had a gentleman's agreement with the town not 
to show X-rated films that the NC-17 rating was "just a way around the ratings 
bureau." 
</P>
<P>
Dedham is a middle-class suburb with more than 25,000 residents, about 10 miles 
south of Boston.
