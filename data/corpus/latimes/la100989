PLUTONIUM THREAT OF GALILEO PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it sadly ironic that soon after we marveled at the ability of the 
Voyager spacecraft to return images from Neptune, the Christic Institute and 
two other citizens groups have filed suit to block the launching of the Galileo 
probe to Jupiter (Part I, Sept. 28-29). If successful, this suit may halt the 
exploration of the outer solar system for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The groups do not seem to consider rationally the risks involved in the launch. 
For there to any chance of radioactive release, a major disaster would have to 
take place during either the launch or the Earth flyby. Even if such a disaster 
occurs, the plutonium is so well encapsulated that an accidental release is 
virtually impossible. In the three previous failures of U.S. spacecraft using 
"radioisotope thermoelectric generators" (RTGs), only one released any 
radioactive material, and that was very finely distributed in the upper 
atmosphere. The other two, which used the new encapsulated design, released no 
radioactive material whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
Given these safety measures, the chances of a dangerous radioactive material 
release are extremely low. The risk is not zero, however, and so this hazard 
needs to be evaluated in comparison with other risks. Consider the number of 
people killed in auto accidents or plane crashes, not to mention natural 
disasters. Given the extremely low odds of a Galileo disaster and the small 
number of fatalities expected from an accident, why does the Christic Institute 
not concentrate upon airline safety or hurricane preparedness? I think Lanny 
Sinkin (a Christic Institute lawyer) answered this when he said, "Our real 
bottom line is, go find an alternative to plutonium." We have developed such a 
fear anything "nuclear" that it becomes impossible to consider the risks 
realistically; we fall victim to nuclear paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
While there are many valid concerns regarding nuclear power here on Earth, or 
even in Earth orbit, a long-range planetary probe faces unique problems. At the 
distance of Jupiter, Galileo will receive only 4% as much sunlight as it would 
at Earth, which would necessitate impossibly large solar panels. Chemical 
batteries and fuel cells would not last the required 8-10 years. A nuclear 
source is the only viable option for the foreseeable future. Given the small 
risks involved, the use of plutonium RTGs seems justified on Galileo, and on 
planned missions such as the Ulysses solar mission, and the mission to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
One can only imagine how the exploration of the Americas would have been 
impeded if 15th Century Europeans had an irrational fear of the magnetic 
compass. Let us hope that our nuclear fears do not lead us to close the door on 
much of the solar system.

PROTECTING WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brown-Ferris Industries, operator of Azusa landfill, cannot be faulted for 
promoting its case against the combined forces of the water industry and state 
environmental groups before the State Water Resources Control Board. A 
potential 40-million ton refuse depository (editorial, "Not the Right Spot to 
Begin With," Sept. 30) generating a rate/ton averaging $15-$25 per ton until 
the expected fill completion date of 2010 adequately reveals the motive. 
Considering the legendary low overhead of the landfill industry, the situation 
looks like a real money machine. 
</P>
<P>
However, Region IX Environmental Protection Agency estimates a 30-year 
$800-million bill required to purify the main San Gabriel basin water table, an 
extensive underground "water tank" or reservoir, which could serve parched Los 
Angeles regional needs if it were adequately cleaned up to contain excess 
winter flows from the State Water Project and Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
The State Water Board's own staff has documented heavy concentrations of a 
great variety of pollutants, including industrial solvents, which amount to the 
greatest underground catastrophe in the state. By a substantial margin, we are 
No. 1. These financial facts expose (former EPA administrator and current) 
Brown-Ferris Chairman William D. Ruchelshaus' offer to build $20 million in 
water treatment facilities at three sites to be puny indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Public Utility Commission regulation, our own water industry might also 
be considered a money machine. Why haven't all the adjudication participants of 
the Main San Gabriel Basin Water Masters installed these suggested water 
treatment facilities on their own or with EPA financial assistant when we 
became a Superfund cleanup site over 5 years ago? The voters of the San Gabriel 
Valley await the answer to this question. 
</P>
<P>
Our basin, critical to the future of Southern California, must be protected. 
Both parties to the dispute have been negligent by not showing adequate 
diligence. The state board should have denied the landfill expansion permit. 
Local control has failed. The state's natural resources are burdened by 
uncompensated costs borne for decades and the cleanup bill is now due.

COLLEGE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We just crammed the new linens and Mac along with the shoe boxes of early life 
mementoes into the Cadillac and drove our third -- and last -- child to 
college. We can set up a dorm room like professionals by now, and have learned 
how to dash off frequent, neutral, comforting letters. 
</P>
<P>
Our current 18 year old leaves home even better prepared and more mature than 
her brother and sister four and two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But her parents fixated at the stage of having teen-agers around. Despite our 
anticipated pleasurable ignorance of the hours she will keep and the diet 
she'll choose, we dreaded the goodby. Although we will be free to have fish and 
eggplant, foods she hates, for dinner every night, we will miss her. 
</P>
<P>
The laundry bin will stand empty; the phone won't ring. Our excitement about 
the professors and peers who will make her think and grow cannot match our 
selfish need for her to need us. 
</P>
<P>
We take the kids to college and they're fine. We only keep the children who 
they were and meet the people they will be when they visit for Thanksgiving.

BEACH TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, volunteers gave up their valuable time to clean up all the trash on 
the local beaches. My point is, why should they do it? 
</P>
<P>
The real culprits are the slobs who leave their trash behind, without even so 
much as a second glance at the mess. I cannot understand why there isn't a 
stiff fine, or even a jail sentence for these people. They should be made to 
take all their own rubbish away, and if a trash container isn't handy, take it 
home and dispose of it on trash day. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches should be policed regularly, and if these people are guilty, ticket 
them, just like illegal parking or not using a seat belt.

Planetary exploration at any risk? 
</P>
<P>
NASA's scheduled shuttle launch on Oct. 12 will bring with it 48 pounds of 
plutonium aboard Project Galileo. As the Challenger disaster tragically 
illustrated in 1986, NASA's space program is not infallible. Furthermore, it is 
believed by some scientists that the plutonium-fueled generator casings are not 
capable of withstanding an accident like Challenger. An even distribution of 
this plutonium is unlikely, but exposure to intense radioactivity now threatens 
many Florida residents if an accident were to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore I ask, should life on Earth be jeopardized by this approach to the 
exploration of Jupiter's atmosphere? Let us insist on the implementation of 
technologies that protect (not threaten) the health of our own planet.

LIST JOE AVERAGE AS A LOSER IF CAPITAL-GAINS PLAN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LEAHY, Michael Leahy is president of Franchise Venture Partners, a 
venture capital and development company in Santa Rosa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critics of President Bush's proposal to reduce capital gains taxes oppose such 
a cut because they believe it will lead to larger budget deficits and a more 
inequitable distribution of wealth. In fact, the proposal will lead to smaller 
budget deficits and a more equitable distribution of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains cut opponents come to their erroneous conclusions because they 
simply do not understand the vital role capital formation plays in fueling 
economic growth. Nor are they familiar with the scarce availability of risk 
capital in our country today. Instead, they are stuck in a zero-sum world where 
it is more important to prevent affluent investors from benefiting than it is 
to provide middle-class and lower-income workers and entrepreneurs the 
opportunity to move up the economic ladder by creating wealth from new 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
A cut in the capital gains tax will have the following positive effects: 
</P>
<P>
* Federal revenues from capital gains taxes will increase in 1990 and 1991, 
because individual and institutional investors will realize capital gains 
earlier than they would under the higher tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
* Starting in 1990, and continuing as long as capital gains are taxed at a 
lower rate, individual and institutional investors will move significant 
amounts of capital from interest-bearing investments (such as bank certificates 
of deposit, leveraged buyout junk bonds and government debt instruments) to 
equity investments in new ventures that offer innovative products and services. 
</P>
<P>
* Federal revenues in 1992 and beyond will be greater, because of corporate 
income taxes paid by the ventures founded with 1990 risk capital and the income 
taxes paid by the employees of these ventures. In addition, capital gains 
revenue will increase as the absolute volume of capital investment offsets both 
the lower tax rate and the effect of the early realization by investors of some 
capital gains in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* Tens of thousands of middle-class entrepreneurs will obtain the risk capital 
necessary to launch ventures. At present, many excellent new concepts go 
unfunded, because of a severe lack of risk capital. 
</P>
<P>
Uncollateralized debt financing is virtually impossible for these entrepreneurs 
to obtain. Even with collateral, debt financing in American is twice as 
expensive as it is in Japan or Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Equity capital from the larger venture funds in America is also now virtually 
impossible for small, middle-class entrepreneurs to obtain, since these funds 
shy away from providing the seed financing to "two guys in a garage" start-ups. 
Instead, the organized venture funds now prefer to invest in the leveraged 
buyouts of existing corporations or other activities that they perceive as less 
risky. Today's entrepreneurs are limited to finding capital from their own 
savings, from the modest bank accounts of believing friends and relatives or 
from the occasional financial angel (angels are an informal nationwide network 
of successful entrepreneurs who collectively are the largest source of risk 
capital for start-ups today). 
</P>
<P>
A reduction of the capital gains tax will provide financial angels with 
incentives to invest more capital in start-ups and may increase the net return 
to venture funds sufficiently enough to allow them to get back in the seed 
capital arena and out of the leveraged buyout business. 
</P>
<P>
* Those new ventures that succeed will provide jobs and career opportunities 
for middle-class and lower-income workers, enabling many of them to take the 
next step up the economic ladder. Most new jobs in the 1980s have been created 
not by the expansion of Fortune 500 companies but by the success and growth of 
small companies. The lower capital gains rate will create more small companies, 
and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
* Investors will benefit from a higher return on their investments. Though many 
of their equity investments will provide no return as some companies struggle 
and ultimately fail, some investments will succeed extraordinarily well. The 
average return on invested capital to investors will be greater with a lower 
capital gains tax. More importantly, capital will be more wisely invested in 
activities that create and spread wealth, as opposed to activities that simply 
preserve wealth. 
</P>
<P>
If capital gains tax opponents are truly concerned about the standard of living 
for middle-class and lower-income people, they should be willing to step out of 
their anachronistic assumptions that anything beneficial to the well off must 
automatically be bad for the rest of us. The 1990s should be a decade in which 
all Americans can pursue enlightened economic self interest, not one where 
political grandstanding polarizes our country by conjuring up outdated visions 
of class struggle.

AQUINO FRITTERS AWAY A POWERFUL HAND; 
</P>
<P>
PROSPERITY IS HER LAST DEFENSE AGAINST PRESSURES RIGHT AND LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W. SCOTT THOMPSON, W. Scott Thompson is a Fulbright professor in Manila, on 
leave from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 
Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Corazon Aquino took power three and a half years ago on the shoulders of 
the army, the students and a cause-oriented reformist class, she had a powerful 
hand of cards to play. She is left today with only one good suit -- the economy 
-- which may not be enough to save her beleaguered administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although belittled as a "mere housewife" at the time of her victory, she had 
out-maneuvered Ferdinand Marcos through sheer tenacity. It was perhaps 
understandable that Philippine observers would watch for further miracles of 
political leadership, but that turned out to be her weakest suit. There is the 
sense of a complete political vacuum at Malacanang Palace these days, and the 
press writes daily of the possibility of a coup d'etat. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? In some ways Aquino made the same mistake that Marcos made in 
the early 1970s in not using the dictatorial powers he gave himself under 
martial law to shake up the polity with real reform. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino had a year and a half of decree-making power before the old electoral 
political system resumed, but used it to do little more than cleanse the system 
of Marcos' people and his system of "crony capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino took the road of least resistance in allowing the old pre-Marcos crowd 
of oligarchs to come back to power through an electoral system they knew how to 
play. They were, after all, her people. Reformers in Manila never stood a 
chance, competing in the provinces against the professionals who had chafed for 
a decade and a half under Marcos and wanted the spoils of power again. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened to land reform illustrates the problem. Marcos gave land 
reform a real chance in the 1970s, until it, too, got caught up in his 
corruption. In 1986, we were told that this time it would be for real -- 
starting with the president's own family hacienda. In the enthusiasm of the 
moment, the U.S. Congress tacked an additional $50 million onto its 1987 
Philippine aid bill for land reform. But it was June, 1988, before a bill was 
passed in the Philippines and it will be 1990 before the first peso is 
transferred from that account. 
</P>
<P>
Land reform got caught up in a landlord-dominated Congress that sought to slow 
it down and gut it of substance. Philippine Congresswoman Hortense Starke, for 
example, publicly urged fellow landlords to bribe journalists to print the 
"right" sort of story about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
And the biggest landlords began importing high-powered weaponry to rebuild the 
private armies that Marcos had once done away with, to protect themselves 
against both the guerrilla New People's Army and agents from Manila with 
notions of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder then that the insurgency is still strong. Even without rear bases 
across borders and without charismatic leadership, the guerrilla army has 
regained the strength it had at its height in Marcos' last years in office. 
True, the armed forces claim -- credibly -- that they have stalled its increase 
this year for the first time. So the rebels have partly transferred the battle 
to the city, with bombings and assassinations that are beginning to terrorize 
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's popularity in recent polls is down to 35% from a high of more than 
double that. The little people -- taxi drivers, for example -- argue that her 
regime is no better than Marcos' and just as corrupt. Even she for the first 
time is accused of corruption. When her younger brother, the powerful 
Congressman "Peping" Cohuangco, appeared to be implicated in a gun importing 
scheme last month, she publicly cleared him before the inquiry she initiated 
had even begun its examination of the scandal. To Filipinos, it looked all too 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Elections are scheduled for 1992, and there are plenty of candidates. But the 
one with the highest popularity rating is the one keeping the lowest profile: 
Secretary of National Defense Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, a hero of the 1986 
revolution. He and his staff are insistent on their subordination to civilian 
rule and they mean it. 
</P>
<P>
But there are plenty of reform-oriented officers of the type who participated 
in an abortive 1987 coup attempt who wish to see the military take charge and 
clean the system up, with President Aquino left as figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
If security continues to deteriorate at the present rate, the belief is that 
Ramos won't have any choice, despite his denials of any interest in a coup. 
</P>
<P>
Only the economy gives hope. Last year's 6 1/2% real growth, continuing at 
almost that rate this year, is bringing signs of prosperity to the cities, but 
little of it is trickling down to the poor. Whether enough more growth will 
come in the next few years to enable the government to spread the gains around 
-- if it has the will to do so -- is the question that will determine Cory 
Aquino's survival. It is her last winning hand.

AMERICA SHOULD REJOIN A REFORMED UNESCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTEBAN E. TORRES, Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Pico Rivera) was the U.S. 
ambassador to UNESCO from 1977 to 1979 and at present is a member of the United 
Nations Assn. of the United States' international panel on UNESCO. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Reagan Administration took the United States out of the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at the end of 1984, 
it aimed to send a political shock wave throughout the U.N. system. Charging 
the organization with excessive politicization, lack of budgetary restraint and 
poor management, the Administration conditioned the United States' return on 
operational, management and financial changes at the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The time to make that return is now. Reforms are under way at UNESCO that 
Americans across the political spectrum agree were needed. And it serves no 
conceivable interest for our country to sit isolated outside the agency that 
lies at the center of world's flow of ideas as it promotes literacy, education, 
science, environmental protection, cultural preservation and the free flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Recent changes at UNESCO now warrant a reassessment of the complaints that 
prompted our decision to withdraw. A new director general, Federico Mayor 
Zaragoza, has steered the organization away from political divisiveness and 
toward practical programs that enjoy wide support. He has discarded program 
rhetoric that troubled advocates of freedom of communication in the West. He 
has produced a new program budget that emphasizes UNESCO's successful core 
programs in accordance with the tight budgetary restrictions the agency has 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor has drafted a medium-term plan that outlines the organization's 
directions for 1990-1995. It charts a new path for UNESCO, one that returns to 
the organization's original vision of direct involvement of the world's 
intellectual communities in building a peaceful world. 
</P>
<P>
As science, education, communications, humanities and cultural preservation 
increasingly take on international dimensions, our participation in shaping 
global activities through UNESCO becomes even more urgent. The American 
scientific, educational and cultural communities are collectively calling for a 
U.S. return as they watch missed opportunities to participate in 
ground-breaking ventures in their fields. UNESCO, too, is feeling the absence 
of American expertise in these fields. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union has taken advantage of the United States' absence 
to assert leadership in many of UNESCO's fields and offer a positive vision for 
the future of the organization. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has 
affirmed the Soviets' desire to be "constructive and trailblazing contributors 
to UNESCO's activity." UNESCO occupies an important place in Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's vision of our changing world. In contrast, by abandoning an 
important agency for multilateral action, the United States is forfeiting an 
opportunity to promote Western values in the world's most important sectors for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
We also risk paying a high price politically. The United States is going to 
great lengths to protect our efforts to move the Middle East peace process by 
fighting the efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization to gain admission 
to U.N. specialized agencies and, thus, political legitimacy as a state. 
</P>
<P>
But, as things now stand, we will not be there to fight the PLO's application 
for membership in UNESCO. At best, we can hope that later this year the UNESCO 
membership will follow the lead of the World Health Organization, which voted 
this past spring to defer the PLO's application for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Human creativity and interchange are fostered by the ideals of UNESCO. This, 
essentially, is why Americans must be a part of the agency. Our country has 
much to contribute to, and possibly even more to learn from, this forum of 
intellectual cooperation and collaboration.

CHARGERS SELF-DESTRUCT IN DENVER, 16-10

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three quarters Sunday, the Chargers beat the heavily favored Denver Broncos 
by running the ball against the league's top-rated ground defense, hurrying 
Bronco quarterback John Elway to repeated distraction and generally keeping 
their wits about them in the noise caldron that was Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the last 15 minutes, the Chargers beat themselves. This is what young 
teams with new quarterbacks and first-year coaches do in the National Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was Denver 16, Chargers 10. The loss cost the Chargers a share 
of first place in the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Denver (4-1) scored the winning touchdown on rookie Bobby Humphrey's 17-yard 
burst with 1:03 remaining against an inside blitz that should have stopped him 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
But free safety Vencie Glenn missed a tackle at the eight. Cornerback Elvis 
Patterson missed a tackle at the five. And Humphrey, who led everybody with 102 
yards in 23 carries, dragged linebackers Gary Plummer and Leslie O'Neal into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the toughest losses I've ever been through," said Charger defensive 
lineman Joe Phillips, who had one of his team's three sacks. "Incredible. We 
gave the game away." 
</P>
<P>
"Today we were our own worst enemy," said Tim Spencer, who led the Chargers 
with 78 rushing yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Painful," said utility back Dana Brinson, whose 52-yard punt return set up 
Marion Butts' two-yard touchdown run off left tackle early in the third period, 
giving the Chargers a 10-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we're all crushed," said Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator. 
"And I hope we all feel a little bit sick about coming that close." 
</P>
<P>
Here's how close: 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the final quarter, quarterback Jim McMahon (10 of 19 for 116 
yards) completed a 19-yard pass to Jamie Holland that would have given the 
Chargers a first down at the Denver 44. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials called left tackle Joel Patten for holding. "It was 50-50 on 
whether it was holding or not," said Patten, who was playing on a sore knee. 
"But he (the official) made the call, and that makes it holding." 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Patten committed an illegal procedure penalty. Two plays after 
that, the Chargers had to punt. 
</P>
<P>
With 3 1/2 minutes left, rookie Charger defensive end Burt Grossman jumped 
offside at the Bronco 33 on third-and-three. Elway's "hard counts" -- a 
technique he has mastered where he changes the inflection in his voice while 
barking out signals -- had given the Chargers fits all afternoon. But this was 
the most costly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally legal," Lynn said. "And our guy was offside." 
</P>
<P>
But Lynn and Charger Coach Dan Henning thought Denver was offside, too. They 
didn't like the lateness of the call by head linesman Aaron Pointer. And they 
took particular exception when the officials needed a protracted conference to 
determine who to penalize. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're allowed to throw a flag after the whistle," Henning said. 
"In fact, I'm sure of it." 
</P>
<P>
Elway would finish with 19 completions on 35 attempts for 199 yards. And his 
17-yarder to tight end Orson Mobley got the Broncos into Charger territory. On 
fourth and one from the 37, Elway faked a dive play and handed back to Steve 
Sewell, who got outside the Chargers' backside containment for seven yards. Two 
plays later, Humphrey's touchdown put Denver ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the frantic final 15 minutes, the Chargers committed five penalties. Spencer 
lost a fumble. And, following the Humphrey touchdown, McMahon threw a 
third-down interception. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was supposed to go to Anthony Miller. But after the game, McMahon said 
it was a "bad read" on his part. 
</P>
<P>
"Anthony isn't supposed to go over the middle on that play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's where McMahon threw it. And Kip Corrington intercepted. The Chargers 
managed just 20 yards on their 11 third-down plays all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Their 211 yards of total offense was a season low. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can see from the scores around the league that anybody's capable 
of beating you anytime," said Denver Coach Dan Reeves, who is now 51-13 at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how Reeves meant his assessment, it was unflattering to the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
But they had earned it.

Running back John Stephens sparked New England's offense, and the defense shut 
down the AFC's highest-scoring team as the Patriots beat the Houston Oilers, 
23-13, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, sidelined the last two games with an ankle injury, opened up New 
England's running game, making it easier for quarterback Doug Flutie to throw 
and the Patriots to end their three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens gained 59 yards in 21 carries and played key roles in New England's 
first three scoring drives. He also ran for an 11-yard touchdown that gave the 
Patriots a 20-3 lead with 5:58 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we were running the ball so well made it a little bit easier on 
our offensive line" to block on pass plays, said Flutie, who was sacked just 
once. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel there was anything their defense could do that we weren't 
prepared for," said Stephens, the AFC's second leading rusher as a rookie last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Davis added three field goals as the Patriots, who began the game as the 
AFC's lowest-scoring team, matched their point total for their previous three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense of urgency," Flutie said. "We wanted to win badly, and if 
you want it badly enough, you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Jerry Glanville was frustrated with the Oilers, who lost two 
fumbles on kick returns that set up touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win if you can't make basic plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who averaged 38 points in their previous three games, got field 
goals by Tony Zendejas of 46 yards on the final play of the first half and 22 
yards early in the fourth quarter. Warren Moon threw a 20-yard scoring pass to 
Drew Hill, cutting the lead to 23-13 with 5:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was sacked three times and intercepted twice after completing a career 
high 82.6% of his passes in a 39-7 win over Miami last week. He completed 14 of 
29 passes for 227 yards against the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (2-3) got a first-half touchdown for the first time in four games. 
Marvin Allen's one-yard run with 1:08 left in the first quarter made the score 
10-0. It was set up by Stephens' seven-yard run for a first down at the Houston 
one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Davis kicked field goals of 30 yards in the first quarter and 34 yards in the 
third quarter, giving the Patriots a 13-3 lead. He added a 43-yarder with 6:49 
left.

Miami Dolphins rookie Pete Stoyanovich may have saved more than a game with his 
35-yard field goal in overtime Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
He also may have saved his job. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich missed a 46-yard field goal in the third period and a 45-yarder 
with three seconds left in regulation time, but gave the Dolphins a 13-10 
victory when he connected on Miami's first possession in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big, big kick in his career," Dolphin Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich, an eighth-round draft choice who became Miami's kicker when 
veteran Fuad Reveiz was injured in training camp, said he was confident about 
the final kick despite his earlier misses. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that far out," he said. "I had no doubt I was going to make it. I'm 
just really fortunate that the team gave me a second opportunity to win it for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland took the kickoff to start overtime and drove 46 yards, but Matt Bahr 
was wide left on a 44-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We all miss," Stoyanovich said. "Nobody's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The winner, with 8:32 left, capped a 55-yard drive that included two 
third-and-10 passes from Dan Marino to Fred Banks. On the first pass, Stephen 
Braggs was called for a 26-yard pass interference penalty at the Cleveland 47. 
The second pass was a 20-yard completion to the Cleveland 27. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's previous home games this season, both losses, also were decided on the 
game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been two games we should have won at the end, but we didn't," 
Marino said. "This will be a big boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (2-3) and Browns (3-2) both had a chance to win the game in a wild 
final minute in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Felix Wright returned an interception to the Miami 37 with 1:08 
left, but Louis Oliver intercepted Bernie Kosar's pass two plays later. Marino 
completed two passes for 23 yards before Stoyanovich missed. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns drove to Miami's 45-yard line with five minutes to go in the fourth 
quarter. Two penalties set them back, and safety Jarvis Williams broke up a 
third-down pass at the Miami 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do it when we had to," Browns Coach Bud Carson said. "We had our 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was hampered by eight penalties for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy football," Carson said. "Ten points don't win many 
football games."

BILLS LOSE GAME AND KELLY AS COLTS ROMP

Buffalo's potent offense never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
After an early Indianapolis touchdown put the Bills in a hole, the Colts' 
defense forced six turnovers and converted them into 23 points in Sunday's 
37-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Buffalo was always playing uphill," Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer said. "We got 
the first turnover and jammed it in, and then we were rockin' and rollin'." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills came in as the AFC's top offensive team, fourth-best in the entire 
NFL at 400 yards per game. They managed 424 yards against the Colts but were 
killed by four quarterback sacks, four intercepted passes, two lost fumbles and 
a shoulder injury to Jim Kelly, the top-rated quarterback in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
A still-sore Eric Dickerson ran for two touchdowns, the only Indianapolis 
scores that weren't set up by Buffalo turnovers, as the Colts (3-2) moved into 
a tie with the Bills for the AFC East lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly suffered a shoulder separation in the third quarter. Early indications 
were that Kelly will be out at least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who didn't start because of a sore hamstring, rushed 22 times for 92 
yards and scored on runs of one yard in the first quarter and four yards early 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Keith Taylor intercepted two of the passes, returning one 80 yards for 
the final touchdown with 2:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jack Trudeau earlier ran for one touchdown and Dean Biasucci added 
three field goals, all following Buffalo turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills' first touchdown, a 16-yard pass from Kelly to Andre Reed late in the 
third quarter, was the first touchdown allowed by the Colts' defense in 11 
quarters. Kelly, however, suffered the injury on the play and was replaced in 
the final period by Frank Reich, who passed 17 yards to Kenneth Davis for the 
Bills' second touchdown with five minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we do not know his condition," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said of 
Kelly. "His arm is in a sling and he is in a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Reich brought the Bills to the Colts' 20 in the closing minutes before Taylor 
killed the drive with his interception return. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson carried the ball only once on the game-opening drive, but his 
one-yard run was good for a touchdown and a lead the Colts never lost.

Mark Rypien threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes as the Redskins 
registered a 30-28 comeback victory over Phoenix Sunday, extending the 
Cardinals' losing streak at RFK Stadium to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't decided until the final play, when Phoenix running back Vai 
Sikahema was tackled at the Washington 41 after taking a lateral from 
quarterback Gary Hogeboom. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals recovered an onside kick after scoring with 14 second left. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins took a 23-21 lead when Rypien, on third and four from the 12, 
threw a pass to Art Monk in the back of the end zone with 7:47 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Washington safety Barry Wilburn intercepted Hogeboom's pass with 5:51 left and 
the Redskins drove 63 yards in nine plays, culminating with Rypien's 23-yard 
touchdown pass to Gary Clark with 1:54 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom threw his third touchdown pass to J.T. Smith with 14 seconds left, but 
the Cardinals didn't have enough time after recovering the onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (3-2) won its third straight game and snapped a five-game home 
losing streak, its longest such string in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien completed 23 of 42 passes for 333 yards to help the Redskins pull within 
a game of the New York Giants in the NFC East. Ernest Byner ran for 102 yards 
in 14 carries and caught five passes for 71 yards. 
</P>
<P>
For Phoenix, which lost its third straight, Hogeboom completed 20 of 35 passes 
for 296 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who have been battered by injuries all season, lost two more 
players in the second quarter. Wide receiver Roy Green fractured his collarbone 
and right tackle Shawn Knight injured his right shoulder.

Donnie Hammond completed a blitz of the Oak Hills Country Club course Sunday 
with a six-under-par 64 for a seven-shot victory in the Texas Open at San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond earned his second PGA title with a tournament-record 258, 22 under par 
for 72 holes. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-year veteran secured the victory when he rolled in a 30-foot eagle 
putt on the 10th hole to open a five-shot advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Runner-up Paul Azinger, after starting slowly, closed with a flurry of birdies 
for a final-round 69 and a total of 265. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lohr and Duffy Waldorf, both with 71s, shared third place with Mark Wiebe 
at 267. Wiebe closed with a 67. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player took advantage of a putting lapse by Rives McBee to gain a 
one-stroke victory in the RJR championship at Clemons, N.C., the richest event 
on the Senior PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
"He was playing in pain," McBee said of Player, who suffered a back spasm while 
playing the fifth hole. "My hat's off to him." 
</P>
<P>
Player, who crouched awkwardly to retrieve his ball from the cup and twice 
almost lost his balance swinging, played down the condition. 
</P>
<P>
It was "like a sheet of lightning," when the spasm hit, he said, but after 
that, "it was not excruciating, just irritating, like a toothache." 
</P>
<P>
Player, 53, who hit only three greens on the back nine, had to work hard for 
his final-round 71 that gave him a 54-hole total of 207. 
</P>
<P>
McBee lost a share of the lead when he missed an 18-inch, par-saving putt on 
the 16th. He finished with an erratic 73 that included three birdies, four 
bogeys and a double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Langer of West Germany shot a bogey-free 68 to win the $540,000 German 
Masters tournament at Stuttgart, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Langer made four birdies to beat American Payne Stewart, the third-round 
leader, and Spaniard Jose-Maria Olazabal, the defending champion, by one stroke 
for his second European PGA victory of the year. He finished at 276.

UNITED STATES BEATS SPAIN IN FEDERATION FINAL

<P>
The top-seeded United States won the Federation Cup in Tokyo today, beating 
Spain, 2-0. The title was America's 13th since the tournament began in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Playing her last competitive tournament, 34-year-old Chris Evert routed 
17-year-old Conchita Martinez 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the second singles, Martina Navratilova lost the first set but rallied for a 
0-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over 17-year-old French Open champion Arantxa 
Sanchez-Vicario on the hard courts of the Ariake Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were to play a doubles match later today, but it won't affect the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Evert got the United States into the final with a semifinal victory Saturday, 
defeating Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised that Evert was too good, without mistakes," Novotna said. "I 
played hard every single shot, but had so many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Evert's victory, combined with Navratilova's, led the United States over 
Czechoslovakia, 2-0. Evert has said she will retire from serious competition 
after the final. 
</P>
<P>
Rain on Saturday had also caused a one-day semifinal delay. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans were too good and too strong, especially Evert was too good," 
Czech captain Jiri Medonos said. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Jim Courier upset top-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 7-6 (8-6), 2-6, 
3-6, 6-0, 7-5, to win the final of an indoor tournament at Basel, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"This was by far my best tennis," Courier said. "It's an incredible feeling. I 
took advantage of the fact that Stefan could have played better." 
</P>
<P>
The match turned when Edberg started the fourth set lethargically and lost in 
22 minutes. He saved two match points on his serve in the 12th game of the 
fifth set, but Courier closed out the 3 1/2-hour match with a topspin forehand 
lob. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi won his first tournament title in 14 months, beating top-seeded 
Brad Gilbert, 6-2, 6-1, in the final of a $415,000 tournament at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels pretty good," said Agassi, who won six tournaments in 1988. "Now 
maybe people won't think I had such a bad year." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert attempted to pressure the second-seeded Agassi by coming to the net, 
but the strategy backfired when Agassi's powerful groundstrokes forced Gilbert 
into volleying errors. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Niclas Kroon earned his first tournament title, beating Mark Woodforde 
of Australia, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, in a final at Brisbane, Australia. Woodforde said 
heat and an upset stomach bothered him.

the 1989 Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb, was killed when his race car hit a deer 
during a qualifying run for the Fall Teller County Hill Climb near Colorado 
Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Donner's car was going an estimated 120 m.p.h. when it struck 
the deer near the end of the 4.6-mile dirt road course. 
</P>
<P>
Donner, 29, was flown from the race course about 20 miles to St. Francis 
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
Teller County Sheriff Gary Shoemaker said the yearling doe, which was cut in 
half by the impact, crashed into the open cockpit of the race car, apparently 
killing Donner instantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We could hear him coming up the road," said Kevin Baker, a member of Donner's 
pit crew. "I could see him coming, and then I saw the deer come out of the 
woods and walk right out in the road."

Gary Ormsby set new performance records en route to a top fuel victory at a 
National Hot Rod Assn. event at Ennis, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby, from Roseville, Calif., drove his dragster to a 4.919-second, 294.88 
m.p.h. quarter-mile records. The elapsed time is the quickest in the sport.

The Scene: Thursday night's premiere of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" at 
the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood. It was also the season opener for the 
Center Theatre Group, which has been displaced from its usual home at the 
Ahmanson by "Phantom of the Opera." Guests had to arrive at the Doolittle by 
6:30 to pick up their tickets, which gave them plenty of time to check out the 
newly painted facade (which makes the theater look a little bit less like an 
unfinished furniture outlet), and to risk the usual pre-theater flash bulb and 
sequined abrasion. Afterward, there was a party at the nearby Columbia Bar 
&amp; Grill. Guests had the option of driving the three blocks to the 
restaurant, or walking down Sunset Boulevard at 10:45 p.m. dressed in tuxedoes 
and gowns. Most drove. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Everyone seemed palpably enthusiastic at the prospect of seeing 
"Virginia Woolf" directed by the playwright, Edward Albee, with Glenda Jackson 
and John Lithgow in the lead roles. Beyond that there was a more pragmatic 
question to ponder: Would guests be in a party mood after sitting through 3 1/2 
hours of drama? 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The play's stars Jackson, Lithgow, Brian Kerwin, and Cynthia 
Nixon; playwright Albee; and a love boat's worth of TV stars, including Jane 
Alexander, Kirstie Alley and Parker Stevenson, artist Don Bachardy, Gene Barry, 
Lloyd Bridges, Lois Chiles, Robert Culp, Tim Curry, Barbara Eden, Tony 
Franciosa, Earl Holliman, Michele Lee, Gavin MacLeod, Lee Meriweather, Louis 
Nye, Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Natalie Schafer, William Shatner, Jonathan 
Silverman, Peter Strauss, Brenda Vaccaro, Joan Van Ark, Leslie Ann Warren, and 
Stephanie Zimbalist. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Invitations specified black tie, and most guests complied, more or 
less. At least there were no shorts or fanny packs in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: "Virginia Woolf" is a hot ticket. Scalping agencies sell the tickets at 
premium prices along with their usual stock of U2 and Cure tickets. Perhaps 
that was why there was a line of several dozen people outside, all dressed in 
black tie, waiting in hopes of a cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Grilled chicken, steak, tortellini, rice, vegetables, salad, brownies, 
coffee, and more, all of it very good. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: At the party, John Lithgow was surrounded by well-wishers, while he 
vainly tried to get a bite to eat in edgewise. "Boy, I knew we were good, but I 
didn't know we were that good," he said after the hundredth congratulation. "If 
I had known Arthur Hill (who originated the role on Broadway) was in the 
audience, I never would have gone on." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: The CTG has always been plagued with the problem of trying to find 
nearby restaurants for its after parties. It looks like it may have found a 
winner in the Columbia Bar &amp; Grill, which managed to be both proximate and 
quite skilled at keeping several hundred play-goers happy. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: All in all not a bad first run for the restaurant, but the lack of 
enough tables and a very crowded bar kept guests eating and drinking on their 
feet most of the night. By the time of the next party, the Columbia Bar &amp; 
Grill should have everything all worked out. KEVIN ALLMAN

AT THE INTERSECTION OF ARTISTIC VALUES

<TEXT>
<P>
Of Limited Partnerships by Lisa Zeidner (North Point Press: $18.95; 272 pages. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be in America -- or so they said -- that an idealistic artist had 
two choices: 
</P>
<P>
(1) Put away those artistic dreams, take over your father's business or get a 
law degree and live a life of material wealth and spiritual poverty. Drive 
everyone around you crazy with continual regrets and wistful glances out the 
window of your undented Oldsmobile or Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
(2) Cast your lot with the artistic life! Drive a Volkswagen until it dies a 
natural death. Let that common cold turn into nasty bronchitis, because you 
can't afford health insurance. Who cares about health anyway? Your real 
responsibility is to your art. The one thing worse than death is "selling out," 
since, by definition, it puts you out of Category Two and back into the odious 
Category One. 
</P>
<P>
Only since the end of World War II has there gradually opened up a 
semi-plausible third option, guaranteed to totally destroy the last semblance 
of the would-be artist's peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
What if it were possible to wire American economic circuits so that as an 
artistic person you'd be able to do what you want, sort of, and sort of get the 
system to pay you for it? That way, you might wind up within a stone's throw of 
your wildest dreams. But can it be done? Is it possible? More specifically, can 
two (or more) people without what appears to be an impossible dream, make a go 
of it year after year, and have a great time doing all of that? 
</P>
<P>
Well, sure. Many of the people I know personally do it all the time. But this 
is the first novel I've ever read about the mechanics of that particular life 
style; its seductions and pitfalls and moments of perfect euphoria. The 
author's exemplary couple, Malcolm de Witt and Nora Worth, have been living 
together for some time, but they just can't get it together to get married. 
They live in Malcolm's old family home, but he can't keep up the mortgage 
payments. He hasn't filed taxes for years. He's stone broke. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm's profession? Not quite an architect, just an interior designer. Nora 
would like to get married, in theory, but she's loaned Malcolm too much money 
over the years, gets no financial benefits from the house, and is working too 
hard to get a grip on either her life or her art. Her profession? Formerly a 
"fine artist," Nora pulls in good money now as a "food stylist," making 
hamburgers and turkeys look pretty for television. 
</P>
<P>
"Malcolm and Nora," the author tells us, "had the worst of both worlds: 
artistic work with none of the arts integrity and no control over the finished 
product; self-employment without fun or profit. They were running in place, but 
whose heart would bleed for them?" 
</P>
<P>
If that weren't enough, Malcolm's latest assignment has fallen through. He been 
working for a shady businessman caught up in weird bank scams that suddenly 
explode in an exciting and harrowing few hours. Suddenly, both the FBI and the 
IRS are all over Malcolm like a cheap suit. And, by mysterious coincidence, 
Nora finds an extra $30,000 deposited to her perennially anemic bank account. 
Just to thicken up the plot a little further, both Malcolm and Nora fall in 
love (or think they do), with "significant others" outside their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Living in a country where, theoretically, everything is perfectable, it's just 
possible that the really perfect mate is "out there" somewhere for all of us, 
and that dodo sitting across the dinner table yammering about money or marriage 
or babies or interest rates surely can't be the very best one of the bunch. 
(Again, isn't Lisa Zeidner talking about all our lives, whether we're locked 
into junk-bond obsessions, or writing the great American novel?) 
</P>
<P>
Is Malcolm really poor? What if he's rich? What does money, or its lack, really 
mean in America? Is the artist entitled to strive after his or her finest 
dreams, and then expect to get paid for it? Where do the material and spiritual 
life intersect? Can people get married and still have plenty of fun? Can people 
who work for the FBI or the IRS be nice? Is America still the place where your 
wildest dreams can come true -- if you know how to work the system? 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Zeidner has definite, hilarious, very smart, sometimes profound answers to 
all these questions. This isn't just a novel of ideas. It's a novel of very 
good ideas.

STAGE REVIEW;

<P>
A YOUNG PRO WHO KNOWS HIS TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too much performance art falls short as performance craft. That was not a 
problem with Robert Longo's "Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes," performed 
over the weekend at Royce Hall, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Like his paintings and 3-D triptychs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 
Longo's stage pieces have the certainty of composition that one associates with 
commercial art. The viewer knows where he is supposed to look, and the artist 
knows how much information he wants to give out. Every image is clearly framed 
and nothing goes on too long. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Bang! Pow! or Zowie! about "Dream Jumbo." Longo saves that for his 
rock videos, also on view at the museum. The flow of images and music was so 
smooth at Royce Hall that it wasn't always clear where one piece had ended 
(five were seen) and another had begun. 
</P>
<P>
Soothing is not quite the word. But if this is a "disturbing" artist, a word 
that seems to be in vogue about Longo, the disturbance is conceptual and after 
the fact. In the moment, we are in the hands, if not of a master, of a young 
pro who knows the technology. 
</P>
<P>
His tableaux might remind us of Robert Wilson's. (The man on stilts in the last 
tableau specifically reminds us of Robert Wilson.) But the attitude towards 
time is different. Longo doesn't try to slow down our heartbeat, to take us to 
the gate of boredom, beyond which lie the fields of contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
Not too much happened in these pieces, but enough happened. Sometimes there was 
even a little story, such as the vignette about the big bald head on the screen 
trying to reconnect with its body, which had somehow got loose into the real 
world and was running around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Once reconnected, the little body (Sean Curran) read Puck's curtain speech from 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream," the one where Puck asks the audience to "give me 
your hands." Two hands on the screen then dealt him a mosquito's fate. A Tom 
&amp; Jerry gag that got a nice laugh, and also made a nice little point about 
the clout of the screen image these days. 
</P>
<P>
One gathers that this is a major theme with Longo -- the way we are manipulated 
by images streaming from the skyscrapers of power and privilege. It is odd to 
see AT&amp;T sponsoring such a subversive artist, but this may be because the 
subversion is so subtle that it's quite easy to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
The "Marble Fog" sequence, for instance, did a lot with the screen image of the 
skyscraper. But it was presented with such appreciation for the mass and line 
of the buildings being seen that the sequence could be interpreted as a 
celebration of the skyscraper, the cathedral of the 20th Century. Rather than 
being oppressed by these images, your reviewer found them quite as handsome as 
those of the fields of flowers seen just before. 
</P>
<P>
This is not an art that is going to change the man in the street's opinion of 
the culture he lives in -- of Johnny Carson as the ultimate talking head, for 
instance. Longo's art is too much of a piece with the visual codes of that 
culture for anyone but an expert to make out the difference. 
</P>
<P>
But it is well done. "Matrix Mutants," for example, was a fetching sci-fi 
diorama set on a nameless planet inhabited by wiggly, squiggly silhouettes. 
This was not exactly a Beckett landscape, but there are more ways than one of 
conceiving apocalypse. Perhaps we will all turn into Toys by Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Room" was a beautiful, formal dance piece for Bill T. Jones, working 
before a huge swatched red curtain that kept moving in an ocean-like manner, 
bellied out by air from backstage. What it meant was up to you, and it didn't 
have to mean anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
Another pleasing piece was the opener, "Sound Distance of a Good Man." This 
had, from left to right: (A) two shirtless men in a slow-motion wrestling 
contest (Jones and Robert Allen); (B) a big black-and-white photograph of a man 
looking up into the sun, while a stone lion in the background looked the other 
way; (C) a soprano in an evening gown (Peggy Atkinson) singing a classical aria 
with much emphasis on the word "Ave." 
</P>
<P>
A beautiful, living triptych, each frame interesting in itself, and pleasingly 
contrasted against the other frames. Two struggling males (struggling to gain 
knowledge of each other, you felt, like D. H. Lawrence figures) versus a female 
serenely singing the praises of someone else. 
</P>
<P>
The mind could easily play with that for 16 minutes, or could wonder about the 
stone lion, or could simply enjoy the spectacle. I don't know how deep Longo 
goes as an artist (the closer he comes to having a message, the more it turns 
out to be a message you've already heard), but he knows how to space figures on 
a stage. 
</P>

Claudio Abbado was chosen Sunday as the new conductor of the Berlin 
Philharmonic Orchestra, Anke Martiny, head of the West Berlin Culture 
Department, announced. He takes the place of Herbert von Karajan, who died July 
16. Abbado, 56, an Italian, is musical director of the Vienna opera and general 
music director in Vienna. A native of Milan, Abbado in 1958 won the Serge 
Koussevitzky conducting prize at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts and 
in 1963 the Dimitri Mitropoulos conducting prize. In 1966, he began a long 
association with the London Symphony Orchestra, directing it regularly before 
he succeeded Andre Previn as principal conductor in 1979. Abbado is well known 
in the United States for his long association with the Boston and Chicago 
symphony orchestras. Shauna Snow

The son of singer Bobby Darin has sued McDonald's Corp. for more than $10 
million, alleging that the restaurant chain copied his late father's singing 
style and gestures in the "Mac Tonight" commercials. The suit, filed last week 
in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that the television ads infringe 
on rights to Darin's 1959 hit version of the song "Mack the Knife." The 
commercials feature a tuxedoed man with a smiling quarter-moon head, wearing 
sunglasses and belting out the hamburger jingle. The suit contends that the 
character's voice and gestures resemble those of Darin, who died in 1973 at age 
37 of heart problems. The suit seeks an injunction halting the McDonald's 
commercials, $100,000 in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages.

POP CAPSULES: STEVIE B PROSPERS IN A WOMAN'S WORLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dance music is a genre that is mostly saturated by flowery, baby-voiced female 
artists such as Paula Abdul, Sweet Sensation and the Cover Girls, but Stevie B 
(nee Stevie B. Hill) lends a decidedly macho perspective. Supported by three 
muscular, pin-up perfect dancer/back-up singers, Stevie B wasn't a model of 
flowery charm -- or creative substance -- at the Palace on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
This Florida-based performer wasn't above throwing out some brusque, 
four-lettered admonitions to his followers when their response to the cuddly 
warmth of "Spring Love" and "In My Eyes" didn't reach a fevered pitch quickly 
enough to suit him. Stevie B's lyrics are as innocent-sounding as those of The 
Cover Girls, but he punctuated them with an overt sexuality. Crass, yes, but 
effective. He eventually got fans on their feet and dancing. Still, his success 
seems largely due to the fact that he is one of the few men in a woman's 
musical world. CONNIE JOHNSON

POP CAPSULES: TESTAMENT: NEXT BIG THING HAS HEADBANGERS IN AWE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

Your earplugs were useless. Your vibrating fillings ached. Little whitecaps 
skittered across the surface of your coffee. At the Country Club on Friday, the 
San Francisco thrash metal band Testament played so loudly that the sound was a 
palpable thing, and even the headbangers in the slam pit had that look of awe 
you might see on the face of a young surfer witnessing the 25-foot waves of 
Waimea for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In certain circles, Testament seems to be the Next Big Thing. They sing about 
the disappearing rain forest, just like Madonna, and get played a lot on MTV. 
Within the context of a genre where craftsmanship counts less than attitude, 
their songs have hooks and melodies, just like Phil Collins'. On stage, 
Testament doesn't look like a thrash band -- they wear tight rock-star clothing 
instead of Misfits T-shirts, and rely heavily on the effects produced by a 
smoke machine and moody spotlights. But mostly, Testament sounds just like 
Metallica these days. Their lyrics are really sensitive too, brooding in the 
way teen-age girls seem to enjoy, though there seemed to be only four or five 
women in the packed club. Maybe women listen to their ear doctors more closely.

POP CAPSULES: DWIGHT YOAKAM TOURS SIN CITY'S HONKIEST TONKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blasting off with a swamp thang version of Dave Alvin's "Long White Cadillac," 
country maverick Dwight Yoakam and his punchy little guitar-fiddle-bass-drums 
outfit took Friday's near-capacity Universal Amphitheatre crowd on a nearly 
two-hour tour of Sin City's honkiest tonks. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the ability to get away with wearin' a pair of jeans-sotight he 
must've put 'em on with an air wrench, Yoakam packs a classic country voice, 
and that's what's got him a six pack a hits ever since he busted out of the El 
Lay club scene several years back. 
</P>
<P>
Doin' everything from his own numbers ("Guitars, Cadillacs") to the King's 
"Little Sister" and even saving a taste for ole Buck ("Streets of 
Bakersfield"), Yoakam fleshed out the evening's entertainment with a loose but 
lucid rap about "what women mean when they say 'nothing' ") before closin' 'em 
down with several two-fisted rounds of back-to-the-joints Merle/George/Ray 
Price/Johnny Horton standards. There wasn't a dry beer in the house. DON WALLER

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'LEACH LORD' GIVES POTENT STATEMENT

Los Angeles film maker Eric Saks' independent movie "Forevermore: Biography of 
a Leach Lord" -- which screens tonight at 8 at the Film-forum, with the film 
maker present -- reminds us how thin many studio-made movies are these days. 
Saks' movie, shot for $14,000, is a mock documentary that traces the 
extra-legal career of the fictional Isaac Hudak through TV science shows, drug 
smuggling and gambling to his true metier: secretively dumping poisonous 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
It has an incredibly rich, packed and well-imagined story line -- with enough 
narrative material for a dozen conventional movies -- and enough factual data 
on waste pollution and science left over for several documentaries as well. 
</P>
<P>
The style, influenced by both Jean-Luc Godard and experimentalist Jim Benning 
(who appears in the cast), is a collage in which image, sound track and 
narration blend or clash while hard, bright shots of American landscapes, 
people and objects collide rigorously. With the frighteningly plausible Hudak 
at its center, "Forevermore" is a cutting attack on American greed from the 
'50s through the '80s and beyond. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

CHARLIE HADEN'S QUARTET TAKES HIGH ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leonad Feather 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Haden's Quartet West, which closed Sunday at Catalina's, covers so much 
territory in a single set that its slogan might well be "Around the World in 
Seven Tunes." 
</P>
<P>
Haden, the composer and bassist who rose to fame in the 1960s with Ornette 
Coleman, shares the credits with three equally skilled musicians: Ernie Watts 
on tenor sax, Alan Broadbent on piano and Larance Marable on drums. 
</P>
<P>
These are not your everyday be-boppers -- though the opening number might have 
given that impression -- because it was an old Charlie Parker line, "Passport," 
for which Watts assumed the melodic responsibility before plunging into the 
first several choruses of hard-driving extemporization. 
</P>
<P>
The idiom changed as the group wrapped itself around Pat Metheny's "Hermitage," 
with a minor key and a Latin beat, and with Watts in a more subdued mood. 
</P>
<P>
Haden's all-embracing scope took a turn for the basics with his simple and 
charming calypso, "Child's Play," during which the brilliant, harmonically 
imaginative Broadbent supplied sensitive chording. Marable, in a long but 
rarely boring solo, went through some interesting motions with sticks on his 
high-hat cymbal. 
</P>
<P>
Haden himself was the key figure in a long freedom excursion, displaying his 
customary finesse, telling stories in long lines and occasional chords. Watts 
took some uncivil liberties with his horn, and the whole thing, despite a 
splendid Broadbent interlude, went on so interminably that the next number, a 
bop line on "All the Things You Are," came as a much-needed contrast. 
</P>
<P>
What is most impressive about Quartet West is its sense of unity. Having worked 
together off and on for two or three years, these men are thoroughly attuned to 
one another's innovative ideas. If they do stumble now and then in their global 
circumnavigation, the passages of smooth sailing make the journey 
worthwhile.Leonad Feather

PIANIST KAHANE PERFORMS AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No stranger to Southland audiences, pianist Jeffrey Kahane has been giving 
recitals here for more than a dozen years. Now 33, he continues to bring 
insight and intellect to his programs, as he did Friday evening at El Camino 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Following a refined account of Debussy's "Estampes," the pianist turned to 
Bartok's "Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs." Showing fine control 
throughout, he played with both intimate subtlety and explosive dynamism. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bartok's "Improvisations," Kenneth Frazelle's "Blue Ridge Airs," written 
68 years later, weaves simple folk melodies into an intricate yet 
understandable contrapuntal fabric. The composer, whose music Kahane has 
actively championed, paced his ideas skillfully, and managed to create a wealth 
of variety -- rhythmic, textural and timbral -- without rambling. 
</P>
<P>
Though obviously challenging to play, "Blue Ridge Airs" (written for Kahane) 
makes fine use of the instrument's capacities, and the pianist made a moving 
and virtually irrefutable case for it. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission, Kahane turned to Chopin, first the Impromptu in 
F-sharp, then the B-minor Sonata. As before, Kahane conveyed a sure sense of 
direction and purpose and brought out details with uncommon clarity. His 
account of the Sonata was neither deeply personal nor technically flawless but 
nonetheless an intelligent, balanced and ultimately satisfying one. TERRY

GLENDALE SYMPHONY BEGINS 66TH SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new era in its seven-decade history began for the Glendale Symphony Saturday 
night, when Lalo Schifrin, formerly a frequent guest conductor, now full music 
director, opened the orchestra's 66th consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Only one brief speech marred the main business of the evening in the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion; that was the introduction to the audience of the conductor 
by board president Donald Platz. After that, the music itself dominated. 
</P>
<P>
Schifrin, a musician who wears many hats, seems comfortable in most styles, 
though his particular strengths as a conductor may lie in his expertise as a 
composer dealing with music of his own century. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise of this performance, then, was in Schifrin's careful but 
propulsive -- sometimes almost breathtakingly quick -- drive through 
Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. Despite the speed, this was a reading both 
stylish and clarified, and never rushed for the sake of rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Even at its best, the Glendale ensemble has seldom demonstrated as much finesse 
of phrasing and dynamics as Schifrin seemed to elicit in this performance. In 
fact, in the program-opening "Huapango," by Moncayo, some of the rhythmic bite 
and instrumental energy characteristic of this group of first-rank players 
seemed blunted, over-smooth. 
</P>
<P>
The thrills -- known and reliable -- in Rachmaninoff's C-minor Piano Concerto 
did not arrive as frequently as anticipated on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Viardo, the Soviet pianist who returned to this country in 1988 after 
a long hiatus, proved a rhythmically unstable, if technically adequate, soloist 
-- speeding up, slowing down and generally stretching the musical arch 
seriously out of line throughout. How Schifrin and the orchestra kept their 
wits about them is a mystery. DANIEL CARIAGA

E. GERMAN POLICE BEAT PROTESTERS;

BRUTALITY IN BERLIN COMES ON 2ND DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS

LEIPZIG, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security forces broke up a candle-lit protest march in East Berlin on Sunday as 
ordinary citizens here and in other cities deplored the brutal police 
suppression of peaceful demonstrations that called upon East Germany's 
hard-line regime to undertake political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Despite chants by the marchers in East Berlin of "No violence! No violence!" 
police snatched some participants from the 1,500-strong march, beating them on 
the head with truncheons, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second day of widespread disturbances linked to the visit of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who took part in the weekend's 40th anniversary 
celebration of the founding of the East German state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev a Hero 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has emerged as a hero to the East German people through his effort to 
democratize Soviet life, which has led to liberalization in other East Bloc 
countries. East Germans have been demanding similar reforms for their own 
country, but the regime led by 77-year-old Erich Honecker has refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations compounded the embarrassment of the Honecker regime, already 
smarting over the flight of about 45,000 East Germans to the West in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In the East Berlin protest, the demonstrators chanted "Freedom! Freedom!" after 
attending a service at the Lutheran Gethsemane Church, a center for the 
nation's budding reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked the demonstrators as they marched along nearby Schoenhauser 
Allee on Sunday night and ordered them to disperse. The police demands were 
drowned out by chants of "We are the people! We are the people!" Residents in 
the area went to their balconies and windows displaying lighted candles in a 
show of solidarity with the demonstrators below. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the demonstrators obeyed the police order, but some did not. It was 
then that police waded into the throng, swinging their clubs. Similar attacks 
by police occurred here and in Dresden. 
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin demonstrators had gathered at the Gethsemane Church to pray for 
the 700 people church sources said had been rounded up by police during the 
weekend demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more than usual have come because since yesterday (Sunday), something has 
happened in this country and many people say it just cannot continue like 
this," a pastor told the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens interviewed in East Berlin, Dresden and here in Leipzig vowed they 
will continue to call for reforms -- despite the police attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The events of the past few days presaged a calculated police crackdown on 
dissenters, observers said, no matter how peacefully the protests may have been 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
An observer from West Berlin, who traveled through East Germany, put it this 
way Sunday: "These are protests from people who have been quiet for years and 
decided to say something in public -- because they couldn't take it any longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, the police are beating up the citizens who want to stay," the 
observer added, "not those who want to leave" their country for the West. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Leipzig, East Germany's second city, the scene outside the Protestant 
Nikolai Church on Sunday afternoon seemed to crystallize national resentment 
against the tactics of the police and local militia forces. 
</P>
<P>
Bouquets of flowers were placed under the stained-glass windows and lighted 
candles served as a vigil of remembrance around the Baroque old church, which 
has served as a focal point for peaceful protests here. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses here said Sunday that as many as 20,000 marchers formed on Saturday, 
before the demonstrations were broken up by stick-wielding security forces 
accompanied by Alsatian dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the church, waiting for it to open for 5 p.m. services, dozens of 
Leipzigers gathered, muttering and grumbling about the outcome of Saturday's 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
People here say that at least 2,000 police were involved and that dozens of 
people were injured and hundreds were apprehended by the police -- although 
most were later released. 
</P>
<P>
"People are scared to go out on the streets," said one man of about 30, showing 
a bandaged hand where he had been struck by a police club. 
</P>
<P>
During the march toward the central railroad station, people whistled the 
Communist anthem "Internationale," some people called out "Help us, Gorby," a 
reference to the Soviet president, and others simply chanted "New Forum," the 
name of a new organization that has gathered 10,000 signatures of support in 
just a few weeks after it circulated a manifesto calling for more dialogue 
between the government and the people of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
And a young man who had watched the demonstration said he heard a senior police 
officer expressly order: "Use your knuppel," the German word for truncheon, and 
"Drive them out of the square." A heavy-set man, about 35, said that both his 
brother and brother-in-law were members of the militia. "I cried when I saw 
what they did last night. I am ashamed for my family." 
</P>
<P>
As the people spoke out to the reporters, one pointed to some windows on the 
side of the square and said: "Look! There are cameras there. The Stasi (secret 
security police) are filming us." 
</P>
<P>
A blonde woman said she was present with her 9-year-old child in the area of 
the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"They used tear gas and water cannons," she said, "and they were hitting women 
and children." 
</P>
<P>
And another insisted: "The hard part to accept is that all of us are peaceful. 
We are the ones who want to stay in the country. Yet they are beating us." 
</P>
<P>
An older man in the crowd said: "Lots of people are leaving the (Communist) 
party and the youth organizations because of the behavior of the government in 
cracking down on these peaceful gatherings." 
</P>
<P>
And someone else said that Communist Party members who play in the famous 
Leipzig Orchestra have left the party as a gesture of protest. 
</P>
<P>
One person said that the local cabaret in Leipzig has been banned. In Germany, 
even on the Communist side, the cabaret is the safety valve through which 
political comment can be expressed, satirically, in nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
Monday evening has been a traditional time when the peaceful protesters have 
gathered at the Nikolai Church, and, after services, marched across a mall to 
the main railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
It was here three weeks ago that five people, members of New Forum, were 
arrested and sentenced to terms of four to six months in jail for anti-state 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday in Dresden, the beautiful, Baroque city that was bombed into ruins 
during World War II and still carries the scars, a scientist who is the local 
coordinator for New Forum said that 10,000 to 15,000 people had marched from 
the main railroad station to the Town Hall and along various streets on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that the pattern in other cities had been followed in Dresden: 
Police breaking up large formations of people, using clubs and splitting them 
into smaller groups, then driving them along side streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different from Earlier Rioting 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the New Forum in Dresden took pains to explain that the weekend 
protests there were different from the rioting that occurred around the 
railroad station Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier demonstrators had been trying to get aboard trains passing through 
Dresden, bound either for Prague or returning through Dresden with East German 
emigrants bound for the west. 
</P>
<P>
"Those others who caused the trouble wanted to get out," a Dresden woman said 
Sunday. "But we wanted to stay." 
</P>
<P>
The New Forum members said they were seeking to have the government 
"decriminalize" their organization "so we can operate openly," as one man put 
it. "Otherwise anything we say can be considered anti-government."

GORBACHEV PUTS BRAKES ON PACE OF HIS REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even as he consolidated his personal power, Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev has recently put brakes on the pace of reform and even back-tracked 
on some aspects of perestroika, according to American analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be entering a new period in which Gorbachev sees the need to rein 
in the more radical forces in society," said Mark Zlotnik, a senior analyst of 
the CIA. "Now that the conservatives (on the ruling Politburo) have been 
vanquished, he needs to put the brakes on." 
</P>
<P>
The changes reflect the underlying precariousness of the situation in the 
Soviet Union, and most analysts see Gorbachev's moves as tactical efforts to 
dampen the tremors that his reforms have already triggered, not a basic shift 
away from restructuring the country. 
</P>
<P>
But in times of chaos, the distinction between tactical and strategic moves can 
disappear: Short-term moves sometimes develop momentum toward strategic 
retreat, several government experts warned. 
</P>
<P>
"He is responding to the growing chaos, trying to tighten up, to accommodate to 
social forces that are getting beyond control, to get some stability and order 
into the country," said Arnold Horelick, a former CIA official who now heads 
the RAND-UCLA Soviet study center. 
</P>
<P>
"His recent moves are reactive now," said one senior U.S. expert, "but I'm sure 
he can't tell you from month to month where he's going." 
</P>
<P>
Any change of direction is watched carefully by U.S. analysts for signs that a 
basic reversal of the reform process is beginning. Skeptics still fear that 
Gorbachev's political, economic and social reforms will someday be reversed -- 
by him or by successors -- and that the confrontational policies of the Cold 
War might reappear. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Gorbachev has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Endorsed a bill banning strikes, which have become common vehicles for 
political as well as economic protest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Called for "greater discipline" within the Communist Party, which he 
insisted will not relinquish its political and ideological positions even 
though its entrenched bureaucracy remains the main roadblock to perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Demanded stronger internal security forces such as the new riot police who, 
armed with a powerful new tear gas and truncheons, bloodily suppressed a 
nationalist demonstration in the Ukrainian city of Lvov. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supported new laws on a mixed economy that fall far short of the reforms 
many Soviets, and many American economists, feel are necessary. Instead of 
private ownership, for example, the new laws provide only for the leasing and 
renting of state-owned property by private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Endorsed the fierce attack by the Kremlin on the nationalist movements, 
particularly in the Baltic states, as "adventurist" when they seek 
independence. He did, however, meet privately with Communist Party leaders from 
those states, reportedly promising them considerable autonomy but urging their 
united opposition to secession. 
</P>
<P>
All this, said one former government analyst, adds up to "a swing to the right, 
undoubtedly." 
</P>
<P>
In the view of this analyst, Gorbachev's actions represent not a fundamental 
move away from reforms but only tactical maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Another Lurch to the Left' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's in preparation for another lurch to the left" with more radical 
reforms, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III seems inclined to the same view. Baker 
told a Senate hearing last week that Gorbachev repeatedly turns economic 
setbacks into political advances, as he did in September when he ousted three 
members from the ruling Politburo who were considered his most conservative 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has not been deterred by the failure to produce economic results," 
Baker said. "To the contrary, at least so far, his recourse when facing 
obstacles, as we saw once again this summer, is to use problems to further 
consolidate his authority. Then he takes (new) steps to press political and 
economic reforms further. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't fold, he doesn't call, he simply raises the stakes," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Soviet specialists, both in and out of government, also see 
Gorbachev's recent moves as a tactical rather than a strategic retreat. But 
most are reluctant to predict whether another giant step forward will follow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stronger, More Indispensable' 
</P>
<P>
"It's paradoxical," said Horelick, "that because the situation in that country 
is so bad, Gorbachev becomes personally stronger and more indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is temporarily backtracking, taking stock and adopting stabilizing 
measures," said Zlotnik in offering his personal views, rather than an official 
U.S. assessment, at a public seminar at the Smithsonian's Kennan Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread discussion of the dangers of anarchy, coups and civil war in 
Moscow has forced Gorbachev to address these possibilities, if only to dismiss 
them. But for him even to discuss them publicly, according to Zlotnik, 
indicates that "the situation is measurably more acute now than when (Nikita 
S.) Khrushchev was overthrown" in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's position appears stronger within the Politburo after last month's 
Central Committee meeting. But his opposition has long been concentrated in the 
party's Central Committee and in the party rank-and-file rather than the 
Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
He has been trying to shift power to the embryonic legislature, as an 
alternative to the party. This would provided him with an alternate base of 
support. Now he is Soviet leader because he is general secretary of the party, 
but in the future, his other role as the Soviet president may become more 
powerful if the legislature does take over power from the party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viable Counterweight 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he probably won a little ground by accident last week. The 
Supreme Soviet forced him to accept less than the 15-month strike ban, but in 
the process showed itself capable of becoming much more than the rubber-stamp 
legislatures of the past. A stronger Supreme Soviet, while more difficult to 
manage, is a potentially viable counterweight to the party bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev today seems secure, mainly because no credible alternative to him 
exists. "Although the crisis is deepening under his leadership," Horelick said, 
"his opposition recognizes that the situation is so delicate that even to 
contemplate a change now would be very destabilizing." 
</P>
<P>
The next dangerous period for him is likely in mid-winter, when economic and 
nationalist pressures may erupt at the same time. A major fuel shortage for 
homes and factories, for example, might coincide with the new elections, 
between December and February, for the top jobs in the 15 republics, numerous 
regions, and local communities. These elections could bring to power outspoken 
nationalists in the Baltic states and even the Ukraine -- leaders intent on 
greater independence than the Kremlin will tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
Riots could take place that would have to be brutally suppressed, as Chinese 
authorities dealt with demonstrators in Beijing last June, some scholars have 
theorized. A substantial retrenchment of Gorbachev's reform program would 
occur, perhaps going so far as Gorbachev's replacement by the moderate-centrist 
faction of the Politburo now building around Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most fearful outcomes that might follow -- sparked by uprisings in 
the Baltics or East European nations deserting the Warsaw Pact, for example -- 
could be a backlash regime, built upon Russian nationalism, that would be 
reactionary, repressive and militant, some observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Some scholars have called this possible result "Red fascism."

Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the disputed southern Soviet region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh attacked each other's villages over the weekend and fought a 
series of gun battles in a sharp escalation of tensions in the region, 
authorities reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
People are now dying almost daily in the fighting, the official news agency 
Tass reported from Stepanakert, the regional capital, as the fighting 
intensified. 
</P>
<P>
And the prolonged road and rail blockade of the region, an enclave of Christian 
Armenians in Muslim Azerbaijan, continues despite the call by the central 
government last week that it be lifted immediately to avert what increasingly 
is portrayed as a local civil war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food, Fuel Supplies Gone 
</P>
<P>
"The region has exhausted its stocks of food, fuel and medicines," Tass said. 
"There are now signs of an epidemic of viral hepatitis." The only supplies 
reaching the region are brought in by military airlift. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being killed daily, houses burned down and cars destroyed," Tass 
said. "Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with dark 
malice and suppresses their reason." 
</P>
<P>
The 55,000 special interior troops assigned to maintain order in 
Nagorno-Karabakh are also coming under fire, according to Tass, and over the 
weekend they engaged several armed groups, including a band of Armenians said 
to be assaulting an Azerbaijani village in revenge for similar attacks on 
Armenian villages. 
</P>
<P>
"A large group of gunmen from Armenia attempted an armed attack on the 
Azerbaijani village of Lachin," Tass reported. "The special district garrison 
of interior troops was forced to use firearms to disperse them." 
</P>
<P>
A military patrol in Shusha, another predominantly Azerbaijani town in the 
region, had earlier arrested a number of Azerbaijanis who had been firing at an 
Armenian village with carbines, Tass said. Those detained included residents of 
Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, who had come "to boost combat morale," according 
to officials. 
</P>
<P>
A major highway bridge leading into Stepanakert was blown up over the weekend, 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are exchanges of fire from both sides, and these have recently become 
more or less continuous," a spokesman for the region's special administration 
said on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate dispatch, Tass said that troops had managed to get several 
freight trains through the blockade to Stepanakert over the weekend despite 
attacks on them. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper Moscow News had reported last week that armed groups had 
begun setting up camps in the mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh and appeared to be 
training guerrilla bands in them. Officers commanding the detachments of 
interior troops said that both Armenians and Azerbaijanis had substantial 
numbers of firearms, including machine guns, and quantities of explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's economic blockade of neighboring Armenia also continued on Sunday 
despite earlier government statements that it had been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Although the central government reported on Friday and again on Sunday that 
trains were arriving almost hourly in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, officials 
there said that the flow was sporadic and the goods which did arrive were 
largely spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that "serious measures were taken to ensure the safety of rail 
traffic" over the weekend and that 37 trains had been sent to Armenia on 
Saturday and Sunday, but that "extremist forces, interested in preserving 
tensions between the two republics, hampered the normal function of the 
railway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops Apparently Not Deployed 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, authorized the use of troops to 
break the blockade, but no soldiers appear to have been deployed either along 
the roads or railway or to be escorting convoys of trucks or trains. Armenia 
gets 85% of its freight through Azerbaijan, and only a small flow of cargo is 
reaching it now through neighboring Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Azerbaijani Popular Front, which has organized the blockade 
over the past month to reinforce claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, said Sunday that 
some trains were being allowed to pass but only during daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
"They are getting food and building materials for the earthquake zone," Nazim 
Ragimov said from Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, "but we are not letting them 
have any fuel." 
</P>
<P>
Other front officials said that attacks have continued on those trains that 
travel without their clearance. 
</P>
<P>
The front, which registered as an organization last week, held another of its 
rallies, this attended by an estimated 400,000 people, in Baku's Lenin Square 
on Sunday to warn the republic's government not to back down in the 
confrontation with Armenia despite pressure from Moscow not only to end the 
blockade but to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.

ADMINISTRATION SEEKS TO SPREAD PANAMA BLAME; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH AIDE SAYS CONGRESS HAS HAMSTRUNG PRESIDENT

<P>
A top Administration official said Sunday that President Bush's critics in 
Congress share responsibility for the United States' reluctance to use American 
military personnel to assist in a coup attempt against Panamanian leader Manuel 
A. Noriega last week. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said that Congress, through 
"micromanagement of the Executive Branch," has historically discouraged 
Presidents from using military force to topple unpopular leaders of other 
countries. He referred specifically to an executive order prohibiting 
assassinations by agents of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has, by its actions and its demeanor, certainly leaned us against the 
kinds of things now they're saying we should have done," Scowcroft said on 
ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Host of Critics 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, members of both parties in Congress -- virtually everyone 
except the most liberal members -- have criticized Bush for failing to provide 
the mutineers with the military assistance that would have enabled their coup 
against Noriega to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft was reacting to their criticism as well as a statement by Senate 
Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren (D-Okla.) that the Bush 
Administration has never been denied any request for congressional approval of 
covert activity in Panama designed to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Boren, also appearing on ABC, said: "Since George Bush became President, every 
single word of authority that he had requested from the Intelligence Committee 
and every single penny that he has requested from the Intelligence Committee 
relating to Panama, he has gotten and gotten with my support." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft replied that he was "astonished" by Boren's statement, adding, "We 
did not get everything we had wanted." But after the television show ended, and 
after he discused the matter privately with Boren, according to a White House 
spokesman, Scowcroft acknowledged that the senator's statement was not 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to sources, the Senate Intelligence Committee discouraged 
then-President Ronald Reagan from carrying out a covert plan that he had 
authorized to foment dissent against Noriega among his own forces. Scowcroft 
appeared to be alluding to that dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Scowcroft's comments reflected a widespread view within the 
Administration that the President's critics would have been equally -- if not 
more -- upset had the White House authorized U.S. military support for the 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen so many bloodthirsty people as I've experienced over the 
last week . . . who say we should have used force," said Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Monday Morning Quarterbacks' 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on. There are 
more Monday morning quarterbacks per square mile in Washington than any other 
city in the nation. The fact of the matter is, given what we knew then, and 
what we know now, I still think we made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have acknowledged that their decision-making during the 
crisis was not as efficient as it might have been, but Bush has declared that 
he still feels he made the right decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, told ABC that he doubts members of Congress are speaking for their 
constituents when they call for the use of U.S. military force to oust Noriega. 
"My judgment is the American people do not want that, nor do the Latin American 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft, Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, all of whom 
appeared on television Sunday in an effort to counter congressional criticism, 
said the President last Tuesday authorized the commander of U.S forces in 
Panama to capture Noriega without the use of military force, if possible. Bush 
also instructed him to devise a plan for using troops to seize Noriega in the 
event such an action was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these two options were ever pursued by American forces in Panama, 
however, because the rebels said they were unwilling to surrender Noriega to 
the United States and because the coup collapsed shortly after Bush issued the 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
"We never made the decision to use military force," said Cheney. "That would 
have involved going in against the rebels and taking Noriega from them. I never 
thought that was a very good idea, but we told him (the U.S. commander) to be 
prepared in case he got the order to do so. And then, shortly after that, the 
coup fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney characterized the position of U.S. troops in Panama last Tuesday as 
follows: "We were leaning forward in case the President made the decision to 
intervene militarily." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baker Against U.S. Action 
</P>
<P>
Baker, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," said it would have been a mistake 
for the President to commit troops to assist the Panamanian rebels under the 
circumstances. "You do not commit American lives on somebody else's plan and 
somebody else's schedule," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what order went from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the 
American command in Panama regarding the seizure of Noriega, Baker said, "I 
think the message that was sent was that, if there were an opportunity to do 
this without risking bloodshed and significant loss of American life and to do 
so without open military involvement, then he was free to go ahead -- the 
commander on the ground was free to go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Although Noriega succeeded in putting down the coup attempt, Baker said that 
the Panamanian leader continues to be weakened by his loss of support among 
other Latin American nations and among the officers in his own Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
"He is isolated," said Baker. "We are seeing his sole base of support -- the 
Panama Defense Forces -- come unglued, engage in insurrections against him, and 
I think frankly that this is moving in the right direction. I would argue that 
there's a very good possibility that Gen. Noriega is a lot weaker after this 
unfortunately unsuccessful attempt than he was before." 
</P>
<P>
Boren has criticized the President for failing to bring U.S. intelligence 
officials into the decision-making last Tuesday, and Cheney acknowledged that 
the CIA was not represented at two key meetings between the President and his 
advisers in the White House situation room. But he insisted the President did 
receive intelligence reports from CIA officials in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that somehow the President did not convene his advisers and 
seek their advice is garbage," Cheney said. "It's not true."

Wildlife specialists from more than 100 countries began meeting in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, focusing on an effort to keep Africa's fast-dwindling elephant 
population from disappearing forever. Delegates of the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as 
CITES, must find common ground between the East Africa demand for an ivory ban, 
supported by the United States and Western Europe, and the position that 
controlled marketing of tusks can finance anti-poaching measures. CITES rulings 
are non-binding and rely on international pressure for enforcement.

Record early autumn cold penetrated the north-central part of the nation, while 
frost warnings were in place in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, where the National 
Weather Service expected that the first significant frost of the season could 
put an end to the growing season. The chill was blamed on a cold Canadian 
high-pressure system, which generated near-cloudless skies and temperatures in 
the 20s. Record lows included 24 at Duluth, Minn.; 22 at International Falls, 
Minn.; 22 at Marquette, Mich., and 27 at Minneapolis-St. Paul.

The United States will continue producing chemical weapons even after a new 
global treaty authorizing their destruction begins to take effect, U.S. 
officials said. President Bush did not mention this intent when he told the 
United Nations last month that he favors immediate steps to "halt and reverse" 
the threat of chemical arms, the Washington Post reported. However, officials 
who asked not to be named said Bush has decided to continue producing chemical 
weapons after a secret policy review. They said the Defense Department contends 
that U.S. plans for producing an arsenal of "binary" chemical weapons, which 
employ two components that become lethal when combined, will likely be at an 
early stage when a new treaty is finished. It said continued production is 
needed in case the treaty's provisions cannot be implemented.

Tens of thousands of people marched through rainy streets in Rome to protest 
racism and demand better conditions for Italy's immigrants. The marchers walked 
through central Rome behind several African immigrants carrying a banner 
reading: "Together for a Future Without Racism." Organizers said 200,000 people 
took part, but police estimates varied from 60,000 to 100,000. The march was 
organized by the Communist labor union CGIL and dozens of citizens' groups 
after robbers killed a South African refugee in southern Italy.

Police officers in Northern Ireland said they raided 30 homes and arrested 28 
people in connection with recent leaks of security files identifying Irish 
Republican Army suspects. The Royal Ulster Constabulary would not comment on 
British news reports that the detainees were members of the Ulster Defense 
Regiment, the locally recruited and mainly Protestant part-time force of the 
British army. Charges have not been filed. The raids followed allegations that 
secret files on IRA suspects have been leaked to Protestant gangs.

TIJUANA SEWAGE: ACCORD CALLED A BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S.-Mexico environmental pact signed in Washington last week is a 
breakthrough that could end the decades-long spillage of Tijuana sewage into 
San Diego-area farms, wetlands and coast, according to U.S. experts and 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a landmark agreement that will finally begin to resolve the problem," 
said Narendra N. Gunaji, U.S. commissioner for the International Boundary and 
Water Commission, an El Paso-based panel that mediates border matters between 
the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The accord also underlines the growing cooperation between U.S. and Mexican 
authorities in combatting border environmental problems, from the befouling of 
the Rio Grande to smelter emissions in the Arizona-Sonora region to the 
border-wide dumping of toxic wastes. Border-area environmental hazards 
increasingly have emerged as irritants in U.S.-Mexico relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1993 Target Date 
</P>
<P>
"The pollution is mutually detrimental to both nations, and therefore both 
nations must work together," Gunaji said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement commits both governments to the construction of a San Diego-based 
facility -- costing nearly $200 million -- that would treat wastes from Mexico. 
Despite the agreement, the plant is still far from reality, with funding 
questions still unresolved. The facility is not scheduled to be in operation 
until at least 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the accord, experts said, the Mexican government in effect abandoned 
plans to construct a treatment plant in fast-growing southeastern Tijuana, a 
project that many on the U.S. side feared would exacerbate the problem by 
depositing huge amounts of barely treated sewage into the already polluted 
Tijuana River, which flows into San Diego. The proposed plant was to be built 
on the Rio Alamar, a tributary of the Tijuana River. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities, on the other hand, agreed to allocate tax dollars exclusively 
to treat foreign wastes. Gunaji noted that Washington, concerned about the 
pollution of the Rio Grande, already is picking up half the tab of a 
$44-million treatment plant planned for Nuevo Laredo, across the river from 
Laredo, Tex. A jointly operated treatment plant has been in operation in 
Nogales, Ariz., for more than 30 years, but that facility handles wastes from 
both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, lawmakers with little faith in Mexican sewage-treatment methods 
had been lobbying for years for a U.S.-based plant to handle Mexican wastes. 
But, until recently, the efforts had received sparse encouragement from their 
Mexican counterparts. That changed considerably in the administration of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office Dec. 1 and has emphasized 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
While the final details of the agreement still have to be worked out, there was 
relief among officials that the Mexican government had finally acceded to the 
concept of a binational facility. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bilbray, a San Diego County supervisor who has been working on the issue 
for more than a decade -- he once rode a bulldozer to dramatize his displeasure 
with the northbound Tijuana sewage flows -- recalled that many doubted that 
Mexico would ever consent to such a plan, or that U.S. officials would agree to 
fund it. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the impossible dream," he said. "We just kept the pressure up. Now we 
know that we'll have our own technology." 
</P>
<P>
For years, raw sewage from Tijuana has naturally flowed to the northern side of 
the border via the Tijuana River and down numerous gullies and arroyos. Many 
Tijuana residents remain without regular plumbing, allowing wastes to enter 
rough channels that drain to the north. In addition, the city's sewage pipes 
are subject to regular breakdown, augmenting the foul flow. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, much of the city's sewage -- 10 million gallons a day or more -- 
ends up in thefetid Tijuana River, which drains on the U.S. side. At the mouth 
of the river on the U.S. side are a slough and a unique national estuarine 
sanctuary, one of the few on the West Coast, that attract considerable 
wildlife, including endangered species. Conservationists fear the impact on the 
delicate ecosystem. Others worry about health hazards for humans: a 2 1/2-mile 
swath of beach just north of the border has been quarantined for more than six 
years because of the sewage. 
</P>
<P>
With the agreement signed, the debate about the treatment project very likely 
will shift to the fiscal arena. Both nations are being asked to contribute 
substantial sums at a time when lawmakers in Mexico City and Washington are 
tightening their fiscal belts. The exact amounts are still to be determined, 
but early estimates put the price tag of the project at $192 million. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is expected to be asked to chip in about $100 million, of 
which only $14 million has already been appropriated, officials said. Whether 
lawmakers from non-border states will be eager to fund a project to treat 
Mexican sewage remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
California also has budgeted $14 million, and is expected to kick in another $1 
million. The city of San Diego, has budgeted $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, according to preliminary estimates, will be required to contribute 
about $41 million -- $21 million for pipeline construction in Tijuana and 
another $20 million for the plant. The binational agreement, however, raises 
the possibility that a loan program will be worked out allowing Mexico to pay 
its share of the costs over a 10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has also reserved the right to reclaim the Tijuana waters treated at the 
international plant -- an important point, given the water shortages that 
always threaten the semidesert region. 
</P>
<P>
The details are now to be worked out by the two nations' representatives on the 
International Boundary and Water Commission. A definitive plan is expected 
within 90 days, authorities said, and construction could begin next year.

FOES CALL INS CHECKPOINT HAZARDOUS, URGE MOVE

San Clemente city officials, tired of seeing U.S. Border Patrol chases end in 
bloody accidents on their streets, are renewing their call for Congress to 
finance a long-proposed relocation of the immigration checkpoint that is just 
four miles south of the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a time bomb," San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice said. "One day the 
chases will result in some innocent adults or children being killed on the 
streets of our city." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, 10 people were injured after they jumped from a van that Border 
Patrol agents were chasing on Interstate 5 in San Clemente. The chase began 
when the van's driver sped off while he was being questioned at the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16-Lane Checkpoint Proposed 
</P>
<P>
The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, which runs the checkpoint 
near the San Onofre nuclear power plant, proposed three years ago that it be 
moved 5 miles south, into San Diego County. The new checkpoint would be 
expanded into 16 lanes (the existing checkpoint has four lanes), both to 
facilitate traffic on northbound Interstate 5 and to reduce opportunities for 
illegal immigrants to evade arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has the backing of Sen. Pete Wilson (R-San Diego) and Rep. Ron 
Packard (R-Carlsbad). The Defense Department, which owns the Camp Pendleton 
Marine Corps base, the site of both the present and proposed checkpoints, also 
approves of the change, according to Packard's office. 
</P>
<P>
But action has lagged in Congress, mainly because of the $30-million cost of 
the project, Packard said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get money authorized because of the tight budget situations," 
Packard said. But the cost is justified, he said, because the new checkpoint 
might save lives as well as aid the government's efforts to stop illegal 
immigration and drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 10 Deaths Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Charles Geer, patrol agent in charge of the checkpoint, said that he had no 
exact statistics on fatal accidents at the site but that "about eight to 10" 
people have been killed there in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Fire Department paramedics, who respond to such accidents, said 
the victims usually are illegal immigrants who jump from vehicles stopped at 
the checkpoint and are struck as they dart into southbound traffic on the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Geer said, some motorists fail to slow down in time at the 
existing checkpoint and slam into the line of stopped vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be a minimum traffic backup," Geer said, referring to the 
multilane design of the proposed new checkpoint. And the chances for high-speed 
chases running into San Clemente would be reduced at the new location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a new checkpoint would help our situation," San Clemente Police Chief 
Al Ehlow said. "The configuration makes it more difficult for a high-speed 
chase to begin. Then, too, if a chase were to start, the new checkpoint would 
be five miles farther south from San Clemente, giving them more time to head 
off the suspects before they got to our city. We've had problems with those 
chases for many years." 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he has pushed the safety angle in trying to drum up congressional 
support for a new checkpoint. At one time, he said, the relocation proposal 
seemed to have broad support in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"But now it seems to be in limbo," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Packard and Wilson succeeded in getting $2.7 million earmarked for 
engineering and design studies. But at the last minute, a congressional 
conference committee deleted the designation, and money was spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back to Square Zero' 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're back to square zero," Packard said. "Sen. Wilson and I are now 
hoping we can get the funding for the checkpoint inserted into one of the 
anti-drug bills. If not, I'll try to get the funding into a highway 
appropriation bill." 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint near San Clemente is the busiest in the nation, according to the 
INS. In 1988, agents there captured 54,678 deportable illegal immigrants and 
arrested another 800 who were involved in smuggling operations, according to 
Packard's office. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint also recovered stolen property -- including cars and items 
burglarized from homes -- valued at more than $2 million last year. A total of 
128 narcotics seizures were made.

College seniors don't know much about history or literature. Nearly a quarter 
of them did not know that Franklin D. Roosevelt was President during the 
Depression, and an equal number identified an excerpt from "The Communist 
Manifesto" as part of the U.S. Constitution, according to findings of a study 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Gallup Poll result also suggests considerable ignorance of other basic 
facts. One-fourth of those polled were unaware that Christopher Columbus landed 
in the Western Hemisphere before 1500. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60% of those surveyed did not know the Korean War started during 
President Harry S. Truman's term (14% thought it began while John F. Kennedy 
was in the White House); 58% did not know that William Shakespeare wrote "The 
Tempest." Only 58% of the students knew that the Koran is a sacred text of 
Islam; 12% identified it as a Jewish text, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
The survey consisted of 87 questions with multiple-choice answers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the students' answers were to be graded, more than half of those tested 
would have failed," concluded the report on the study, which was conducted for 
the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the results, NEH Chairwoman Lynne V. Cheney on Sunday called for 
colleges and universities to revise their curricula so that undergraduates must 
study "essential areas of knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
In a booklet titled "50 Hours," she suggested a core curriculum for teaching 
"basic landmarks of history and thought." 
</P>
<P>
About 55% of the students, surveyed in the spring of their senior year, 
answered fewer than 60% of the questions correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Even more troubling, the report said, was that more than a third of the 
questions were taken from a 1986 test designed for 17-year-olds. When only 
those questions expected to be answered correctly by most 17-year-olds were 
considered, 49% of the college seniors still failed. 
</P>
<P>
The students even had trouble with five history questions from citizenship 
tests for immigrants. Only two of those questions were answered correctly by a 
high proportion of students. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 696 students at 67 colleges who took the test, 68% failed the literature 
section and 39% failed the history section. 
</P>
<P>
About 83% of them did not know that T. S. Eliot wrote "The Wasteland" and "The 
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock;" 58% could not identify Plato as the author of 
"The Republic." 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, 95% knew that Mark Twain wrote "The Adventures of 
Huckleberry Finn." 
</P>
<P>
Some 42% of the students could not place the Civil War within half a century, 
and 55% could not identify the Magna Carta. 
</P>
<P>
About 23% of them said that the phrase, "From each according to his ability, to 
each according to his need," was part of the U.S. Constitution instead of "The 
Communist Manifesto" of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. 
</P>
<P>
On average, men scored higher than women, and the seniors in private schools 
had higher scores than public university students. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that many colleges and universities award bachelor's degrees to 
students who have taken no courses in history, literature, science or 
mathematics. He urged that trustees and administrators support faculty efforts 
to strengthen general education requirements.

TAX MAN COMETH, BUT AN ARAB TOWN RESISTS

BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During almost two years of struggle against Israeli occupation, almost nothing 
has been sure for Palestinians but death and taxes, although in this town at 
least, residents are trying to free themselves from the tax man. 
</P>
<P>
In Beit Sahur, which is built around the fields where the Bible says shepherds 
heard angels herald Jesus' birth, everyone is refusing to pay income and sales 
taxes to the Israeli government. In response, Israel has ordered the army to 
escort tax collectors door-to-door and confiscate furniture, appliances, 
television, pianos and anything else deemed valuable. 
</P>
<P>
The self-styled Unified Leadership of the Uprising in the Occupied Territories 
has coalesced around the tax revolt as a means of channeling the frustrations 
of the intifada, as the uprising is known. They hope that support for civil 
disobedience expressed in Beit Sahur will spread elsewhere in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip and give them a new weapon in fighting the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Leads Nonviolent Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
"This is the city that leads nonviolent struggle, and we must stop Israel from 
crushing it," said Faisal Husseini, a public leader of the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in months, Israeli officials appear to be on the defensive 
in the face of a Palestinian tactic. In answer to charges that they are trying 
to crack peaceful protest by sacking possessions from family living rooms, 
officials respond only that the confiscations are legal under Israeli law. Even 
during the uprising against its rule, Israel insists that it is trying to keep 
up public services and that residents must pay. 
</P>
<P>
To limit adverse publicity, the army has sealed off Beit Sahur, just a trumpet 
blast from Bethlehem, for most of the last three weeks and disconnected the 
town's telephone service. When Palestinian activists called a press conference 
last week in Jerusalem to complain about the tax raids, the army closed the 
streets around a hotel that was hosting the conference and declared the area a 
"closed military zone." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, soldiers barred a delegation of seven European consuls from 
entering Beit Sahur to investigate the property seizures. The commander at the 
roadblock said the town was sealed off for "operational reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Not Be Magic Formula 
</P>
<P>
It is far from clear that the Palestinians have hit on a magic formula to force 
an end to Israeli occupation. For one thing, civil disobedience has failed to 
gain much support anywhere but in Beit Sahur. Many grass-roots leaders in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip are calling for stepped-up violence, not campaigns of 
folded arms. 
</P>
<P>
Even Beit Sahur is torn over how far to carry the protest. As has become 
commonplace in the intifada, factional disputes broke out: Communist activists 
wanted to compromise with the Israelis, while members of the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine called for 100% refusal to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"If one pays, we'll all have to pay," said a street organizer and part-time 
plumber in Beit Sahur. "Do we want to keep paying for the bullets used against 
us?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small-Town Values 
</P>
<P>
Among West Bank cities, Beit Sahur is viewed as a little corner of middle-class 
propriety: neat, quiet and devoted to small-town values. Ozzie and Harriet 
could live here. 
</P>
<P>
Householders maintain trim gardens and olive groves, work is considered a prime 
virtue and the town's population of 12,000 boasts that its schools are the 
oldest in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the intifada, Beit Sahur residents have been the most 
dedicated of all Palestinians to peaceful protest. They set up victory gardens 
to wean themselves away from dependence on Israeli foodstuffs. When schools 
were closed for most of 20 months, they formed underground classes to keep 
studies going. When Israeli peace activists were looking for Palestinians to 
meet, Beit Sahur was an eager host. 
</P>
<P>
Violence has been comparatively minor. The only Palestinian killed was hit on 
the head by a block dropped on him by a soldier. Stone-throwing incidents here 
are played like games by schoolchildren without much damage to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responded to Call 
</P>
<P>
Last May, when the Unified Leadership reiterated a call for Arabs to stop 
paying taxes, only Beit Sahur responded fully. Residents refused to pay income 
tax while merchants and craftsmen also withheld value-added taxes on their 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal officials issued a statement to explain the philosophical basis for 
their protest: "To the Israeli people, we say that for 20 years of occupation 
you thought we were satisfied, and then came the intifada to tell you that we 
want our freedom and that not paying taxes is a form of nonviolent resistance 
to your occupation. The intifada tells you that by treating us as a colony of 
Israel you are practicing taxation without representation." 
</P>
<P>
So far, tax collectors have taken goods from 60 houses and stores in Beit Sahur 
and the government announced plans to raid another 250 properties. A public 
auction of the items has been tentatively scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in as if they own us," said Nasser abu Ayta, the owner of a video 
cassette store and a nationalist activist who has been jailed on several 
occasions. He said that last week, the tax man took three color televisions, 
three black-and-white televisions, two video recorders and several appliances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washer Taken in Mid-Cycle 
</P>
<P>
"They even took a washer while the rinse cycle was on," Abu Ayta said. He 
claimed that goods belonging to his brothers were taken even though only he was 
wanted for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Raji Qumsiyeh, an upholsterer, said that a tax collector and nine soldiers came 
and carted away a 12-piece living room set, two carpets, a table and four 
chairs, a television and video recorder. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, now we have plenty of time to sit and play cards," Qumsiyeh sighed. 
</P>
<P>
The army has also taken the opportunity of frequent curfews, when everyone must 
stay indoors, to make about 20 arrests. Among the new detainees are some 
residents who have been active in meeting peace groups and presenting their 
case for an independent state. 
</P>
<P>
"Can this be a coincidence?" asked Hana Andoni, whose son Ghassan, a physics 
teacher and host for Arab-Israeli meetings, was thrown in jail last week. 
"Ghassan talked peace and they come and take him away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sprits Flagging 
</P>
<P>
The focus on the tax revolt comes at a time when leaders of the uprising are 
searching for ways to revive flagging spirits in the intifada. The toll of 
deaths, more than 550 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers, has eroded 
enthusiasm.

As night fell Sunday, Jews throughout Israel marked the start of their holiest 
day, Yom Kippur, with fasting and prayers of penitence. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the nation's highways and streets came to a halt, commercial flights 
were suspended and the border with Egypt and bridges to Jordan were closed. 
</P>
<P>
State-run Israel Radio and Television and Army Radio ceased broadcasts, leaving 
the country without communications for the solemn holiday, which ends at 
sundown today. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Israelis are secular, Yom Kippur is widely observed, and many 
flock to the nation's almost 8,000 synagogues for prayer services. It is 
traditional for Jews to refrain from taking food and water during the 24-hour 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Jews beg God for forgiveness and pray for life and peace during Yom Kippur, 
also known as the "Day of Atonement." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli families often take advantage of the quiet by walking down major 
roadways to synagogues. In past years, cars that ventured out on Israeli 
streets were sometimes stoned by religious zealots. Appeals were broadcast on 
the radio to allow ambulances to pass freely. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Jews traditionally gather at the Western Wall, Judaism's 
holiest site. The wall is the last remnant of the temple destroyed by the 
Romans in AD 70. Many Jews spend the entire 24-hour fast day praying at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Yom Kippur ends the 10 "Days of Awe" that begin on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish 
New Year. Jews believe that during the period, God decides each person's 
destiny over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
This Yom Kippur marks the 16th anniversary of the 1973 Middle East War, which 
began when Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce battles were fought on the Golan Heights and in the Sinai desert, and 
Arab armies briefly threatened to invade Israel itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Visit Graves 
</P>
<P>
Every year at this time, bereaved families lay wreaths and flowers at the 
gravesites of the almost 3,000 Israeli troops who fell in the war. 
</P>
<P>
In a special broadcast to the nation, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir paid 
tribute to those who fell.

Seven people were killed and nine others injured when an explosion and fire 
tore through a bus in northern Bogota on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At least two children were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports blamed the accident on a bomb planted by attackers with links 
to the nation's drug cartels. But a police spokesman said the fire apparently 
was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle's electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said police were investigating the incident to see if it was linked 
to the 64 bombings that have rocked Bogota since drug lords declared war on the 
government Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was on its normal route in northern Bogota when an explosion ripped the 
vehicle apart and engulfed it in flames, witnesses said. An unknown number of 
passengers managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The national radio chain RCN said the fire was caused by a bomb placed by two 
assailants in the back of the bus. It said the two fled just before the device 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
RCN did not cite a source for its report.

POPE PRAYS FOR REUNIFICATION OF NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA

<P>
Pope John Paul II prayed for reunification of the bitterly divided Korean 
peninsula here Sunday in a plea for peace to members of one of the fastest 
growing Roman Catholic churches in the world. 
</P>
<P>
A colorful and disciplined sea of worshipers, more than 600,000, gathered in 
bright sunshine for a papal Mass on an island in the middle of the Han River, 
which bisects this capital of nearly 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"The Korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet able to become 
one in peace and justice," said the Pope at the Mass climaxing an international 
Eucharistic Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On his second visit to South Korea in five years, John Paul also challenged 
President Roh Tae Woo, an army general when the Pope came in 1984, to extend 
democratic reforms that are the fitful counterpoint to rapid economic 
development in a nation of 42 million. 
</P>
<P>
"You are confronted with the challenge of seeking peaceful and just pathways 
toward a national life and reunification based on authentic justice, freedom 
and inalienable human rights," the Pope told Roh in public remarks that papal 
aides said were echoed in a 35-minute private meeting. 
</P>
<P>
His return visit to South Korea, the Pope told the Korean leader, "enables me 
to note the strong desire of all your people to proceed along the way to full 
democracy, a prosperous and tranquil civic life." 
</P>
<P>
Capitalist South Korea and Communist North Korea have been armed and angry 
neighbors along the 38th Parallel since armistice ended the Korean War in 1953. 
Such division is a microcosm of tensions around the world, the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
"East is divided from West, North from South. These divisions are the heritage 
of history and of the ideological conflicts which so often divide peoples who 
otherwise would wish to live in peace and brotherhood with one another," John 
Paul told the respectful crowd in his homily at the island Mass. "Korea, too, 
is marked by a tragic division that penetrates ever more deeply into the life 
and character of its people." 
</P>
<P>
The way forward, the Pope said, is clearly marked: "True peace -- the shalom 
which the world urgently needs -- springs eternally from the infinitely rich 
mystery of God's love." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic reforms born of street protest have changed the face of South Korean 
political life since the Pope's first visit, but authoritarian practices 
persist. National and international human rights groups deride South Korea for 
arbitrary arrests and a crackdown on political dissidents that has intensified 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Roh government has no patience with South Koreans who seek 
reunification with the north through private initiatives; a Protestant minister 
who visited hard-line North Korea was recently sentenced to 10 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Bishops 
</P>
<P>
Catholics from all over the world attended the Eucharistic Congress, including 
two elderly Vietnamese bishops whom the Pope had never met. No Catholics came 
from North Korea, despite an invitation that was directed to them. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul continued his trip today with a flight to Jakarta for a six-day visit 
to Indonesia.

PROBES OF BRADLEY TAKING TOLL ON IMAGE AT CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Affable and relaxed, Mayor Tom Bradley faced the news media one morning last 
week to announce a new program aimed at cutting traffic and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The event followed the customary format: a speech by the mayor, explanations 
from aides and then the reporters' turn. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, smart alecks, ask some questions," Bradley said, turning to the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Intended as an icebreaker, the remark got a laugh, but it underscored the 
frustration of the five-term mayor as he tries to divert the attention of the 
press and public from his financial affairs and project an image of 
business-as-usual at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Six months of persistent stories about local and, more recently, federal 
investigations have taken their toll and signs have emerged that business is 
anything but usual at City Hall. Not only has Bradley encountered what he 
considers a hostile press corps for the first time in his career, but he also 
faces increasing and unaccustomed friction with the 15-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom was very popular and it was not fashionable to take your cuts at him," 
Councilwoman Joy Picus said last week. "Now people don't mind saying what they 
think and they can be very mean. This man who was, in fact, a paragon of virtue 
has been blemished." A liberal who has worked with Bradley on issues such as 
child care, Picus has nevertheless criticized him over the years as 
inaccessible to council members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boldness in the Council 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by what they view as a weakened and distracted mayor, some members 
of the City Council have begun seizing power, pushing harder for their own 
agendas, and testing the water for runs at Bradley's job, possibly before his 
term ends in 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many council members who are considering whether they should make a 
run for the mayor's office," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who has been 
cautious in her criticism of the mayor. "And it's never too early to start." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there has been a noticeable change in the relationship 
between the mayor's office and the City Council, Flores said. "Members who in 
the past have been kind of laid back and accepting of recommendations are 
becoming more vocal," she said, and easy passage of the mayor's priority 
programs "is no longer a given." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, whose Ad Hoc Ethics Committee began hearings last week 
on the city attorney's investigation of the mayor, said he sees signs of 
"chaos" in leadership at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley may no longer be able to provide "a strong vision of the future for the 
city," said Woo, who was elected four years ago when he unseated a Bradley 
ally. "I don't know where that vision is going to come from if it's not coming 
from the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to move the City Council now is like trying to lead a herd of cats," 
Woo said last week. "You've got to have some glue to hold things together. 
There is no glue here." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley aides deny that the mayor's office has been hobbled by the continuing 
scandal and say that initiatives announced in Bradley's inaugural address three 
months ago are going forward. They say that new initiatives are being announced 
every week but that the news media, especially The Times, have intentionally 
ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints About Coverage 
</P>
<P>
"If the Los Angeles Times were effective in crippling Tom Bradley, all you 
would do is cripple the city of Los Angeles," Michael Gage, Bradley's chief of 
staff, said in an interview Friday. City Council members, he said, take their 
cue from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a blatant attempt by the Los Angeles Times to blank Tom Bradley 
out of the paper with anything positive," Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, The Times last week played on the obituary page a story 
on the mayor's press conference to denounce U.S. Senate passage of a bill that 
would exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 Census. The same day, Gage said, The 
Times reported on the front of the Metro section that Bradley had turned over 
his income tax returns to the U.S. attorney's office as part of a federal probe 
of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Managing Editor Noel Greenwood said that The Times has assessed news 
from the mayor's office according to standards of relevance and fairness, and 
will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has been at the center of an ethical controversy since last March, when 
the first reports of his dealings with Far East National Bank surfaced 
publicly. Bradley was paid $18,000 as a consultant to the bank, which received 
$2 million in city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, City Atty. James K. Hahn filed a civil suit against Bradley for 
failing to disclose major personal stock holdings, but said he did not find 
sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. A federal grand jury 
investigation of the mayor's finances has not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigations have mounted, Bradley has made fewer public appearances 
and vanished from public view for several days at a stretch on two occasions -- 
the latest last week when The Times disclosed details of the federal grand jury 
investigation. He has dramatically cut back on contact with the press and 
refused to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
One indication of the council's invigoration during the last six months is a 
broad reorganization of its committee structure to focus more attention on 
issues such as housing and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
In one move that appeared specifically aimed at the mayor, the council created 
a committee to assume authority over the multibillion-dollar Community 
Redevelopment Agency, a domain that had been strictly the mayor's. Last week, 
the committee refused to endorse a CRA plan to pay the Union Rescue Mission 
$6.5 million to vacate its downtown building. 
</P>
<P>
The plan goes before the City Council this week, but its prospects for approval 
are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest opposition came from Councilwoman Gloria Molina, chairwoman of 
the recently created Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, who 
complained last week that the CRA was attempting to rush the plan through and 
had not provided the council with enough information about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's Assessment 
</P>
<P>
The council's attack on the CRA has "been coming on for some time," said City 
Council President John Ferraro, the architect of the new committee system. "The 
CRA's been running around without any controls over it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's concern that the mayor's been wounded, and maybe he has been," added 
Ferraro, who ran against Bradley in 1985. "But I don't think it affects the 
city operation." 
</P>
<P>
Gage, the mayor's aide, said Bradley does not consider the new oversight of CRA 
a slap, but instead points to the fact that the council voted down a proposal 
to take over the CRA entirely. That, he said, was a recent victory for the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some council members have allowed themselves to be sidetracked," Gage 
said. "At least half of them want to be mayor. Given that the mayor has been 
battered pretty badly, why shouldn't they feel their oats? 
</P>
<P>
"But it takes one person to provide leadership and each time one of them pokes 
his head up, the others will push him down." 
</P>
<P>
Another indication of the mayor's loss of influence was a rare council override 
last week of a Bradley veto. It came in the matter of a temporary moratorium on 
building in two pockets of the 10th District, represented by Councilman Nate 
Holden, a Bradley foe. 
</P>
<P>
Holden had backed the moratorium and won council approval, but Bradley vetoed 
it. The council override, which came in a vote last Wednesday, prompted further 
speculation about Bradley's leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried that the vote sets a precedent for the future and points to 
chaos," said Woo. "Even at best we suffer from a dispersal of authority. We run 
the risk of heading into uncharted waters."

 A GAME OF HIDE-AND-REAP; 
</P>
<P>
AVOCADO GROVES USED BY SOME MARIJUANA GROWERS TO CAMOUFLAGE CROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nestled in North County's rolling hills, distinguished for their dark green 
carpet of avocado trees, is the county's most lucrative cash crop. 
</P>
<P>
These plants are sometimes protected by workers armed with guns and sometimes 
by booby-traps. They're fed by a fertilizer-and-water mix illegally tapped from 
the irrigation lines of a landowner who is paying the bill. The aim of the 
growers is to get their crop to market before they're discovered by lawmen. 
</P>
<P>
It's October, marijuana harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
It's a cat-and-mouse game played annually between law enforcement officers, who 
fly overhead in helicopters, and marijuana growers, who try to hide their 
illicit plants from detection until the crop matures -- both physically and 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Ever-Present Thorn 
</P>
<P>
In a county once considered the methamphetamine capital of the nation because 
of the proliferation of clandestine, back-country chemical labs, and one in 
which more time and money are spent looking for cocaine, crack and heroin, 
marijuana cultivation remains the least spectacular but nonetheless 
ever-present and needling thorn in the side of the law. 
</P>
<P>
It should come as no surprise that this popular drug of the '60s still thrives 
in an era of high-tech designer drugs that have grabbed more headlines and 
killed more people. 
</P>
<P>
Growing marijuana is the least risky of the illegal drug trades to ply, 
narcotics agents say. The grower doesn't use his own land. He doesn't use his 
own water or fertilizer. He doesn't have to be present. He can hire field 
laborers to manicure his crop. And, if the plants are discovered, he usually 
escapes the net. 
</P>
<P>
Against that relatively small risk, consider the potential profit margin: A 
single, high-grade sinsemilla plant, the most potent of the marijuana plants, 
can be put in the ground as a seedling in the spring and grow by October to up 
to 13 feet tall -- literally shooting up like a weed. By then it may be worth 
as much as $9,000 -- wholesale -- after the leaves are dried, processed and 
reduced to 3 pounds of smokable material. By the time the marijuana is 
purchased on the street, its value has doubled or tripled. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics agents won't estimate how much marijuana is being grown in San Diego 
County. But so far this year they have discovered and cut down about 14,000 
plants -- including at a recent raid that netted 3,300 plants ripe for harvest 
in a remote canyon of De Luz, east of Camp Pendleton on the San Diego-Riverside 
counties line. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, agents eradicated nearly 32,000 plants in the county -- worth about 
$200 million if they had reached market. That was a record year here for such 
busts, highlighted by the single seizure of more than 20,000 plants growing on 
the slopes of Palomar Mountain at the eastern end of the Pauma Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The raids don't hold the kind of glamour of a Miami Vice episode. They're more 
gosh-and-by-golly occurrences, a combination of luck and skill in sighting the 
plants from the air, then gathering enough investigators together days or weeks 
later to finally move in. 
</P>
<P>
"Given our limited resources, marijuana is far from a priority for us," said 
Ron Garibotto, assistant agent in charge of the federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration's regional office in San Diego and director of the county's 
multi-agency Narcotics Task Force. "We don't have the teams of agents available 
to work marijuana on a full-time basis." 
</P>
<P>
The DEA contracts with the county Sheriff's Department to fly helicopters over 
remote areas to look for marijuana plots. But, for one recent raid, "it took us 
three weeks to mount a large enough force to move in," Garibotto said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 100 officers -- from task force agents to local police backup to U. 
S. Border Patrol officers -- are needed to raid a marijuana farm. Some go in by 
surprise and try to catch whoever may be tending the plants, while others 
surround the property and try to catch those who scamper for the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Often, agents simply move in on an untended plot. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough resources to go out to a site and camp there for days at 
a time, hoping that someone may come in to check their plants," said Sheriff's 
Lt. Pat Kerins, the department's ranking representative on the Narcotics Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, chances are the person coming in will just be an illegal alien who 
was tending the plants for someone else," he said. "They tell us they're just 
taking care of the fields for some gringos who are paying them big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a recent raid, three men, all documented Mexican laborers, were 
arrested on suspicion of growing the marijuana, but agents have yet to put 
their finger on the person behind the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see these three men growing, harvesting and processing the marijuana, 
but that was a lot of marijuana for them to distribute on their own," Kerins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the field laborers won't squeal on the person behind the operation, 
if, indeed, they know who it is, authorities said. Sometimes, all the worker 
can offer is a physical description of the boss, who occasionally shows up at 
the site to check on things. 
</P>
<P>
From the law enforcement standpoint, then, the success comes only in keeping 
the seized marijuana off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scattered on Periphery 
</P>
<P>
The recent raid was the largest haul of marijuana this year, but was typical in 
other respects. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,300 plants were scattered along the periphery of a 40-acre avocado grove, 
growing in clumps of several hundred here and there in the tall brush. The 
growers tapped into the landowner's irrigation lines, which drip water and 
fertilizer at the base of the avocado trees, and installed their own hoses so 
the same nutrients could feed the illegal plants, which responded vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
The marijuana was detected by sheriff's deputies from the air. A later fly-over 
confirmed the finding. A search warrant was issued in Vista Municipal Court and 
the raid was mounted. 
</P>
<P>
The man who managed that particular grove said he had his suspicions that 
something was amiss. The water pressure for the grove's irrigation system was 
low, said Ben Drake, but he couldn't locate where it had been tapped. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll 'T' into our lines and bury their own lines. On top of that, you've 
got five or six months of growth and leaves, and you don't even see them," 
Drake said. "Either you're lucky because one of your irrigating people runs 
across it, or the task force finds the plants from the air, by chance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Workers Stumble Across It 
</P>
<P>
The raid was the second involving a client of Drake's in two weeks. In the 
previous one, 100 marijuana plants were discovered on another parcel managed by 
Drake near Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
"It was being grown in an area between our ranch and a nursery. There was brush 
in between, where the marijuana was growing, and they tied into our water." 
</P>
<P>
It's not uncommon for grove workers to stumble across marijuana. They are 
instructed to back off quickly and report it to their supervisors, several 
grove managers said. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Taylor said some of his grove workers encountered marijuana growers at 
gunpoint just two weeks ago, within the grove itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The (marijuana) growers told our guys to get out of there -- and they did, 
quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The workers reported the incident to Taylor's company, which in turn notified 
the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them they had a problem, and that we wouldn't go back on the property 
until it's rectified," Taylor said. "We wash our hands of it. It's up to the 
property owner to contact the Sheriff's Department. I don't know if it's been 
reported yet or not. All I know is that we haven't been back." 
</P>
<P>
Growing marijuana within a grove area itself is unusual because most groves are 
so routinely maintained that the chance for detection is greater. 
</P>
<P>
"But some groves are up on hillsides, and, if they can find a secluded part of 
the grove that we don't get to too often, they'll try it," Taylor said. "The 
avocado trees provide a good canopy, so it's harder to see the marijuana from 
the air." 
</P>
<P>
These particular marijuana growers "know there's no guarantee their crop will 
reach fruition, because it might be detected, but, if they can pull it off, 
they make big bucks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting a free ride. They use our land and our water. It's like a 
scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
John Martin, another grove manager, said his workers have discovered marijuana 
"a couple of times," just outside the groves he cares for. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Water Bills 
</P>
<P>
"The owner was complaining of high water bills, so we checked into it," Martin 
said. "We finally found some hoses running off into the brush. The Sheriff's 
Department has told us not to go into those areas because they might be 
booby-trapped, so we just cap off the water and notify the Sheriff's 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
Though booby-traps are rare, narcotics agents have come across them -- 
including, in one incident last year, nails connected to shotgun shells that 
might have exploded at eye level if set off by a trip wire. The trap was 
discovered by agents without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Even when there are no traps, officers anticipate meeting armed resistence when 
they move in. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Bob Baker, who has worked for the Narcotics Task Force for seven years 
in North County, recalls the raid last year that netted more than 20,000 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
That marijuana farm was detected after someone complained about noise and 
gunfire at the bottom of Palomar Mountain. A deputy rode into a remote canyon 
to investigate and saw brilliant green plants growing on the side of the 
mountain -- sticking out like a sore thumb once they came into view, because 
the area had been burned the previous year by a large grass fire, and most of 
the hillside was still barren. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy called Baker, and the two went out again. Baker confirmed that the 
plants were marijuana, then looked on maps to determine who owned the land. The 
owner was a public agency -- a local municipal water district. 
</P>
<P>
When NTF agents staged their first raid, they discovered 11,000 plants and 
arrested four armed men. Some of the plants were less than a foot tall; others 
were 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The growers were watering the plants with water collected in barrels at the 
bottom of a waterfall on the mountain. Pipes from the barrels sent the water 
farther downhill, where drip lines quenched the plants, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Baker got word from a water district employee that they may 
have missed some plants. Investigators returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We went up on a ridge line a half-mile from the original spot, and we found 
another whole field of marijuana plants and another (guard) camp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They sneaked up on a tent and caught two field hands off guard. One was 
cradling a shotgun as he slept, and the other tried to reach for his tennis 
shoes before he was pulled out of the tent by his hair. The shoes helped hide a 
fully loaded, 9 m.m. semiautomatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The second raid netted another 10,000 or so plants, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lot of Time and Effort 
</P>
<P>
Those two, as well as the other four defendants, were able to provide 
investigators with only a broad description of the man they worked for: someone 
in his 30s with blond hair and a blond mustache. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the fire that had gone there the previous year, and because all the 
miles and miles of pipes seemed new, we assume that was his first year in there 
growing marijuana," Baker said. "He spent a lot of time and effort on that one. 
The plants were probably worth $60 million wholesale. But it didn't pay off for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
The bust was believed to be the largest single seizure of marijuana plants that 
year in California, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to find marijuana is like looking for a needle in a haystack," he said. 
"Even though it's a brilliant green, it's hard to see unless the sun hits it 
just right." 
</P>
<P>
And there's no sure place to go looking for the stuff. Marijuana has been found 
growing on federal Bureau of Land Management property, state parkland and in 
the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
An Aug. 31 raid in Jamul was unusual because it led to the arrest of a San 
Diego State University professor on suspicion of growing 700 plants on his 
50-acre ranch. Authorities alleged that the professor, Jack David Mooers, was 
both growing and selling the weed. 
</P>
<P>
The plants were discovered from the air as sheriff's deputies were 
investigating a methamphetamine lab in the same area, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the raids this year were of plants growing on private property in the 
De Luz region of North County, north of Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Not all marijuana is grown outdoors. Four years ago, 3,500 plants were 
discovered growing in an Escondido industrial warehouse. It was detected after 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. discovered that a tenant had tapped into a 
power line unlawfully. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said at the time that it was the most sophisticated marijuana 
cultivation scheme ever uncovered in the county. It featured an intricate, 
automated system for soil-less cultivation with water recycling and 
electrically timed fans set up to simulate breezes and carry pollen. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, investigators seized 195 plants and 200 pounds of harvested 
marijuana, valued at $1.4 million, from remote growing sheds in a valley 10 
miles south of Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most marijuana apparently is grown outdoors, where investigators' 
ability to identify the operators is greatly thwarted. But there are drawbacks 
for the criminals: Animals eat the plants before the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, chicken wire is placed around each plant to keep ground squirrels and 
other small animals away from its base. Deer, however, present a different 
problem, and at least one grower thought of a new solution, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a raid where we got 1,800 plants on the north side of Palomar Mountain. 
It was my first year with the NTF," he said, "and I wasn't quite sure what to 
make of what I saw. All along the perimeter of the field were tampons. 
</P>
<P>
"An old tracker said the growers had put the scent of mountain lions on them, 
to keep the deer out of the area."

A drug discovered in a Texas laboratory appears in early tests to inhibit 
growth of the AIDS virus and may show promise in preventing healthy people from 
contracting the disease, the laboratory said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bill McAnalley, Carrington's research director, said the studies showed that 
the drug seems to boost the body's ability to fight the AIDS virus even in 
healthy patients. "The drug turns on the immune system and the effects last 
several days from just one dose." 
</P>
<P>
The drug, whose brand name is Carrisyn, was given orally to healthy male 
patients. Blood samples were then taken from the patients and put into test 
tubes. The AIDS virus was then added to the blood and the growth of the virus 
was measured. 
</P>
<P>
The virus spread less quickly than it would have in blood from men who did not 
take the drug, McAnalley said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Burroughs Wellcome Co. announced plans Wednesday to market a 
strawberry-flavored syrup version of the AIDS-fighting drug AZT. AZT or 
zidovudine -- the sole government-approved drug to directly fight the AIDS 
virus -- is available only in capsule form. 
</P>
<P>
"This new (syrup) formulation should provide more flexibility in making dosage 
adjustments and be particularly useful to patients who have difficulty 
swallowing capsules," said Kathryn Pattishall of Burroughs Wellcome. 
</P>
<P>
The AZT syrup, which the Food and Drug Administration recently judged to be as 
effective as the capsules, will be available at pharmacies in four to six 
weeks, Burroughs Wellcome said. 
</P>
<P>
Jean McGuire, director of the AIDS Action Council, said the new formulation 
should prove helpful to AIDS patients who have problems swallowing because of 
mouth and throat infections or sores.

NEW HORIZONS IN RADAR; 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA ARE DEVELOPING A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO UPGRADE AGING EARLY 
WARNING NETWORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN ZORPETTE, Zorpette, a science and technology writer based in New York 
City, writes occasionally for the science/medicine page. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by technical advances and the need to upgrade their aging early 
warning networks, military services in the United States and Australia have 
embarked on ambitious programs to build the first unclassified over-the-horizon 
radars designed for everyday operation. Using the earth's ionosphere as a giant 
mirror, the radars can "see" over the horizon, keeping tabs on ships and 
low-flying airplanes as far as 2,500 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force has begun testing a system in Maine, is finishing another 
near the California-Oregon border and has further plans for systems in Alaska 
and in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy, meanwhile, just tested what it calls a relocatable 
over-the-horizon radar, designed to be moved as needed during a war to track 
and assess enemy air and sea forces. It is now being set up on the Aleutian 
Island of Amchitka, for operation next year. 
</P>
<P>
And the Australian military plans to break ground next year for a network of 
three over-the-horizon radars for monitoring northern approaches to the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
The radars, which can cost a half-billion dollars each, are uniquely suited to 
diverse military needs, from warning of a bomber attack to monitoring the 
launch of test missiles deep within the borders of a foreign country. There 
have even been reports that over-the-horizon radar has promise in detecting 
stealth aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But promising civilian applications have also been explored in tracking 
suspected drug-running aircraft and long-range monitoring of weather and sea 
conditions. Both take advantage of the vast swath -- 6 million square miles -- 
that can be covered by a single over-the-horizon radar within about 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the principles behind the new radars were first proven by a pair of 
experimental Navy radars built in California in the 1960s. The Wide Area 
Research Facility in the Central Valley and the Sea Echo radar on San Clemente 
Island are still used for research into new technologies and the ionosphere. 
</P>
<P>
That work is critical because it is the ionosphere -- layers of charged 
particles blanketing the earth at altitudes between 50 and 300 miles -- that 
makes the new radars work. Conventional radar waves, which are emitted in 
frequencies above 200 million cycles per second (200 megahertz), penetrate the 
ionosphere and continue out into space. 
</P>
<P>
Over-the-horizon radars, on the other hand, use frequencies between 5 and 28 
megahertz, which are bent and reflected by the ionosphere back toward the 
Earth's surface hundreds of miles away from the radar. From there, a small 
portion -- perhaps 1% -- of the radio waves are reflected back toward the 
ionosphere and then down to the radar, carrying with them the coded imprint of 
any craft that happens to be within the radar's sweep. Thus the systems are 
known as over-the-horizon backscatter radars (OTH-B for short). 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the frequency used and the conditions in the ionosphere, the 
radar's beam might reach the Earth's surface anywhere from 600 to 2,500 miles 
from the transmitter, If an aircraft happens to be flying within that beam, it 
too will reflect some radio waves back toward the radar via the ionosphere, 
regardless of how low the aircraft may be flying. A conventional radar would 
not see an aircraft sneaking in at a low altitude, because of the Earth's 
curvature, until it was much closer -- perhaps less than 50 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
In a dimly lit control room in Bangor, Me., operators of the OTH-B would see 
the aircraft as a small yellow square of light on the screen of a 
television-type monitor. Powerful computers automatically compare the 
aircraft's flight path with those of scheduled civilian and military flights. 
If no match can be found, operators notify the nearest Air Force regional 
operations control center. 
</P>
<P>
There, based on information from satellites and other sources, officials decide 
whether to "scramble" -- send out aircraft for a closer look. Since the radar 
went into initial, limited operation late in 1987, Soviet aircraft have been 
intercepted 36 times, according to the 24th Air Division, which is responsible 
for operating the radar. Most of the aircraft are bombers on training flights. 
Occasionally they fly within 115 miles of Cape Hatteras, N.C., an Air Force 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea behind them is simple, OTH-Bs are among the most 
sophisticated of radars. When an aircraft flies into their beam, the amount of 
radio energy the aircraft reflects back to the antennas is minuscule compared 
to the signal bounced back from the Earth's surface below the craft, typically 
that of the sea. That surface echo, called clutter, may be 10,000 times 
stronger than the signal of interest, so finding the signal is a lot like 
finding the proverbial needle in a haystack. 
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse is the ionosphere itself, which changes radically from 
year to year as sunspots come and go, from month to month as seasons change, 
and even from minute to minute at dawn and dusk. Each of these tends to affect 
one or more of the ionosphere's four layers of charged particles, requiring 
operators to make adjustments to compensate. Especially troublesome are the 
sudden ionospheric disturbances caused by solar flares or other events on the 
sun, which can blind or cripple an OTH-B radar for periods ranging from a few 
minutes to several hours, according to Jurgen Buchau, a researcher at the 
Geophysical Laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. (Since the 
episodes are unpredictable and short-lived, Buchau noted, they are not 
considered useful to an enemy plotting a surprise attack.) 
</P>
<P>
To cope with those problems, OTH-B radars have enormous antennas and many 
computers (the Air Force models have 28 apiece) to analyze signals and compare 
radar tracks with known flight paths. Each of the Air Force units consists of 
three 4,000-foot transmit antennas and three mile-long receive antennas. To 
avoid interference, receive and transmit antennas are about 100 miles apart; 
the West Coast receive site is in Tulelake, Calif., in the northern part of the 
state, while the transmit site is in Christmas Valley, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
When finished sometime in 1991, the West Coast units will cover a 180-degree 
arc from Mexico to Alaska, out as far as the Hawaiian Islands. The radar, like 
its counterpart on the East Coast, is being built for the Air Force by General 
Electric's Government Electronic Systems Division in Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
To spot targets in a sea of clutter, OTH-B radars make use of the Doppler 
effect: When a signal from a radar is bounced off a target moving toward the 
radar, the frequency of the signal that comes back is higher. How much higher 
depends on how fast the target is moving. OTH-B radars use that frequency shift 
to distinguish a target from the surface below it. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials say the radars have no trouble spotting ordinary bomber 
aircraft. A more delicate question now is whether they can spot aircraft built 
with so-called stealth technologies, known as "low-observable" techniques in 
military jargon. Such aircraft have shapes and exteriors designed to minimize 
the reflections of waves from conventional radars, which use relatively high 
frequencies and look up at their targets, rather than down from the ionosphere. 
</P>
<P>
If OTH-B radars can perform well against stealth aircraft, as several radar 
experts have speculated, the Air Force's B-2 stealth bomber would seem less 
able to complete its mission of penetrating Soviet airspace. The Soviets 
already have at least three OTH-B radars, according to open Pentagon reports. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Air Force officials take care when discussing the issue. The head 
of the Air Force's OTH-B program, Col. John O. Lenz, said: "With this kind of 
radar, because of the frequencies you're using and the angle at which you look 
at the target, we present a little bit tougher problem for the designer of 
offensive low-observable craft. It's simply mathematics." No tests using 
stealth aircraft have been done and none are planned, Lenz added. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Department of Defense has become more open since the early days of 
OTH-B research about three decades ago, when the technology was in its 
preliminary stage and was not discussed publicly. Since then there have been 
scattered, unconfirmed reports of various forms of over-the-horizon radar being 
employed by the United States and Great Britain for spying. 
</P>
<P>
Such military uses have been the mainstay of work on OTH-B radars, but their 
civilian potential has not been ignored. In 1973, the Navy disclosed that it 
had used an experimental radar on the Maryland coast to monitor the size and 
direction of ocean waves over vast areas of the North Atlantic. The wave 
information let scientists quickly infer the wind patterns above the waves with 
great accuracy, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure was never put into regular use in the United States, but it has 
long been used in Australia. Meteorologists there have for years had access to 
data from an experimental OTH-B radar called Jindalee (the name is aboriginal 
for bare bones). 
</P>
<P>
And the U. S. radars have not been entirely limited to military uses. Officials 
from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Air Force confirmed that the 
Maine OTH-B radar has been used to track suspected drug-running aircraft over 
the Caribbean. And that application is likely to become common as the military 
begins fulfilling its role in government efforts to stem the influx of illegal 
drugs. Officials of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which is 
directing and coordinating surveillance of airborne drug traffickers, recently 
identified the proposed set of four OTH-B radars as the cornerstone of its 
future plans against aerial smuggling.

Doctors in Vancouver, Canada, have discovered that tiny cells called 
neutrophils tend to collect in the lungs of active smokers where they are then 
free to slowly destroy the organs. The finding, reported in the New England 
Journal of Medicine, may help explain why smokers are more likely to develop 
emphysema, a potentially fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
Past research has suggested that when the disease-fighting neutrophils are 
exposed to cigarette smoke, they release an enzyme that attaches itself to the 
lung tissue and begins to destroy the lungs' elastic properties. 
</P>
<P>
The research, led by Dr. William MacNee of St. Paul's Hospital, found that the 
lungs of active smokers tended to hoard the neutrophils. The hoarding was not 
seen in nonsmokers or volunteers who did not smoke during the study. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that the presence of cigarette smoke in the lungs of some subjects 
increases the local concentration of neutrophils and suggest that . . . 
emphysema may be a result of the destruction of lung tissue by neutrophils that 
remain" in the tiny vessels of the lungs, the researchers said.

LIFE APPEARS TO BE TURNING AROUND FOR GIRL WHO REPORTED FAMILY DRUG ABUSE

Come January, Terah Beth Cortez hopes that three years of pain and uncertainty 
caused by her parents' use of cocaine will come to an end and that she will be 
able to once again live with her now-sober father. 
</P>
<P>
Terah gained national attention Oct. 27, 1986, when she decided to report to 
Los Angeles police that her mother and stepsister were using drugs. Last March, 
her story was told again, when she was on the verge of being moved from a 
foster home into a home for psychologically disturbed youths because she was 
refusing to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
Now Terah's life appears to have taken a turn for the better. The biggest 
change, she says, is that her father, Ernest, who was also a cocaine user, has 
been clean of drugs and alcohol for 162 days -- about 5 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
She is attending Mulholland Junior High School and getting good grades. She has 
been allowed by the Juvenile Court division of Los Angeles Superior Court to 
live with her stepsister near her father in Reseda and visits him frequently. 
And a Studio City movie producer is attempting to have a movie made of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
But Terah says she knows now that her father must fight his own battle. She 
realizes that she cannot keep him, or her mother, off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The bright, articulate Reseda eighth-grader says she also realizes that she is 
not the only youth whose family ties have been severed by a loved one's 
attraction to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids have gone through so much," Terah said of those who attend 
her Alateen group. In Alateen, youths whose parents are addicted to drugs or 
alcohol share their stories with one another. 
</P>
<P>
"I just noticed that I'm not . . . the only person in this world to have 
problems like this," she said. "It made me feel a lot better because . . . if 
they can get through some of the things they've gone through, then I'm sure I 
could too." 
</P>
<P>
Her resolve to deal with her difficulties has been bolstered by her father's 
sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as he changed, there was finally somebody I could depend on," Terah 
said of her father, an ex-minister, ex-drug dealer and ex-Los Angeles city 
tree-trimmer. "A lot of the problems went away because he became more 
responsible and took care of things he needed to take care of, and took care of 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Terah says now that she did not realize that her life would begin spinning out 
of control as soon as she notified police that her mother and stepsister were 
freebasing cocaine in the living room of their home in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Barbara Cortez was arrested on drug charges. The Los Angeles city 
attorney's office held a hearing on the charge but did not prosecute. Her 
stepsister was gone when police arrived. Ernest Cortez and Terah's sister's 
boyfriend were arrested on charges of child endangerment, which were later 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Terah, who was 10 at the time, and another child were placed in the protective 
custody of the Department of Children's Services. Typically in such cases, a 
social worker is assigned to make recommendations to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after the incident, Terah was allowed to live with her parents, but 
the social workers assigned to the Cortezes' case ordered Barbara, 48, and 
Ernest, 58, to undergo counseling and drug testing if they wanted to regain 
legal custody of Terah. 
</P>
<P>
But because her parents' erratic behavior continued and they failed to abide by 
the court's orders, she has been moved by the court through three foster homes. 
When her parents had custody of her, they moved her to the homes of various 
friends and into two different apartments. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, her parents were evicted, beginning an eight-month period of 
homelessness for the family. While they lived partly in their car, Barbara and 
Ernest Cortez moved Terah from place to place, sometimes alone, sometimes with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
She became so depressed with all of the disruption that, about a year ago, she 
took a overdose of cold pills in a suicide attempt and was hospitalized 
briefly. She has also endured an emotionally draining series of court hearings, 
meetings with lawyers, therapy sessions and confrontations with psychologists, 
social workers and educators. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, just over five months ago, Ernest Cortez said he realized that he was 
on the verge of losing Terah forever, and he began complying with the court 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez said he stopped using drugs and began attending individual and group 
counseling and meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous. He 
rented a quiet, one-bedroom guest house in Reseda and cut himself off from his 
circle of drug-using friends. Cortez said he still must attend a court-ordered 
parenting class, but hopes that Terah will again be allowed to live with him 
permanently by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
He said Barbara Cortez, still struggling with her own powerful cocaine 
addiction, has moved to the East Coast to live with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living on Streets 
</P>
<P>
But before her decision to move, Barbara had been living on the streets of Los 
Angeles. The fact that she "was out in the street with no home, no place to go 
and sometimes no food to eat and involved with a bunch of druggers was a very 
heavy thing that weighed on Terah and my mind," Cortez said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Cortez said, he finally gathered up his resolve and ordered Terah to 
go back to school. Although Terah was a good student who had previously done 
well in school, the turmoil in her life had distracted her and made her 
unwilling to go. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make yourself do this," he remembers telling Terah. "I said that's 
what discipline's all about. You've got to make yourself do stuff." 
</P>
<P>
He told her that it was not easy for him to go to the meetings and talk about 
his powerful attraction to cocaine or alcohol. It was not easy to cut himself 
off from his drug-using friends. And it was not easy to work for $50 to $80 a 
day as a masseur, when he had made that much in a matter of minutes as a drug 
dealer. But he did it, because he didn't want to lose her, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Terah took an art class this summer and resumed going to school in September. 
She attends Alateen sessions twice a week, meets frequently with a school 
psychologist and is making plans to attend modeling school with the proceeds 
she hopes to get from selling her story to a movie production company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Movie 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCabe, the co-founder of the Actor's Center of Los Angeles, and a 
partner, Michael Fournier, have written a treatment of the Cortezes' story for 
a television movie and said it is generating considerable interest. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe said the proposed movie project would cover the period of time from when 
Terah called police until the present, but will also tell the story of the 
Cortezes' slide into drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The finish will be a happy ending, which we are all hoping for," he said. 
"She's back in school and at least one of her parents is straight, and she is 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Terah said the lowest point in the past three years was when she wanted 
desperately to be back with her mother, but her mother had disappeared. 
Eventually, she said, she learned to let go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd done all I could for her and after awhile I learned to separate myself 
from her, like when a kid goes off to college," Terah said. "I had to get on 
with my own life. I couldn't hide forever, and as soon as he changed, I felt I 
could change." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Walker, a Hermosa Beach woman who contacted the Cortezes after reading 
about their story and who put them in touch with McCabe, has noticed the change 
in Terah. 
</P>
<P>
"She's come out of her depression," Walker said of Terah. "She feels hopeful. 
If you saw her in a room of kids now, you would just think she is a normal, 
all-American girl." 
</P>
<P>
Terah recognizes the progress she and her father have made and has written a 
poem to thank him for his efforts to free himself from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Being clean and sober is the most wonderful high of all," the first line of 
the poem reads. The last line reads, "You're with people who care for you most 
of all." 
</P>
<P>
Terah said: "He's come so far. We've both come so far. Since it happened, this 
is like the best it's ever been."

ANIMALS RAVAGE GARDENS, IMPERIL MOTORISTS IN QUEST FOR FOOD, WATER 
</P>

<P>
Call them urban deer. Driven by increasing hillside development and persistent 
drought conditions, they venture into an unlikely and often unwelcome 
environment, from busy streets and residential gardens in the San Fernando 
Valley to the pounding surf of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Their search for food and water brings them into almost daily contact with 
residents of communities that border the canyons and foothills of the Santa 
Monica and Santa Susana mountains, particularly in areas where new development 
is displacing existing wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Lost and panicked deer have been injured and killed on canyon roads. They have 
been spotted along Ventura Boulevard in Encino and outside upscale restaurants 
and chic boutiques, struggling to find their way back to the mountains, animal 
control officers said. 
</P>
<P>
They drink from back-yard swimming pools, feast on roses and begonias, dart 
down quiet streets and stroll along lush country-club fairways. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate conflict between mountain development and the wilderness," said 
Rob Glushon, president of the Encino Property Owners Assn., who observed four 
deer during a recent round of golf at the El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Deer have always inhabited the area mountains. State and local officials 
estimate that 9,000 live in the vast and undeveloped ranges of the San Gabriel 
Mountains and anywhere from several hundred to more than 1,000 are in the Santa 
Monicas and Santa Susanas. 
</P>
<P>
The animals have been turning up near hillside residences for years. But 
California Department of Fish and Game officers say more of them appear to be 
venturing into urban areas as new developments invade their territory and the 
drought stretches into its third year. 
</P>
<P>
"A deer is like any other animal," said Jon Fischer, a wildlife biologist with 
Fish and Game. "It will go where food is easiest to get, and if I water my back 
yard and it is full of succulent flowers, a deer would be crazy to stay 400 
yards away and eat dry grass. So they are overcoming their fear of people and 
coming into back yards." 
</P>
<P>
Enchanted by their beauty and grace, hillside dwellers often welcome the deer 
-- initially. But the novelty wears off once the animals start eating expensive 
flowers and ravaging gardens that took years to create. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Consolation 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials offer homeowners little consolation. They can't move 
the deer, they say, because that would overpopulate existing animal ranges and 
lead to starvation and disease. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they say, deer adapt poorly to new areas. When 200 were moved from 
Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay to Napa County 10 years ago, 80% wound up 
dead on local roads within three weeks, most of them victims of traffic 
accidents, said Larry Sitton, wildlife management program supervisor for Fish 
and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers, who warn that deer can be dangerous if cornered, 
recommend using commercial repellents or lion droppings to keep them away. But 
homeowners who have tried those remedies say they offer only a temporary 
reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no ivy left," said Susan Gottsegen, who lives on Coronet Drive in 
Encino. "They ate the whole hillside. It's barren. They come three and four at 
a time, and they're very brazen. They come right down 
</P>
<P>
and walk on the street. I have a German shepherd, and they're not even afraid 
of her. She barks at them and they just keep grazing. They've become 
domesticated. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time my neighbors saw one, they said, 'Look, it's Bambi,' " 
Gottsegen recalled. "They thought it was so beautiful -- until Bambi started 
eating all their flowers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Food Sources 
</P>
<P>
Gottsegen has lived on Coronet Drive for 26 years. She said she never had a 
problem until grading began for the 178-home Caballero Canyon development at 
Reseda and Ventura boulevards. She suspects that the deer have come from there, 
seeking new shelter and food sources. 
</P>
<P>
"They have nowhere else to turn," said Sonia Thompson, program manager for the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, who predicts the deer population in Los 
Angeles will ultimately perish as their habitat is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have no natural vegetation in the canyons and no water sources, and 
they go down to gardens where people put out poison . . . that is sort of a 
death warrant right there. Then there are domestic dogs that chase them into 
the road where they are hit by cars." 
</P>
<P>
About 18 deer are killed by motorists each year in the West Valley area, said 
Irene Malloy, president of the Marine and Wildlife Rescue Station in Agoura 
Hills, who helped prepare a 1988 study on animal fatalities for the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
But the number could be even higher. In September, 10 deer were hit and killed 
by cars in the West Valley area served by the county's animal care and control 
center in Agoura, said Lt. Martin Broad of the West Valley Animal Care and 
Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
Most are traveling between the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains, where 
only one wildlife corridor remains, she said. The deer grow confused and 
venture into oncoming traffic. One died two weeks ago on Agoura Road in an 
incident that occurs so frequently Malloy has started calling the drag "death 
row for deer." 
</P>
<P>
"The desecration of deer in this canyon is pitiful," said Malloy, who lives in 
Liberty Canyon. "It's tragic." 
</P>
<P>
There also have been problems along Mulholland Drive, Coldwater Canyon Avenue 
and Beverly Glen and Laurel Canyon boulevards. "Deer live in there," said 
Dennis Kroeplin, a wildlife officer with the city-operated West Valley Animal 
Care and Control Center. "They have trails that cross those roads, that were 
there before the roads. You find deer-crossing signs to caution drivers, but 
they still get killed." 
</P>
<P>
State game warden John Hernandez said he recently helped rescue a buck that was 
chased by stray dogs all the way to the ocean in Malibu. "It wouldn't come near 
the shore," Hernandez said. "We had to get everyone back so it felt confident 
returning to the hills." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Nieman never had deer problems at his Encino hills home until last spring 
when his dog died. Now six deer frequent his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Advice 
</P>
<P>
"They've eaten hundreds of dollars of begonias," Nieman said. "You feel sorry 
for them. The poor deer, they're hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Nieman took the advice of animal control officers, drove to the Wildlife 
Waystation in Little Tujunga and picked up lion droppings that he placed around 
his property. It worked -- for two weeks. Then the deer were back. 
</P>
<P>
"This is insane," Nieman said. "I can't lick it. I'm not going to do this every 
two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
In Sherman Oaks, deer feasted all summer on 75 rosebushes that surround J. 
Hardy's hillside home. "They've just stripped them," said Hardy, who peered out 
her bedroom window late one night in July and found herself staring a deer in 
the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed," she said, "and it went flying." 
</P>
<P>
Animal advocates say development is the greatest threat to deer in the Los 
Angeles region. "When you stop and think of the growth in Southern California, 
that's not surprising," Fischer said. "We build houses and put up fences. We've 
restricted their movement. So what has been historically deer habitat is now 
somebody's back yard."

MAN SEVERELY BEATEN NEARBY AFTER BOY, 16, IS FATALLY SHOT 
</P>

<P>
Hours after a 16-year-old boy was shot to death in a gang-related attack on a 
street in Huntington Park, a man driving in a nearby alley was pulled from his 
car and severely beaten by several men with clubs, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park police said they are investigating whether the two incidents 
are related. One possibility, they said, is that the second attack was in 
retaliation for the shooting, although the young murder victim was not believed 
to be a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old victim of the bludgeon attack was hospitalized in critical 
condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 9:30 p.m. Saturday on Arbutus Street after a red 
Honda Civic pulled up and the two people inside asked the victim where he was 
from and then left. The 16-year-old, whom police declined to identify, was in 
front of his home talking with family members. Several minutes later, the car 
returned and shots were fired, one of which struck the boy in the head. No one 
else was hit. 
</P>
<P>
The second incident occurred about 3 a.m. Sunday in an alley a block away. A 
man, whom police declined to identify pending notification of his family, was 
driving in the alley when his car was set upon by four or five attackers with 
baseball bats and other blunt objects, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify the hospital where the victim was being treated, 
fearing that his attackers might try to find him. Police said the attackers are 
believed to be gang members.

CHARGERS RUN BUT CAN'T HIDE IN FINAL QUARTER 
</P>

DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three periods Sunday, the Chargers beat the heavily favored Denver Broncos 
by running the ball against the league's top-rated ground defense, hurrying 
Bronco quarterback John Elway to distraction and generally keeping their wits 
about them in the noise caldron that was Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the last 15 minutes, the Chargers beat themselves. This is what young 
teams with new quarterbacks and first-year coaches do in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was Denver 16, Chargers 10. And the loss cost the Chargers 
(2-3) a share of first place in the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Denver (4-1) scored the winning touchdown on rookie Bobby Humphrey's 17-yard 
burst up the gut with 1:03 remaining against an inside blitz that should have 
stopped him cold. 
</P>
<P>
But free safety Vencie Glenn missed a tackle at the eight. Cornerback Elvis 
Patterson missed a tackle at the five. And Humphrey, who led everybody with 102 
yards on 23 tries, dragged linebackers Gary Plummer and Leslie O'Neal across 
the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the toughest losses I've ever been through," said Charger defensive 
lineman Joe Phillips, who had one of his team's three sacks. "Incredible. We 
gave the game away." 
</P>
<P>
"Today we were our own worst enemy," said Tim Spencer, who led Charger rushers 
with 78 yards on 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Painful," said utility back Dana Brinson, whose 52-yard punt return set up 
Marion Butts' two-yard touchdown run off left tackle early in the third period, 
which gave the Chargers a 10-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Butts took advantage of blocks by Spencer, guard Broderick Thompson and tackle 
Joel Patten to score his sixth touchdown and the first by the Charger offense 
in Denver since 1985. But it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we're all crushed," said Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator. 
"And I hope we all feel a little bit sick about coming that close." 
</P>
<P>
Here's how close: 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the final period, McMahon (10 of 19 for 116 yards) completed a 
19-yard pass to Jamie Holland that would have given the Chargers a first down 
at the Denver 44. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials called Patten for holding. "It was 50-50 on whether it was 
holding or not," said Patten, who was playing on a sore knee. "But he made the 
call, and that makes it holding." 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Patten drew an illegal procedure penalty. Two plays after 
that, the Chargers had to punt. 
</P>
<P>
With 3 1/2 minutes left, Burt Grossman, the Chargers' rookie defensive end, 
jumped offside at the Bronco 33 on third and three. Elway's "hard counts" -- he 
has mastered a technique with which he changes the inflection in his voice 
while barking out signals -- had drawn the Chargers offside all afternoon. But 
this one was the most costly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally legal," Lynn said. "And our guy was offsides." 
</P>
<P>
But Lynn and Charger Coach Dan Henning thought Denver was offside on the same 
play. They didn't like the lateness of the call. And they took particular 
exception when the officials needed a protracted conference to determine who to 
penalize. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're allowed to throw a flag after the whistle," Henning said. 
"In fact, I'm sure of it." 
</P>
<P>
The official who made the call was head linesman Aaron Pointer. Oddly enough, 
Pointer's sisters are, yes, the Pointer Sisters. All of which might give new 
meaning to the song, "Slow Hand." 
</P>
<P>
Elway would finish with 19 completions on 35 attempts for 199 yards. Three 
plays after Pointer's call, Elway's 17-yarder to tight end Orson Mobley lurched 
the Broncos into Charger territory. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, on fourth and one from the 37, Elway faked a dive play and 
handed back to Steve Sewell, who got outside the Chargers' containment for 
seven yards. Two plays later, Humphrey's touchdown put Denver ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"A guts call," Lynn said of Sewell's gain. 
</P>
<P>
In the frantic final 15 minutes, the Chargers committed four of their 10 
penalties. Spencer lost a fumble, recovered by Tyrone Braxton and leading to a 
David Treadwell field goal that made it 10-9. And, following the Humphrey 
touchdown, McMahon threw a third-down interception, his only one of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was supposed to go to wide receiver Anthony Miller. But afterward, 
McMahon said it was a "bad read" on his own part. 
</P>
<P>
"Anthony isn't supposed to go over the middle on that play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's where McMahon threw it. And Kip Corrington intercepted. The Chargers 
managed just 20 yards on their 11 third-down plays. 
</P>
<P>
Their 211 yards of offense was a season low. But their 118 yards rushing was a 
season high. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can see from the scores around the league that anybody's capable 
of beating you any time," said Denver Coach Dan Reeves, who is now 51-13 at 
home. The Broncos' latest winning streak at Mile High is eight. The Chargers 
have lost six of their past seven here. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how Reeves meant his assessment, it was unflattering to the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
But they had earned it. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger H-back Rod Bernstine strained the medial collateral ligament in his 
left knee during the second half and did not return. That's the same knee that 
ended Bernstine's season prematurely last year, but that was the anterior 
cruciate ligament and required surgery. Bernstine said Charger physicians told 
him this injury would not need an operation. "It's just very sore," Bernstine 
said. "And it was very scary." He said he will probably be "doubtful" for next 
Sunday's home game against Seattle. . . . The score at halftime was 6-3, 
Denver. The Broncos got 46- and 18-yard field goals in the second period from 
David Treadwell. Charger Chris Bahr kicked a 39-yarder in the first quarter. . 
. . The Chargers' two inactive players Sunday were both injured starters -- 
wide receiver Quinn Early (knee) and right cornerback Sam Seale (shoulder). 
Gill Byrd moved from left corner to right, and Elvis Patterson took Seale's 
spot on the left side. Jamie Holland started for Early and didn't catch a pass. 
. . . Treadwell's 54-yard attempt that fell short on the last play of the first 
half was his first missed field goal of the year. He had made 11 in a row 
before that and entered the game as the AFC's leading scorer. . . . Rookie 
Marion Butts was barely touched on his two-yard touchdown run. "The hole was 
huge," Butts said. "It was so huge I almost fell going through." How huge was 
it? If he had fallen, he still would have scored. . . . Versions differed on 
Charger running back Tim Spencer's fourth-quarter fumble. Tyrone Braxton, the 
Bronco who recovered, said linebacker Karl Mecklenburg stripped the ball. 
Spencer said: "As I was struggling to go forward, the ball came out." . . . 
Before Sunday, the Chargers had outscored their opponents, 37-12, in the final 
period. But Denver beat them, 10-0, in the fourth quarter. . . . Byrd's third 
period interception, his fourth of the year, was the eighth by the Chargers in 
the past three games. . . . Right outside linebacker Simon Fletcher, the NFL's 
sack leader after four games, made one tackle and zero sacks against the 
Chargers.

For the 1-3-1 San Diego State football team, victory remains somewhere over the 
rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
Not too far, but just enough for a team that has seen three of the past four 
games slip away in the last 2 minutes 39 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was running back Jamal Farmer's third touchdown, a nine-yard run 
with 29 seconds left, that lifted the University of Hawaii to a 31-24 Western 
Athletic Conference victory over the Aztecs at Aloha Stadium.

Farmer, a redshirt freshman from Granada Hills, also scored on runs of one and 
15 yards as Hawaii, ranked 20th by United Press International, raised its 
record to 5-1 and 2-1 in the WAC. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU, 1-2 in the WAC, appears out of the running for the Holiday Bowl. No team 
in 27 years has won the title with more than one conference loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a lack of effort; it is a lack of being able to take it to a 
different level when you have to, and this program has to learn that," said Al 
Luginbill, the Aztec coach. "Once they do that, this football team is going to 
be real good." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the Aztecs will continue to be frustrated as they were against 
Hawaii, UCLA (a 28-25 loss) and Cal State Fullerton (a 41-41 tie). 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the story for us the whole year," Luginbill said. "There will come 
a day when our players will deliver, and it won't come down to the last three 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he added: "We've gotten to the point where we're in the last two 
minutes of a ballgame with a chance to win. This program has not been in that 
position the last couple of years. They've been either out of the ballgame or 
winning it at that time. What we have to learn is that you have to go to 
another level at that time in order to win." 
</P>
<P>
They might not even have needed that level had the Aztecs taken care of 
business in the first half Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Four times before halftime, they had the ball inside the Hawaii 20. But all 
they got was a 34-yard Andy Trakas field goal to trail, 17-3, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Given the state of a kicking game that has made good on four of nine field 
goals -- and just one beyond 26 yards -- even that was something. But Trakas 
missed field goal tries of 26 and 47 yards in the first half, and the Aztecs 
also struggled to find a capable long snapper and someone who could kick off. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill made his second change of a kickoff man in two games, restoring 
Trakas in the second half after having replaced him with Tom Wurth in the 
second half against Utah. Trakas took over again after Wurth put two 
consecutive kickoffs out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
As for the long snapper, Jason Bill replaced Jim Jennings on placements after 
bad snaps cost the Aztecs on a field goal try in the first half and an extra 
point attempt in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The missed opportunity that hurt most came after Aztec defensive back John 
Wesselman recovered an airborne fumble and returned it 34 yards to the Hawaii 
26 in the first quarter. But the Aztecs were unable to score despite having 
three tries inside the Hawaii two. 
</P>
<P>
On third down, linebacker Joaquin Barnett got the first of Hawaii's five sacks 
of quarterback Dan McGwire, a six-yard loss to the eight. McGwire had been 
sacked only five times in four previous games. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings' snap for the 26-yard field goal try was low, the ball never was 
placed properly, and Trakas missed wide right. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy panicked a little bit," Luginbill said. "If he had just hung in there, he 
would have gotten it." 
</P>
<P>
Another threat died when the WAC interception leader, free safety Walter 
Briggs, picked off his fifth, a McGwire pass at the Hawaii 13. It was the only 
Aztec turnover. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire completed 23 of 41 passes for 319 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, if everything had gone well, it would have been a 13-point 
turnaround, and it could have been a tie score," Luginbill said. "But that's 
all ifs -- and ifs don't count." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Aztecs were forced to come back in the second half -- and they 
did. Two Darrin Wagner touchdown runs -- of 10 yards in the third quarter and 
six yards on the fifth play of the fourth -- and a two-point conversion pass 
from McGwire to Monty Gilbreath tied it at 17 with 12:47 left. A dead-ball 
personal foul on Hawaii gave SDSU an automatic first down and second life on 
the 17-play drive that had seemingly ended at the Hawaii 10. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii made it 24-17 with 9:44 left behind their third quarterback, 
seventh-year senior Ken Niumatalolo (he went on a two-year church mission and 
redshirted one year), who engineered a drive that set up Farmer's 15-yard 
score. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aztecs matched it at 5:56 with a 14-yard touchdown pass from McGwire to 
Robert Claiborne, Claiborne's seventh reception. 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbows went 55 yards -- all on the ground -- in six plays for their 
winning score. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said, "I was extremely disappointed that the guy (Farmer) we can't 
let beat us did it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Farmer, who had 87 yards on a career-high 19 carries: "I was so tired but 
I wanted to get in there (in the end zone) because I didn't want to have to 
come back on the field." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs will now play host to two Big West opponents -- Long Beach this 
Saturday and Pacific the following week -- before resuming WAC play Oct. 28 at 
Texas El Paso.

<P>
A camera lens pushed through the champagne mist in the Oakland clubhouse and a 
microphone was pushed in the face of Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave, is there anything you'd like to say to the folks back home in Oakland?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, Dave said as he stared wildly back at the camera, there was: 
</P>
<P>
"We're b-a-a-a-a-c-k." 
</P>
<P>
Frightening thought, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, silencers of the Toronto Blue Jays by way of Sunday's 
4-3 victory in Game 5 of the American League playoffs, are the first team in 
more than a decade to win back-to-back pennants -- and the first team ever to 
enter a World Series with so stacked an agenda. 
</P>
<P>
They want to purge from their consciousness the Dodger disaster of 1988 -- and 
now they have Rickey Henderson to help them do it. 
</P>
<P>
Dodgers, be grateful your number came up last year. 
</P>
<P>
The A's won 104 games in 1988. In 1989, they might be the most improved team in 
baseball. Not only did they add a 19-game winner (Mike Moore) to the rotation 
during the winter, but on June 20 they added Henderson, the fearless leadoff 
man who completed a peerless championship series. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's clincher at the SkyDome, Henderson personally accounted for half of 
Oakland's runs. He walked and stole second base in the first inning, soon to 
score on a single by Jose Canseco, and tripled home Walt Weiss for the A's 
second run in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson stole two bases in Game 1, stole four bases in Game 2, scored two 
runs in Game 3 and hit a pair of two-run home runs in Game 4. All told in this 
series, Henderson batted .400 with five runs batted in, six hits, seven walks, 
eight runs and eight stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
The runs and stolen bases are individual playoff records. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable player trophy he ran away with only begins to tell the story 
of the impact he has made on the A's. 
</P>
<P>
"Has anyone ever had a championship series like his?" Oakland Manager Tony La 
Russa asked. "I don't think that can be topped. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in awe of him all year long. He has all of these abilities -- defense, 
baserunning, hitting -- and he showed it all this series. It has to be the best 
playoff series that anyone's ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, Sunday's winning pitcher, flatly calls Henderson "the premier player 
in baseball right now." And Stewart says this in a clubhouse where you can bump 
into last year's model, Canseco, on your way to saying hello to baseball's best 
relief pitcher (Dennis Eckersley) or a near American League batting champion 
(Carney Lansford) or a third-year first baseman (Mark McGwire) with 117 home 
runs already to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey's always been the life of the party," Stewart said. "He's the man of 
the hour, the one you want out there this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be my third World Series and I can say I've never seen 
anything like him." 
</P>
<P>
Neither, for that matter, has Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I surprised myself this series," Henderson said. "I'm expected to 
make things happen, and this series, it so happened that everything fell into 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was simply the final piece. 
</P>
<P>
As he had three times in the previous four games, Henderson began Oakland's 
first inning by safely reaching base, this time by drawing a walk against 
Toronto starter Dave Stieb. As is his tendency, Rickey didn't stay there long. 
Henderson stole second base -- his eighth in as many tries against beleaguered 
Blue Jay catcher Ernie Whitt -- and promptly scored on a one-out single by 
Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's steal left Whitt an underwhelming 0-for-13 in stolen-base shootouts 
with Oakland runners. Canseco also tried to steal second in the first inning, 
which Whitt somehow foiled. 
</P>
<P>
Whitt wound up his playoff a one-for-14 marksman. But now, at least, he will 
have something to tell the grandkids. 
</P>
<P>
The A's 1-0 lead lasted as long as it took Henderson to bat again, which meant 
the third inning. One out after Stieb walked Weiss, Henderson tripled into the 
gap in right-center field, giving Stewart a 2-0 lead he would protect until his 
teammates could add two more runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, the Blue Jays finally began to stir. Lloyd Moseby hit a solo 
home run to ruin the shutout. In the bottom of the ninth, George Bell, 
awakening from a three-for-19 slumber, also homered, making the score 4-2 and 
spelling the end for Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa made the call for Eckersley, which, by now, is a venerated Oakland 
playoff tradition. During the past two AL championship series, the A's have 
played nine games and won eight. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley recorded the final out in all eight victories. 
</P>
<P>
But before he could get this one, Toronto Manager Cito Gaston made a request: 
Clear customs first. Claiming that Eckersley was packing a foreign object -- an 
emery board was the charge -- Gaston asked home plate umpire Rick Reed to check 
Eckersley before he threw a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Reed) to keep an eye on him," Gaston said. "While I talked, I watched 
the guy go from his neck to his pocket, then down to the ground, pick it up and 
drop it in his pants. 
</P>
<P>
"Reed didn't see it. Either that, or he didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
The only commotion Gaston caused was in the Oakland dugout. La Russa 
immediately joined Gaston and Eckersley on the field to lodge a counterattack 
with Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"Gamesmanship," La Russa said afterward. "Somebody tried to plant a seed and 
disrupt Eckersley. I read in the paper today where (the Blue Jays) were going 
to step out of the box on him. Now, they were going to try this trick. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great crew of umpires here -- they've worked with Eck all year long 
-- and there was never one (suspicious) ball turned in. I thought it was 
out-and-out gamesmanship and I didn't appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Given the OK to pitch, Eckersley went to work on sanding down the last Toronto 
threat of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It would take a while. 
</P>
<P>
The first batter he faced, Tony Fernandez, blooped a single in front of center 
fielder Dave Henderson. Fernandez then stole second base and went to third on a 
ground out by Whitt. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Gruber followed with a sacrifice fly to center and the lead had melted to 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Felix, with two out, came to the plate, representing the tying run. Five 
pitches later, he was still there, facing a full count and one more delivery by 
Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
This one, Felix swung at. 
</P>
<P>
This one, Felix missed. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland was back in the World Series, bound for an opening date next Saturday 
night with either neighbor-by-the bay San Francisco or the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The A's have been given another chance to get it right and, as insurance, 
they're bringing along Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, for one, likes that chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a better team because of Rickey Henderson," McGwire said. "He really 
sewed it up. Last year, we went through eight or nine different leadoff hitters 
and we didn't have that real stolen-base threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey's been the difference. I think he showed that by winning the MVP and 
playing his rear end off." 
</P>
<P>
So what do get the baseball team that had everything except the Dodgers' number 
in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
You didn't have to be at Whitt's end to know the answer to that one. 
</P>

EVEN IF RAMS AREN'T PERFECT, THEIR RECORD IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Football League's only undefeated team can't stand to look at a 
stat sheet anymore. It hurts too much. Not as much as losing, though, so the 
Rams continue to endure the pain of explaining victories. 
</P>
<P>
They put away the Atlanta Falcons, 26-14, Sunday for their fifth consecutive 
victory in front of 52,182 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They did it by allowing opposing quarterback Chris Miller carte blanche, and he 
fired it up 39 times for a career-high 340 yards. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams were having another yard sale -- and they were -- Miller wanted to 
be first one on the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he may have knocked the Rams' 26th-ranked pass defense all the way to 
dead last before wishing them well on their march toward the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There's something happening here; what it is isn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Three hundred yards," Ram cornerback Jerry Gray said. "That's a lot to me. I'm 
grateful to be 5-0, but 300 yards? How can they do that? You have to face 
reality, but do we have to let them catch it? No." 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that teams are not even bothering to run on the Rams anymore. 
The Falcons, who have a Pro Bowl back in John Settle, ran only 15 times Sunday. 
Settle carried seven. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Rams are content to sit back in their zone and give up everything but 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird," Coach John Robinson said. "I don't know why it's happening. . . . 
We're being forced into more contain defenses because teams are throwing almost 
all the time. But we've given up two touchdowns in the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, keep those yards and letters coming. 
</P>
<P>
This impressive group of losing quarterbacks through five weeks has pierced the 
Rams' secondary for 299, 266, 335, 227 and 340 yards respectively, though 
respect apparently has little to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never been enamored with statistics," defensive coordinator Fritz 
Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing. What Shurmur and his players have done is lull opponents to the 
brink of victory before pulling the carpet with the big play. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, it was Green Bay's Brent Fullwood fumbling on the goal line. 
Last week, Alvin Wright popped the ball loose from 49er fullback Tom Rathman to 
start the game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Rams used two touchdown passes from Jim Everett, four Mike Lansford 
field goals and four key defensive stands to save the game. 
</P>
<P>
Corner LeRoy Irvin started it in the first quarter when he intercepted Miller's 
pass at the Ram 12-yard line to stop a Falcon rally. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, trailing 17-7, Atlanta chose to go for the score on fourth 
and goal at the Ram one, giving up what seemed a chip-shot field goal. Settle 
was stuffed by Doug Reed and Co. and was left only to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Then, down by 12 with 10 minutes left, the Falcons tried again on fourth and 
six at the Ram 34, but this time Irvin batted down a pass intended for George 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Irvin isn't a head coach or anything, but even he had to wonder what the 
Falcons were thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"If Atlanta goes for the field goals, it's a seven-point game with time to go," 
he said. "It's their decision to make, but I think if they would have gotten 
the field goals, it might have been a different game." 
</P>
<P>
Judgments can get hazy when you lose as often as Atlanta, which dropped to 1-4 
overall and 0-5 against the Rams in the last five tries. 
</P>
<P>
With 5:18 left, the Falcons had no choice but to go for six on another fourth 
down at the Rams' goal line. This time, the Rams' George Bethune stopped Gene 
Lang short of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Reed thinks the Falcons may have finally gotten the message. He figures there 
is a reason teams haven't been running on this defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we've been stuffing people," he said. "You talk about all the 
sacks, but we're stopping guys and taken most teams out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
And it's not as though teams such as the Falcons are going to find their touch 
inside the Rams' five. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to take it personally," Reed said. "If you think you can get it, well, 
just try." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons did, and failed, and lost. So what's new? 
</P>
<P>
"It was our inability to make our fourth-down plays," Falcon Coach Marion 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell thought the Rams' first goal-line stand with 6:14 left in the first 
half was the killer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big play, huge," he said. "Had we gotten it, it would have been a 
different ballgame. Instead, they got three points out of it, and they got 
jacked because of it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rams' offense cruised along so efficiently that Lansford field 
goals of 48, 35, 27, and 42 yards almost seemed disappointing conclusions. 
After all, quarterback Jim Everett took his team 68 yards on the Rams' first 
possession with relative ease, the drive ending on a 13-yard scoring pass to 
tight end Pete Holohan. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons tied it up on a nine-yard scoring pass from Miller to Shawn 
Collins, but the Rams were unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford sent the Rams ahead for good with 2:22 left in the first quarter with 
a 48-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
And the Rams mounted their most impressive drive after Irvin's interception. 
The highlight was Everett's leading block on Greg Bell's 29-yard run down the 
left sideline. The play was designed to go right, but when Bell changed 
directions, Everett headed downfield and put a solid helmet on safety Evan 
Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it wasn't a pretty sight," Everett said. "But I'm dangerous in the 
open field. Any time I pitch the ball I look for the cut back. I won't take 
anybody out, but I'll nibble on his ankles a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bell felt a twinge in his hamstring on the run and didn't return for the second 
half, finishing with 62 yards in 10 carries. The Rams didn't take any chances 
with Bell, who wants to be 100% when he returns for the first time to Buffalo 
next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was headed for a big day," Bell said. "But the next 11 games are more 
important than one big game." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove on without him, thanks to the pass-catch team of Everett and 
Henry Ellard, who might as well be bound by string these days. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard had seven catches and 150 receiving yards in the first half alone, but 
none more important than a 25-yard grab on fourth and six at the Falcon 33. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams might have chosen a safer pass, but you have to consider 
Everett-to-Ellard these days. Everett dropped the ball in nicely between two 
defenders, and Ellard had only one real problem with the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see it until it came from behind the defender," Ellard said. "I 
didn't see Jim or the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The ball ended up in Ellard's hands, though, and two plays later, Everett 
rolled right, sucked linebacker Aundray Bruce into thinking run, and then 
dropped a nice touch-pass over Bruce's head to Robert Delpino, who one-handed 
the ball for the score to put the Rams up, 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard finished with eight catches for 165 yards, and not even Atlanta rookie 
cornerback Deion Sanders could stop him, though he stayed pretty close on one 
14-yard completion. 
</P>
<P>
Of Everett's 16 completions, half went to Ellard. Everett finished with 290 
yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Miller finished with a ton of passing yards of his own, but fewer 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we used just about every pass play we have," Miller said. "I'm pretty 
sore from throwing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the Rams don't get Dan Marino this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Irv Pankey's bad back kept out of his second consecutive game. Robert Cox 
started at left tackle. . . . Damone Johnson sprained his right ankle in the 
second half and didn't return. Fred Strickland sprained his right knee and 
missed the fourth quarter. The Rams reported that linebacker George Bethune 
suffered a hip pointer. . . . Kevin Greene had both sacks of quarterback Chris 
Miller for minus 25 yards. . . . Deion Sanders displayed some of his speed when 
he chased down Ron Brown after a 74-yard kickoff return to open the second 
half. . . . Sunday was the fourth time in his career that Mike Lansford has 
kicked four field goals in a game.

MIKE DOWNEY: GIANTS ARE CUT ABOVE CUBS WHEN IT COMES TO BIG PLAYS

<P>
They both bat swift center fielders leadoff, followed by smooth second basemen. 
They both boast first basemen with gaudy, Gehrigesque playoff batting averages, 
not just above .300 but beyond .600. They both have stormy-weather ballparks, 
long-suffering believers and old-school managers who just happen to be old 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
Their hitting is superior to their pitching. They met on the field of battle a 
dozen times during the season, evenly splitting the spoils. The pitcher who 
today will try to navigate his team into the World Series -- Rick Reuschel -- 
was once the favorite pitcher of the very team he will be trying to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
Their differences seem few. One side has an M. Williams with thinning hair, the 
other an M. Williams with a thick, tumbleweed bush of it. Otherwise, these 
baseball clubs seem so much alike -- such absolute scratching-and-spitting 
images of one another. 
</P>
<P>
So, what exactly is the big difference between the Giants and Cubs? 
</P>
<P>
We can answer that, we think, at this stage of the National League championship 
series, now that San Francisco has picked up the scent of its first World 
Series appearance since 1962, and now that Chicago could be finding itself 
about to commit both hara-kiri and Harry Caray. 
</P>
<P>
In the clutch, so far at least, there has been one very important difference 
separating the two finalists of the National League championship series, and, 
as academic as it might seem, it sums up San Francisco's success of the past 
two days as accurately as anything else can: 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a Giant needed to hit the ball out of the park, he made it go out. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the Cubs needed to hit the ball out of the park, he made an out. 
</P>
<P>
Too broad? Too simple? All we know is that whenever a moment of truth has 
occurred during the National League championship series games of Saturday and 
Sunday, the big bad bats of the Bay Area Bombers went boom. We have just seen 
San Francisco pry open a 3-1 series advantage over a bunch of free swingers who 
happen to be batting .305 as a team for the playoffs, if you can believe that. 
</P>
<P>
First there was Saturday night's man of the hour, Robby Thompson, who stepped 
into a seventh-inning pitch and sent it winging toward a 5-4 Giant victory. 
When the Cubs needed heroes in the last two innings, no one stepped forward. 
The tying and winning runs were left on base, in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, same thing. San Francisco needed to sock it to 'em, and Matt 
Williams delivered a two-run screamer over the left-field fence. Came the ninth 
inning and bases full of Cubs, Andre Dawson waved at strike three, assuring 
broken glassware in half the saloons and households of greater metropolitan 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
We hardly mean to pick on the poor old Cubs. Lord knows life itself has done 
plenty of that. All we mean to emphasize is that the Giants have risen to the 
occasion every time there has arisen an occasion, and the Cubs have not. And 
while it is not too late for them, the sky is definitely getting dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to use Yogi Berra's line, 'It's not over until it's over,' " Cub 
Manager Don Zimmer said. "I know we beat the Mets three times in a row this 
year. We beat the Cardinals three times in a row. We beat the Expos three times 
in a row. We can't worry about three in a row now. We got to worry about 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
That they do. And whatever solace they can find in baseball's old 
sun'll-come-up sanctuary of optimism has as its foundation the comebacks made 
by other Boys of Autumn throughout this decade -- the Cardinals coming back to 
overtake the Brewers, the Cardinals defeating the Dodgers, the Royals over the 
Blue Jays, Royals over Cards, Twins over Cards, Mets over Red Sox, Cards over 
Giants, even the Padres to jolt the Cubs. Baseballs take funny bounces. 
</P>
<P>
What the Cubs must do is keep their heads screwed on tight. They are blowing 
this thing with bonehead plays, blowing the opportunity of a lifetime, wasting 
the wonderful hitting of Mark Grace, Ryne Sandberg and Luis Salazar by leaving 
baserunners stranded, taking foolish risks on the bases, making strange 
managerial decisions, even losing track of the count on the batter, as Les 
Lancaster did in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Giants, they are making the most of things, and not just at the 
plate. One minute Kevin Mitchell is catching a two-on, two-out line drive from 
the seat of his pants. Next minute Will Clark is scooping a throw out of the 
dirt, or upsetting a Cub infielder with a hard slide at second base, breaking 
up a double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants look loose, relaxed. When Shawon Dunston of the Cubs check-swinged a 
dinker down the right-field line, Kelly Downs, the Giant pitcher, an old 
winter-ball acquaintance of his, glanced over to first base and made a joke, 
something on the order of: "You're not gonna take that one, are you?" He was 
smiling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunston wasn't. At that moment he wanted to do exactly what the Cubs did not do 
enough of Sunday: Hit Kelly Downs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Shawon didn't see the smile," Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. Maybe the Cubs see nothing amusing about their current predicament, and 
won't unless they are given the opportunity to laugh last. Maybe they will 
figure out how to pitch to Clark, Mitchell, Williams and the others before that 
becomes the Oakland Athletics' worry, not theirs. Maybe they will salvage this 
thing yet, or maybe Yogi Berra was full of it. 
</P>
<P>
Two thousand miles they roamed, hoping to bring this series back home. But the 
Chicago Cubs are sitting on the dock of the bay, watching their time slip away.

ZIMMER, SUTCLIFFE BICKER OVER POSSIBLE GAME 6 START 
</P>

<P>
With no hard feelings between the opposing teams -- the managers send each 
other Christmas cards, for goodness sakes -- the National League playoffs took 
a different twist before Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
It matched Chicago Cub vs. Chicago Cub. 
</P>
<P>
Along one foul line was pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, reiterating that the pulled 
muscle in his left leg felt fine, and that he was ready to pitch Game 6 
Wednesday night in Chicago, if the series goes that far. 
</P>
<P>
Along the other foul line was Manager Don Zimmer, who said Sutcliffe had not 
recovered enough from the Game 3 injury to pitch in Game 6. Then Zimmer 
reminded everyone that Sutcliffe is not the manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the deal is," Sutcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at him," Zimmer said. "Today, I don't think he's ready to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Before Game 4, Zimmer was leaning toward either left-hander Paul Kilgus or 
right-hander Scott Sanderson for a potential Game 6. Sanderson did get in two 
innings Sunday night but could be ready. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer could also change his mind and go with Sutcliffe, who gave up three runs 
in six innings Saturday when the Giants won, 5-4. But one thing won't change. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe and Zimmer won't be exchanging phone numbers this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be ready to go Wednesday, I was fine (Saturday)," Sutcliffe said. "But I 
guess I'll just pitch when the manager says I should pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer: "That is why I'm the manager. If anybody else wants to make the 
decisions, they should be the manager." 
</P>
<P>
Their problems stem from midseason. Sutcliffe said then that he was pitching 
with a sore shoulder aggravated when Zimmer asked his starters to work on three 
days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer thought Sutcliffe should quit complaining and either pitch or visit the 
trainer's room. He thought Sutcliffe was setting a bad example for the team's 
many young players, a point he emphasized during that time when a reporter 
asked him to cite Sutcliffe's leadership ability. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe was more than happy to comment Sunday when asked if, by not letting 
him start Wednesday, Zimmer was trying to give him more rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't why," Sutcliffe said. "He did it this way (three days' rest) in all of 
July." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said that, among other problems with Sutcliffe Saturday, he didn't like 
the way the Cub starter looked like between pitches. He was referring to 
Sutcliffe's habit of circling the mound, rubbing his face, shaking his head and 
looking like a beaten pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had broken him of that," Zimmer said. "Earlier this year in 
Atlanta, down in the bullpen, I took the ball from him and said, 'Watch me, I'm 
going to throw two pitches.' 
</P>
<P>
"During those pitches, I stomped around the mound and did everything he does. 
He finally said, 'Do I really do that?' I said, 'Yes, and you are putting your 
infielders and outfielders to sleep.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said Sutcliffe improved after that session. 
</P>
<P>
"The next couple of starts, he worked quick and went right after the hitters," 
Zimmer said. "But Saturday that changed." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' likely Game 6 starter would be Don Robinson, who was credited with 
the victory Saturday after giving up one unearned run in 1 2/3 innings in a 
relief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has a sore right knee, but it is not as bad as Mike LaCoss' sprained 
left knee. LaCoss had to leave Saturday's game because of the injury, after 
giving up three runs in three innings. He was encouraged Sunday by a magnetic 
resonance imaging examination, which showed no structural damage to the knee. 
LaCoss' status is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
A day after forgetting the count on a game-losing home run pitch, Cub reliever 
Les Lancaster was not making excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason for it, it cost me, and I have nobody to blame but 
myself," said Lancaster, who gave up a seventh-inning, two-run homer to Robby 
Thompson on a 2-and-0 pitch that he thought was a 3-and-0 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster said part of the problem was that he replaced Paul Assenmacher with 
the count already 1-and-0 on Thompson. The other problem was the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I knew what the count was when I came in," said Lancaster, 27, who 
has played parts of three big-league seasons. "But when I made my first pitch 
and looked at the scoreboard, I saw 3-and-0. I know it wasn't 3-and-0, but 
that's what I thought I saw. 
</P>
<P>
"The catcher (Joe Girardi) didn't say anything to me, the umpire didn't say 
anything to me, but I still should have known." 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster spoke hurriedly, like a man who couldn't wait to get back on the 
mound and redeem himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I do, I want to get it out of my mind, and it's hard right now," Lancaster 
said. "I know I'll be harassed by the fans for it." 
</P>
<P>
Not just them. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zimmer: "Tomorrow I'm going to go out and buy one of those umpire's 
indicators and give it to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' Will Clark and the Cubs' Mark Grace continued to make this a series 
controlled by first basemen. 
</P>
<P>
By going three for four with two runs scored, Clark tied an NLCS record for 
hits with 10 and runs with seven. He is batting .625 for the series with three 
doubles, two homers and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Grace went one for three with two RBI and briefly tied the NLCS record with 
eight RBI until the Giants' Matt Williams broke it one-half inning later with 
his game-winning homer. Grace is batting .642 with one homer.

SOLOIST'S CONCERTED EFFORT WINS MVP

<P>
Even as Rickey Henderson was receiving the most valuable player award for his 
performance in the American League playoffs, the Toronto Blue Jays continued to 
malign his and the Oakland Athletics' style. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost like Rickey was pointing to the seats and calling his shots," 
A's general manager Sandy Alderson said of Henderson's in-your-face dominance 
of a five game series in which Oakland repeated as AL champion. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson sustained his impact Sunday as he tripled, singled and stole yet 
another base, driving in one run and scoring a second in the 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey kept altering his game to the opposing pitcher and he did it at will," 
Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Against right-handers he would be more patient, just trying to get on base, 
knowing he could steal. Against left-handers, knowing he would have a tougher 
time stealing, he went for the extra-base hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like this was his stage, his Carnegie Hall, and he rose to the occasion 
with a virtuoso performance." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's next recital comes Saturday in the first game of the World Series 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson grew up in the Bay Area rooting for the Giants. Now, he wants the 
Giants to defeat the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs so that it 
will be a short commute from his Oakland Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
But he wiped the champagne from his face Sunday and added: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident I can run against either team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can top this, but I think I can do just as well." 
</P>
<P>
How well did Henderson do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- He had a slugging percentage of 1.000, an on base percentage of .609 (14 
for 23) and a batting average of .400 based on six for 15, not including seven 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He set a championship series record with eight stolen bases, tied another 
by scoring eight runs and either scored or drove in 11 of the A's 26 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He led both clubs in RBI and extra base hits with five each, and tied 
teammate Dave Parker for the most home runs with two. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, of course, he seemed to intimidate the Blue Jays, distracting 
their focus. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, he walked twice, stole two bases, scored one run and accounted for 
two others by breaking up a double play with a pivotal slide at second base. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 2, he walked twice, singled twice, scored two runs and infuriated the 
Blue Jays with his tiptoe approach to second base on a seventh-inning steal 
that failed to draw a throw. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 3, the only A's loss, he doubled, walked, stole once and scored two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 4, he hit two homers, drove in three runs and walked. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday, aware, as he said, that opposing pitcher Dave Stieb is prone to 
rattle, Henderson walked to open the game, stole second and scored on Jose 
Canseco's one-out single. Two innings later, he tripled to right-center field 
for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get to Stieb early, you can frustrate and intimidate him, and I think 
that's what happened," Henderson said. "He's a tremendous pitcher, but he 
shouldn't let people intimidate him the way he does." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, it came down to a final exchange of words Sunday, with the Blue 
Jays' George Bell calling Henderson a great leadoff hitter who doesn't need to 
"showboat and show up people the way he does," and catcher Ernie Whitt, who 
threw out one of 14 A's base stealers, saying of Henderson's performance: 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he was the key going in. We knew we had to keep him off the bases and 
that didn't happen. We held down the Oakland big boys, but couldn't contain 
Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great series, but I still don't appreciate the way he goes about it 
at times. You don't try to embarrass the other guy in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson smiled. Showmanship, he said, is the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think George Bell or any of those guys know what this was all about," 
he said. "Maybe it was because I wanted it more, but I don't think they 
recognized the excitement and emotion of it. 
</P>
<P>
"They kind of went out and stood around, but that's fine. I'm just a little 
hurt and disappointed that they have to make it personal again, that they can't 
admit they were outplayed." 
</P>
<P>
Striving to reach his first World Series, Henderson said he was on a mission. 
He cited the effort that went into it and said he wasn't surprised by his 
success, calling it and the A's pennant a dream come true, the happiest moment 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
He also credited the byplay with fans here and the Blue Jay comments for 
keeping his adrenaline pumping, and said, "I enjoy having the spotlight on me. 
I strive to raise my game in that situation. I'm honored when people say I'm 
the best leadoff hitter ever, but I don't know about that. I feel I'm one of 
the best of this decade. I don't know much about what happened before." 
</P>
<P>
There was a spotlight in New York, of course, but Henderson didn't always 
respond in a consistent manner, as he did with the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Traded to the A's June 20, he stole 52 bases in 58 attempts and had 160 hits 
and walks while reaching base in 80 of 85 games. He hit .247 in the first half 
and .294 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Eligible for free agency when the World Series ends, Henderson said he hopes to 
remain with the A's, although he had previously said he would consider all 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relaxed. I feel less pressure than I did in New York," he said. "The 
people in this organization let you know they're high on you, they care for 
you. It's a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Alderson, aware that his praise only enhances Henderson's sales pitch, said he 
would not begin negotiations until the World Series is over. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey knows we want him to stay. We've told him that we'll do everything we 
can to retain him. He obviously has given us a dimension we didn't have last 
year. And if we hadn't had him this year, this series easily could have gone 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Henderson's postseason performance probably will stand as a yardstick 
against which all others are measured. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill Rigney, an adviser to Alderson and a baseball man for almost 50 
years: 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me who I compare Rickey to and I have to say Jackie Robinson when 
it comes to daring on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have never seen anyone play so hard and do so many things in a five-game 
series. He wanted it, and it rubbed off on everyone else here."

A CALCUTTA MURDERER SLINKS FROM DEPTHS OF DEPRAVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CALCUTTA, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He strikes only when Calcutta sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
His victims are street people, Calcutta's helpless beggars, lunatics and 
rickshaw pullers who share their muddy concrete beds with the city's rats, 
garbage and disease. And his is the perfect murder weapon in a crumbling city 
of broken streets -- an anonymous, 50-pound concrete slab that is always taken 
from near his sleeping victims. 
</P>
<P>
He has killed seven people in the past three months, crushing their skulls with 
a single blow. London had its Jack the Ripper; Boston, its infamous Strangler, 
and Los Angeles, its Hillside Strangler and terrifying Night Stalker. Now, 
Calcutta, a 300-year-old city long synonymous with the horrors of life and 
death, is being stalked and spooked by a serial murderer, barbaric even by 
local standards. 
</P>
<P>
They call him, simply, the Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going back to the Stone Age," declared Rachhpal Singh, deputy 
commissioner of Calcutta's beleaguered police department. "Killing each other 
with stones shows what kind of progress we have made here." 
</P>
<P>
Belatedly, public outcry for justice has grown in this city of 6 million people 
to the point where "Stoneman" has become as much a household name as "Gandhi." 
</P>
<P>
Singh concedes that his police department is no closer to solving the "Stoneman 
Mystery," as the local press is calling it, than it was when the killer first 
struck June 4. 
</P>
<P>
"We are nowhere on this case yet," he said. "We haven't a clue." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the only physical evidence the Stoneman has left behind at each murder 
scene is the concrete slab he has used to crush his victims' skulls. And 
reliable police sources admitted that until the most recent killing, on a 
lonely street corner in downtown Calcutta, detectives had not even thought to 
keep the murder weapons. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, the police do not even know the exact names of six of the seven 
victims, who, like most of the more than 50,000 homeless flooding Calcutta's 
streets from nearby states in recent years in search of work and a better life, 
are as anonymous as the city's cracked sidewalks and potholed streets. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first three or four murders, we did not have an idea that it might be 
methodical or the work of a single person," Singh said. "And initially, yes, I 
do admit some lack of concern because these victims were, after all, just 
pavement dwellers." 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, Calcutta's citizenry also was largely unconcerned when the spate of 
slayings began. 
</P>
<P>
The Stoneman's first victim, after all, was a woman who had made her living by 
selling moonshine on the street. His second victim, a beggar who also called 
the sidewalk his home, was not killed until July 4, exactly one month after the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the pavement dwellers themselves, no one was bothered much about 
it," said Sanjoy Basak, a local police reporter for the Calcutta newspaper, The 
Telegraph, who has covered the Stoneman murders since they began. "Pavement 
dwellers don't even have voting rights here, so nothing was really done." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was not until 5 a.m. on Sept. 8, when the Stoneman claimed his 
seventh and most recent victim, who is described only as "male, approximately 
35 years old, beggar-lunatic type" in the official police report, that 
officials were forced to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
The beggar was crushed to death on Old Court House Street, just a block from 
police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We are under tremendous pressure right now from the public," Deputy 
Commissioner Singh said. "The Stoneman has become a household discussion. And 
Calcutta is a most peculiar place. It is like a small village. Anything 
happening here gets the attention of each and everyone simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"And the people here are very intelligent. They go through the newspaper very 
seriously. Now, they want this case solved." 
</P>
<P>
Facing such pressure, the police last month launched a massive, two-phase 
operation, first, to protect the sidewalk dwellers, and, second, to capture the 
Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
Police patrols have been stepped up throughout central Calcutta, where all the 
murders have taken place. Hundreds of suspects described by police as 
"lunatics" and "maniacs" have been swept up in a citywide dragnet. Undercover 
agents have even been posing as street people, pretending to sleep under 
blankets that hide their service revolvers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Human-Rights Protests 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown has brought loud protests from human-rights groups, which insist 
that the police are beating defenseless street people and torturing unlikely 
suspects who could not possibly be the Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
The dragnet did yield one possible suspect. Police picked up a "lunatic" named 
Mohammad Akram near a sidewalk dweller who claimed he had been attacked by the 
Stoneman. Later, though, the victim admitted that he never really saw anyone 
aim a stone at his head, and police found only a tiny cut on his ear that they 
concluded was a rat bite. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect himself is emaciated and incapable of even lifting the typical 
concrete block used by the killer. And, perhaps the only man left in the police 
department who believes Akram may be the Stoneman is Calcutta's chief of 
detectives, Prasun Mukherjee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defending the Police 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last month, Mukherjee insisted that the police are doing their 
best to catch the mass murderer. 
</P>
<P>
"You must understand that this is a once-in-a-lifetime case for us," he said. 
"There has been nothing like it in all of India. But I am confident that we 
will catch him." 
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee also asserted that there are no departmental politics involved in the 
Stoneman case. Other observers, among them several Calcutta policemen, are not 
so sure. In addition to the apparently sloppy police work in the beginning, the 
police department seems to be competing within itself to solve the case, 
dividing into two distinct factions under Mukherjee and Deputy Commissioner 
Singh. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 18, it was announced that Mukherjee alone would be in charge of the 
case, making it clear that Singh, who had developed intricate theories and 
psychological profiles of the killer, would no longer be involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychotic Profile 
</P>
<P>
Singh, for example, is known to believe that Akram is not the Stoneman. Rather, 
he believes that the killer is most likely psychotic but highly intelligent and 
probably acting out of deep hatred for the city's beggars and street people. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some motive of hatred against all these beggars and madmen and 
lunatics," Singh said in an interview. "But to me, he seems to be an 
intelligent person. He conceals himself. His weapon is untraceable. And he has 
been so brazen as to strike twice in exactly the same spot." 
</P>
<P>
But Singh also is known to have rankled his superiors, in part by coining the 
nickname "Stoneman," during a press conference several weeks ago. "I'm paying 
for it now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee also has his theories. 
</P>
<P>
"This man also could be a tantrik -- a death sorcerer of some kind," Mukherjee 
said. "There are some precedents for that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killer in Bombay 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the only other serial murderer on record in India is Raman Raghav, a 
religious fanatic who claimed 42 victims in Bombay in the late 1960s before 
police caught him. 
</P>
<P>
Raghav also victimized only impoverished street people and only at night while 
they slept, but his murder weapon was an iron bar. Bombay police first arrested 
him in 1966 and held him for two years, during which he confessed nothing. The 
murders stopped during his incarceration, but, with no other proof, the police 
released him and the killings began anew. 
</P>
<P>
After a rearrest several months later, Raghav admitted that he had, indeed, 
"been true to the voice of the sun god" in performing all 42 ritual murders, 
and he led police to his iron bar. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the precedent and public announcements to the contrary, though, 
Mukherjee said his department has not yet enlisted the aid of Bombay 
detectives, nor has he contacted police in other countries that have faced 
serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been reading up on Jack the Ripper, the Yorkshire Slasher and the 
Boston Strangler," he said. "And there are no real similarities. But keep in 
mind that Jack the Ripper still hasn't been identified, and that was going on 
in London in 1888." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street People Unite 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the street people of the city said they are finding, as they always 
have, their own means of survival. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all staying in groups now," Shankar Malik, a sidewalk dweller who 
sweeps the wards at a local hospital, told passing journalists on a recent 
morning, as they accompanied one of the new midnight police patrols through 
Calcutta's eerie downtown streets. "And we sleep in shifts now. Some are always 
awake and standing guard, so if the Stoneman comes, we can tackle him." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he and the dozen or so friends sleeping around him continue to live 
on the streets despite the risk, Malik said they had all left the adjacent 
Indian state of Bihar because there was no land for them to farm, and now they 
find themselves in a city with no shelter where they can sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, these people have no choices," said N.C. Bhattacharya, the police 
officer in charge of Calcutta's downtown station house, as he guided the 
journalists around rat-infested garbage heaps and row after row of sleeping 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
"And so many of them could not make the choice, even if they had it. They are 
just lunatics and madmen, you know. So many lunatics in Calcutta. Just like 
this Stoneman we are searching for. Lunatics. All of them, lunatics."

GOLDEN CHOICES;

WORK-SOME, PLAY-SOME LIFE STYLE APPEALING TO MORE OLDER WORKERS

<P>
It once was said that retirement was twice as much spouse and half as much 
money. 
</P>
<P>
But that appears to be changing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "what we are seeing is a new definition of retirement," says Helen Dennis, 
a lecturer at the USC Andrus Gerontology Center, a project director of the 
Conference Board and a nationally recognized authority on retirement and older 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are discovering that retirement and work do not need to be mutually 
exclusive, that the two need not be incompatible," she says. "Many who retire 
have found themselves coping with an emptiness or lack of meaning to life. 
Having a job again can solve this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Phenomenon 
</P>
<P>
This feeling among retirees is coming at a time when employers are increasingly 
turning to gray as their favorite color. It is a national phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 10 years there will be 15 million fewer people ages 18-25 than there 
are today," explains Natalie Gold, a Los Angeles project manager with the 
National Council on the Aging Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will America's businesses have to compete harder for available young 
people, Gold continues, but they also will have to look to older, experienced 
people to fill positions. 
</P>
<P>
Which is one reason for the eighth annual Job Fair for Older Workers to be held 
statewide Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 13 locations -- the first time it 
has expanded out of the Southland. Fairs will be held at two other locations on 
other days. 
</P>
<P>
The free events, sponsored jointly by NCOA, Volt Temporary Services and Bank of 
America, are expected to attract about 10,000 seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"At our first fair, we had to beg employers to participate," Gold recalls. "Now 
they ask to be there. Some of the sites will have as many as 50 booths." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job Possibilities 
</P>
<P>
Those attending will receive information on job possibilities (part-time and 
full-time) from large and small companies. They will get application forms and 
have access to representatives from government agencies. They also may sit in 
on programs dealing with such subjects as what to expect upon re-entering 
today's job market and the probably forgotten art of how to dress for an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Most seniors re-entering the job market are interested in supplemental income. 
For individuals under age 65 who draw Social Security benefits, the annual 
earnings limit is $6,480, after which, for every $2 earned, the recipient loses 
$1 in benefits. From ages 65 to 69, the annual earnings test is $8,880. At age 
70 and older, there is no earnings limit. 
</P>
<P>
But money isn't the sole issue in seniors' employment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are increasingly seeing," Dennis says, "is an appreciation of the 
skills and abilities of mature, experienced workers." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Art Chancellor of Sherman Oaks, having labored for decades as a 
swimming pool designer and salesman, decided it was time for a leisurely life 
of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I did chores around the house, got in some gardening, built a wood fence 
around the yard, and spent a lot of time just sitting around," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Olympics came here in 1984, I volunteered, and was assigned to the 
Biltmore Hotel, where I drove dignitaries anywhere they asked to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I was enjoying it. Then the Olympics ended, and I sat down and asked myself: 
'What am I going to do now?' 
</P>
<P>
"I was going through the paper, and I saw an ad for a medical laboratory that 
was looking for a courier. I said, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor applied, was hired, and now -- five years later and at age 78 -- is 
still on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Three days a week, he shuttles medical specimens or reports in a car between 
the lab and its customers. "My route takes me all the way up to Santa Barbara. 
I love it. I drive alongside the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor said he is paid $7.50 an hour, and averages about 20 hours a week. 
"I could get along without the money, but it buys a few luxuries. It allows my 
wife and I some trips, and some extra dinners out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Work Ethic Is Gone' 
</P>
<P>
Like many others who have gone back to work after an absence, he said he has 
noticed changes in the work place and in workers: "As I make my rounds, I 
notice that people seem to have forgotten how to work. The work ethic is gone. 
People don't seem to care much about their jobs anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what his wife, Vera, thinks of his returning to the work force, he 
answered: "Any wife in her right mind adores the idea of her husband getting 
out of the house once in a while. The thought of total retirement is 
ridiculous, unless you have an all-consuming hobby. The muscles grow slack, 
depression sets in, and you keep hearing about people who die soon after they 
retire." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Benjamin of Sylmar, now 65, doesn't intend for that to happen to her when 
she retires Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for years she has heralded the value of older workers, in her 
full-time capacity as director of human resources development with the Volt 
company: "We have wanted, in part, to reach those who have had their fill of 
retirement, and want to get back into the real world. There is only so much TV 
you can watch, or only so many bogeys you can take." 
</P>
<P>
But something new has happened for her: "I have become a grandmother for the 
first time -- a grandson named Michael -- and I want to enjoy this new aspect 
of my life, so I am going to take retirement. But I know I will become bored to 
death if I have to stay home all the time." What she has done -- as have more 
and more American workers -- is to arrange to return to her soon-to-be former 
employer in a part-time capacity. "I want a job relationship, but on my terms," 
she said. She views it as a chance to "slow down the merry-go-round." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't 'Quit Cold Turkey' 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Benjamin has made arrangements for her company's float in the 
annual Hollywood Christmas Parade. "I will do it for them this year on a fee 
basis, and will be paid for doing other projects for them. After all these 
years of working, I couldn't just quit cold turkey." 
</P>
<P>
Not that she is resisting entirely the idea of partial retirement: "Workaholics 
miss so much of what life is all about. From now on, it's work some, play some. 
That has always been the healthiest combination." 
</P>
<P>
But the work-some portion is important to a growing number of seniors. "If I 
suddenly lost this job, it would be like driving a stake into my heart," 
Chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of Tuesday's statewide Job Fair for Older Workers is "Experience 
Works." 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but Denise D. Jessup, associate director of the Los Angeles 
Council on Careers for Older Americans, points out that "fewer jobs require 
strenuous physical labor" and "older people are better educated now than at any 
time in our history." 
</P>
<P>
Although many types of businesses will be represented at the various sites, 
Dennis, of USC, says that as the years go by, demand will especially increase 
for older workers to fill jobs such as secretaries, bank tellers, retail 
salespeople, and positions in high tech. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, among other firms, has been active in recruiting older 
workers. Robert N. Beck, executive vice president for corporate human resources 
at the bank, says of such employees: "We are pleased to have them, including 
Bank of America retirees, because their many years of experience gives them a 
broader view of the business situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Special Asset 
</P>
<P>
"Once on the job, they tend to have less turnover, and are less concerned about 
career management. Also, they are a special asset in working with the growing 
number of customers who are in the retirement population." 
</P>
<P>
Still, though, there is the challenge of convincing mature Americans that 
employment should still be part of their futures. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of Americans are ill-prepared for the last third of their lives 
-- in terms of what they want to do," Dennis says. "We talk about goals, and 
yet for some reasons the goals switch turns off at about age 58. What is it you 
want to do during that time? What reason will you have to get up in the 
morning?" 
</P>
<P>
This should be answered, she continues, because those who make it to retirement 
have up until then been strong people: "They are survivors. They have possibly 
been through a Depression, been through wars, career changes, family problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nagging Concern 
</P>
<P>
Now there is the supposed euphoria of finally being able to live a carefree 
life. "But with the increased life expectancy, plus inflation, there is a 
nagging concern over the possibility of outliving one's assets," Dennis says. 
</P>
<P>
Which is one of the reasons that, at the same time employers now are courting 
them, retirees are becoming available. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason, Dennis says, is the meaning of work: "Work has more value 
than just financial. It gives a sense of purpose, and of being part of a team. 
Many older Americans are finding they miss this -- and employers are finding 
they miss them." 
</P>
<P>

STAR VOGUERS HIT RUNWAY AND DAZZLE AFICIONADOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ROUILARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For vogue-ing fans in Los Angeles, this was the summer of our discontent. The 
East Coast dance craze never found a home here. Or a house. 
</P>
<P>
Houses are groups of voguers under the leadership of a fashion designer 
usually, like "House of Chanel" or "House of Patricia Fields." In New York, 
there are dozens of houses. On the runways in Paris and Milan, vogue-ing is the 
ne plus ultra touch that has made the collections of Jean-Paul Gaultier, 
Thierry Mugler and Patrick Kelly something to watch. Voguers spin, dip, dance, 
pose, sneer, whirl down runways, wearing the latest designs. 
</P>
<P>
Vogue-ing hit Los Angeles in early July, and, by August, there must have been 
about six people who still wanted to learn how to vogue. By September, there 
appeared to be two: Club owners April La Rue and Christian Farrow still 
featured vogue-ing at the Love Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Is vogue-ing dead in Los Angeles? Is Los Angeles not cool? Not fashionable? 
</P>
<P>
"Vogue, vogue, vogue, vogue," the crowd in the VIP mezzanine of the Hollywood 
Palladium was shouting at the empty stage Saturday night. Rock impresario 
Malcolm McLaren had gathered up some of Europe's and New York's top voguers to 
perform his new album, "Waltz Darling." 
</P>
<P>
The event, a benefit for the Rainforest Foundation, featured the fashions of 
L.A. designers Michele Lamy, Squarewear, Richard Tyler, Modern Objects, Rozae, 
Body Glove and Pepito Albert. It was nearly sold out. The crowd, about 5,000, 
was dying to see how the professionals do it. 
</P>
<P>
How do they do it? 
</P>
<P>
Well. And certainly better than anything we've seen in Los Angeles so far. Star 
voguer Willy Ninja left the VIP mezzanine screaming for more. The screamers 
included Madonna, Billy Idol, actors Billy Wirth and Steve Antin, the Fashion 
Patrol (fashion photographers Matthew Rolston and Paul Jasmin commenting on 
each and every ensemble), designers Jocelyn Winship, Diana Hammro and Jef 
Huereque, restaurateur Mario Tamayo, stylist to the stars Raymond Lee, and 
make-up maven Gale Hayman.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: SOUTHERN AFRICA THROUGH A GLASS, CLEARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two faces of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
One is "South Africa Now," a low-budget, low-key -- but in its own way 
absolutely spectacular -- weekly newsmagazine that is indispensable viewing for 
anyone who wants to know what's really happening in southern Africa. Aired on 
PBS outlets in 62 cities, it's available locally at 9 a.m. Sundays on KCET 
Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
The other face is "Shaka Zulu," a gory, historically suspect, 
Pretoria-encouraged miniseries about unredeemably savage and blood-lusting 
Zulus in early 19th-Century southern Africa. "Shaka Zulu" has been traveling 
across America in syndication since 1986, amassing impressive ratings, and now 
gets its first national airing this week on cable's TBS network. It runs in 
five installments, today through Friday from 5 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Made at a cost of $24 million -- including $2.5 million from the 
state-controlled South Africa Broadcasting Corp. -- the 10-hour miniseries is 
lavishly mounted, but so ineptly executed that it's mainly for viewers who like 
seeing barbaric, semi-nude blacks running around carving each other up as 
civilized whites look on in horror. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaka Zulu" is a muddy window. 
</P>
<P>
Watching "South Africa Now," however, is like seeing through a clear window for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Always spotty, American television coverage of South Africa has dropped off 
considerably since the Pretoria government declared a state of emergency and 
increased media censorship in June, 1986. And even in the best of times, the 
time limits imposed on network news stories are not conducive to in-depth 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa Now," a nonprofit series that has had a single focus since its 
inception in April, 1988, has more than filled the coverage gap, drawing from a 
variety of sources, ranging from Afrovision to free-lancers in South Africa who 
smuggle their material out of the country at great risk. Although a culture 
segment is slipped into each half hour, the heaviest emphasis is hard news: 
</P>
<P>
* Black youths turn their bare backs to the camera to display ugly wounds said 
to come from police whippings. 
</P>
<P>
* An investigation reveals ways South Africa is said to circumvent a global oil 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
* A white leader in the rebellion against South Africa's continued control over 
the South West Africa territory of Namibia speaks about threats and attempts on 
his life. He was assassinated after taping the interview. 
</P>
<P>
* A renegade American conservative is accused of violating U.S. law by 
representing South Africa's extreme-right, rigidly pro-apartheid Conservative 
Party in this country without registering as its agent. 
</P>
<P>
* Anti-apartheid journalists appear in an excerpt from an Irish documentary 
about hazards faced by the dissident press operating inside South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by the independent production firm Globalvision in association with 
the anti-apartheid Africa Fund, "South Africa Now" surely is anti-apartheid, 
which is about as dishonorable as being anti-Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa Now" is anything but a shrill soap box, however, and the 
reporting is usually fiercely sober and thorough. 
</P>
<P>
Produced on a relatively spare budget of $26,000 a week -- which is 
underwritten by mainstream foundations and individuals, including Bruce 
Springsteen -- this is also not a gleaming, elegant program with wide anchor 
desks and dazzling technology. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its diversity of sources, moreover, the quality of production varies 
greatly from story to story. So does the quality of the anchors, who range from 
rough-edged quasi-amateurs (who are in the show's training program for young 
journalists) to producer Carolyn Craven, a polished former anchor-reporter for 
KQED in San Francisco and former White House correspondent for National Public 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "South Africa Now" special is that there's nothing like it anywhere 
else. No other program sheds so much light on the dark continent. 
</P>
<P>
Mainstream media coverage of Southern Africa does not escape its close 
scrutiny. A segment on Sunday questioned New York Times reporter Christopher 
Wren's use of "shadowy" to describe the "mass democratic alliance" against 
apartheid in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa Now" failed to clarify the context in which Wren had applied 
"shadowy" to organized apartheid opposition. What it did do was demonstrate the 
power and potential hair-trigger combustibility of words used to characterize 
political or human rights movements. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, "shadowy" does apply to "Shaka Zulu," whose resurfacing on TBS 
also occupied a portion of Sunday's "South Africa Now." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Harmony Gold is listed as the producing company for "Shaka 
Zulu." Directed by white South African William C. Faure and featuring such 
prominent English actors as Edward Fox and Christopher Lee, the miniseries 
centers on the great warrior king of the powerful Zulu nation from 1816 until 
his murder in 1828. 
</P>
<P>
This is more of the black experience through white eyes. The bottom line here 
is image: At a time when Pretoria's white-minority government continues to 
argue that South Africa's overwhelming black majority is unfit for self rule, 
"Shaka Zulu" arrives almost on cue, filling the screen with black tribesmen 
motivated only by barbarism and black magic. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a fascinating depiction of a turbulent part of world history 
that's rarely seen," Bob Levi, executive vice president of TBS, said from his 
Atlanta office. Levi characterized the South Africa Broadcasting Corp.'s 
financial involvement -- which was unpublicized by KCOP Channel 13 in Los 
Angeles and other stations previously airing the miniseries -- as nothing more 
than a routine "pre-buy" for South African broadcast rights. "The key is that 
they had no script approval," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, "Shaka Zulu" is labeled "the greatest project yet undertaken by the 
SABC," and crucial for the nation's "image abroad" in the public record of a 
1984 South African parliamentary debate. And a sales ad for the miniseries in a 
1985 London trade publication bore the SABC logo, address and telephone and fax 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The miniseries shows "African resistance to English colonialism," Levi said. 
"It's relevant and it's good television." 
</P>
<P>
In its report Sunday on "Shaka Zulu," "South Africa Today" replayed footage 
from an earlier story it had done on the miniseries in which sharp criticism 
was expressed by Mazisi Kunene, a black South African who teaches African 
literature at UCLA and wrote the biography "Emperor Shaka the Great." 
</P>
<P>
"It's untenable that Shaka could strip naked and drink blood," Kunene said 
about one scene in the production. The miniseries "says Shaka has a brain," he 
said, "but a bad one." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a very bad series lives on.

'DIVORCE COURT' TAKES NEW STAND AGAINST DAYTIME COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the evolution of television, as in the evolution of intelligent life, 
organisms must adapt to new surroundings or face the consequences. Such is the 
case with "Divorce Court," the syndicated series that began back in TV's 
Cro-Magnon age. 
</P>
<P>
Competition from a barrage of daytime talk shows that specialize in the seamier 
side of life was making it increasingly difficult to attract viewers. " 
'Oprah,' 'Geraldo,' 'Donahue' -- these are the direct competition," explains 
Ron Ziskin, executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
So when the show's new season begins today, it will be a far different "Divorce 
Court" than viewers have ever known. The program will attempt to be more 
realistic, without actually being real. (The show will air locally at 4 p.m. on 
Channel 13.) 
</P>
<P>
From its inception in 1957 to the end of its first run in 1969, "Divorce Court" 
consisted mostly of embittered couples hurling vicious accusations at each 
other from the witness stand. Narration was provided by a whispering announcer, 
seemingly pulled away from a golf tournament: "While the court takes a brief 
recess, we'll pause for a commercial announcement." The judge was played by an 
actor and the show had a mission, pronounced daily, "to help stem the rising 
tide of divorces." 
</P>
<P>
The series was resurrected in 1984 by Blair Entertainment, which pretty much 
followed the old format, aside from a few changes. Retired Judge William B. 
Keene was hired to preside over the cases and real lawyers were used to portray 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, apparently feeling the need to get in on the "reality" craze that 
was sweeping TV, the show issued a new statement of purpose -- it was a press 
release, actually -- that clarified the series' intentions. "In the case of 
'Divorce Court,' " it said, "the show is less interested in presenting some 
high-flying concept of realism than it is in presenting reality -- in an 
entertainment form." (The italics were theirs.) 
</P>
<P>
Whatever that meant, it resulted in cases such as Escobar vs. Escobar, in which 
a "Cuban-American ex-CIA agent is accused of gun- and drug-running by wife, 
whom he alleges is sleeping with a renegade CIA agent who wrote a book damning 
the agency"; and Satin vs. Satin, in which "a construction worker accuses his 
wife of using her job as a phone sex operator to solicit business as a 
prostitute. Wife claims alcoholic husband forced her into sexual perversities 
by threatening violence." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't help the ratings, so new producers were brought in to revamp the 
show this year. The program has been radically restructured and will now be as 
much a soap opera as a court show. 
</P>
<P>
The real lawyers who played lawyers have been replaced by actors, whose 
characters will develop over time. Relationships among the attorneys will be 
revealed. The judge, who is still the same, retired judge, will have more 
scenes and dialogue away from the bench. New sets have been added to take the 
action out of the courtroom. Scenes will now take place in the hallway, a cafe, 
an attorney room, the restrooms and other nearby locales. 
</P>
<P>
And there is no more whispering announcer. Instead, a TV reporter, played by 
Martha Smith, formerly of "Scarecrow &amp; Mrs. King," will summarize testimony 
and interview the litigants, lawyers and judge about the cases. 
</P>
<P>
The show also will use flashbacks to tell the stories. "It makes the show more 
realistic," Ziskin says. "Now you can see the motivation." The show used to 
rely on dramatic outbursts in the courtroom to explain something that had 
happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Episodes will often focus on social issues, such as battered children, 
alcoholism, drug dependency and homelessness, the producer said. Toll-free 
numbers for help with the problems featured in that day's episode will be given 
when possible. "I think we can provide useful information to people," Ziskin 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But all is not lost for viewers who disdain social relevance. Some of the 
segments will be just plain kinky. Rock singer Fee Waybill, late of The Tubes, 
will play a rock star in an episode about a wife whose marriage is torn asunder 
when she writes a tell-all book about her life as a groupie. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Entertainment has ordered 110 episodes of the remodeled show. Ziskin and 
co-executive producer Bob Jaffe will churn them all out in eight weeks in a 
studio in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mammoth undertaking," Ziskin says. 
</P>
<P>
Three to four shows are shot every day. While one group is shooting, another is 
in makeup, another in the rehearsal hall. It's a marital Angst factory.

SMALL COMPUTER COMPANY SIGNS BIG OFFICE LEASE; 
</P>
<P>
TERADATA'S EL SEGUNDO DEAL IS VALUED AT $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the largest lease agreements in Southern California this year, 
Teradata Corp., a fast-growing computer maker, has signed an 11-year lease 
valued at more than $100 million for 335,000 square feet of office space in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Teradata will consolidate operations scattered in three Marina del Rey 
buildings into 14 floors of a 20-story high-rise at Pacific Corporate Towers. 
The three-tower complex is owned by Pacific Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
Such large leases are more typically seen in downtown Los Angeles, said John 
Knott of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate brokerage firm that 
represented Teradata. 
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming more difficult for tenants -- that occupy tremendous blocks of 
space -- who aren't in professional services to pay the rents in West Los 
Angeles and downtown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoying Rapid Growth 
</P>
<P>
Teradata has grown quickly in the past few years, expanding into the three 
office buildings and one manufacturing plant on the West Side. That arrangement 
has been hampering productivity, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're growing at a rate of 125 to 150 people per quarter," said Kenneth W. 
Simonds, chairman and chief executive of Teradata. 
</P>
<P>
The company recorded sales of $137 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, up 
54%. Ten-year-old Teradata was named the nation's fastest-growing small public 
company last April by Inc. magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I had great expectations for what we could accomplish, but I think we've 
outstripped my expectations," Simonds said. 
</P>
<P>
Teradata has more than 1,100 employees, with nearly 800 in Los Angeles. It 
opened a factory in Dublin, Ireland, last month. 
</P>
<P>
Teradata's move to heavily traveled Sepulveda Boulevard and a high-rise 
building bearing its name will increase visibility for the fairly low-profile 
company. "When we first got started," Simonds said, "we used to get a lot of 
magazines from earth-moving companies and sand and gravel companies."

FOOTNOTES: DO LESS AND LIVE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Egads! It's possible to get as much work done in an eight-hour day as in one 
that stretches to 10 or 12? Egads! Advertising images glorify self-destructive 
overwork? Egads! Productivity can be enhanced if employees actually take all 
their vacation time? 
</P>
<P>
These revolutionary notions are the pith of EGADS: Exposing the Glorification 
of our Anxiety Driven Society, a newsletter launched this month by 
Overachievers Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-member group, founded by San Francisco public relations executive 
Carol Orsborn, is dedicated to the belief that people should work to live, not 
live to work. The first issue of the newsletter rails against advertising that 
portrays successful executives as anxious, overworked and competitive, warning 
that such images heighten business people's insecurity and drive them to 
endanger their health and ignore their families. 
</P>
<P>
Overachievers Anonymous makes no such demands, according to Orsborn. It 
guarantees no meetings, no classes and no fund-raisers. "In fact," she says, 
"we don't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Dealies for Wheelies 
</P>
<P>
The folks that brought you "Wheel of Fortune," the wildly successful game show 
that made household names out of Vanna and Pat (as in White and Sajak), are 
hoping to hit it big with some new characters: the Wheelies. 
</P>
<P>
Currently featured in commercials for "Wheel of Fortune," Wheelies are 
"adorable, mischievous characters" who live on the "Wheel of Fortune" set and 
play the game all night after the prime time regulars have gone home, said 
Jerry Kapner, vice president of merchandising for King World Productions, which 
distributes "Wheel of Fortune." King World, which already has successful 
licensing programs for its "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" shows, is 
negotiating with several companies to license the multicolored puppets for 
merchandising, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Wheelies bear a vague resemblance to Sajak and White -- that is, if 
the host and well-dressed letter-turner had fangs, bowed legs and an appendage 
that looks like the collar on Dracula's cape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is It for You or Your Dog? 
</P>
<P>
Smelling like your dog may not be the goal of many pet owners but 
Nebraska-based conglomerate ConAgra thinks that there's a market for matching 
fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
Snoopy Private Collection Cologne, a line of scents that ConAgra hopes to have 
out for the start of the Christmas buying season, comes in five fragrances -- 
Pedigree, Puppy Love, A Breed Apart, Delightful and Fetching -- that ConAgra 
says are compatible with human-targeted products Obsession, Giorgio, Chanel, 
Opium and Aramis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Snoopy scents, expected to retail for $3.99, the company is 
expanding its line of Snoopy toys. 
</P>
<P>
"The new Snoopy toys and the pet perfumes will give our company added 
merchandising strength on the retail front," according to a release from 
ConAgra Pet Products Co. "We expect to set new sales highs as this program 
picks up momentum." 
</P>
<P>
The time must be ripe for the perfumed pooch.

MANAGING INVENTORIES, TIMELY DELIVERIES ARE KEY TO KEEPING CUSTOMERS, 
CALIFORNIA MARKETS SATISFIED 
</P>

<P>
Melody Salazar thought that the new rug that she ordered on June 2 from the 
Sears store in Torrance would arrive in plenty of time for her July dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid $200 and they said it (the rug) would arrive in two to three weeks," 
said Salazar, a Manhattan Beach resident who operates her own clothing sales 
firm. "I had the perfect spot all picked out. But my rug didn't come until the 
middle of August. I was very, very angry." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has gone shopping only to find an item out of stock, or who, like 
Salazar, has waited months for merchandise to be delivered, knows how important 
adequate product supplies can be in maintaining customer satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Once a field that drew little notice, the management of inventory has become a 
major preoccupation of American business in the wake of the expansion of the 
global economy and federal deregulation, in 1980, of the U.S. truck and rail 
freight industries. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in maintaining adequate inventories is particularly keen in 
California, which is home to the nation's two largest general merchandise and 
prescription drug distributors as well as a state that has become an important 
hub for products arriving from major foreign manufacturing sites such as 
Mexico, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California companies are having to compete in the international and 
national market so they are having to think more about distribution," said 
Harold Cypress, a senior consultant with Arthur D. Little in Los Angeles. "One 
of the true competitive edges in today's global market is speed of 
distribution. Quick response has become a prerequisite to being a successful 
company. It's an important part of customer satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
In this absolutely-positively-have-to-have-it-overnight world, retailers, 
manufacturers and distributors are dispensing with the old paper-based system 
of order blanks and shipping receipts and substituting new technologies such as 
computers and bar code scanners to keep shelves adequately stocked. And with 
federal deregulation of the trucking and rail industry touching off an 
explosion of new freight carriers, the industry has become more competitive 
than ever. Still, as Salazar discovered, mistakes can happen. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are dealing with a decorator rug, we usually just carry a floor 
sample," explained Clayton Valstad, regional facilities manager for Sears in 
Santa Fe Springs. "Our policy is to offer a refund -- at any time, for any 
reason -- to an unsatisfied customer. We don't like to inconvenience the 
customer." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping inventory on hand, however, is a complex task that requires planning as 
well as information on the movement of goods between vehicles, warehouses and 
stores that can be hundreds of miles apart. Because the federal government no 
longer regulates the number or prices of truck and rail freight carriers, costs 
can vary widely, so decisions on shipping products are more crucial today. 
</P>
<P>
"What deregulation has done is dramatically increase the number of economic 
choices that we as movers of goods have to deal with," said Robert Wayman, 
chief financial officer of Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto. "When 
transportation prices were regulated, it didn't make as much difference who you 
chose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saturn Decision 
</P>
<P>
But today millions of dollars often ride on a manager's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of transporting cars from the factory to the marketplace, for 
instance, was the single biggest factor in General Motors' decision, in the 
mid-1980s, to locate its huge Saturn automobile assembly plant in Spring Hill, 
Tenn., GM officials said. The company noted that the city is within 500 miles 
of nearly 80% of the U.S. population. Other auto makers -- including Nissan, 
Honda and Toyota -- have also built plants in the region because of its central 
location. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Hawthorne-based Mattel Inc. chose to build most of its 
manufacturing plants in Asia. Labor costs are lower there, company officials 
say, but distribution is more intricate. Mattel relies on a network of ocean 
liners, trains and trucks to deliver toys to its two U.S. warehouses in City of 
Industry and Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel's network was tested earlier this year when student protests in China 
disrupted the manufacturing of toys at the company's plant near Canton in 
southeastern China, said Jeffery Douglas, vice president of logistics for 
Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
"Transit time from the Orient can take anywhere from 14 to 17 days" by ship, 
Douglas said. "Toys are time sensitive and if you don't make a product 
immediately available on the shelf, parents are going to buy something else." 
He said Mattel made "minor adjustments" to its production and delivery 
schedules from other plants in Asia to make up for the disruption in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Expectations 
</P>
<P>
Such planning for distribution efficiency has had a significant effect on 
moderating price increases and improving corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Delaney, a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., 
estimated that businesses have saved about $60 billion annually in 
transportation and inventory carrying costs since federal deregulation of the 
truck and rail industries helped focus more attention on distribution costs. 
</P>
<P>
But while costs have come down, consumers' expectations have risen. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become used to getting things when we want them," said Harold 
Kassarjian, a professor of marketing at UCLA. "With more and more crowding in 
the cities, life has become more hectic. Consumers are saying, 'If you don't 
have the cereal I want, I'll go to the store next door.' " 
</P>
<P>
The change in attitudes has "caused corporate management to question the 
traditional ways of meeting customer needs by accumulating stockpiles of 
inventory in close proximity to customer facilities," concluded a study on 
consumer satisfaction conducted last year by Ohio State University's College of 
Business. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become more sensitive to the consumer," said Wayman of Hewlett Packard. 
"By viewing logistics as a vital aspect of customer satisfaction, we're getting 
a better appreciation of it. When somebody pays $500,000 for a piece of 
computer equipment, they are not tolerant of poor delivery. They want it in a 
timely, complete fashion." 
</P>
<P>
A major influence on the new ways of managing inventory has been the Japanese 
who, because of a lack of raw materials and space in their country, perfected 
the concept of "just-in-time" delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of stockpiling months' worth of raw materials and finished products, 
deliveries are timed more closely, reducing carrying costs and storage space 
for manufacturer and retailer alike. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, in the United States, goods are often kept in sparsely populated 
areas rather than stockpiled in costly urban locations. To move products 
around, retailers rely on frequent deliveries by independent distributors such 
as Bergen Brunswig Corp. of Orange or McKesson Corp. of San Francisco, the 
nation's largest pharmaceutical and general merchandise distributor. McKesson 
had earnings of $100.6 million on sales of $7 billion in the fiscal year ended 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms distribute more than 100,000 kinds of merchandise. Virtually 
every item found in the typical drug store, from camera film and toothpaste to 
prescription drugs and sunglasses, is transported or warehoused by one of these 
two firms. It is a task that requires military-like coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"You literally have to plan to take in every issue from freeway congestion to 
when key managers are on vacation," said Bernard J. Hale, vice president of 
distribution for Bergen Brunswig, which earned $47.6 million on sales of $3.9 
billion for the fiscal year ended in August. 
</P>
<P>
To keep deliveries within 15 minutes of the promised time, Hale relies on a 
fleet of 500 trucks and 30 distribution centers. He stays in touch by phone 
with many of his warehouse managers and distributors. But he says his most 
important tool is the personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
"We always keep in mind that a customer is depending on us to deliver," Hale 
said. "When a pharmacist is running low on a life-saving drug, he doesn't 
understand when you are two hours late."

Tom Baker, president of Local 751 of the International Assn. of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, said he could not guess when the two sides will return to 
the bargaining table, although the union is prepared to meet as soon as Boeing 
presents a new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said Friday that the company was prepared to begin 
negotiations as soon as the union's leadership "consolidated" their positions 
on the issues of wage increases, bonuses and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"They are playing games when they talk about 'consolidation,' " Baker said in a 
telephone interview. "They know what the issues are, where the hang-up is. . . 
. That's all just game playing, stalling on their part, until they decide how 
to get back into the negotiations and deal with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, reached at home Sunday, said he spoke with 
representatives from both Boeing and the union over the weekend "and nothing is 
scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Evergreen Airways Corp. of Taiwan said it signed contracts Friday 
with Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a division of Boeing Co., and McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. for the purchase of 26 aircraft valued at a total of $3.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.93-Billion Order 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, Boeing will deliver eight 747-400 and four 
767-300ER passenger jets to Evergreen between 1992 and 1997, while McDonnell 
Douglas will deliver 14 MD-11 craft. 
</P>
<P>
The total Boeing order, including options, is worth $1.93 billion in 
delivery-year dollars, the price Evergreen will pay when it actually receives 
the planes, Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming number of Boeing machinists voted Oct. 3 to reject the 
company's proposed three-year contract and strike Oct. 4, the first walkout 
against Boeing since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
About 43,000 stopped working in the Puget Sound area, 11,700 in the military 
aircraft division in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred 
others at scattered sites around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing offer included the first general wage increases since 1982 -- 4% 
this year, and 3% in each of the next two years. It also provided for an 8% 
bonus this year and 3% the second. 
</P>
<P>
According to Boeing, the lowest grade of machinists now earn a base salary of 
$24,805, while the most experienced earn $38,461 without overtime or bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has said the union expected a double-digit pay raise this year to offset 
the lack of base increases since 1982, and in light of the record number of 
airplane orders that Boeing has stacked up, resulting in record profits. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker declined Sunday to be specific about what the union requests are. 
"The company knows we can't state publicly and wouldn't state publicly what 
kind of pay raise would be acceptable to the membership," he said. "Obviously, 
wages is the No. 1 issue." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the union is prepared for a long strike, if necessary, but he would 
prefer a fairly quick settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has got a good, happy work force, one that's loyal to the 
company," Baker said. "The longer they are out, the longer it is going to take 
for (Boeing) to get the work force to being as productive as they normally 
would be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backlog of Orders 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has a backlog of about 1,600 airplanes on order, enough to keep 
production lines moving through most of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 40 planes partially completed when the strike began, and 
Boeing officials have said they expect them to be completed by supervisors and 
other nonunion personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The first planes finished during the strike rolled off assembly lines Friday -- 
a 747-400 for Malaysia Airlines and a 757 for Ansett World Leasing of 
Australia.

Investor Begins Bid for Lionel: New York investor Robert I. Toussie began a 
hostile $145-million tender offer for Lionel Corp., the toy retailer that 
reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy in 1985. Robert I. Toussie L.P. said it 
began an offer of $8 a share in cash for up to 11.9 million of Lionel's common 
shares. The offer is also for up to $34.8 million of the company's bonds. The 
offer will expire Nov. 3, unless extended. Lionel said it asked shareholders to 
take no action on the offer until its board makes a recommendation on it. 
Toussie holds 9.9% of the New York-based firm.

Consumers can save nearly $150 a year by using the most energy-efficient 
appliances sold in the United States, according to an independent nonprofit 
energy research group. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many factors that consumers need to look at in purchasing 
appliances. Energy is one of them," said Steve Nadel, senior associate at the 
American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
</P>
<P>
Since "one-third of the electricity produced in the U.S. is consumed in our 
homes" the council recommends that consumers pay closer attention to the 
EnergyGuide labels affixed to new appliances. The group has published a guide 
entitled "The Most Energy-Efficient Appliances." 
</P>
<P>
"If all the households in the U.S. had the most efficient refrigerators 
currently available, the electricity savings would eliminate the need for about 
10 large power plants," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Using appliances and heating and cooling equipment costs an average household 
more than $1,000 per year," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that these standards will save consumers at least $28 billion over 
the lifetimes of the products sold through the year 2000," the report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The council report rates a Frigidaire 18.6-cubic-foot model as the most 
efficient in that size category. Based on a national average energy cost of 7.7 
cents per kilowatt hour, the booklet estimates the annual cost to run the 
Frigidaire at $65, a savings of $47 a year over the average inefficient 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
The council rates a White-Westinghouse dishwasher, which costs $38 a year to 
operate, and a Gibson front-loading standard-size washing machine costing $23 a 
year to run, as the most energy-efficient new models. The consumer buying these 
would save $32 and $67, respectively.

Ailing Central Bank Sold: Bank of the West, which has 45 branches throughout 
California, said it signed an agreement for the purchase of the financially 
troubled Central Bank, with 46 branches, for $54 million. Central Bank, 
headquartered in Walnut Creek, Calif., reported a loss of $12.9 million in the 
first six months of 1989 and $39.9 million last year because of bad loans. 
Central has been operating under a consent order and other agreements with the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that required it to change its management and 
increase its capital.

Southeast Asian countries have urged Japan to buy more of their products, 
disband trade barriers and spread technological know-how around the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of South East Asian Nations, which groups together Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Indonesia, said Tokyo has a key 
role in ensuring political stability in the region, but it also has to fulfill 
its promise to help poorer countries develop. 
</P>
<P>
Solita Aguirre, Manila's foreign affairs director of ASEAN affairs, said, 
"ASEAN can only reiterate that Japan provide positive action to ASEAN requests 
for better terms of cooperation in the economic, financial, industrial, 
development and cultural fields." 
</P>
<P>
The director-general of Japan's foreign ministry Asian affairs bureau, Sakutaro 
Tanino, said Japan-ASEAN trade rose by 24.7% in 1988 from 1987 and by 23% in 
1987 from 1986. Tokyo's imports of ASEAN manufactured goods have increased by 
49% over the past year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Japanese investment in ASEAN soared by 78% in 1988 to $2.71 
billion against $1.52 billion in 1987.

DEFECTORS AGREE TO PAY $7 MILLION IN AD AGENCY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The advertising executives who caused an industry uproar 19 months ago when 
they defected from the Lord Geller Federico Einstein agency to set up their own 
shop have agreed to settle a legal dispute arising from the walkout by paying 
their former employer $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached Friday, brings to an abrupt and inconclusive end a 
series of legal claims and counterclaims, including accusations of business 
sabotage that had been closely watched by leaders in the advertising business. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement does not suggest admission of wrongdoing by any of the parties 
and is intended to avoid the expense and distraction that would accompany 
continued litigation," the four firms involved in the case said in a brief 
statement announcing the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Those involved in the settlement are Lord Geller and its owner, WPP Group PLC 
of London, the new agency Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners and its 49% 
partner, the ad agency Young &amp; Rubicam. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners will pay $7 
million to WPP Group, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Six top Lord Geller executives, including agency founders Richard Lord and 
Arthur W. Einstein Jr., walked off the job unexpectedly on March 18, 1988, and 
promptly announced the creation of the new agency, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; 
Partners. Young &amp; Rubicam, a privately held agency, was their partner. 
</P>
<P>
The defectors had been chafing under the management of WPP Group, which 
acquired Lord Geller only eight months earlier as part of its $566-million 
buyout of the advertising holding company JWT Group in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
After the walkout, WPP filed suit against the defectors and their new agency, 
accusing them of trying to steal clients and employees from their old agency. A 
New York state court judge issued an order prohibiting such activity. 
</P>
<P>
But Lord Geller lost a huge amount of business, as its billings shrank to $50 
million from a pre-breakaway level of $212 million. 
</P>
<P>
It lost several important clients, the biggest of which was the computer giant 
International Business Machines Corp. Lord Geller had established a reputation 
as a creative powerhouse largely because its work for IBM, including the 
campaign that used a Charlie Chaplin-like character using IBM office equipment 
to bring order to a chaotic business environment. 
</P>
<P>
As of last March, Lord Geller executives insisted they had stabilized the 
agency, which employed about 100 people, down from 320 before the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
Lord Einstein, on the other hand, had grown from nothing to an agency with 
about $75 million in billings and 82 employees after the first year.

SOUTHLAND'S 600 LIMOUSINE FIRMS TAKE IT TO THE STREETS -- AND THE (LEGAL) LIMIT 
-- IN PLEASING THE WHIMS OF CLIENTS.

They call the limousine trade a service business, which means that on any given 
day a limousine driver may be asked to paint his car purple and cruise the city 
dodging teen-agers who are trying to smooch his right fender. 
</P>
<P>
That job was given to Fleetwood Limousine Ltd. a couple of years ago when pop 
star Prince wanted to lease a limo for three months to publicize his "Purple 
Rain" album. When fans couldn't get through the tinted windows to Prince, "they 
figured kissing the car was the next best thing," says Alan Shanedling, 
president of the Westwood firm. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating the wildest of whims is all in a day's work for the 600 or so 
companies of Southern California's thriving limousine industry. To earn their 
customary $35 to $60 a hour, drivers must transport their passengers, swaddle 
them in luxury and fulfill whatever curious desires may seize them. 
</P>
<P>
With its entertainment industry, weather and love of conspicuous 
self-indulgence, Southern California has always been a hospitable environment 
for the long sedan. But while it's an easy business to enter, operators say 
it's also easy to go bust, particularly if you can't satisfy customers' 
exacting demands for service. 
</P>
<P>
And customers will ask for almost anything. A client of Afflair Wide Body 
Limousine Service once showed up with a bearskin rug and an overflowing 
champagne bucket and asked sheepishly whether the partition behind the 
chauffeur would guarantee the passengers' privacy. The customer's plan, it 
turned out, was to recreate a torrid love scene that took place in a limousine 
in the movie "No Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we'll do anything the customer asks, so long as it isn't illegal," 
says Jim Phillips, owner of the Brea company, who had no objection to what the 
customer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Event Dictates Color 
</P>
<P>
A driver for Dreams Unlimited Limousine Service in Los Alamitos was once paid 
to propose marriage to a woman. On instructions from her fiance, the driver met 
the woman at work, read a romantic poem of proposal and spirited her to the 
airport, where she flew to San Francisco for an evening with her future 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Another Dreams Unlimited customer paid to have a limousine carry her boyfriend 
around Southern California on an elaborate treasure hunt. She kept the hunt 
going for eight hours with a series of clues that led to destinations where the 
boyfriend found gifts and other clues. 
</P>
<P>
White may be the color of choice for limousines in Southern California, but 
some occasions bring a run in requests for other colors. If the Dodgers are in 
the playoffs or World Series, there will be a run on requests for royal blue 
sedans; concerts by the rock group Pink Floyd inevitably bring a flurry of 
orders for pink. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the limousine operators' earnings come from ferrying customers to 
airports, handling corporate traffic and special events. The most important of 
those occasions are proms, weddings, bar mitzvahs and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
The prom season is the biggest money maker for most small operators, a time 
when some can jack up their rates to $125 an hour because demand far outstrips 
the supply of cars. More typically, for an eight-passenger car an operator will 
charge $65 an hour, with an eight-hour minimum and a required 15% tip. 
</P>
<P>
But earning this premium fee requires hard work and much diplomacy. Drivers 
often get caught in the middle between parents, who want the drivers to act as 
chaperons, and the teens, who want them to look the other way as they go 
drinking, hang out of the limo's sun roof and generally make the night as wild 
as they have dreamed it would be. 
</P>
<P>
While most teens follow the rules, operators tell horror stories of how 
youthful high spirits brought them ripped seat covers, broken TVs, scratched 
finishes and run-ins with the police. In popular prom-night cruising terrain, 
such as Newport Beach, police set up roadway checkpoints to keep an eye on the 
limousines and other traffic. 
</P>
<P>
For the operator, "it's the best night of the year, and the worst night," said 
Marshall Clayton, owner of Dreams Unlimited Limousines. 
</P>
<P>
The one- and two-car operators who are often so dependent on prom night make up 
most of the industry in Southern California. Only half a dozen limousine 
companies in the area have more than 20 cars, estimates Fleetwood's Shanedling, 
who is vice president of the Limousine Owners Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The history of Clayton's business says a lot about the risks of the enterprise. 
In the 4 1/2 years since he founded Dreams Unlimited, he has bought out small 
limousine companies named Windsor, Caberet, Affluent and Unique. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people get into the business thinking they can count on their friends 
to give them business," Clayton said. "They find out all their friends want it 
for free." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Overhead 
</P>
<P>
The operators also quickly find out about the heavy expenses that they must 
carry if they want to operate legally. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to prices that now run about $40,000 to $60,000 for a new Lincoln 
Town Car or Cadillac stretch limousine, insurance can cost $8,000 to $10,000 
per car each year. Public Utilities Commission licensing fees run 0.75% of an 
operator's gross. 
</P>
<P>
"Put this stuff together, and it's a killer," said Harold Berkman, president of 
Music Express of Burbank, which specializes in show business clientele. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of operators simply don't pay those costs, a maneuver that 
allows them to charge $4 to $8 less an hour than legal competitors, according 
to Shanedling. Such "bandit" drivers are understandably a major gripe of legal 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Los Angeles City Attorney James K. Hahn, in a campaign against 
illegal limousines, sued four companies for failing to have insurance and 
licenses, and other violations. Three have agreed to pay fines to settle the 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
Also important for the business are the show business awards ceremonies, 
including the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys. The Oscars, for example, provide an 
evening's work for about 800 limousines; by comparison, President Bush's 
inauguration fielded 150 limousines. 
</P>
<P>
But these glamorous occasions are also a source of frustration for many small 
operators, since the movie studios use their leverage as big customers to drive 
down rates for the limos that will carry their biggest stars. 
</P>
<P>
"My observation is, sometimes the biggest stars ride around in the crummiest 
looking cars," sniffed operator Phillips.

Today's limousine comes in a standard shape and size and in variations that are 
elongated and ornamented to satisfy the most imaginative lover of 
crushed-velour comfort. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 limousines are manufactured each year by an industry that consists 
of a handful of high-volume manufacturers and countless small operations. The 
standard limousine is a Lincoln or Cadillac sedan that has been stretched to 
add 46 inches to 64 inches to its midsection. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure isn't complicated. The car's interior is stripped, and the car is 
cut in half with a welding torch. Prefabricated side panels, roof and floor are 
fitted in place, along with a new drive shaft. A final welding and paint job 
are the last steps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electronic Gizmos Standard 
</P>
<P>
Standard equipment these days usually includes cellular telephones, 
videocassette recorders, television sets, retractable "moon" roofs and a host 
of bar accessories. 
</P>
<P>
For the adventuresome, there's lots more. Custom limousine shops have stretched 
Rolls-Royces, Jeeps, Jaguars, Maseratis and Hondas, and added every imaginable 
kind of upholstery, electronic gadget and decor. 
</P>
<P>
There is a range of special features for politicians and corporate executives 
worried about security. 
</P>
<P>
A company called Executive Armoring offers bullet-proof limousines that can 
repel pursuers, in the style of James Bond, with oil slicks and smoke screens. 
The company says it has developed a high-voltage electrical system that can 
send a shock through the body of any intruder trying to open its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Ultra Limousine, of La Palma, has attracted wide publicity in recent years by 
making itself the company that leads the way in the creation of the wildest 
limousines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
92-Foot Limo Seats 35 
</P>
<P>
Ultra, which has sold limousines to Clint Eastwood, Frank Sinatra and Liberace, 
has built cars with jet engines. For an executive desperate to keep in touch 
with the outside world, Ultra built one that held a computer terminal and eight 
phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the company built a 92-foot, $3-million limousine that seated 35 and 
came equipped with a small swimming pool, a Jacuzzi and a 20-foot putting 
green. Now the company's at work on a $5-million, 150-foot model that will have 
a suntan parlor, a sushi bar and a small bowling alley. 
</P>

For Walt Disney Co., Ultra built a $1-million, 41-foot "liMOUSEine" designed to 
carry Mickey Mouse on a promotional tour. Disney claims that the car is the 
longest fixed-frame automobile that can be legally driven on the public roads.

SAN CLEMENTE WANTS ACTION ON CHECKPOINT MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Clemente city officials, tired of seeing U.S. Border Patrol chases end in 
bloody accidents on their streets, are angry over Congress's delay in funding a 
long-proposed relocation of the immigration checkpoint just four miles south of 
the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a time bomb," San Clemente Mayor Brian J. Rice said. "One day the 
chases will result in some innocent adults or children being killed on the 
streets of our city." 
</P>
<P>
City officials' longstanding concerns about the checkpoint were reinforced last 
month when 10 people were injured after they jumped from a van that Border 
Patrol agents were chasing on Interstate 5 in San Clemente. The chase began 
when the van's driver sped off while being questioned at the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The move five miles farther south into San Diego County was first proposed 
three years ago by the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, which 
runs the checkpoint near the San Onofre nuclear power plant. The new checkpoint 
would be expanded from four lanes to 16, both to facilitate traffic on 
northbound Interstate 5 and to reduce opportunities for illegal immigrants to 
evade arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has the backing of Sen. Pete Wilson (R-San Diego) and Rep. Ron 
Packard (R-Carlsbad). The Defense Department, which owns the Camp Pendleton 
Marine Corps base, the site of both the present and proposed checkpoints, also 
approves of the change, according to Packard's office. But action has lagged in 
Congress, mainly because of the $30-million cost of the project, Packard said 
in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get money authorized because of the tight-budget situations," 
Packard said. But the cost is justified, Packard said, because the new 
checkpoint might save lives as well as aid the government's efforts to stop 
illegal immigration and illicit drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 10 people died last year in accidents at the checkpoint, city 
officials said. San Clemente Fire Department paramedics, who respond to such 
accidents, said the victims usually are illegal immigrants who jump from 
vehicles stopped at the checkpoint and are struck as they dart into southbound 
traffic on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Geer, patrol agent in charge of the checkpoint, said that he had no 
exact statistics on fatal accidents at the site but that "about eight to 10" 
people have been killed in the last year while running on foot into oncoming 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Geer said the proposed new checkpoint would be safer for all concerned, 
including motorists, who sometimes fail to slow down in time at the existing 
checkpoint and slam into the line of stopped vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be a minimum traffic backup," Geer said, referring to the 
multilane design of the proposed new checkpoint. And Geer said the chances for 
high-speed chases running into San Clemente would be reduced at the new 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a new checkpoint would help our situation," San Clemente Police Chief 
Albert C. Ehlow said. "The configuration (for the proposed checkpoint) makes it 
more difficult for a high-speed chase to begin. Then, too, if a chase were to 
start, the new checkpoint would be five miles further south from San Clemente, 
giving them more time to head off the suspects before they got to our city. 
We've had problems with those chases for many years." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Fire Chief Thomas F. Dailey said the city is under contract with 
San Diego County to provide emergency medical services at accidents in the San 
Onofre area, including the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible when some of the people get killed there trying to run away 
across the freeway (and into oncoming traffic)," Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he has pushed the safety angle in trying to drum up congressional 
support for a new checkpoint. At one time, Packard said, the relocation 
proposal seemed to have broad support in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"But now it seems to be in limbo," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Packard and Wilson succeeded in getting $2.7 million earmarked for 
engineering and design studies. But at the last minute, a congressional 
conference committee deleted the designation, and money was spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're back to square zero," Packard said. "Sen. Wilson and I are now 
hoping we can get the funding for the checkpoint inserted into one of the 
anti-drug bills. If not, I'll try to get the funding into a highway 
appropriation bill." 
</P>
<P>
Packard said the need for the new checkpoint is urgent. 
</P>
<P>
"We are well aware of San Clemente's long desire to halt the high-speed chases 
from coming into there, and we believe this is the way of preventing those 
situations," Packard said. "We also think a new checkpoint would be much more 
effective in drug interdiction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Busiest in Nation 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint near San Clemente is the busiest in the nation, according to the 
INS. In 1988, agents there captured 54,678 deportable illegal immigrants and 
arrested another 800 who were involved in smuggling operations, according to 
Packard's office. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint also recovered stolen property -- including cars and items 
burglarized from homes -- totaling more than $2 million in value last year. A 
total of 128 narcotics seizures were made, netting drugs with a total street 
value of $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint was designed primarily to intercept illegal immigrants. But as 
the flow of illegal drugs has increased, the station increasingly has become a 
focal point in the nation's war on illicit narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he stresses the anti-drug theme in pushing for congressional 
approval of funding for a new checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"We, of course, know how important it is to stop the high-speed chases into San 
Clemente," Packard said. "But my colleagues in Congress are more likely to be 
swayed by how important this new checkpoint is in intercepting drugs."

DESPITE CRACKDOWN WARNING, FULLERTON POLICE PACK JAIL WITH SUSPECTED DRUNK 
DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ROBBINS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The warning signs were posted in Fullerton bars and liquor stores all week. 
Police passed out flyers, got stories published in a local newspaper and got 
the word out on cable TV: They would be out in force Saturday night, cracking 
down on drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of publicity, you would have expected Fullerton streets to be 
empty of anything but teetotalers that night. 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance. By night's end, police had filled their city jail with 15 
suspected drunk drivers and six more who were arrested for allegedly being 
drunk while in a car. 
</P>
<P>
To Fullerton Police Lt. Bud Lathrop, those figures add up to more of a 
communications failure than an enforcement success. The last time the 
department had a drunk-driving crackdown, there was no advance publicity -- and 
officers made just 12 arrests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The program failed miserably," Lathrop said. "I guess nobody got the word." 
</P>
<P>
The first suspected drunk driver, a well-dressed man who appeared to be in his 
late 40s, was brought into the Fullerton police station on Commonwealth Avenue 
at 8:45 p.m. Police said his car had been straddling the center line. 
</P>
<P>
The man was questioned and asked to empty his pockets, one of which contained 
$2,900. He was then given a choice between a blood test, a urine test and a 
breath test to determine his blood alcohol level, with .10% being too drunk to 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
He chose the blood test. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer that they take a blood or urine test," Lathrop said, explaining that 
with a breath test, there is no hard evidence left over -- other than a police 
report -- to prove the suspect's innocence or guilt at trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1,600 fine 
</P>
<P>
The man was then fingerprinted and escorted to a padded cell in the city jail 
where he could sleep. He was to be released -- when judged sober by police -- 
with a citation for $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Roger White, who ferried suspected drunk drivers from the streets back to 
the station all night, said they generally do not have much trouble with drunks 
resisting the processing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you treat them with respect, usually they respect you," White said, "but if 
you treat them badly, then they react badly." 
</P>
<P>
About 10:30 p.m., White rolled onto the scene of a drunk-driving arrest near 
Brookhurst Road and Commonwealth Avenue. The man being questioned said he had 
come from a wedding reception and was looking for the Riverside Freeway but had 
driven right under it on Brookhurst and was heading straight into the Beatrice 
Foods plant past Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Don Kendrick asked the man, who appeared to be in his late 30s, how 
much he had to drink that night. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 1/2 six-packs, the man answered. Fifteen beers. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you questioning me? You're just going to take me in anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick asked the man to perform several balancing tests. When he had to close 
his eyes, he almost fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to walk heel to toe in a straight line eight steps that way, then 
10 steps back," Kendrick said. The suspect proceeded to walk 12 weaving steps 
each way. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked you to take eight steps that way, then 10 steps back," Kendrick said. 
"How many did you take?" 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve," the man responded. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick gave him a second chance. Again, he walked 12 steps each way. 
</P>
<P>
As he was being led to Sgt. White's car for the trip to the city jail, the man 
said, "I'm not so (fouled) up I can't stop at the red lights. Oh well, this 
ain't the first time." He had been arrested for drunk driving in 1985, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By 10:51, Fullerton police had arrested five drunk drivers, and the next couple 
of hours were busy. 
</P>
<P>
A lull set in about about 12:30 a.m. and lasted until a couple in their early 
20s were pulled over about 1:30 a.m. They were fighting in the parking lot of a 
bar when they saw the officers and drove off in a Mercedes, Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
After officers pulled the couple over, the woman began screaming something 
about not letting "them" take her baby. She later told police that she has a 
baby in the intensive care ward of a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She was also pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
White took the couple back to the jail at 1:41 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the once-quiet jail had become a writhing mass of bodies. There were 
drunks in every nook and cranny. Suspects were getting their blood taken. The 
pregnant woman was screaming that she should get one phone call and was 
slamming her fists on the glass window of the jailer's office. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was in tears because she did not want to go back with "the crazies" 
in the women's holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
All the traffic officers came in for the night about 2 a.m., White said, so 
they could begin their paper work. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't do any more good," White said. The station was already packed to 
capacity.

SHOOTING VICTIM HAD BEEN READY FOR NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After two decades of being an absentee father, Ronald Look was eager to be 
permanently reunited with his son Darren, who recently visited him in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
But first the 21-year-old Darren had to return to his mother's Anaheim home to 
gather up his belongings and clear up some outstanding traffic tickets, Ronald 
Look recalled Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Before Darren could do all that, tragedy struck. Darren Look was shot and 
killed Saturday at his mother's home by her ex-boyfriend, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to get out of this particular area," Ronald Look said of his son. 
"It just wasn't a good scene." 
</P>
<P>
Look, who had been divorced from Darren's mother, Barbara Badgett, for 21 
years, was among several relatives and friends who gathered at the Badgett home 
Sunday to console the family in the wake of the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Look had been in a bedroom at his mother's home at 1337 Aetna St. at 
about 10:30 a.m. on Saturday when her ex-boyfriend, George Burnside, 31, came 
to the house, angry and threatening to kill the seven people inside, according 
to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Badgett had tried to break off her relationship with Burnside, but "he 
wouldn't take no for an answer," family friend Don Carter said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Burnside "busted in" the house and followed Barbara to her bedroom, Ronald Look 
said. Darren Look "ran in the room, turned and bam!" -- was shot, the youth's 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Badgett and others inside the house fled Saturday, but Burnside 
remained inside holding the woman's 67 year-old mother, Jean Badgett, hostage 
for more than five hours before he finally surrendered to police, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Look, an electronics installation manager, arrived in Orange County at 
noon Sunday from Seattle, where he has lived for years since his divorce from 
Barbara. The couple's oldest son, Craig, had joined his father in the Seattle 
area several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brother Got News 
</P>
<P>
It was Craig who received a telephone call Saturday evening telling him that 
his brother had been killed, Ronald Look said. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought that maybe a couple of his friends were pulling a joke on him," 
Ronald Look said. "He called me. 
</P>
<P>
"You are never prepared for something like this," Ronald Look said. 
"Everybody's in deep shock." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Saturday was not the first time Burnside had wielded a weapon in 
arguments with Barbara Badgett. 
</P>
<P>
"He stuck a BB gun in his mouth and said he was going to blow his brains out," 
Carter recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Barbara Badgett knew little of Burnside's background after meeting 
him through mutual friends about eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a mile to the south, residents in the 2200 block of Colchester Drive 
in Anaheim were shocked to learn Sunday that their neighbor had been arrested 
for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Neighbor 
</P>
<P>
Several neighbors, who asked that their names be withheld, described Burnside 
as a quiet man who kept to himself, sold perfume at swap meets and lived in a 
modest one-room apartment with his mother. Burnside did odd jobs but appeared 
to have no permanent employment, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
No one answered the door at the Burnsides' apartment Sunday, but neighbors said 
police had visited Burnside's mother at the residence Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the quiet type," one neighbor said. "You never can tell when they are 
going to snap." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday some neighbors said they were not shocked at the shooting because 
police had been called to the Badgett home several times to quell fights 
between Badgett and Burnside. Although some neighbors said they also had called 
police because they believed that drugs were used at the home, a Police 
Department spokesman said Sunday that he was unaware of any police activity at 
the residence other than for the domestic disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Belknap, 21, a next-door-neighbor who attended Savanna High School with 
Darren Look, said he has never seen drugs used at the Badgett home. Some 
neighbors, Belknap said, may have stereotyped the family because of large 
crowds of young people who often gather at the residence.

PEOPLE: PASSION FOR HELPING PEOPLE PROMPTS CRIME-AWARENESS LIFE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Sener has a passion for helping people, but when the one-time Michigan 
State University retail merchandising major went looking for a job, she hardly 
expected that it would be helping residents avoid becoming victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I have a passion for people, period," said Sener, a San Clemente 
Community Services Officer who works in that city's Neighborhood Watch Program. 
</P>
<P>
"You become connected with the people, and it's like a friend getting violated 
when they are victims of a crime," said Sener, the mother of three sons. 
"Sometimes you get a real empty feeling." 
</P>
<P>
"You give residents support and tell them you have sympathy for what happened," 
added Sener, who spends much of her time trying to convince people that it's 
much better to take steps to prevent crime than to listen to her sympathize. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to learn to lock their doors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the neighborhood watch, Sener conducts a series of classes including 
drug awareness for children, bicycle safety, baby-sitting, consumer fraud and a 
class to prevent drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
"I like grass-roots folks. You get to see the results of your effort," she 
said. "I can identify with these people." 
</P>
<P>
Sener moved to California from Michigan to escape the cold and began working 
for the Police Department as a records clerk. Before that, she helped students 
overcome learning disabilities. Now her concern is helping senior citizens 
protect themselves against criminals, especially con artists. 
</P>
<P>
She stresses that awareness is the key to a more crime-free community and that 
apathy is the biggest enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't want to take the time sometimes can end up being the 
victims," she said. "It all comes back into the structure of the neighborhood 
watch. It is the best thing going." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the successes in the neighborhood watch, "you have to keep prodding so 
the program stays structured," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, her drive to develop ways to help local residents protect 
themselves got her involved in the 15-year-old California Crime Prevention 
Officers Assn. This year she was elected its president. 
</P>
<P>
She is the first female and nonsworn officer to hold the post, and last month 
she chaired the group's quarterly training session in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Although she plans to continue her work in San Clemente, Sener said her 
knowledge "can move you in a lot of different directions either in government 
or private concerns to maintain security. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me a sense of satisfaction knowing I've helped to make a better life 
for people in this community," she said. "I guess I will always stay in this 
kind of work in some area." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Leslie Smith thought she wanted a career that was different from the 
norm, so she became a barber in a one-chair shop in Newport Beach, directly 
across the street from the Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unique then for a woman to be a barber," said the one-time Cal State 
Dominguez student, who charges $23 for a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's worth it," she said. "I give a good cut." 
</P>
<P>
And she talks. "I think too much," she said. "I never shut up." 
</P>
<P>
Customers are entertained by her unusual shop, which looks more like a museum. 
It includes a moose head, a tuba hanging from the ceiling and an old ice bow 
where she keeps her towels. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 38, said customers want to know if she plans to hang any of the 
artifacts at a new shop she is opening about a mile away, which she will call 
World Famous Leslie's Headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they kidding? I don't want any of this junk in my new shop," said the 
Newport Beach resident. "I need a complete change." 
</P>
<P>
Her grand opening is scheduled Nov. 14 -- which happens to be her birthday.

Running back Greg Bell, who suffered a slight hamstring pull when he made a cut 
during a 29-yard romp in the second quarter Sunday, said he thought he would be 
ready for his return to Buffalo next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very minor strain," he said. "I felt it pull, but I stayed in for a 
couple of plays. I couldn't push off it too well, though, so we decided to play 
it safe." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who played 3 1/2 seasons with the Bills before coming to the Rams in the 
deal that sent Eric Dickerson to Indianapolis, said it would be "special" going 
back to Buffalo. Especially if he returns as the top rusher in the National 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason I came out (of Sunday's game) is because I want to be 
healthy for Monday night," he said. "And this is the type of (injury) where you 
could miss three or four weeks if you're not careful." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who spent much of his final season with the Bills in the doghouse, plans 
on showing the Buffalo faithful that he's now the top dog. 
</P>
<P>
An interception by LeRoy Irvin, playing in his second game after a 30-day 
suspension for substance abuse, probably kept the Falcons from grabbing a 14-10 
lead late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On first down at the Ram 32-yard line, Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller threw a 
pass over the middle intended for Shawn Collins. Irvin left the man he was 
covering, sprinted in front of Collins and snatched the ball at the 10-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a chance," Irvin said. "(Miller) was trying too hard to look me off, so 
I broke over in front of Collins. If I hadn't gotten there, they would have had 
a TD." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin admitted that he took some chances later in the game that didn't pay off, 
and he got burned more than once. But he wasn't alone. Miller completed a 
personal-high 28 passes for a personal-best 340 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's assessment of his best day as a pro: 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't too bad as far as numbers go, but you want good results with good 
numbers. I think we used just about every pass play we have. All I did was get 
the ball off and watch 'em fly." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because they all wear helmets, but the Rams and the Falcons had a 
different view of what the Rams were doing with their ears Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Miller: "When you throw the ball this much, they just pin their ears 
back and come after you." 
</P>
<P>
Ram linebacker Kevin Greene: "They're throwing a lot on us but you can't start 
laying your ears back and going after the quarterback because they'll just run 
a draw and gain 50 yards." 
</P>
<P>
So which is it? Do the ears have it? 
</P>
<P>
Rookie tailback Cleveland Gary says he is learning more about the Ram offense 
every day, but admits he still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to put a lot of pressure on myself," he said. "It takes time." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he's going to sit back and enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to be undefeated," he said. "There's nothing in this world like 
walking off a football field after you've won a game." 
</P>
<P>
So, as other-worldly experiences go, the Rams are five for five. 
</P>
<P>
Ram punter Dale Hatcher was reduced to a cameo appearance Sunday and he didn't 
mind a bit. One game, one punt and no heavy lifting, either. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad work if you can get it. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happens when your offense scores on nearly every possession. The 
Rams scored on six of their 10 drives, with one ended by an interception and 
two more by the clock -- at the end of the first half and end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Hatcher's only kick traveled 40 yards. And as best as he could 
remember, it was his first one-punt Ram game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just watching the game like everyone else," he said. "Maybe the next 
time I'll get a bag of peanuts and watch." 
</P>

DELPINO OUT TO WIN RESPECT, PLAY MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Robert Delpino the most overlooked back in the Rams' running attack? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe this remark made by Coach John Robinson after Sunday's 26-14 
victory over Atlanta will shed a little light on that question: 
</P>
<P>
"If (Greg) Bell hadn't pulled his hamstring (in the first half), we probably 
would have run the ball more. But both Cleveland Gary and Gaston Green have a 
limited repertoire and it cuts down on what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Delpino was not among the throng that had crowded into the interview room next 
to the Rams' locker room, but no one would have blamed him if he had burst 
through the door and screamed, "Hey Coach, what about me?" 
</P>
<P>
Later in his postgame analysis, Robinson did note that "Bobby Delpino did an 
outstanding job," but that doesn't change that fact that Delpino can relate to 
all of Rodney Dangerfield's shtick and at least one Aretha Franklin song. 
</P>
<P>
After all, all he wants is a little respect . . . and some playing time. 
</P>
<P>
After Bell went out midway through the second quarter, Green, Gary and Delpino 
shared the tailback duties. Green carried the ball nine times and gained 36 
yards. Gary had seven chances and picked up 25 yards. He also had one reception 
for five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino had 48 yards in four carries. He also had one catch, a forgettable 
little routine, one-handed stab for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had a 10-7 lead and the ball on the Falcon seven-yard line when 
quarterback Jim Everett rolled right, out of the pocket. He tucked the ball 
away as if he was going to run and then pulled back abruptly, lofting a pass 
over Delpino's head. Delpino leaped above Atlanta linebacker Aundray Bruce, 
snagged the ball with his right hand and managed to pull it in as he hit the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Aundray had it covered pretty good," Delpino said, "and I thought Jim was 
gonna run, so I started to block. Then I saw him stop, so I just floated back 
behind Aundray and watched it in and cupped it. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good. Really good. But for me, it's just exciting to get in the game. 
Playing time. That's everything for me. That's all I want." 
</P>
<P>
In the Rams' media guide, Delpino is described as "one of the most versatile 
players on the roster," but so far, he's getting precious few chances to show 
it. Sunday's performance pushed his season statistics to the point where he's 
almost averaging two carries per game. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino understands the situation. The Rams have two young No. 1 picks -- both 
of whom made more than $1 million (including signing bonuses) in their first 
year -- waiting on the sidelines to earn their pay. 
</P>
<P>
It's a numbers game in which dollars don't always make sense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to like it, but it's reality," he said. "They're both No. 1s and 
I'm a No. 5. I can't say that I don't sometimes think about how much money 
they're making, but we're all good friends and that's just the way things are. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both great players and I guess I'll just have to wait my turn. It's 
the story of my life. I'll just have to prove myself again and again and 
again." 
</P>
<P>
At least Robinson and Co. don't have to worry about Delpino pouting. He's too 
busy taking pride in his job. Seconds after making the touchdown grab, for 
instance, Delpino sprinted the length of the field as a member of the kickoff 
coverage team and corraled Falcon kick return ace Deion Sanders after a 
nine-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Delpino what he did best Sunday and he responds: "I think I finally came to 
life on the special teams." 
</P>
<P>
The flashy Sanders is known as "Neon." Delpino could go by "Lantern." You won't 
be blinded by the light, but he's certainly dependable. 
</P>
<P>
With Bell rolling up record yardage every other weekend, Delpino knows that 
it's hard to get noticed. But he's smart enough to have figured out that 
expecting to go 99 yards every time you touch the ball is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to put that kind of pressure on myself, but somewhere deeply 
embedded in myself is the desire to make something happen," he said. "You only 
get so many chances and you have to make the most of them." 
</P>
<P>
So, in the meantime, Delpino will take his knocks on the special teams and wait 
for his opportunities.

JANIE EICKHOFF LIKES SETTING ALL OF HER WHEELS SPINNING; 
</P>
<P>
ALREADY A WORLD-CLASS CYCLIST, THE LOS ALAMITOS ATHLETE TAKES HER SKILL AND 
VERSATILITY TO THE ICE FOR SPEED SKATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janie Eickhoff is a 5-foot-2 college freshman who has legs to put you in mind 
of Bo Jackson, and a repertoire of accomplishments to match. 
</P>
<P>
Janie knows cycling. She became a track cyclist five years ago, after a knee 
injury ended the soccer career she had begun by making the Los Alamitos High 
School varsity as a freshman. After a year as a competitive cyclist, she was a 
junior national champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't decide I liked it until the junior nationals in '85," Eickhoff said. 
"I was convinced then that this was what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Eickhoff has climbed the ladder -- junior world championships, 
first-place finishes in senior national championship events. Since August, she 
has been on a remarkable run, setting an unofficial world kilometer record at 
the national championships and taking a bronze medal in the points race at the 
world championships at Lyon, France. This weekend, she won medals in six of her 
seven events at the NEC World Cycling Invitational in the Olympic Velodrome at 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. The United States won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Janie also knows speed skating. She took up the sport about three years ago 
after hearing other cyclists talk about it as they trained at velodromes. 
Others, such as Bonnie Blair and Connie Young, had begun their careers as 
skaters. Eickhoff saw it as a way to complement her riding, a training regimen 
that would enhance her leg strength and give her a break from the bike. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she won the national senior women's short-track speed skating 
championship at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
And watch out, Janie might get to know cross-country skiing this winter. 
</P>
<P>
What Eickhoff can't do is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, she is at an age at which most people begin to discover that life's 
opportunity is not so boundless after all. 
</P>
<P>
But Eickhoff's opportunities just keep expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Off the track and the ice, Eickhoff is an unassuming, appealing young woman who 
occasionally worries that if she doesn't build her upper body she'll "look like 
a dinosaur," -- tiny little arms at the top of sturdy frame. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the track or the ice, she is a competitor so tough that she once came 
back to race less than an hour after falling to the ice in a false start, 
splitting her chin open, requiring stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Off in the future, the Olympics wait. Eickhoff would like to make it as a 
cyclist, and is considered one of the top U.S. prospects for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Making the Olympics in speed skating would be considerably tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff's legs intimidate even the top skaters -- her coach, Barth Levy, says 
she is probably the strongest skater at almost every competition. But after 
only three years as a competitive skater, her technique is still raw. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm competing against other people who seem like their second pair of shoes 
was a pair of ice skates," Eickhoff said. "It's frustrating. You train so hard, 
but they're more effective and can be just as fast." 
</P>
<P>
Her success at the world cycling championships has Eickhoff considering whether 
she should focus solely on cycling. Besides the bronze medal she won in the 
points race, Eickhoff finished sixth in the match sprint, the classic track 
race that sets riders against each other in a tedious cat-and-mouse game 
followed by an all-out sprint to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Her coaches -- Levy and cycling coach Pat McDonough, both of whom she spends 
hours with on the phone getting long-distance training advice -- would each 
like to see her focus on one sport. If it had to be one, cycling would win. 
</P>
<P>
But with the start of staggered Olympic Games in 1994 -- winter and summer 
games will no longer be held the same year -- it will become more feasible for 
an athlete to train in two sports. The temptation will be there. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling experts marvel at what Eickhoff has been able to do with so little 
training and at such a young age. Eickhoff herself can't offer a satisfying 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tried really hard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Trying hard makes high-school champions, not world-class cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"In cycling, I can't believe it, really," Eickhoff said. "I'm still not sure 
how far I can go. Maybe I'll go a few more years and see where I get to." 
</P>
<P>
The training is hard, and a little lonely. Eickhoff lived in Pennsylvania to 
train with McDonough this summer, and last year lived in Cleveland to train 
with Levy. 
</P>
<P>
But these days she is living at home in Los Alamitos and the routine is built 
around fall semester classes at Cal State Dominguez Hills, jogging distance 
from the Olympic Velodrome where Eickhoff works out twice a week. She trains 
for speed skating at Iceland skating rink in Paramount, and runs and cycles 
more on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, George Eickhoff, accompanies her to the velodrome, changing wheels 
and timing her laps and sprints. But for coaching, Eickhoff relies on 
long-distance phone calls to McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
It was Eickhoff's father, "the hobby-aholic," Janie calls him, who encouraged 
her to try cycling after the soccer injury. Her father and brother, Rick, have 
both been on the U.S. pistol shooting team, and George also has raced cars. He 
took Jane to the velodrome to see if it would interest her. It did. 
</P>
<P>
And by the way, Janie knows pistol shooting, too. Her father says she was a 
natural. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff's success in cycling and speed skating is because of her versatility. 
She's also a sprinter who also has endurance and cunning. 
</P>
<P>
She does well in cycling events whose demands, according to one cycling 
promoter, are as varied as those of the 100 meters and the mile in track. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff delights in the strategy of racing, of outsmarting and then 
outsprinting opponents on the banked slopes of a velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
"You might not be the fastest, but if you can get across the line first by 
drafting or suckering someone into doing something, you can win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the match sprint, Eickhoff says, the more experience, the better. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most important thing, to have a bigger bag of tricks." 
</P>
<P>
In the kilometer, tricks are not the issue. The race is an all-out, three-lap 
sprint considered by some to be the toughest event in cycling -- and worthy of 
the nickname "killer-meter." 
</P>
<P>
At the national championships in August at Redmond, Wash., Eickhoff finished 
first in the kilometer with a time of 1:13.81, .425 seconds faster than the 
world record held by Soviet Erika Salumiae. But the event wasn't 
internationally sanctioned, so the time was unofficial. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff's versatility helps her succeed in competitions, but it makes for a 
lot of luggage. 
</P>
<P>
Both she and her father drive vans equipped with racks, filled with all variety 
of wheels and frames. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I like skating," Eickhoff said. "You can fit everything into one 
bag. You don't have to carry suitcases and suitcases around. Maybe I should 
have gone into something like running. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that would have been much too simple."

A YOUNG PRO WHO KNOWS HIS TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too much performance art falls short as performance craft. That was not a 
problem with Robert Longo's "Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes," performed 
over the weekend at Royce Hall, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Like his paintings and 3-D triptychs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 
Longo's stage pieces have the certainty of composition that one associates with 
commercial art. The viewer knows where he is supposed to look, and the artist 
knows how much information he wants to give out. Every image is clearly framed 
and nothing goes on too long. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Bang! Pow! or Zowie! about "Dream Jumbo." Longo saves that for his 
rock videos, also on view at the museum. The flow of images and music was so 
smooth at Royce Hall that it wasn't always clear where one piece had ended 
(five were seen) and another had begun. 
</P>
<P>
Soothing is not quite the word. But if this is a "disturbing" artist, a word 
that seems to be in vogue about Longo, the disturbance is conceptual and after 
the fact. In the moment, we are in the hands, if not of a master, of a young 
pro who knows the technology. 
</P>
<P>
His tableaux might remind us of Robert Wilson's. (The man on stilts in the last 
tableau specifically reminds us of Robert Wilson.) But the attitude toward time 
is different. Longo doesn't try to slow down our heartbeat, to take us to the 
gate of boredom, beyond which lie the fields of contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
Not too much happened in these pieces, but enough happened. Sometimes there was 
even a little story, such as the vignette about the big bald head on the screen 
trying to reconnect with its body, which had somehow got loose into the real 
world and was running around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Once reconnected, the little body (Sean Curran) read Puck's curtain speech from 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream," the one where Puck asks the audience to "give me 
your hands." Two hands on the screen then dealt him a mosquito's fate. A Tom 
&amp; Jerry gag that got a nice laugh, and also made a nice little point about 
the clout of the screen image these days. 
</P>
<P>
One gathers that this is a major theme with Longo -- the way we are manipulated 
by images streaming from the skyscrapers of power and privilege. It is odd to 
see AT&amp;T sponsoring such a subversive artist, but this may be because the 
subversion is so subtle that it's quite easy to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
The "Marble Fog" sequence, for instance, did a lot with the screen image of the 
skyscraper. But it was presented with such appreciation for the mass and line 
of the buildings being seen that the sequence could be interpreted as a 
celebration of the skyscraper, the cathedral of the 20th Century. Rather than 
being oppressed by these images, your reviewer found them quite as handsome as 
those of the fields of flowers seen just before. This is not an art that is 
going to change the man in the street's opinion of the culture he lives in -- 
of Johnny Carson as the ultimate talking head, for instance. Longo's art is too 
much of a piece with the visual codes of that culture for anyone but an expert 
to make out the difference. 
</P>
<P>
But it is well done. "Matrix Mutants," for example, was a fetching sci-fi 
diorama set on a nameless planet inhabited by wiggly, squiggly silhouettes. 
This was not exactly a Beckett landscape, but there are more ways than one of 
conceiving apocalypse. Perhaps we will all turn into Toys by Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Room" was a beautiful, formal dance piece for Bill T. Jones, working 
before a huge swatched red curtain that kept moving in an ocean-like manner, 
bellied out by air from backstage. What it meant was up to you, and it didn't 
have to mean anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
Another pleasing piece was the opener, "Sound Distance of a Good Man." This 
had, from left to right: (A) two shirtless men in a slow-motion wrestling 
contest (Jones and Robert Allen); (B) a big black-and-white photograph of a man 
looking up into the sun, while a stone lion in the background looked the other 
way; (C) a soprano in an evening gown (Peggy Atkinson) singing an aria with 
much emphasis on the word "Ave." 
</P>
<P>
A beautiful, living triptych, each frame interesting in itself, and pleasingly 
contrasted against the other frames. Two struggling males (struggling to gain 
knowledge of each other, you felt, like D. H. Lawrence figures) versus a female 
serenely singing the praises of someone else. 
</P>
<P>
The mind could easily play with that for 16 minutes, or could wonder about the 
stone lion, or could simply enjoy the spectacle. I don't know how deep Longo 
goes as an artist (the closer he comes to having a message, the more it turns 
out to be a message you've already heard), but he knows how to space figures on 
a stage.

SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY OPENS 6TH SEASON WITH RUSSIAN MUSIC AND GRATITUDE GALORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An aura of determination and optimism permeated the first concert of the South 
Coast Symphony's sixth season Saturday night. With subscriptions reportedly up 
32% over last year, and with J.C. Penney picking up the tab for the evening, 
there were expressions of gratitude galore at Robert B. Moore Theatre on the 
campus of Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
First, radio personality John Santana saluted the audience for supporting arts 
in Orange County. Then founding president of the orchestra, Peter Staudhammer, 
and Richard J. Burrell presented the symphony's 1989 Man of the Year award to 
managing director Albert Wong for "re-energizing the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra did seem to have been re-energized, and not just financially, 
though it remains -- with roughly 60% professional personnel and four 
preparatory rehearsals for each concert -- a community orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Still -- despite some ragged entrances, particularly among the woodwinds in 
Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" Fantasy-Overture, and in spite of 
inconsistencies in balance -- conductor Larry Granger led his group with a 
sense of purpose in this Russian program. 
</P>
<P>
Soloist John Walz's aggressive and soul-searching First Cello Concerto of 
Shostakovich formed the focal point of the evening. Though Walz appeared 
markedly uncomfortable in the warm hall, frequently mopping both brow and 
instrument, he drew every mournful drop from each note of the second movement 
and its corollary cadenza and attacked the outer movements with sure skill. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while the orchestra members partnered admirably, the results were less 
rousing than efforts merited, thwarted by a sound-absorbing auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was there inordinate excitement in the Second Symphony of Aleksandr 
Borodin, though ominously biting lower brass choirs spoke pointedly. Only 
distinguished solo passages -- exemplified by Linda De-Roche-Duffin's subdued 
and confident horn solo in the Andante, which was given graceful echo by Steve 
Roberts on clarinet -- interrupted an otherwise competent and predictable 
reading.

BALLET HISPANICO OF N.Y. REMAINS AT ITS BEST AT ITS MOST SHOCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ballet Hispanico of New York was forged in a milieu of deprivation and 
passionate commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Ramirez created the group in 1970 to provide opportunities for young 
Latino dancers who longed -- but had little chance -- to make it in what was 
then a closed professional world. 
</P>
<P>
So it is always a celebration when this 12-member troupe appears, even when not 
all the works show the dancers to their best advantage, as happened on a 
three-part program Friday at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Blame the choreographer in the case of Vincente Nebrada's "Group Portrait of a 
Lady," a vague retrospective look into a woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
To Alberto Ginastera's moody, mercurial "Variaciones Concertantes," a central 
woman, Justine DiCostanzo, animates the other dancers, then joins or observes 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Two pas de deux portray earlier relationships. One, danced by Merceditas Manago 
and Eduardo Vilaro, is brutal and brutish; the other, with Mercedes Gudino and 
Pedro Ruiz, is lyric and consoling. 
</P>
<P>
After some fleeting, unclear episodes, the brute returns humbled. The lady 
absolves him, brings him into her circle. The dance ends with her exaltation. 
</P>
<P>
Do we care? Not much. The choreographer fails to illuminate the woman's 
character, the other people or the situations in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Talley Beatty's romp, "Recuerdo de Campo Amor," on the other hand, seeks 
nothing so ambitious. Set to Latin jazz by Felipe Campuzano, R. Pachon and Tito 
Puente, the work apparently means to evoke a popular New York dance hall in the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
But the choreography is refined virtually out of all period and remains 
stylized and impersonal. The company swirls on and off the stage. A central 
couple, Nancy Turano and Jose Costas, appear to have a spat. Over what? Who 
knows? The two quickly, easily reconcile. The beat goes on. 
</P>
<P>
But not too long: The dance comes to an abrupt, premature -- and, as it turns 
out, deceptive -- end. Costas then voices an invitation for everyone to rumba, 
and the dancers make a series of grand (and finally) individualized entrances. 
</P>
<P>
These curtain calls turn out to have more interesting choreography than the 
dance itself. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty's tricks mount up in a giddy, aimless way until the choreographer runs 
out of ideas, meanwhile putting his dancers at some physical risk. Then they 
take several final stop-action, chorus-line poses, and the audience goes wild. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad the dance ignores the company's real talent -- talent nowhere so 
evident as in Graciela Daniele's "Cada Noche . . . Tango" (music by Astor 
Piazzola), first seen in Orange County in April. 
</P>
<P>
On second viewing, it remains an electrifying, disturbing, complex work, and 
the company is simply fabulous in it. 
</P>
<P>
A dance-drama set in a Buenos Aires brothel, the work depicts the men's macho 
contempt and control of the women and the women's willing subservience and 
quiet mediation of the men's power. 
</P>
<P>
This master-slave dynamic is most vividly sketched as Costas brutalizes the 
newcomer (Turano), like a trainer breaking in an animal. The event is shocking, 
and is meant to be shocking. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, then, that this time around the company management gave in to the 
temptation to simplify the ambiguities rather than let them multiply. The 
program now identifies specific roles for the dancers -- the Madam, the 
Outsider and (least likely of all) the Brothers (Costas and Pedro Ruiz). 
</P>
<P>
Well, the program may say that they are brothers, but the movement does not. 
The ambiguity of their sexual pursuit -- evident when their hands touch on the 
woman's bare back -- is only part of the work's complexity, so brilliantly 
realized by Ballet Hispanico.

Baritone Donald Christensen, a resident of Riverside, took first place Saturday 
at the Orange County District preliminaries for the Metropolitan Opera National 
Council Western Regional Auditions. Christensen, 30, won from a field of 10

Rossini's "Il Barbiere di Siviglia." 
</P>
<P>
Second Place went to Soprano Anne-Marie Boche, 30, from Long Beach, who sang 
arias from Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Bizet's "Carmen." Bass Mel Whitehead, 
31, from Anaheim, won third place with arias by Mozart and Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
The three prize winners will go on to compete in the Western Regional Auditions 
on Nov. 3 in Los Angeles.

A Mexican trapeze artist today was the first victim of a massive security 
operation at the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool after his van was 
blown up by British troops. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Rodogel, late for his act at a circus Sunday night, left the 
Dutch-licensed van in a no-parking zone just yards from the site of the party's 
annual meeting in this northern English seaside resort. Minutes later police 
sealed off roads and called in army bomb disposal experts to carry out a 
"controlled explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Security has been very tight at Conservative Party conferences since their 1984 
meeting when a bomb planted by Irish republican guerrillas almost killed Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher.

METROMEDIA'S KLUGE RICHEST IN U.S. 
</P>

<P>
Metromedia Co. founder John Werner Kluge topped Fortune magazine's list of the 
400 richest people in America today, unseating Sam Walton who held the honor 
for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Wal-Mart Stores fortune was divided this year among Walton and his four 
children, sending each of them, with $1.8 billion each, to share the No. 17 
spot on the magazine's annual list. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, who placed second in 1988, has an estimated net worth of more than $5.2 
billion, adding about $2 billion to last year's coffers with lucrative sales of 
cellular phone licenses, Forbes said. The Charlottesville, Va., and New York 
City resident also launched a computerized billboard painting company and holds 
a majority stake in Orion Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Earning second place this year was investor Warren Edward Buffett, of Omaha, 
Neb., whose worth was placed at more than $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Third place went to National Amusements Inc. founder Sumner Murray Redstone, 
who earned part of his $2.88 billion by purchasing and taking public Viacom 
Inc. and also battling Kluge for control of Orion. 
</P>
<P>
Placing fourth was Ted Arison of Miami Beach, founder of Carnival Cruise Lines. 
Leveraged buyout artist Ronald Perelman earned fifth place, while publishers 
Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. and his brother, Donald, shared sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the top 10 were media owners Barbara Cox Anthony and sister Anne Cox 
Chambers, Texas businessman H. Ross Perot, financier brothers Jay Arthur and 
Robert Alan Pritzker, and real estate magnate A. Alfred Taubman. 
</P>
<P>
Seven out of the top 10 had significant interests in media and communications, 
while two of the biggest casualties this year were in real estate, Forbes said. 
Trammell Crow's fortune slipped to $300 million from $775 million, while 
Dallas' Alfred Mack Pogue slipped off the list altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Squeaking by at No. 400, with an estimated $275 million or more, was Nan Tucker 
McEvoy, granddaughter of San Francisco Chronicle founder Michael H. de Young. 
Her wealth beats out more than three-quarters of the people on Forbes' first 
list in 1982, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six people are newcomers this year, 15 of whom owe their new-found 
status to inheritances, Forbes said. They include the Waltons; the Dorrance 
family, founders of Campbell Soup Co., and the granddaughters of the late J. 
Paul Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of those on the list inherited their wealth, the magazine said. 
Among the 60 from last year's list who failed to make this year's cut were 
Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, New York Times publisher Arthur Ochs 
Sulzberger and turnaround artist Bennett Lebow, undone in part by a takeover 
attempt of Prime Computer, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six people on the list are billionaires, while just 54 of the 400 are 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the 1989 list include media mogul Ted Turner, No. 18; publisher 
Rupert Murdoch, No. 26, and indicted junk bond king Michael Milken No. 38 with 
an estimated $1.27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the real estate magnates were developer Donald Trump, No. 19, Harry 
Helmsley, No. 22, and Samuel LeFrak, No. 24.

An accident involving two cars and a tractor-trailer truck closed the 
southbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway during the morning rush hour today as 
one of two victims with major injuries was airlifted to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers said they were investigating the cause of 
the 7:45 a.m. accident north of the Harbor Boulevard off-ramp that snarled 
traffic for more than an hour. An investigating officer said he was trying to 
sort out conflicting accounts of the cause, including one report that the 
incident began when one of the cars attempted to change lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Two unidentified women in one of the cars were injured. The driver was taken by 
helicopter to UCI Medical Center while a passenger was taken by ambulance to 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.

A Pan Am 747 jetliner flying from New York to Madrid with 203 passengers aboard 
had engine problems, forcing the pilot to cut an engine and make an emergency 
landing in Gander, Newfoundland, Pan Am said today. 
</P>
<P>
The plane touched down smoothly and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Flight 156, which left John F. Kennedy International Airport at 9:52 
p.m. Sunday after an hour and 42 minute delay, experienced vibration in one of 
its four engines off the coast of Canada just before midnight. The pilot cut 
the engine and turned back, Pan Am officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, a Boeing 727 landed safely in Paris missing one wheel after losing 
part of its landing gear while taking off from Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
Orly airport officials said emergency services were put on alert, but Air 
Algeria Flight 1002 landed smoothly, and none of the 129 passengers aboard

Former Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou gave up on forming a leftist 
coalition government today and again blasted communist forces for their recent 
deal with the right. 
</P>
<P>
The Socialist leader, ordered to stand trial on criminal charges by a 
conservative-communist coalition that resigned Saturday, is seeking a comeback 
after a crushing June election defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not possible to form a government," he told reporters after returning a 
three-day mandate to seek coalition partners to President Christos Sartzetakis. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, 70, has accused the unprecedented right-left coalition of carrying 
out a political vendetta to destroy his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, which 
held power from 1981 until June.

<P>
It was the longest shutdown of the university since Lebanon's civil war began 
in 1975.

<P>
"The whole family's back," said Radwan Mawlawi, spokesman for the university, 
which once was the most prestigious in the Middle East but was swept by 
terrorism after the war.

Syrian troops and Lebanese police checked students' identity cards at the three

The armed services newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes will be run in the future by 
civilians instead of military officers, the Pentagon's spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Both the European and Pacific editions of Stars &amp; Stripes -- originally 
designed to serve as a hometown paper for U.S. forces overseas -- have been 
plagued in recent years by allegations of censorship, and in some cases 
employee harassment. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon-appointed ombudsman is in the Pacific looking into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"When the current military editors retire, it is our intention to put civilians 
in there," Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the Pentagon is also "looking into" the possible financial and 
editorial consolidation of the newspaper's two editions.

Foreign visitors to the United States spent $20 billion in the first six months 
of this year, 19% more than during the same period in 1988, a Commerce 
Department official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Based on projections for the rest of 1989, the United States should have a 
travel trade surplus of almost $1.2 billion, marking the first time it will 
have posted a full year of gains. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell Schnabel, undersecretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism, said the 
agency's data were compiled from a survey of air travelers from the U.S. Travel 
and Tourism Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The data show that foreign visitors spent more money in the United States than 
Americans spent abroad ($19.9 billion) by almost $118 million in the first six 
months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Japan tourists topped the list by spending nearly $2.7 billion, an increase of 
19% from the same period in 1988, followed by Canada ($2.5 billion) and Mexico 
($1.5 billion). 
</P>
<P>
The United States reported travel surpluses of $2.6 billion with Japan and $1.4 
billion with Canada.

Isuzu Motors Co., Japan's commercial vehicle maker, announced today it will 
sell heavy-duty tractors imported from Volvo Truck Corp. of Sweden, starting in 
March next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based company said a formal agreement on import and sales of Volvo's 
F16 tractors in Japan has been concluded between the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is part of our company's globalization program and is aimed at 
meeting the needs of the diversifying domestic market," Isuzu President Kazuo 
Tobiyama said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Isuzu believes this Volvo tractor will meet the expanding requirements of the 
Japanese heavy-duty transport market," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope our heavy-duty tractors will have a strong appeal to the Japanese 
market," said Sten Langenius, president of Volvo Truck Corp. "The Swedish 
tractor industry has achieved fully international operations over the last 10 
years."

A controversial Irish airport set up by an ambitious priest eager to attract 
pilgrims to a local shrine has tripled its profits and looks set to double its 
passenger numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Critics labeled Knock Airport a white elephant and government backing was 
withdrawn before the site was completed four years ago in a remote corner of 
County Mayo, western Ireland. Undeterred, Msgr. James Horan raised the rest of 
the money privately. 
</P>
<P>
Knock Airport announced profits today of $210,000 for the year ending in June, 
triple the previous annual profit figure. Knock expects to attract 180,000 
passengers in 1989, 46% up from last year.

JAGUAR DISCUSSING PACT WITH GM, POSSIBLE SALE OF MINORITY STAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Jaguar PLC, British luxury auto maker, said today it is holding talks with 
General Motors Corp. about a possible cooperative operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar said that General Motors is considering buying a minority stake in 
Jaguar as part of such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The news confirmed the expected tug-of-war between GM and Ford Motor Co. over 
Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after London's Stock Exchange closed. Jaguar finished 
at $10.82 a share, down 73 cents. Trading has been very heavy since Friday, 
when Ford, which previously owned 1% of Jaguar, received U.S. regulatory 
clearance to buy up to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Ford announced Sept. 19 that it wanted to buy up to 15% of Jaguar and left open 
the option of making a full bid for the British company. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar characterized Ford's stake-buying as unwelcome and said it wants to 
remain independent. However, money-losing Jaguar also has said it might be 
interested in building ties with a major auto company. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar was widely believed to be holding talks with General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar's rules of association prohibit any shareholder from taking more than a 
15% stake before the end of 1990 and give the British government a "golden" 
share with which it may block any bid for the formerly state-owned company.

<P>
An Arco Arena executive said he will recommend tighter security and smaller 
servings of beer but no end to boxing despite a near riot at the facility after 
a title bout. 
</P>
<P>
Fans pelted the ring with beer, ice, cups and other objects after the hometown 
champion, Tony Lopez, lost Saturday's nationally televised contest against Juan 
(John John) Molina. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this in and of itself is not going to have an impact on the future of 
boxing in Sacramento," Greg Van Dusen, Arco Arena's executive vice president, 
said Sunday. "But it is going to have an impact on how we internally treat 
boxing events in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
No one was arrested and no one was reported injured in the tumult that occurred 
after referee Dr. James Jen-Kin stopped the bout because of Lopez's eye 
injuries 2 minutes, 10 seconds into the 10th round of the scheduled 12-round 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen said he believed alcohol consumption may have contributed to the 
crowd's hostility but said beer will probably continue to be sold at fights, 
albeit in smaller cups.

BILLS' KELLY TO BE OUT 3 WEEKS; BACKUP TO START AGAINST RAMS

The Hand of fate -- Indianapolis Colts defensive end Jon Hand -- finally caught 
up with Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Never seriously injured during his four-year NFL career, the Buffalo Bills' 
quarterback was smashed to the Hoosier Dome's artificial turf by the 300-pound 
Hand on Sunday, suffering a separated left shoulder that is expected to 
sideline him for at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know how long it's going to be (before it heals)," Kelly said 
today. "It could be four weeks, maybe six, maybe three." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Kelly, who was on the way to having his best NFL season, capped an 
abysmal day for the Bills, who were drubbed by the Colts 37-14. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reich, Kelly's backup for the past three seasons, finished Sunday's game 
and he will start next Monday night against the unbeaten Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of confidence in Frank Reich," Kelly said. "He's going to do a 
good job." 
</P>
<P>
In four years as a pro before Sunday, Reich completed 10 of 20 passes for 123 
yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions.

TYSON'S CLINICS FULFILL SENTENCE

Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson sparred for half an hour and signed 
autographs at a boxing clinic this morning as part of his sentence for speeding 
twice here last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson held the clinic at St. Joseph's Youth Center in downtown Albany. He was 
to hold two other clinics, featuring drug-related talks, later in the day at 
the nearby Arbor Hill Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson was ordered by Judge Stephen Safranko to hold the clinics and pay a $300 
fine after pleading guilty in August to speeding. Tyson had originally been 
ordered to hold the clinics by Saturday, but his attorney, John Hicks, struck a 
deal with Safranko allowing an extension to today. Safranko said Tyson faced 
resentencing if he failed to hold the clinics today. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with a car gets tickets," Tyson said. "Just because I'm more famous 
doesn't mean I did anything worse."
