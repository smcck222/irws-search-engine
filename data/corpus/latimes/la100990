NEW DEFICIT PLAN NEARS SENATE OK; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: BUSH APPEARS WILLING TO SIGN A COMPANION FUNDING MEASURE TO END 
SHUTDOWN OF FEDERAL AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate late Monday neared expected ratification of a new $500-billion 
budget plan approved hours earlier by the House. President Bush was believed 
willing to sign a companion funding measure needed to end the weekend-long 
shutdown of many federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The budget plan essentially revives the overall deficit-reduction targets set 
by White House and congressional negotiators in the "budget summit" agreement 
that was rejected by the House last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the new plan junks provisions in the earlier accord detailing Medicare cuts 
and new tax increases on items ranging from gasoline to beer. Instead, 
Democratic-run congressional committees would be given wide leeway in drafting 
the specifics of any spending cuts and tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Largely in response to citizen outcries, the committees are expected to soften 
Medicare cuts called for in the original plan. They also are likely to shift 
more of the tax burden onto upper-income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
As the Senate moved toward a vote on the new plan, congressional and 
Administration officials said that they were close to agreeing on the 
compromise stopgap funding bill that would enable shuttered federal agencies to 
reopen and would avoid layoffs today of thousands of federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders indicated that they were willing to agree to slightly lower 
domestic spending and slightly higher defense spending while the stopgap 
measure would be in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Republican lawmakers had urged that Bush veto the stopgap bill if it 
did not contain a provision requiring about $1.3 billion in across-the-board 
spending cuts for the next 12 days. That is the time Congress intends to give 
itself to pass implementing legislation for the new budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
The House rejected such a provision in approving a stopgap bill early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush vetoed an earlier stopgap measure last Saturday morning and selectively 
shut down much of the government in a move aimed at pressuring Congress to 
approve a new deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday afternoon that "we'll 
send no signals" on whether Bush would sign the stopgap measure until after the 
Senate had voted on the new deficit plan. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior White House aide glumly speculated that "we're going to have to 
swallow it" because of the behavior of rebellious House Republicans, who helped 
sink the original package, which Bush had promoted heavily in a nationally 
televised appeal. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash) said Monday night: "I am optimistic that 
this can be resolved tonight, or early in the morning, and that this 
unnecessary and artificial crisis can be ended." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders also said that Bush appeared to offer 
no objection to the new deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.), who has represented Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) in budget negotiations, said that "all 
signals from the White House have been weak, spasmodic and intermittent the 
last few days." 
</P>
<P>
As he struggled to work out an agreement to speed consideration of the budget 
matter, Mitchell told colleagues Monday night that prompt action was 
imperative. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to federal employees who face being sent home from work today if no 
operating funds are approved, Mitchell said: "We're not just dealing with 
numbers but with individual human beings and their families -- their hopes and 
fears and concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler and other Senate leaders were optimistic that the plan would be 
supported by most of the 55 Democrats and by less than a majority of the 45 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are going to pass it with substantial Republican votes," Fowler 
said. "Then we are going to roll up our sleeves and go to work on 
reconciliation" -- budget jargon for the process of reconciling the plan's 
vague money targets with specific tax increases and program cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), ranking minority member of the Senate Budget 
Committee, said that he, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and a number 
of other Republicans would vote for the plan's outline "because it moves the 
process along." 
</P>
<P>
Domenici said that the current plan "maintains the basic framework" of the 
original budget package approved by White House and congressional negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
However, Domenici said after a GOP caucus that a number of other Republicans 
will vote against it because they believe that implementing committees will 
make unacceptable changes in the original plan's details, which were widely 
supported by GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
Domenici said that he is drafting a letter in which Republican senators would 
declare that they would not support implementing legislation unless it met 
certain tests. 
</P>
<P>
There could be no "smoke and mirrors" -- that is, ostensible cuts unlikely to 
produce savings, he said. Further, he declared, final laws would have to 
provide the full $500-billion in deficit-reduction over five years and revenue 
increases could not exceed the $118.8 billion outlined in the plan's blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, cuts in Medicare and other entitlement programs would have to total 
at least $107.4 billion. And spending-cut enforcement mechanisms and budget 
process reforms spelled out by the budget negotiators would have to be 
included, Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), co-author of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law 
that helped force production of the current plan, said that he would vote 
against the revised version. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a promise, not a program," he said. "It's easy to pass a promise. It's 
tough to pass a program." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen 
(D-Tex.) said that he believes the final package will raise income taxes on 
top-bracket payers in exchange for lowering the tax on capital gains, or 
profits from investments. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen said that the change would be part of a Democratic effort to make the 
tax increases more equitable for low- and middle-income payers, who would be 
hit disproportionately hard by proposed tax hikes on gasoline, alcoholic 
beverages and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't have a package that hits the average family that much," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A deal on capital gains faltered in the recent budget talks when Administration 
negotiators resisted Democratic demands to raise the income tax rate on the 
wealthiest taxpayers to 33% from 28%. The Administration reportedly refused to 
go above 31%. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr. (R-Wis.) said that he and most other Senate 
Republicans and Bush are opposed to raising marginal income tax rates under any 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"And in my discussions with the President and (his chief of staff, John H.) 
Sununu, they have been opposed to that trade, too," he said. 
</P>

Fishing for Atlantic striped bass will be prohibited in most federal waters 
starting Nov. 1, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced. 
</P>
<P>
Harvest and possession of striped bass will be banned in federal waters 
extending from 3 miles to 200 miles off shore. The only exception is an area of 
Block Island Sound, Rhode Island, where fishermen will be permitted to 
transport to the mainland bass taken legally in state waters at Block Island. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations are intended to protect the striped bass, which is slowly 
recovering from a severe decline in the 1970s and early 1980s, officials said.

Four people aboard a single-engine airplane were killed when the plane came 
down on U.S. 224 near here, skidded into a ditch and burst into flames, 
officials said. The cause of the crash Sunday night was not determined 
immediately.

REPORT CARD ON U.S. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Generally, our schools are very functional and constantly improving. The 
training and personal qualities of teachers are extremely adequate, and 
typically they are dedicated, skilled professionals. 
</P>
<P>
New curriculum, teaching methodology and technology are constantly provided and 
introduced through intensive staff development programs. State-mandated quality 
reviews are being conducted in all schools. 
</P>
<P>
Compensatory education, bilingual programs and various other categorical 
services for special-need students attempt to equalize the achievement 
potential of all youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, underachievement remains a massive problem. 
</P>
<P>
My conclusion regarding the causes of the problem are based on 30 years 
experience in education. 
</P>
<P>
The primary source of underachievement is the home environment. 
</P>
<P>
I found that most parents want their children to succeed. However, three basic 
causes interfere in their participation: The parents are so overwhelmed by the 
socioeconomic circumstances of their lives that there is little left to give 
the child; parents don't know what their role should be or how to perform it; 
parents are too busy and/or self-centered to focus on their child. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious solution is parent education. If parents could be trained when 
their children are very small, and be assisted as their youngsters grow and 
mature, I'm convinced that much of the publicly perceived problems in education 
could be reduced and kids would achieve.

REPORT CARD ON U.S. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to respond to the article "Report Card Gives Schools a Poor Grade" 
(Part A, Sept. 27) regarding the report from the Department of Education that 
the performance of most American students is "low and not improving." 
</P>
<P>
As much as I respect Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, I do not agree 
with him that our schools are deficient because parents need to give more 
assistance to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have nothing to do with school management in most of the school 
districts in our country. 
</P>
<P>
It is school administrators who must be held accountable for the constant 
disruption of our classes. For example, last year at La Puente High School in 
the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, I tallied all school bulletins: 
70 different fund-raisers and sales were announced; the names of 4,348 students 
appeared on bulletins excusing them from classes for participation in 
extracurricular activities; two whole days of classes were canceled so teachers 
could attend irrelevant in-service meetings, and on 26 different days classes 
were shortened in order to make time for pep rallies and other non-academic 
frills. During the first two weeks of this semester, we lost 14 hours of class 
instruction because of teacher in-service meetings, a pep rally and six 
assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
If Cavazos wants more assistance for teachers, he should suggest to all school 
administrators throughout the country to allow teachers to teach and students 
to improve their academic performance by not scheduling more than one school 
activity at a time!

PROPOSITION 127; 
</P>
<P>
QUAKE BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earthquakes can't be prevented, but their destructive consequences can be 
reduced. One sure way is to bring existing buildings up to seismic safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The least-safe buildings in California are the 175,000 living units built of 
unreinforced masonry walls, like brick. Current law permits required seismic 
safety improvements made in these buildings to be excluded from reassessment 
for property tax purposes for 15 years. That makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes sense to have buildings made of other materials brought up to 
seismic safety standards. Proposition 127 is a constitutional amendment on the 
Nov. 6 ballot that would allow seismic safety improvements that are made in 
such buildings to be excluded from property tax reassessment. It's a fair 
measure that deserves voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Taxing seismic safety improvements on the grounds that they add to a property's 
value is a clear disincentive to making necessary, even life-saving changes. 
Strengthening a building so that it has a better chance of standing up in an 
earthquake is obviously in a different category than, say, adding a swimming 
pool or an extra room to a home. There is no reason for such seismic safety 
improvements to be taxed the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments would lose some revenues by excluding seismic safety-related 
improvements from tax reassessments. But local governments also face tax losses 
when buildings collapse or are badly damaged in an earthquake. Proposition 127, 
unanimously endorsed by the Legislature, is an important public safety measure. 
We urge a yes vote.

CONSERVATION AT ITS VERY BEST; 
</P>
<P>
RECOMMENDING YES ON PROP. 130; NO ON 138 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the seven environmental propositions that the California voter will face on 
the November ballot, not the least significant of them, by far, is Proposition 
130 -- the forest protection bond act. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130, with its $742 million in bonds to finance its programs, offers 
Californians the chance to save remnants of its old- growth forests -- those 
still cathedrals of ancient trees that tower over leafy carpets, underbrush and 
seedlings -- provide essential habitats for species endangered or otherwise and 
contribute to maintaining a quality environment. It is a vital measure of 
environmental significance. 
</P>
<P>
Yes on 130: In addition to buying as many as 4,000 acres of ancient forest, 
Proposition 130 would prohibit most clear-cutting of any forest and require the 
timber industry to produce as many new trees each year as it cuts down. In 
clear-cutting, forests are stripped bare and what is left is burned. 
</P>
<P>
Of the giant redwoods that once covered 2 million acres of California, about 
90% are gone. More than half of those still standing are on private land, 
unsheltered by park boundaries. But the first sale of bonds would finance a 
purchase of some 3,000 magnificent acres of redwoods near the southern Humboldt 
County coast. In fact, all but $32 million of the remaining bonds would be used 
to buy other ancient forest; the rest would go for retraining timber workers 
who might lose their jobs when more redwoods are put off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry warns of higher lumber prices -- and higher housing costs 
-- and a loss of many jobs if 130 is approved. But its sponsors say 130 will, 
in fact, save many jobs and keep prices down. The arithmetic seems to bear them 
out. At current cutting rates, old-growth forests will not last more than two 
decades, at which point nearly all of the old-growth timber jobs would 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of 130 say that their call for a mandate for a sustained yield -- in 
which a new tree grows to take the place of each tree that is felled -- will 
mean more timber jobs in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
No on 138: By the same token, we recommend a no vote on Proposition 138, 
sponsored by the timber industry in hopes of peeling votes away from "Forests 
Forever." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138's contribution to solving "global warming," for instance, would 
be to study the problem. Another section would call for a study of the 
financial impact (on the industry) of restrictions on clear-cutting. Where 
Proposition 130 would ban outright the export of unmilled logs from California 
-- a practice that costs jobs -- the industry proposition would simply ask 
Congress to do it. Clear-cutting would be banned under 130, with exceptions for 
Christmas tree farms and on other technical conditions. It would continue under 
138, except in old-growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138 also authorizes a bond issue, but more than one-third of the 
money would pay owners of relatively small stands of timber to reforest their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
We urge a yes vote on 130 to preserve a rich gift from California's past and a 
no vote on the unworthy 138.

HOSTAGES CRISES IN TWO CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the owner of a fast-food restaurant in Hollywood, I am disturbed by the 
implications in the article headlined "High Risk, Low Security at Fast-Food 
Stands." 
</P>
<P>
(Metro, Sept. 26.) 
</P>
<P>
I believe it is wrong to single out fast-food restaurants as particular targets 
of armed robbers. This is a problem that pervades our entire society, whether 
it be at liquor stores or mom-and-pop groceries, follow-home robbers in posh 
suburbs or Rolex grabbers on the street in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Any business that deals in cash or valuable merchandise must take reasonable 
precautions to prevent criminal assault. But once we have done that, are we to 
surrender abjectly to these elements and put our people behind bullet-proof 
glass?

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 21 days since my husband has been held in the Los Angeles County 
Central Jail. Now I'm beginning to wonder just how long this living nightmare 
is going to last. To think that this is happening in our United States is still 
totally unbelievable to me. I guess I'm still very naive. 
</P>
<P>
To think that our court system is allowed to keep an untried, non-threatening 
man in a "holding cell" runs counter to everything I always believed in the 
Constitution and civil liberties in America. America has long forgotten her 
once firm belief of "innocent until proven guilty." Do you ever once wonder if 
our government and our media might single you out because you stand for 
something they disagree with? 
</P>
<P>
Our government has effectively silenced all savings and loan executives by what 
they have done and are doing to my husband. Good, solid citizens, who have been 
stripped of their businesses and their jobs, are sitting back quietly -- ever 
fearful of becoming another Charlie Keating. Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner said my husband's photo should be hung in every board room in America to 
warn executives not to be like him. Try to tell me that Charlie is not being 
used as a weapon of fear? Try to convince me that he is not being treated as a 
convicted felon? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, corporate America is scared. Do you blame them? Everyone told us, "Never 
fight the government." My husband, however, still believes he is right. Because 
of his beliefs, he has earned shackles and chains. He is lied about and mocked 
in the press and the media. Every day we read more and more horror stories 
about things we've never done. Once one paper runs a story others repeat it 
like it's gospel truth. 
</P>
<P>
My six beautiful children, their spouses, 23 grandchildren all love their 
father and "Papa." We all know him as a loving, caring and honest individual, 
who has time for all our concerns and needs, as well as those of the needy of 
the world and tried to instill these virtues in his family. He is not the man 
the media make him out to be, that is a desperate fugitive, a man without a 
country and a serious risk because he may flee his responsibilities. Charlie 
Keating has never fled from anything. Why should he start now? His belief in 
his innocence certainly has not changed. Yes, we're scared to death of the 
power of government which is looking desperately for a scapegoat on whom to 
blame the destruction of our American banking system. 
</P>
<P>
The scapegoat is Charlie. He spends every day in a tiny concrete cell with an 
iron door. Except for court appearances, he does not see daylight. He is 
chained and shackled (his arms tied to his waist) when he is escorted to the 
attorney room to meet with his lawyers. He is allowed one visit per day, which 
consists of talking on a phone through a plexiglass wall while he is chained to 
a chair and guarded. Life is difficult. We are strong and we are together as a 
family. We must get him out! He cannot fight this immense battle from a holding 
cell. Our government knows this and delights with it. The games they have been 
playing with him are ludicrous. And this is justice?

<P>
THE BUDGET NEGOTIATORS' $60-BILLION CUT IS A NECESSARY START TO CURB OUR 
INSATIABLE DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Institute in Indianapolis.

<TEXT>
<P>
By offering $60 billion in Medicare savings, last week's budget agreement made 
a credible start at tackling one of the nation's greatest challenges in the 
1990s and beyond: how to rein in the explosive increase in entitlement spending 
in an aging society that is both hooked on early retirement and evinces an 
insatiable demand for health care. 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that the most farsighted initiative in the budget accord 
proved to be its chief obstacle in the House. If it is to be defensible, any 
new budget deal cobbled together in the days ahead must leave the Medicare 
savings largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
Although $60 billion is a relatively modest sum in the context of Medicare's 
dizzying growth (the Congressional Budget Office anticipates $200 billion in 
extra federal outlays between 1990 and 1995), a cut of this size would take a 
substantial bite out of the budget deficit. With Social Security off-limits, it 
is difficult to imagine where policy-makers could even look for comparable 
savings on the domestic side of the budget, since Social Security and Medicare 
together will account for about two-thirds of all increases in non-defense 
spending, excluding interest payments, over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators' Medicare proposal is well-crafted because half of the savings 
are to be realized through greater beneficiary cost-sharing. This creates the 
right kinds of incentives for additional cost-containment in the future. The 
phased-in hike in the Part B deductible from $75 to $150 would foster prudent 
purchase of physician services. It also preserves Medicare's primary insurance 
function: protection against large, out-of-pocket expenses. The parallel 
increase in the Part B monthly premium to around $55 would create an incentive 
for the elderly to take a more active political interest in slowing the growth 
in national health-care spending. Such action has enormous potential, since 
older Americans now account for about one-third of all health-care spending, 
more than two-thirds of which is financed through heavily subsidized government 
programs. Under Medicare Part B, for instance, premiums that the beneficiaries 
pay cover just one-quarter of costs. Under Part A, whose hospital coverage is 
financed entirely through payroll taxes, pay-backs on elderly beneficiaries' 
prior contributions average about 10-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sensible as the original Medicare initiatives are, they are in jeopardy. A 
coalition of major elderly advocacy groups endorsed a Democratic alternative, 
now part of the new House resolution, which features emasculated cost-sharing 
incentives and $20 billion less in savings. As debate continues, every 
politician will have to take into account the regrettably predictable threats 
with which many senior-lobby spokesmen greet anyone who questions their 
priorities. "We want to make it clear that those who wage a budget war against 
seniors shouldn't expect pacifism on Election Day," warns Ron Pollack, 
executive director of Families USA. 
</P>
<P>
Claims of a budget war being waged against seniors are groundless and should be 
resisted by budget policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, substantial savings in Medicare are a cornerstone of any 
credible budget deal. If programs that benefit older Americans must bear a 
large share of cuts in domestic spending, it is because they are the biggest 
and fastest-growing entitlements. Although Americans aged 65 or over make up 
just 12% of the population, they receive about 60% of all federal benefits, a 
share that rises every year. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the proposed changes do not burden those least able to pay. The poor 
(as well as many near-poor) elderly will be eligible to have the bill for extra 
costs picked up by Medicaid. As for middle-income seniors, aggregate statistics 
which show that large numbers are reduced to poverty by out-of-pocket medical 
expenses are misleading; most of that problem relates to nursing-home care. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a decision to jettison real reform today would miss an important 
opportunity to realign America's entitlement systems with the next century's 
emerging realities. Under current policies, the cost of Social Security and 
Medicare will climb to between 10% and 16% of GNP over the next 35 years, up 
from not much over 6% today. At the low end of this range, these costs will 
become intensely controversial; toward the high end, they will not be 
sustainable without robbing other generations or other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of every political stripe were quick to find reasons to hate the budget 
accord. Objection to its Medicare provisions, however, is the least 
justifiable. In the scramble to fashion a new compromise, congressional leaders 
and the President should stand their ground on the key features of their 
Medicare proposal.

MORNING BRIEFING: MAKER OF RAM SOUVENIR CAN'T PULL ONE OVER ON THIS FAN

Reader Nick Salata was browsing in the T-shirt section of the Glendale 
Sportmart when a "Rams Legends" shirt caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
He took a careful look at the names and drawings of the 11 legends: Elroy 
Hirsch, Tom Fears, Rosey Grier, Marlin McKeever, Tom Mack, Jack Snow, David 
(Deacon) Jones, Merlin Olsen, John Cappelletti, Jon Arnett and Bill Munson. 
</P>
<P>
Add T-shirt: Salata said he was tempted to buy the shirt for its comic value, 
but decided that $12.96 was too much to pay for elevating quarterback Bill 
Munson (No. 11 on the Rams' all-time passing yardage list) to legendary status, 
over Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," Salata said, "it didn't even have Jack Youngblood, although it did 
show McKeever as No. 85, Youngblood's number. McKeever was No. 86." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: After two games of the American League playoffs, Carney Lansford 
has a lifetime playoff batting average of .382 (21 for 55). Who has the highest 
playoff batting average for hitters with 50 or more at-bats? 
</P>
<P>
Slam dunkin': Vince Lascheid, the organist at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers 
Stadium, was ready for the Cincinnati Reds Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lascheid played "The Charleston" for Red pitcher Norm Charlton. He played 
"What's New Pussycat?" for Red first baseman Hal Morris. 
</P>
<P>
And he played the Dunkin' Donuts jingle for Mariano Duncan, who went three for 
five with a home run and four runs batted in in Cincinnati's 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sport and society: The Associated Press noted Sunday that it had been 15 years 
since ultra-marathon swimmer Diana Nyad tried to swim around Manhattan, only to 
call off the attempt after completing 20 of the 28 chilling miles in six hours. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nyad: "I'm amazed that my involvement in such a minor, eccentric sport got 
such attention. I suppose in the mid-1970s it was symbolic. Women were making 
their mark in sports and my swimming gave respect to the new marathon ethic." 
</P>
<P>
The new what? 
</P>
<P>
Those eastern fans: Steve Kelley, Seattle Times columnist, visited former major 
leaguer Larry Parrish on a recent trip to Japan. During the 1989 Japanese 
season, Parrish led Cecil Fielder in home runs (42-38) and was leading again 
this year before knee problems forced him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish on Japanses fans: "It sounds more like a college football crowd than a 
baseball crowd. They're amazing here. We could be down, 10-1, in the seventh 
inning, and they'll still be cheering. 
</P>
<P>
"This definitely isn't Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
Priceless remark: Late in the regular season, Pittsburgh center fielder Andy 
Van Slyke was batting .405 and had 27 RBIs whenever Doug Drabek was the 
Pirates' starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Van Slyke told Pittsburgh writers: "(Drabek) told me he'd give me half of his 
Cy Young incentive bonus if he won it. I asked him how much it was, and he 
said, 'Nothing.' So I guess I'll get a handshake and a phone call in the 
off-season." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mickey Rivers tops the list at .386, followed by Lansford, Pete 
Rose (.381) and Dusty Baker (.371). 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, on why he doesn't think the drafting 
of underclassmen by the NFL will ruin college football: "If our game depends on 
young men sacrificing better opportunities, it deserves to go down the drain."

LITE LIGHT WINS THE OAK LEAF STAKES

<P>
Those who thought Beyond Perfection was California's hope to upset Meadow Star 
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies might have to start rethinking their 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Badly beaten by Beyond Perfection in the Del Mar Debutante Sept. 2, Lite Light 
turned the tables in a big way Monday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-1 third choice in the field of four, Lite Light got the lead before a 
quarter of a mile had been run, then turned the $242,256 Oak Leaf Stakes into a 
one-filly affair. 
</P>
<P>
A Kentucky-bred daughter of Majestic Light, she defeated Garden Gal by four 
lengths in 1:42 4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles, the same time Best Pal had while 
winning the Norfolk the day before. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-2 favorite, Beyond Perfection was four-wide most of the way and finished 
6 1/2 lengths behind Garden Gal. Even though she was beaten by 31 1/2 lengths, 
Title Bought earned $14,832 for finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive when beating Beyond Perfection in the seven-furlong Sorrento 18 days 
before the Debutante, Lite Light had an excuse for her decisive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"She was horsing (ovulating) so bad last time I would have had to take her out 
of any ordinary race," said trainer Henry Moreno after Lite Light's third 
victory in seven starts. "I liked her going in today on account of knowing what 
was wrong last time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty nice filly, that's all I can say. More than likely, we'll go 
on to the Breeders' Cup (Oct. 27)." 
</P>
<P>
Last going into the first turn, Lite Light moved to the front when an opening 
developed on the fence. A head in front after a :46 half-mile, she started to 
draw away midway around the turn and won with something left. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the first turn, I didn't feel we would have a shot in the middle 
with four horses going head to head, so I took back," said Russell Baze after 
his first victory of the six day-old Oak Tree meeting. "Then, Garden Gal 
drifted out and she pulled me through there. Chris (McCarron) tried to get 
(Garden Gal) to drop in, but if anything, she went wider. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I rode her (in the Sorrento), she ran similar to what she did 
today. Last time, she came into heat real bad the day of the race. Henry told 
me in the paddock that day we'd be lucky to get any part of it. She was not in 
top form at all. The real Lite Light showed up today." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that would be good enough to beat Meadow Star, who remained unbeaten 
with a 14-length victory in Saturday's Frizette at Belmont Park, is an entirely 
different question. 
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent both of them are quality fillies," Baze said. "We'll never know 
until we hook her." 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup also seems the probable destination for Garden Gal, who was 
making her first start around two turns. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with her race,' said trainer Brian Mayberry. "She finished well 
for her first time longer than six furlongs." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Perfection acted as though she might be tired. The Oak Leaf was her 
fourth race since Aug. 15 and her third in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those races that you hate to have, but that you're going to 
get," jockey Alex Solis said. "I got caught four wide, but she didn't really 
fire when I asked her." 
</P>
<P>
Sensational Star, who won the Bing Crosby and Pat O'Brien Handicaps at Del Mar, 
will have nine opponents Wednesday when he starts in the $108,625 Ancient Title 
Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
A $32,000 claim more than two years ago by Bill Spawr, the 6-year-old gelding 
drew the outside post in the six-furlong race. He will again be ridden by 
Rafael Meza. Sensational Star, who is preparing for the California Cup Nov. 3, 
worked six furlongs in a bullet 1:13 1/5 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A quality colt overseas, Corwyn Bay was impressive in his main track debut 
Sept. 10 at Del Mar. Under Eddie Delahoussaye, the 4-year-old son of Caerleon 
beat allowance rivals by 6 1/2 lengths and ran the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:14 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field include multiple-stakes winner Prospectors Gamble; 
Snipledo, who has has won six consecutive races in Washington, including the 
Longacres Mile; the Vladimir Cerin-trained entry of Yes I'm Blue, who captured 
the Aprisa and Governor's Cup at Fairplex Park; Hollywood Reporter; On A Roll; 
Ambessa; Astro, who won his last three starts at Arlington Park, and Gallant 
Sailor. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, who disappointed when heavily favored in the Del Mar Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup, is expected to start in Saturday's Goodwood Handicap. Other 
possiblies include his stablemate, Lively One; Miserden, who worked six 
furlongs in 1:13 2/5 Monday morning; Asia; Festin, and Edipo Rey. . . . Lite 
Light paid $10.60 to win and the victory was worth $148,320 to owner Jack 
Finley. . . . For the second consecutive day, no one was able to isolate all 
the Pick Six winners, so there wil be a carryover of more than $198,000. . . . 
Kent Desormeaux and Julio Garcia each won twice Monday.

SENIORS ALSO PART OF 'BOOK GENERATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In relation to your article on "The Book Generation" by Dennis McLellan (View, 
Sept. 13), perhaps you would be interested in some readers at the other end of 
the age spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
A group of seniors meets on Fridays at 10 a.m. at the Golden Timers, 114 E. 
19th St. in Costa Mesa, and new members are welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
(Phone: (714) 642-2275.) 
</P>
<P>
We read plays: classical or modern, serious or comic. The ability to act is not 
at all essential, but if you're a seventy-something woman, you may read the 
part of a 12-year-old boy with elan and understanding; and a sixty-something 
man may read that of a faithless young wife in a very nice baritone for a few 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
The vintage of this group seems a good one. Our long life experience has 
enriched our comprehension of some of its mysteries and humor -- if we do say 
so ourselves. And we're still discovering wonders.

ERMA BOMBECK: MIND LIKE STEEL WITH THE ANSWERS TRAPPED INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
My kids tell me I am losing 100,000 brain cells every day of my life. They base 
this on the fact that I cannot finish a sentence anymore without three or four 
people to help me fill in the blanks. They say it's like talking to a 
contestant on a game show where the audience participates. 
</P>
<P>
I read where one author said we feed our minds intellectual junk food so that 
our brains are like globs of Elmer's glue. They harden before you can do 
anything with them. That's disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
I prefer to regard my brain as a cheap computer that stores information. Over 
the years, it has stored so much useless stuff that it is on overload and takes 
a little longer to bring the information up on the screen. I can recall my 
phone number when I was 9 years old, but I can't recall important things like 
who played opposite Gregory Peck in "Gentleman's Agreement." Give me a minute . 
. . . it's coming. Oh, you know, she played in "Oklahoma" . . . . her name 
begins with a B . . . it's on the tip of my tongue. Wait a minute . . . . 
Celeste Holm! 
</P>
<P>
When one of the kids said, "If you don't use it, you lose it," that made sense. 
I started to take Isaac Asimov's quiz that appears in our newspaper every 
morning. Without fail, I reached the Ph.D. level. However, I cheated so badly, 
I lost all respect for myself. So I started to watch "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Every afternoon at 4 p.m. I would stop what I was doing and sit in front of the 
TV set in a straight-back chair and concentrate. I knew the answers. It was 
just that I didn't remember them until the middle of the 6 o'clock news. It was 
demoralizing to watch a 16-year-old answer questions in history when I couldn't 
come up with the answers. And I had been there. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I became quite morose one day when I did pretty well during the game but 
lost all my winnings when the final question had to do with Greek mythology. 
Where do they find these people? Are they all little endowments from a genius 
sperm bank? 
</P>
<P>
I think the brain does go on overdrive as you get older. I blame this on the 
kids. When they were small, my brain was on call 24 hours a day. I figured out 
once I made on the average of 35 decisions an hour -- not major decisions but 
questions where an instant answer was required. 
</P>
<P>
Now that I've stopped running their lives, I've sort of kicked back and let 
them come up with their own answers. One of them called the other day and asked 
if he had had mumps as a child. I thought a second. "What is Centerville, Ohio, 
in 1965?" He said, "OK" and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
I'm really proud of myself, but face it, he's losing it and he's only in his 
30s.

Science, after all, is limited. In the areas where it holds sway -- physical 
reality -- it has no equal in its ability to understand the world and its power 
to affect it. But it cannot know everything. Values and morals, for example, 
elude scientific proof. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the limits? How much can science know? Questions along this frontier 
turn out to be devilishly difficult and so far unresolvable. Is there a 
complete physical explanation for the experience we call mind? Is there a 
mechanical equivalent of consciousness? If you think so, you say we haven't got 
it yet. If you think not, you say it can never be found. No one knows who's 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Questions of this kind lurk at the heart of many areas of study, and they are 
always fascinating even if they cannot be answered. Some have been around since 
the Greeks invented knowledge and Plato was dean of the Academy. They include 
fundamental truths about truth itself. Science rests on them, but they are 
apparently beyond scientific proof themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, a rotating group of -- for lack of a better word -- intellectuals 
has met monthly or so in New York to discuss these matters and see what headway 
they might make on them. This group, the Reality Club, has heard papers 
principally from scientists and philosophers, 13 of which are collected in this 
volume, "Speculations," edited by John Brockman, the club's founder. 
</P>
<P>
These essays, provocative, lively and informative, focus on aspects of the 
human mind, which remains the most complicated and elusive object of scientific 
study. The brain, whose extraordinary powers make science possible, resists the 
scientific method. 
</P>
<P>
There are many theories and there is a large amount of data, but no one knows 
how the brain works. How you are reading these words and making sense of them 
is, as the Germans say, unangreifbar beim heutigen Stand der Wissenschaft -- 
unassailable at the current state of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
So it is appropriate for philosophers to get in on the act, and here we find, 
for example, Daniel C. Dennett, the distinguished arts and sciences professor 
at Tufts University, asking, "How is human consciousness situated in the world? 
That is a great, ancient problem of philosophy, but also one of the most 
perplexing unanswered questions of science." 
</P>
<P>
Dennett discusses Von Neumann machines, which would work like computers, and 
goes on to hypothesize about the workings of what he calls a Joycean machine, 
"since it is the stream of consciousness we are modeling." He concludes: 
</P>
<P>
"Where does the mind come from? Is it real? What is it made of? It is a virtual 
machine, running in the brain, a product of three sorts of evolution. And it is 
its own user illusion." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Humphrey, a British theoretical psychologist, wonders what 
evolutionary advantage consciousness afforded those who had it. What advantage 
does consciousness give to creatures who are able to think about themselves 
(us) so that they have survived and others have not? 
</P>
<P>
"We have an idea of what consciousness is doing -- namely, giving the subject a 
picture of his own brain activity -- but we have no idea yet about what 
biological good that does him in the context of his daily life," Humphrey 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Berman, a social critic and essayist, wonders about a related topic: 
what happens when there's too much consciousness or a heightened consciousness, 
which may be related to artistic sensibility or to creativity itself. He is 
drawn to the subject of the tortured artist, and he thinks about the "peculiar 
tendency" of creativity "to burn out or destroy the artist, often at a 
relatively young age." 
</P>
<P>
He distinguishes various kinds of creativity and attempts to put it all 
together in a theory, but, as is common in this sort of enterprise, the 
questions are more impressive than the answers. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we think about these things at all? Why are we curious? Where does our 
urge to know come from? Who is this person I call I? Where are my thoughts and 
emotions? Do they have physical reality? These questions underlie all others, 
and for reasons unknown, thinking about them is very pleasurable even if we are 
a long way from knowing the answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Speculations" offers a first-rate collection of current thinking on the 
subject.

Dueling Leonardos: An Italian artist has claimed in his will that he painted a 
painting previously attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was made by Cesare Tubino, who died in Turin, Italy, last week at age 
91, the Turin daily Stampa Sera reported Monday. The "Madonna With Cat" first 
surfaced in the 1930s and was shown at a prestigious Milan exhibition in 1939 
after several experts attributed it to the 15th-Century master. But it 
disappeared soon after and was believed to have been stolen or lost. It was 
found in Tubino's apartment after his death. CLAUDIA PUIG

Artwork Nets Nickels Galore: There is an art lover out there who thinks more of 
a watercolor by Katharine Hepburn than the actress does herself. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn painted a scene of the Pacific Ocean in the 1960s while staying at John 
Barrymore's house and donated it to the North American Wildlife Assn. for its 
benefit auction Saturday night. When she gave the association the painting, she 
said, "I do hope it will bring a price, although I wouldn't give you a nickel 
for it." It brought a little more than that -- $5,000. CLAUDIA PUIG

HEGE LEADS DEBUT ORCHESTRA AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To call the Young Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra a training ensemble 
would be technically correct. But the orchestra is better than that label 
implies; its concerts are usually small jewels in the musical life of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's concert in Royce Hall, the first of the orchestra's 36th season, 
proved typical in its excellences: These young musicians regularly make old 
music sound fresh. No small amount of the credit for Sunday's event is due to 
Daniel Hege, who made his debut as conductor-in-training, a position he will 
hold for three years as winner of the YMF National Conducting Competition last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Both orchestra and conductor were shown to best advantage in Schubert's 
Symphony No. 5. Hege coaxed precise yet gracious playing from his musicians, 
revealing an already strong rapport with them. He stressed vigor and dynamic 
contrast in the outer movements without compromising their tunefulness. Glowing 
colors and elegantly singing lines characterized the Andante. In short, a 
mature, fully realized interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, principal clarinetist Andrew Lamy took on the solo duties in Copland's 
"Clarinet" Concerto. His rock-solid technique allowed one to forget his 
mechanics and focus on the balletic gracefulness of his phrasing, the give and 
take with which he moved his music through the orchestral texture. Hege and 
orchestra accompanied with sensitivity, though their abilities were challenged 
by the craggy finale. 
</P>
<P>
A misjudgment marred the opening work on the program, Handel's Concerto a Due 
Cori No. 2. In this piece the two wind choirs must be separated for their 
antiphonal music to have proper effect. Sunday they were seated in a single 
group behind the strings. Otherwise, a solid performance, if a trifle bland for 
lack of stereo. TIMOTHY MANGAN

SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY AT UC IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two important events took place Sunday afternoon in the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 
on the edge of the campus at UC Irvine: 
</P>
<P>
First, the new auditorium, an elegant, 756-seat hall costing $17.6 million, 
hosted its first complete musical event. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the South Coast Symphony, under its founder/conductor, John Larry 
Granger, inaugurated a second series in an acoustical venue clearly more 
beneficial to its musical pretensions than the problematic auditorium at Orange 
Coast College, where it has been resident since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Both events promise much for the future. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cheng Hall, its welcoming interior handsome in dusky rose, all of its 
seats within 60 feet of the proscenium arch, is a most pleasant room, with 
lively but not strident acoustics and good sight-lines. 
</P>
<P>
With its programming mandated to be divided equally between university, 
community and commercial uses, the Irvine Barclay facility can be an important 
cultural center in an area which has long needed an auditorium of this size -- 
not to mention audience comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Granger's orchestra, a professional ensemble which has struggled with the 
sizable but unflattering Robert B. Moore Theater at OCC all these years, 
deserves the kind of musical help the new hall gives it. And every orchestra 
tends to perform better at a second performance -- which this one was, the 
ensemble's Costa Mesa season having begun the night before at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Solid, characterful playing marked the entire performance, devoted to three 
contrasting works, Ralph Vaughan Williams' "Serenade to Music," the Piano 
Concerto by Aram Khachaturian and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
In the Fifth, Granger took unexceptionable tempos, enforced them with 
gentlemanly ease and let the entire work unfold with compelling logic and 
fluency. Except for some scrappiness in the exposing slow movement, his 
orchestra played with tight balances, admirable ensemble values and strong 
soloism. And this reading climaxed, as it should but does not always, with a 
finale direct and unswerving in its impact. 
</P>
<P>
In the Concerto, veteran pianist Leonard Pennario was the splendid, 
communicative and high-energy soloist, making what is certainly a cheap and 
tawdry piece seem almost elegant. 
</P>
<P>
The full house in the new theater cheered Pennario relentlessly after the 
concerto, and was rewarded with two encores: Scriabin's Prelude in D-flat for 
Left-Hand Alone, and Louis Moreau Gottschalk's "Le Banjo." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan Williams' cherishable Serenade for orchestra and singers opened the 
proceedings appropriately. Here, the instrumental ensemble was assisted by the 
three-dozen members of the Lee Vail Singers and soloists Pamela Chapin, Nina 
Edwards, Leland Vail and Royce Reynolds. Granger presided over a mellow and 
noble performance.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: LONG-LOST 'SALLY' RESURFACES AT THE VAGABOND; 
</P>
<P>
REVIVALS: MARILYN MILLER, FLO ZIEGFELD'S SINGING AND DANCING STAR OF THE '20S, 
IS FEATURED IN THE EARLY TALKIE MUSICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marilyn Miller is virtually forgotten today, having made only three 
long-obscure early talkies before her death from blood poisoning in 1936 at the 
age of 37, but she had been Florenz Ziegfeld's shining singing and dancing star 
of the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
Her first film, "Sally" (1929), long thought lost, resurfaces at the Vagabond 
today and Wednesday in a respectable black-and-white print, duped from a 
two-strip Technicolor print apparently no longer extant. 
</P>
<P>
While its appeal today is surely restricted to determined nostalgists and to 
historians, "Sally" is fascinating on several counts. The early talkie 
musicals, as little more than filmed plays -- in fairness, "Sally," directed by 
John Francis Dillon, is more fluid than some -- are of greatest interest as a 
record of popular Broadway entertainments and personalities during its most 
dazzlingly successful decade, the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
And even more than "Sally," accompanying clips from "Gold Diggers of Broadway" 
(1929), "The Cuckoos" (1930) and "Show of Shows" (1929) serve to remind us how 
incalculable the contributions of the soon-to-arrive Busby Berkeley and Fred 
Astaire were to be in tapping the infinite resources of the camera in 
photographing and staging songs and dances for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
An adaptation of Miller's 1920 hit written by Guy Boltonq, with songs by Jerome 
Kern, "Sally" is a bit of typical fluff of the period about how a klutzy 
waitress, through luck and pluck, becomes a top musical comedy star. Its key 
song is the evergreen "Look for the Silver Lining." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is a pretty blond, not terribly photogenic, with a light operatic 
singing voice, lovely legs and graceful whether tapping or toe-dancing in the 
unsophisticated routines of the era. Her genteel appeal pales alongside the 
down-to-earth Depression heroines Ruby Keeler, Ginger Rogers and Joan Blondell, 
who were to succeed her shortly at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The film's lavish sets and costumes are credited to Jack Warner's having fallen 
hard for his star. 
</P>
<P>
If "Sally" is limited in its appeal, the Vagabond's next offering, "The Narrow 
Margin" (1952), screening Thursday and Friday with a razor-sharp new print, can 
be recommended across the board, especially to those who have seen the current 
remake, which curiously throws away the original's surprise twist while adding 
credibility-destroying elaborate action sequences. 
</P>
<P>
If ever there was an argument for less being more, it's the original "Narrow 
Margin," directed tautly by Richard Fleischer and written tersely by Earl 
Felton from Martin Goldsmith and Jack Leonard's Oscar-nominated screen story. 
In this thriller-on-a-train film noir classic, Charles McGraw is the decent, 
reflective cop escorting hard-as-nails Marie Windsor from Chicago to Los 
Angeles. Playing with it is "Out of the Past" (1947). (213) 387-2171. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Salvador Trevino's "Raices De Sangre" (1977) and Alejandro Grattan's 
"Only Once in a Lifetime" (1978), screening Sunday at 2 p.m. in UCLA's Melnitz 
Theater, are the first of a series of films that the UCLA Film Archive is 
presenting in conjunction with UCLA's Wight Art Gallery's "Chicano Art: 
Resistance and Affirmation." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino's film, regarded as the first 35 mm film directed by a Chicano and 
dealing with crucial moral and career choices facing a Harvard-educated Chicano 
attorney (Richard Yniquez), was not available for preview. Unfortunately, 
Grattan's film is a disappointment -- uneven, overlong and tritely conceived. 
</P>
<P>
The vitality that Miguel Robelo brings to his role as as struggling, 
uncompromising middle-aged painter is dissipated by the film's leaden pacing 
and poor acting by some of the supporting actors. It's too bad that its capable 
guest stars, Claudio Brook (as a suave art dealer) and Sheree North (as a faded 
ex-Hollywood starlet), had not been given more screen time. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday: "Break of Dawn" and "Zoot Suit." For full schedule: (213) 206-FILM, 
206-8013.

NO LIGHTER FLUID BAN IN WORKS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS WILL SEEK OTHER METHODS OF REDUCING 
POLLUTION FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While much of Southern California will soon be giving up the smoky American 
tradition of using lighter fluid to start the back-yard barbecue, Ventura 
County cooks can continue to light their fires any way they want. 
</P>
<P>
At least as long as county officials continue to focus their attention on other 
air pollution sources. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District last week adopted the first ban 
in the nation on the sale of most lighter fluids and pre-soaked briquettes in 
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties starting in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But the top official at Ventura County's Air Pollution Control District says 
there is little chance that anyone will start tinkering soon with county 
barbecuing practices. 
</P>
<P>
The primary focus for the county now is reduction of emissions from large 
pollution sources like motor vehicles and power plants, rather than smaller 
sources like charcoal and lighter fluid, said Richard Baldwin, county air 
pollution control officer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of thing we will propose if we can't find other solutions," 
Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin did not rule out the possibility that Ventura County may also place 
solvent-based lighter fluids under closer scrutiny as other sources of air 
pollution are controlled or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that South Coast district officials have studied the lighter fluid 
issue closely enough to be able to estimate that 2,700 gallons of lighter fluid 
are used in the four-county area every day, generating emissions equal to 
34,000 cars or an oil refinery. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Baldwin said, officials have not yet even studied how much lighter 
fluid is used in Ventura County or begun to consider how a similar ban might 
help clean up Ventura County air. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Baldwin made it clear that he thinks lighter fluid is an inferior 
way of starting a back-yard barbecue, even if it remains legal here. 
</P>
<P>
"I started using an electric starter 13 or 14 years ago because of the taste," 
he said. "My most recent test of this was yesterday, when I barbecued ribs 
without lighter fluid and enjoyed the taste." 
</P>
<P>
A brief survey of county barbecuers Monday revealed, however, that there are 
some strong feelings on both sides of the question. 
</P>
<P>
As he turned some tri-tip steaks on a grill at Arroyo Verde Park in Ventura, 
Ron Dawson of Oxnard, a computer scientist for the federal government, said he 
thinks the government should keep its regulatory mitts off his barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"You're fooling with an American tradition that absolutely should not be 
tampered with," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
If such a measure were passed in Ventura County, Dawson said he may be forced 
to cross county lines looking for the lighter fluid or to search for contraband 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine a black market for charcoal in mom-and-pop stores?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Among county officials, there was a little more readiness to consider other 
barbecue options. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Braitman, executive director of the Local Agency Formation Commission 
and an outdoor chef of some repute in county government circles, said he often 
uses lighter fluid on his custom-made barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, he knows several techniques, because he was trained by the 
barbecuers of Santa Maria and Lompoc, where barbecue is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
He sometimes substitutes oak for coals and lights the fire with paper and 
twigs, Braitman said. Or he fills hollowed-out tin cans with briquettes, lights 
them with just a tiny bit of lighter fluid that newspaper could replace and 
fans the flames with a blow-dryer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to cook in 15 minutes when I use that method," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One Ventura County supporter of the ban on lighter fluid is environmental 
activist Russ Baggerly. 
</P>
<P>
Before he became a leader in the environmental movement, Baggerly said, he used 
lighter fluid to start back-yard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
He rarely has time for that activity anymore, Baggerly said. But if he ever 
again gets time to barbecue, Baggerly said he'll buy an electric fire starter 
or a gas barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cleaner fuel, and you get the same effect from gas as charcoal but 
without a mess," he said.

5 SCHOOL DISTRICTS STOP OFFERING DRIVER TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Ventura County school districts have stopped offering driver training 
classes this fall because of state budget cuts, and school officials say plans 
by some districts to offer the classes for a fee will shut out students who 
can't afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ventura, Fillmore and Santa Paula 
districts decided not to offer the classes this fall after Gov. George 
Deukmejian vetoed $21.2 million in program funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, several districts may charge students for the program. The only other 
option is not to offer training for beginning drivers at all, some school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District voted to 
charge students $120 for the course, to make up for $95,563 that the district 
will lose from the funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The board of Ventura Unified School District will consider a similar plan at 
its meeting tonight. Some Ventura board members have expressed misgivings about 
the fairness of a fee. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel it's not an equitable situation for children who can't afford 
it," said Ventura board President Barbara Myers. "The very students who can't 
afford the class are the students who need it." 
</P>
<P>
In the Ojai Unified School District, the only district in the county that still 
offers the classes free of charge, the future of the program is in doubt, 
hanging on whether a new governor will restore the money, said Leo T. Molitor, 
the Ojai district's assistant superintendent of business/administrative 
services. 
</P>
<P>
At its Nov. 6 meeting, the Ojai board will also consider a plan to charge a fee 
for the class. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ojai district received about $15,000 toward the $27,000 cost of 
the program, Molitor said. If they decide to continue offering it, the district 
may have to assume the total cost itself or ask students to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to take money from other programs to teach young people how to 
drive," Molitor said. "It's a very important skill, but at what price? That's 
what districts have to ask." 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Kernen, assistant superintendent of the Fillmore Unified School 
District, said the district will not offer driver training even if state 
funding is restored because state money covers only about 75% of the program's 
cost. The program cost about $17,000 last year, but the state only paid about 
$13,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had made a tentative decision even before the governor's veto, because 
paying for the program was encroaching on our general fund," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oak Park Unified School District, students take courses through nearby 
Las Virgenes Unified School District in Los Angeles County, officials said. The 
Moorpark Unified School District does not offer a program, said Supt. Thomas G. 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Most districts in the county offer driver training either before or after 
school, and it is usually taught by teachers who also have full course loads in 
other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Ventura and Fillmore said they may look to private business to 
help subsidize driver training programs if the funding is not restored. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Ventura district board meeting, members discussed asking car 
dealerships, insurance companies and car stereo companies to fund scholarships 
for students who cannot afford to pay a fee for the classes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are also awaiting the outcome of several lawsuits, including one 
filed by the Salinas School District and the California Assn. of Safety 
Educators against Deukmejian and the state, said Jim Malkin, the Simi Valley 
district's coordinator of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
"If worse comes to worse, we'll probably offer it through some community 
service class for a fee," Malkin said. "But we're hoping the election of a new 
governor will change some things."

SIERRA CLUB WITHHOLDS 19TH DISTRICT ENDORSEMENT

<P>
The Sierra Club has decided against endorsing either Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) or his Democratic challenger despite efforts by both candidates to 
win the blessing of the nation's largest environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the local chapter of the Sierra Club came as a surprise to both 
campaigns, which have tried to woo voters concerned about the environment by 
trading on the Sierra Club's name and 400,000 national members. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent newsletter to his constituents, Lagomarsino prominently displayed a 
letter from the Sierra Club president thanking him for pushing renewal of the 
federal Clean Air Act. The taxpayer-financed newsletter angered some local 
Sierra Club members who believed it made the letter look like an endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Democratic challenger Anita Perez Ferguson erroneously claimed a 
Sierra Club endorsement in campaign literature after some club members hinted 
that it was forthcoming. The Ferguson campaign quickly retracted the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This news today is a complete surprise," said Sam Rodriguez, Ferguson's 
campaign manager. "If this is accurate, we will be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he had not been officially notified of the decision and was not 
giving up hope that the Sierra Club would endorse Ferguson, who has the backing 
of the League of Conservation Voters and other environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
John Doherty, Lagomarsino's spokesman, said he had no comment on the club's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sierra Club has decided to stay out of the area's congressional 
politics, the local chapter has recommended that the club endorse Ginny 
Connell, a Democrat challenging Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting last month, the executive board of the Los Padres chapter also 
decided to recommend the endorsement of Oxnard Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, a 
Democrat who is running against Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi, a Republican. The 
Los Padres chapter has more than 6,000 members in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Maron and Connell will not receive official endorsement until the 
recommendations are ratified by Sierra Club officials in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," Connell said. "For me it is an affirmation that a group as 
prestigious as the Sierra Club sees my concern about environmental issues in 
line with theirs." 
</P>
<P>
She said the pending endorsement is an indication of McClintock's poor voting 
record on the environment and of the Sierra Club's desire to be involved in the 
effort to replace him in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock was unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Maron said she was delighted to receive the stamp of approval from the 
executive board of the Los Padres chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in favor of keeping as much open space as possible, putting it into the 
greenbelt and keeping it there," she said. "The mayor is looking to build 
houses there." 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said he was displeased that the Sierra Club chapter would endorse one 
of his five mayoral opponents without giving him the opportunity to address the 
group to outline his views. 
</P>
<P>
"If you review the voting record of Mrs. Maron and me, we have voted 
identically or similarly on every environmental and building issue that has 
come before the City Council," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Full, political action chairwoman of the Sierra Club's local chapter, 
said the club's executive board recommended Maron because "we felt we needed 
somebody we could trust to handle all of the problems with the development of 
Ormond Beach and other issues." 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th Congressional District race, Full said the political action 
committee voted unanimously in August to endorse Ferguson, but that 
recommendation was overturned by the executive board in September. 
</P>
<P>
She said Ferguson was short one vote for the two-thirds vote needed to win the 
board's endorsement. Some chapter board members decided not to vote for 
Ferguson's endorsement because she has never held elective office, Full said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any concrete evidence of where she stands other than the 
organizations she belongs to," Full said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Lagomarsino, she said the board did not endorse him even though he 
filled out a lengthy questionnaire, had it hand-delivered to her house and 
telephoned her personally to lobby for the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"He did all of the things you are supposed to do, except vote the right way," 
Full said. The Sierra Club relied heavily on the League of Conservation Voters' 
score card of environmental votes in Congress, which gave Lagomarsino a 50% 
grade in 1989, up from 38% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy his record has improved a lot," she said. "But there are a number 
of issues that we are not happy with." 
</P>
<P>
The group also decided not to endorse Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). "His 
record is even worse than Lagomarsino's record," she said. On 10 key 
environmental votes in 1989, Gallegly voted correctly 30% of the time, 
according to the league score card. 
</P>
<P>
She said the executive board is not supporting Gallegly's Democratic 
challenger, Richard Freiman of Agoura Hills, because of his slim chances of 
defeating a Republican incumbent in an overwhelmingly Republican district. The 
21st Congressional District includes eastern Ventura County and the westernmost 
portions of the San Fernando Valley.

SANTA ANA WINDS LASH THE REGION; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: THE HOT DESERT AIR BRINGS WARMER TEMPERATURES TO THE COAST AND 
UNUSUALLY CLEAR SKIES TO SIMI VALLEY AND THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>

<P>
Santa Ana winds gusting to 40 m.p.h. swept across Ventura County on Monday, 
knocking down power lines, tripping burglar alarms, aggravating allergies and 
raising concern about brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
The hot desert winds also brought unusually clear skies to Simi Valley and 
Thousand Oaks by pushing pollution out to sea. In reverse of the usual pattern, 
Ventura was smoggier than Simi Valley on Monday, air quality officials said. 
The same is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
In another reverse of the norm, Ventura, with a high of 89 degrees, was hotter 
than Simi Valley, where the high was 82 on Monday. Even higher temperatures are 
predicted for today, with highs in the low 90s in Ventura and Oxnard, the 
mid-90s in Ojai and the upper 80s in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Only one minor brush fire was reported Monday in Ventura County, a two-acre 
blaze along the Simi Valley Freeway that caused no property damage. But 
officials said the risk of brush fires will continue today and Wednesday as the 
Santa Ana winds persist. 
</P>
<P>
The state fire marshal's office has issued a "red flag warning" through 
Wednesday for all of Southern California because of the extreme fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
Fires scorched more than a dozen residences in Southern California and forced 
evacuation of 50 residences and a school. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Four residences were destroyed and two were damaged in Diamond Bar in Los 
Angeles County in a blaze that started in brush and burned uphill to houses 
worth about $350,000 each, Los Angeles County fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
High winds also spread a fire that erupted in a garage at the rear of a 
150-unit townhouse complex in San Dimas to the wood-shake roofs of three 
residences, which Los Angeles County firefighters could not save. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside, at least 15 residences near the Santa Ana River received minor 
damage and at least 50 residences and a junior high school had to be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the Fire Department has called in off-duty firefighters to 
staff its four water-tender trucks, which provide water in remote locations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been sitting and waiting for the big one," said Sam Meier, a department 
spokeswoman. "So far, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
But Southern California Edison crews were busy Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are having several wind-related problems," said Mark Olson, Edison area 
manager for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
In Camarillo, the strong gusts blew down power distribution lines on Hobart 
Drive at 10:48 a.m., Olson said, cutting power to 3,670 customers. All but a 
few had power restored within 30 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The wind also played havoc with home-security systems as it rattled windows and 
doors, triggering dozens of false alarms. Sheriff's Lt. Kelli McIlvain said 
more than 80 false alarms were recorded in the Thousand Oaks and Moorpark 
areas, compared with 20 to 30 on a normal day. Winds began picking up about 1 
a.m. Monday, according to Meier of the Fire Department. By 3:30 a.m. 
temperatures had risen 20 degrees and humidity had plummeted from about 60% to 
10%, she said. The strong winds were expected to continue today and Wednesday, 
said Steve Burback, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana winds occur when air pressure is higher inland than it is over the 
ocean. The inland high pressure -- centered over southwest Idaho on Monday -- 
is pushing hot desert air to low-pressure areas over the Pacific, raising 
temperatures, sucking up moisture and stirring up dust and pollen. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lewis Kanter said the winds stir up local particulates and bring in 
sagebrush and tumbleweed pollen from the desert. "I've got a lady in the office 
who was perfectly fine until yesterday, when her asthma kicked in, apparently 
for no reason -- the no reason being Santa Ana winds." 
</P>
<P>
Kanter said most cases can be treated with cortisone, antihistamines and other 
anti-inflammatory drugs, although some asthma sufferers require 
hospitalization. He advised anyone with a respiratory problem to try to stay 
indoors with air-conditioning turned to the recirculate setting. 
</P>
<P>
Air-pollution levels in the county were well within the moderate range, but the 
normal pattern was reversed, said Philip Moyal, of the Ventura County Air 
Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura measured 52 on the district's pollution index Monday while Simi Valley, 
which usually has the county's highest pollution readings, came in at 38. Moyal 
predicted even higher levels for Ventura today. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Simi Valley measured 56 and Ventura's reading was 33, Moyal said. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the winds are pushing pollution more than 100 miles out to sea, 
which makes it less likely that the smog will drift back over the coastal areas 
when onshore breezes return, probably by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Another victim of Santa Ana winds is agriculture, Ventura County's biggest 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it, when Santa Anas come, it dries things up more than 
normal," said Lawrence Yee, county director of the UC Cooperative Extension 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
James Barker, whose family farms about 800 acres and runs a vegetable stand in 
Somis, said the dry winds burned the tops of his carrots, beets and radishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to buy a bunch of radishes with the tops shriveled and 
dehydrated," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
No wind-related traffic accidents were reported Monday, but the California 
Highway Patrol issued wind advisories until further notice for all of the 
county's highways. Jan Carr, a dispatcher supervisor at the CHP's Ventura 
office, said drivers of campers, trailers and other high-profile vehicles are 
advised to be especially careful.

<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and Councilwoman Ann Rock, both running for 
reelection, and council candidate Sandi Webb have raised more money than eight 
others vying for two council seats and the mayor's post on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, who is seeking a third term as mayor, reported the largest campaign 
fund, according to campaign statements filed with the city clerk's office. 
Stratton reported raising $8,364. The deadline for filing was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said about half of the money in his treasury stemmed from his 1988 
campaign. Contributions he received from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30 came largely 
from business owners and developers, including $750 from Ahmanson Developments 
Inc., $500 from the Ventura Pacific Capital Group and $250 from the Lusk Cos. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton's lone challenger, Alfred J. Wilson Sr., a retired Los Angeles bus 
driver, has raised $255, according to campaign statements. 
</P>
<P>
Council candidate Sandi Webb, a Simi Valley businesswoman, reported the second 
largest campaign fund with $7,750, including $6,000 in personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Rock, who is seeking her third term, has raised $6,582. About 
half of the money came from business owners and developers. The largest 
contribution -- $1,000 -- came from the Mid Valley Management Co. She also 
received $250 each from Blackstone Consultants and Walnut Court Development, 
and $200 from Dantona Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Mikels, a Simi Valley businesswoman and chairwoman of the Planning 
Commission, has raised $5,883, mostly from developers and business owners. Voit 
Development Co. contributed the largest amount, $1,000. Mithra Partnership and 
San Port Development each contributed $250. 
</P>
<P>
David McCormick, a Simi Valley businessman, reported $5,676 in loans and 
contributions from local businesses, including $500 from Simi Pacific Building 
Materials and the same amount from Conejo Enterprises Inc. McCormick 
contributed $1,000 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Harold Fick, who ran unsuccessfully for a county supervisor seat in 
the June primary, reported $3,850, nearly all of it his own. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn E. Maurer, a retired school teacher, has contributed $1,438 to her 
campaign. Candidate John Etter, an environmentalist, reported $1,406. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Bruce Kanegai and Kenneth Wenning reported that they will spend less 
than $1,000 on their campaigns. CARLOS V. LOZANO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OFFICERS SLIGHTLY HURT AS CAR IS STRUCK 
BROADSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two officers suffered minor injuries Monday when their patrol car was struck 
broadside by another car in a South Los Angeles intersection, authorities said.

MALIBU DEVELOPER, COASTAL COMMISSION TO SQUARE OFF AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer, whose permit to build four luxury homes was revoked by the 
California Coastal Commission after he was accused of grading 14 times the 
amount of earth his permit allowed, has revealed a new plan for his Malibu 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Sheldon Gordon now wants to build three mansions in the exclusive 
Sweetwater Mesa area, including a 20,000-square-foot home with two guest 
houses, three swimming pools, two tennis courts, a two-story horse stable and a 
barn. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Coastal Commission hinted last week that the commission's 
staff is very likely to recommend against the latest proposal to develop the 
184-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
The state panel, which meets this week in Monterey, is scheduled to consider 
the matter on Wednesday. "I doubt that the recommendation will differ radically 
from what it has been in the past," planner Diane Landry said of the 
commission's tough stand against Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who owns the Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel in West Hollywood was accused of 
grading 560,000 cubic yards of earth, despite a permit that was to have limited 
the grading to 40,000 cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
In revoking his permit in June, several commissioners angrily accused Gordon of 
misleading them about the amount of grading involved and said they never would 
have approved the work had they known. 
</P>
<P>
The case has become a cause celebre for environmentalists, who hailed the 
revocation as a stern message to developers that the panel was ready to clamp 
down on accused violators of the state's 1976 Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearing is widely viewed as a test of the commission's will to deal 
with developers accused of illegal grading within the five-mile coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit against Gordon filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the coastal 
panel is seeking $1 million in civil penalties from Gordon., The suit also asks 
that he be barred from developing the property and that he repair the damage 
caused by the grading. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gordon has filed a lawsuit against the commission asking that the 
permit be reinstated. He contends that the commissioners acted unlawfully in 
revoking the permit without proof that he intentionally misled them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the revocation halted future development of the rugged hill property, 
the action has, until now, left unresolved what is to be done to restore the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents whose homes are near the property and who opposed the revocation 
have said that the $1 million Gordon says he has spent to restore some of the 
damage is not enough. They say that unless he is allowed to finish the project, 
heavy rains are likely to cause landslides in the exposed hills. 
</P>
<P>
Observers say that in deciding how to treat Gordon's latest proposal, the 
coastal panel's biggest challenge may be in balancing the punishment a majority 
believe he deserves with the unpleasant possibility that, if landslides occur, 
the commission itself may be the target of lawsuits by nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's lawyers and representatives of the Coastal Commission have been trying 
to negotiate a compromise for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources familiar with the negotiations, each side wants the other 
to drop its lawsuit as a condition to Gordon's being allowed to move ahead with 
his project. But the two sides are said to be far apart on the sanctions and 
the project's size. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's application to reinstate the permit was to have been heard by the 
commission last month. But its consideration was postponed at the last minute 
after the two sides agreed to try to settle the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last month, Joseph Petrillo, an attorney for Gordon, complained 
that the coastal panel was "trying to squeeze all the profit" out of his 
client's proposal as punishment for the grading. 
</P>
<P>
Petrillo said that, by recommending that Gordon be allowed to build homes on 
only a small portion of the property, the commission staff "seems bent on 
assuring that there is no way he can come out financially on the project." He 
said that his client has invested more than $10 million in the property, 
including the purchase price.

2 DRIVERS HELD AFTER 3-CAR CRASH HURTS 13 
</P>

<P>
Two Oxnard men driving separate vehicles were arrested on suspicion of drunk 
driving after they were involved in a three-vehicle accident involving 13 
people, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Granados, 33, was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
released after posting $2,500 bail, said Officer Lisa Ragone of the Oxnard 
Police Department. Javier Castro, 35, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor 
drunk driving and released on his own recognizance, Ragone said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Sunday at 5:38 p.m. when Granados, driving west in a 1985 
GMC Jimmy with nine passengers, tried to make a left turn from Wooley Road to 
Escalon Drive without yielding to oncoming traffic, Ragone said. 
</P>
<P>
Granados' vehicle was struck by a Chevrolet pickup driven by Castro, who was 
driving east through the intersection on Wooley Road, Ragone said. The force of 
the impact pushed the Jimmy into a Datsun pickup driven by Peletisala Tau, 34, 
of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Tau's car, which had been stopped at a stop sign on Escalon Drive, spun around 
and crashed into a brick wall, Ragone said. Granados' vehicle also hit the wall 
and struck a light pole before coming to rest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During the accident, Granados' wife, Estella, 34, hit her head on the 
windshield, Ragone said. The couple's 1-year-old daughter, Casandra, was 
crushed between her mother and the dashboard, Ragone said. 
</P>
<P>
The three Granados family members, all riding in the front seat of the Jimmy, 
were extracted using rescue tools and taken to St. John's Regional Medical 
Center, Ragone said. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Granados was treated and arrested. Estella Granados was listed Monday in 
critical condition in the intensive care unit, and Casandra Granados remained 
in serious condition in the intensive care unit, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The seven people riding in the back of the Jimmy were taken to St. John's, 
treated and released, as was one passenger in Castro's truck, Ragone said. 
Castro was treated at the hospital and arrested, Ragone said. 
</P>
<P>
Tau was admitted to the hospital and listed in good condition Monday, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. CAROL WATSON

OXNARD'S 'WINDFALL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A windfall is defined as "an unexpected or undeserved stroke of good fortune." 
The Times unfortunately chose the word "windfall" to describe the potential 
increase in state and federal funding that the city of Oxnard may receive due 
to the preliminary population count released by the U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
As noted correctly by The Times, the preliminary count shows Oxnard with a 
population of 137,468 -- significantly higher than the State Department of 
Finance estimate of 129,980. However, this preliminary figure is neither 
unexpected nor undeserved. We have long maintained that Oxnard's population was 
severely undercounted in the 1980 census and, as a result, tax dollars that 
have been paid by Oxnard residents over the years have been flowing from our 
large, ethnically diverse, lower-income residents to other cities that have 
wealthier, easier-to-count communities. 
</P>
<P>
The correction of such an inequity can in no way be considered a "windfall," 
any more than the return of stolen property to its rightful owner would be a 
windfall for the victim of a theft. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Oxnard funded an aggressive program to reach out to our homeless, 
minority and non-English-speaking populations to encourage participation in the 
census, a program that still continues. 
</P>
<P>
It must be emphasized that the figures are preliminary, and that the census is 
not over yet. We are presently reviewing the housing-unit figures provided by 
the Census Bureau, and will be presenting to the bureau a response reflecting 
some concerns we have with their preliminary figures. For example, the figures 
from the Census Bureau assert that nearly 25% of the housing units in the 
Oxnard Shores area are vacant, and that more than 11% of the units in the city 
of Port Hueneme are vacant. We have questions about these figures, as well as 
concerns that all of the hundreds of doubled-up families (whose addresses we 
provided to the Census Bureau) be included in the final census count. 
</P>
<P>
If you or anyone you know hasn't been counted, call us at 984-4609, or the 
Census Bureau at 1-800-999-1990 (English) or 1-800-CUENTAN (Spanish) to make 
sure you are included.

CITY OKS REMOVAL OF GRASS, BENCHES AT HORTON PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weighing safety concerns against aesthetics, the San Diego City Council voted 
Monday to temporarily remove the benches and grass from Horton Plaza Park in an 
effort to rid the small, historic gathering spot of drunks and rowdies. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved unanimously, was an amended version of an earlier proposal 
under which downtown businesses will pay to replace the grass with 
drought-resistant flowers and to remove the benches that line three sides of 
the park to deprive undesirables of places to sit. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Central City Assn. plan endorsed by the council last summer, the 
benches were to be returned within six months, but the grass was not to be 
restored unless the landscaping changes were unsuccessful in improving the 
park's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
However, under the plan passed Monday, the grass, too, will be restored, even 
if the landscaping modifications -- expected to be completed within three 
months -- prove successful in discouraging loitering in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Area businesses have long complained that the park, on Broadway between 3rd and 
4th avenues, has become a haven for drunks and criminals whose drug dealing, 
panhandling and general unsavory demeanor scare away citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"This insures . . . that an important part of downtown will be available to 
more and more people," said Councilman Bob Filner, whose district includes 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Under the park redesign, a kiosk where food will be sold will open, other 
vendors will sell merchandise from pushcarts, and the park increasingly will be 
used for musical performances, art shows, book sales and organized luncheons 
intended to attract more pedestrians.

HEROIC ACTIONS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sept. 12, several of us stood with a neighbor and watched while her home 
burned to the ground. What took the Ventura County Fire Department so long to 
respond? The nearest fire station is only three minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems that all its men and equipment were busy elsewhere at a training 
drill. 
</P>
<P>
Once they did arrive, more time was wasted as they suited up and prepared hose 
lines. From our observation, no aggressive action was taken to suppress the 
fire, only to confine it to that structure. Why? 
</P>
<P>
The adjacent home was spared through the heroic efforts of a neighbor, an 
off-duty city fireman, who stayed on that roof watering it down until the Fire 
Department had hose lines going. He sustained first-degree burns on his face, 
arms and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Our hearts go out to our homeless neighbor. We're thankful she escaped unharmed 
but are very angry at her loss. This anger is not directed at the men and women 
who risk their lives fighting fires, but at the system that dictates how they 
do their job. It is a chilling and sobering thought to know that in time of 
need, help will be too little, too late.

DOLPHIN GROUP URGES BOYCOTT OF SEA WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Miami-based environmental group on Monday called for a boycott of all Sea 
World parks and all products produced by Anheuser-Busch because the company has 
refused to rid its five marine theme parks of "petting pool conditions" that 
the group says endanger dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The call for the boycott was made by the Dolphin Project, which was joined by 
three other animal protection groups, all of which allege that the giant beer 
company's parks regularly violate government restrictions by overcrowding 
dolphins in the pools and by putting too much chlorine in the water. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at a Beverly Hills hotel, Scott Trimingham, 
president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a group participating in 
the boycott, claimed that dolphins in cramped tanks constantly injure 
themselves as they butt up against each other, and that inordinately high 
chlorine levels have been causing the animals to go blind. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World executives contested the allegations, saying the pools meet 
government standards. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World parks' assistant zoological director, Brad Andrews, speaking at 
another news conference at the hotel, called the allegations false and said the 
activists are not qualified to comment on whether the dolphins' living 
conditions are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"The claims appear to be fabrications," Andrews said. "In the industry, the 
people making these comments are nonentities. . . . We would not allow anything 
abnormal to happen to the dolphins. The pools are adequate." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture letter addressed to Trimingham, 
who requested an investigation into the alleged suffering of dolphins being 
kept in petting tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, USDA officials said a pool at Sea World in San Diego complies 
with the agency's space stipulations. Still, Trimingham claimed that a pool at 
Sea World in Orlando, Fla., has failed to meet regulations. USDA officials also 
said the chlorine level in the two pools was acceptable by their standard. 
</P>
<P>
Even when government regulations are met, Trimingham contended, there is no 
guarantee the animals are being protected. 
</P>
<P>
He referred to USDA officials who formulate safety guidelines as "prostitute 
scientists" -- those working for, or associated with, the marine park industry. 
</P>
<P>
"By visiting Sea World, children have the opportunity to become acquainted with 
marine mammals and other ocean life, which is important in developing an 
awareness and concern for the future of these animals," said Michael J. Roarty, 
a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Companies in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational benefits of the interactive pools -- indeed all Sea Worlds' 
operations -- are important. . . . Sea World regularly receives letters from 
children saying that one of the things that they appreciate most about a visit 
to the parks is the chance to reach out and feed or touch a dolphin." 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest voices calling for the removal of the petting tanks has 
been Richard O'Barry, the trainer of dolphins that appeared in the 1960s 
television series "Flipper." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Flipper' was one of the best and worst things that has happened to 
dolphins," he said. The five dolphins O'Barry trained for the series helped to 
"create an awareness about dolphins and the ocean," he said, but they also 
"created an unnatural desire to hold and caress them." 
</P>
<P>
When several of the dolphins he trained died due to "captivity stress," he 
began lobbying against those who continued to train the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years, I was part of the problem," O'Barry said. "Now I'm on the other 
side of the fence." 
</P>
<P>
O'Barry said the boycott was raised after a yearlong call for the end of the 
petting pools. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now going after Anheuser-Busch in a way that they must take heed, 
through their consumers." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Anheuser-Busch marine parks have been reluctant to discontinue use 
of the petting pools, because of their appeal to an estimated 12.5 million 
visitors per year. Sea World officials acknowledged that the dolphin exhibits 
are among the parks' most popular. 
</P>
<P>
The brewing-industry giant bought Sea World in December, 1989, from Harcourt 
Brace Jovanovich for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott is aimed at the company's 17 different beer products, as well as 
its Eagle brand snack foods. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Sea World parks in San Diego and Orlando, Anheuser-Busch 
owns Sea Worlds in San Antonio, Tex., and Akron, Ohio. Dolphin Project 
representatives said the boycott also extends to Anheuser-Busch's other theme 
park in Tampa.

Planned Parenthood has asked the City Council of Santa Maria for $60,000 in 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood claims that it needs the money to help poor women. Why does 
it want to use HUD money? Is it right to take the funds provided for affordable 
housing for families and senior citizens, just so Planned Parenthood can 
continue the slaughter of 28 million unborn children? Are they really concerned 
about the poor? Planned Parenthood is the leading provider of abortion in the 
nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood receives millions of dollars from taxpayers' money. Do they 
still need more? What are they doing with the money?

GUSTY WIND FANS FIRE IN RECYCLABLE DEBRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wind-fanned fire engulfed an acre-size mound of paper and cardboard at a Sun 
Valley recycling firm Monday afternoon, sending up 200-foot flames and thick, 
black plumes of smoke visible throughout much of the San Fernando Valley, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported and the fire was contained in the yard of Sun Valley 
Paper Stock Inc. at 11166 Pendleton St., Los Angeles city Fire Department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gusty winds blew burning embers that spread the flames throughout the 
six-foot-high paper pile and sent blasts of hot air into nearby debris, 
igniting it. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind caused the fire to preheat the area and create gaseous fumes that 
erupted very rapidly," said Assistant Fire Chief Richard Olsen. "On a hot day 
like this, the fire just took off." 
</P>
<P>
As the first of 17 Fire Department companies arrived at the yard, fire raged 
over the pile of paper and inside two corrugated-metal warehouses containing 
rags, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, Olsen said. Firefighters battled the 
blaze with water that was chemically treated to quickly penetrate burning 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
Thick smoke obscured vision in the area, prompting fire officials to shut down 
several nearby streets, including busy Glenoaks Boulevard between Pendleton and 
Tuxford streets. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hernandez, a company employee, said he saw the blaze begin when sparks of 
unknown origin burst from an eight-foot-high pile of cardboard at the east end 
of the four-acre yard. He and several others ran for fire extinguishers and 
nearby water hoses, but in seconds the fire enveloped the debris, rendering 
their small hoses useless. 
</P>
<P>
"Flames were all over the place in a matter of seconds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fagan, one of the firm's owners, said his 20 employees safely evacuated 
the yard, where up to 500 tons of recyclable materials were stored. 
</P>
<P>
"We all scrambled," Fagan said. "There was an awful lot of flames everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was under investigation and no estimate of monetary 
damages was available. It took about 85 firefighters more than an hour to 
control the blaze, which was reported shortly after 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were expected to stay at the yard throughout the night, pouring 
water on the smoldering mounds of paper and rags. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going full bore," Olsen said. "At least an acre was on fire. At the peak 
of this fire flames were 200 feet high and the air was heavy with black smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Two Fire Department helicopters circled the area to ensure that embers had not 
ignited nearby structures and a brush-covered hillside about a quarter mile to 
the east. 
</P>
<P>
Fagan said he had not yet assessed damage to the firm's paper bailer and 
compacting machines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very bad day for us," he said.

CSUN URGED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO AMERICAN INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 30 protesters urged Cal State Northridge to address the problems of 
American Indian students, claiming 92% of them drop out because the university 
does not try hard enough to retain them. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the protesters want counselors to provide academic advice 
and organize activities for the 208 American Indians on campus. They also 
called on the university to recruit American Indian students. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also demanded that university administrators keep a promise 
made in May to provide the 20-member American Indian Student Assn. with more 
study and meeting space. The group currently shares a converted storage closet 
with another student organization, said protester Nancy Peterson-Walter, a 
former part-time anthropology instructor at Cal State Northridge who counseled 
American Indian students before leaving the university in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Aguirre, president of the American Indian Student Assn., said a survey by 
his organization showed that, on average, 45.5% of the campus' American Indian 
students drop out after their freshman year. Only 7.7% manage to graduate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics compiled by the university show that, of American Indian 
freshmen who enrolled in 1983, just 10% graduated. Overall, 45% of the students 
who enroll as freshmen go on to graduate, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that American Indian students on campus have a gathering 
place," Peterson-Walter said. "The number of American Indian students is 
decreasing at a higher rate than all other ethnic minority groups, but the 
population is increasing. If there's anything that's desperately needed, it's 
higher education." 
</P>
<P>
American Indians are the smallest minority group on campus, making up only 
0.69% of the 30,000-student population, according to registration statistics 
compiled last spring. An interdisciplinary program begun in the late 1970s 
offers a minor in American Indian studies. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Asians, who recently won approval for creation of a full 
department of Asian-American studies, make up 12% of the student population. 
</P>
<P>
Registration records indicate that 11% of the university's students identify 
themselves as Latino and 5% as black. Pan-African and Chicano studies 
departments were established in 1969 in the wake of student and community 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Jacobs, associate vice president for academic services, said the 
university plans to hire two American Indian counselors to recruit American 
Indian high school and transfer students. She also said the School of Social 
and Behavioral Sciences, which oversees the American Indian studies minor, is 
considering American Indian applicants for the position of educational equity 
coordinator, which will oversee relations with minority groups in the school. 
</P>
<P>
University spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said she sympathized with the protesters 
but said American Indians already have access to academic counseling through 
the American Indian studies program. She also said she doubted the 
demonstrators' sincerity, because they held the protest at the same time that 
other minority groups were gathering on campus to discuss ways to improve 
ethnic and race relations. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions were part of events this month in honor of the university's 
cultural diversity and racial awareness. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators targeted Columbus Day to protest what they called the 
historic oppression of American Indians by whites. 
</P>
<P>
"1492: That was the beginning for European Americans but the end for American 
Indian people," protester Rene Orozco said.

BRUSH FIRE SWEEPS THROUGH JUNKYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving Otay Mesa brush fire burned 60 to 80 acres Monday afternoon, 
swept through a junkyard and temporarily caused the closure of Brown Field, the 
small commercial airport near the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city firefighters and California Department of Forestry crews used 
air tankers to help douse the blaze, which began about 2:30 p.m. near Heritage 
and Otay Valley roads, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was expected to be controlled by late Monday, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned about 100 cars at the junkyard, a fire department spokeswoman 
said. There were no other reports of damage and no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Brown Field was closed for about an hour to clear the air space for air tankers 
used to help douse the fire, an airport official said. The airport, immediately 
east of the fire, reopened late Monday.

ANGRY OVER 'VISITORS'

In response to "Baby Boom Pushes a Hospital to Limit":

<P>
I feel that our public maternity wards are being abused by "visitors" from 
other countries. Last year, a relative of a friend came to Los Angeles under 
the presumption of visiting a family member. 
</P>
<P>
This man and his wife arrived in L.A. approximately two weeks before her due 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had not received proper prenatal care in her native country. She was 
also in need of Medi-Cal assistance to defray the cost of her maternity stay. 
Somehow, the proper paperwork was completed and this young lady delivered her 
baby boy by C-section at Olive View Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
What really angered me was the fact that these so-called "visitors" returned to 
their country about three weeks after the birth of their son. 
</P>
<P>
Why are we, the taxpayers, left with these outrageous bills? We can't even take 
care of our own Medi-Cal patients, but we are willing to pay for outsiders to 
deliver their babies in American hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
We should seriously investigate why we taxpayers are paying for these births 
and supporting these visitors.

Mayor Bradley is right in his reaction to the City Council's rejection of domes 
and minarets for a proposed mosque in Granada Hills as "an affront to religious 
freedom." What Bradley fails to mention is that it is also an affront to 
architectural freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Angelenos have been blessed with the most bizarre and 
free-wheeling of architecture: the Chinese Theater, Clifton's Cafeteria, the 
facade of which was a tropical waterfall, the Egyptian Theater in the image of 
a Pharaoh's tomb, and the Firestone Tire Co. building that paid structural 
homage to the ancient Assyrians. 
</P>
<P>
These buildings and others like them were a delight to visit and part of our 
architectural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
If such structural adventures as the new Disney building facade with its seven 
dwarfs are right, what makes domes and minarets wrong, regardless of religious 
intent?

SERVICES ARE TODAY FOR CAPT. WILLIAM MUNROE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Services will be today for Retired Navy Capt. William Robert Munroe Jr., who 
helped pioneer the design and use of guided missiles for Navy ships. Munroe, 
70, died Oct. 2 in La Jolla after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be at 3 p.m. at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in Point 
Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Munroe participated in the design of the Regulus I and II missiles, which 
earned him the command of the Charles Francis Adams, the first Navy ship 
designed and built as a guided missile destroyer. 
</P>
<P>
Munroe was born in Los Angeles and educated at St. Alban's School in Washington 
and at the University of Virginia and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
His Navy career began in 1942 and spanned 30 years during which he commanded a 
variety of Navy vessels. 
</P>
<P>
He was awarded five Bronze Stars, receiving the first for action in the Pacific 
during World War II. During the Korean War, his command took part in several 
decisive actions that resulted in his being decorated with the Distinguished 
Service Cross, one of Britain's highest military honors. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Munroe served as director of operations and planning for 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He received several presidential citations and naval 
awards for his strategic and tactical work. He retired in 1979 and moved from 
Washington to La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Munroe is survived by his wife, Carlota Chapman-Munroe; a son, William Robert 
Munroe III of New York, and a daughter, Maria Munroe-Browne of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial contributions may be sent to: Scripps Memorial Hospital, 9888 Genesee 
Ave., La Jolla CA 92037, or to The City of St. Jude, 2048 W. Fairview Ave.,

HENNING SEEKS WAY TO RECHARGE THE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The philosophy is simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Our approach," Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said, "is to create 
havoc." 
</P>
<P>
That certainly happened Sunday in Pittsburgh. The only problem is the defense 
created more havoc for the Chargers (1-4) than it did for the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers lost, 36-14, and all you really need to know is that the Steelers 
hadn't scored an offensive touchdown since last year up until the Chargers came 
knocking. The leftovers Monday morning weren't any more appetizing than 
Sunday's main course. 
</P>
<P>
"That thing doesn't look a lot better on film than it did in the game," Coach 
Dan Henning said. "We're not playing as well as we had been playing." 
</P>
<P>
Rather amazingly, it is the defense that has played a big role in the past two 
losses. This is the same defense that was supposed to make people around the 
NFL marvel -- not to mention overlook the deficiencies of an offense still in 
the developmental stages. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, Charger defensive players are defending themselves more than 
any opposing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
And Henning isn't coming to their rescue. It was pointed out that the offense, 
which has scored 14 points in the past two games, hasn't given the defense much 
of a break. (Time of possession on Sunday: Chargers 20:53, Steelers 39:07). 
</P>
<P>
Henning responded: "That, to be crude, is a bunch of bull . . . I've heard that 
for years. To get off the field you have to stop them, don't you? It has 
nothing to do with the offense. It has to do with the defense." 
</P>
<P>
It has to do with not being able to stop an opponent on third down. Opponents 
have converted 19 times on 28 third-down plays in the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
It has to do with inexperience. Linebacker Junior Seau is learning as he goes, 
playing a different position than he did at USC. Rookie cornerback Donald Frank 
is learning with each burning. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Henry Rolling is filling in for the injured Billy Ray Smith, a 
player who stabilizes the unit. And two men, Les Miller and George Hinkle, are 
being used at nose tackle to replace Joe Phillips, who is out with multiple 
injuries after being assaulted by three men in Mission Beach two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of trouble came nine days ago in the Chargers' 17-7 loss to the 
Houston Oilers. Allowing 17 points looks pretty good against the run-and-shoot 
offense, and nobody was talking much about defensive mistakes. But Henning was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week there was a great deal of perception around here that we had played 
well defensively," he said. "I didn't feel that way, and it was kind of the 
same way it was in this game. The points were different, but that had nothing 
to do with the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn doesn't think any of this can be attributed to a lack of effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's an intensity problem," he said. "I don't think you could 
accuse them of loafing. I think that sometimes maybe their attention wanders." 
</P>
<P>
What's the solution? First thing on the agenda, says Lynn, is to throw out the 
fancy stuff and return to your basic "going after them, dogging them, blitzing 
them." The "doodads" are out. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to stick with the same personnel. "These are the guys we selected," 
Lynn said. "I know that the veterans can play. I have no question this will be 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it happens soon enough to salvage the season remains to be seen. The 
defense wasn't supposed to be a concern. It was supposed to to take care of 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "There's no doubt about that. 
We've got to go out and play with a sense of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
Said linebacker Leslie O'Neal: "All of this is a learning experience. You've 
got to go through some negative times to appreciate the good times."

BEATHARD: HENNING'S JOB IS SECURE

With the Chargers off to a 1-4 start, the questions about Coach Dan Henning's 
job security are beginning to surface. Henning, who replaced Al Saunders before 
last season, has a record of 7-14 with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard gave his coach a vote of confidence 
Monday, after a 36-14 loss to a Steeler team that hadn't scored an offensive 
touchdown this season before Sunday's meeting with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have all the confidence in the world in Dan," Beathard said. "That's a 
thought that's never crossed my mind. I think Dan's going to succeed. I don't 
have any doubts about Dan Henning." 
</P>
<P>
In Beathard's mind, the losses have nothing to do with Henning's ability to 
motivate. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, he's terrific," Beathard said. "I can't tell you how good he is 
talking in front of these players. I mean the guy has been just fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
While he was at it, Beathard also gave his vote to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"As bad as I felt yesterday, I still don't feel much different about the team," 
he said. "I think we have a much better team than we saw (Sunday), or that we 
saw so far this season. We just have to work our way through this." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, he says, is one of emotion, or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to win in this league it takes emotion," he said. "All I hear 
everywhere, and I can't argue with it, is we aren't playing with emotion. I 
think even teams that I don't think our as good as we are have won because of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Ronnie Harmon suffered a mild concussion Sunday when he tackled 
Steeler cornerback Rod Woodson on a kickoff return. He is expected to be ready 
for Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Safety Vencie Glenn, who sprained 
his ankle Sunday, is also expected to be ready to play. DON PATTERSON

LUGINBILL MAKES LINEUP CHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
The aftermath of Saturday's 52-51 loss to Wyoming brought lineup changes Monday 
by Aztec Coach Al Luginbill, but they were minor compared to the ones made 
after the Brigham Young loss two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Marcus Preciado will replace the injured Johnny Walker (sprained foot) 
at free safety, although Luginbill said he was already considering making a 
change at the position. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Pieri, Gary Taylor and Marlon Andrews will compete for the starting 
cornerback positions in practice this week: Taylor and Andrews started last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill also announced that Patrick Rowe will be the primary return man on 
the kickoff team. He will flanked by Larry Maxey and Kipp Jeffries. Receiver 
Merton Harris had been a member of the kickoff return team. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec notes: Running back Tommy Booker, who has missed the last three games 
with an ankle injury, ran well in practice and should play Saturday at UCLA. 
Luginbill said he is still not sure who will start at running back: Booker, 
T.C. Wright, Maxey or Curtis Butts. DAVE McKIBBEN

PAIR HAS THE COMPETITION COVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Kathy Olsen and Suzette Wehunt, the most difficult part of becoming 
entrepreneurs was cutting the umbilical cord to their former employers, leaving 
behind a dependable, weekly paycheck to go into business for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three years after stepping out into the great unknown of 
self-employment, the twosome seems to have made the right move. The 
four-employee company, Computer Covers Unlimited, a manufacturer of dust covers 
and other accessories for personal computers, has grown rapidly to a sales 
level of $400,000 for 1990, up from $26,000 when the pair took over. 
</P>
<P>
Despite formidable competition, the company has carved a niche by paying close 
attention to product quality and individualized service. Clients include a high 
number of school districts and government entities, in addition to computer 
retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
All of the company's computer covers, trademarked Nycov, are cut from raw nylon 
at its Clairemont Mesa plant and sewn by independent contractor seamstresses in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Olsen and Wehunt earned the distinction of becoming the first 
beneficiaries of a $25,000 annual San Diego Women Business Owners Grant, given 
by sponsoring organizations that include Women's Enterprises, the U.S. Small 
Business Administration and Southern California Women for Business Ownership. 
</P>
<P>
They beat out 100 entrants to win the award, gaining the favor of a panel of 
judges that included local businesswomen Jenny Craig, Gail Stoorza-Gill, Joyce 
Bonneau, Ingrid Croce and Judi Sheppard Missett, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The grant money came from dozens of donors, including Jenny Craig 
International, General Dynamics, Wells Fargo Bank, Union Bank, Avon Products 
and First California Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The award is meant to highlight the success of women-owned businesses and 
provide them with capital to develop specific business plans and products, said 
Women's Enterprises President Joann Mockbee. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, 40, and Wehunt, 39, acknowledged that their decision to buy Computer 
Covers Unlimited in early 1988 from its previous owner was a risky venture. 
Both left jobs with salaries of more than $40,000 of year. 
</P>
<P>
But both were debt-free, single -- -- Olsen at the time was a divorced mother 
of a teen-age son -- -- and looking to make career changes. Of comfort was the 
fact that the company they were buying had a product already on the market, 
although sales were at exceedingly low levels. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen left a job she had held for six years in the finance department of IVAC 
Corp. of San Diego, where she had specialized in computerizing office 
functions. Wehunt had spent eight years in a marketing position with Clark 
Security Products, a San Diego-based wholesale distributor of locksmith 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The two met as members of an investment club and joined forces as consultants 
in their off hours. The previous owner of Computer Covers Unlimited hired them 
as consultants, and a year later offered to sell them his company. 
</P>
<P>
"We had fallen in love with the product line and with its purpose, which is to 
protect the investment in a computer and the people who use them," Wehunt said. 
The market looked as though it could be fertile if they could accentuate 
individual attention to clients. 
</P>
<P>
The company's covers were made of lightweight nylon that allowed personal 
computers to "breathe" after being turned off. Other plastic coverings trapped 
heat inside, shortening the life of the machines, Wehunt said. The company says 
that only three of the 40,000 or so covers it has sold in the past three years 
have been returned for faulty manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The company's product line has been expanded to include keyboard protectors and 
radiation screens for terminals, but both of those items are manufactured by 
outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
The women put up no capital -- they had none -- but agreed to pay the seller of 
the company a royalty on future sales. The company they acquired had $15,000 in 
inventory -- about half of it obsolete -- plus 1,000 yards of material and 
$2,000 in receivables. 
</P>
<P>
The company grew mainly through an aggressive direct sales approach to high 
volume buyers, including school districts and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference I have seen in their covers is they are made of nylon as 
opposed to clear plastic covers, which get hot from the machines and crack," 
said Kim Glemser, a buyer for the San Diego Unified School District in charge 
of computers, software and accessories for the district's 165 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They do have lots of competition. Just about everyone offers computer covers," 
Glemser said. "But their stuff is better quality and they are local. In case 
there is a problem, they can come and service the account more easily." 
</P>
<P>
Manjula Jain, vice president of purchasing at Byte &amp; Floppy Computers 
retail store in Kearny Mesa, said her store carries Computer Covers Unlimited 
products because of their high quality. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been carrying them for five years. They are custom-made and the 
quality is good. They are not unique -- there are several people who make the 
covers, but (Computer Covers Unlimited's) quality has been good. The service is 
very good. We don't have to do any returns." 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to use the $25,000 grant to help expand its market from 
mainly San Diego County to other cities on the West Coast, Wehunt said.

<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 58 points last week, gained an 
additional 13 points Monday on low volume, according to Irving Katz, director 
of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The gain was a "surprise because the budget resolution is still in disarray as 
Congress works to come up with some form of a budget-cutting package and 
government remains on hold," Katz said. "In addition, unemployment has risen, 
the dollar is at new lows, war threatens in the Mideast and the deficit remains 
unmanageable." 
</P>
<P>
"To all of that, you add consumer confidence that remains low, retail sales 
that evidently will make poor comparisons to last year and you have indications 
that the economy is entering a recession," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Most San Diego stocks remained near their year lows in recent days, Katz said. 
Last week three stocks -- Medical Imaging Centers, Molecular Biosystems and 
Xytronyx -- moved up more than a point. 
</P>

<P>
The sound of his electric guitar probes through space like some futuristic 
laser weapon. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Bill Frisell, who plays Elario's tonight at 8 and 10, has merged 
influences from Wes Montgomery, Jim Hall, Jimi Hendrix, country-Western and 
be-bop into a fresh, eclectic brew that has critics hailing the emergence of a 
guitar hero for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell is revered among music reviewers. Nearly every project he touches rates 
five stars, whether it's jazz with drummer Paul Motian, whacked out make overs 
of movie music with saxophonist John Zorn's band, Naked City, or five albums of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
His newest recording, "Is That You," includes only drummer Joey Baron from 
Frisell's regular band. The music consists of nine originals plus warped 
versions of the Aretha Franklin hit "Chain of Fools" and Henry Mancini's movie 
theme, "The Days of Wine and Roses." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell's last album with his band was the 1989 "Before We Were Born." Like 
Frisell's playing, the instrumentation presents a new twist. Baron and Kermit 
Driscoll hold down traditional drums and bass positions, but cellist Hank 
Roberts adds unusual new colors. 
</P>
<P>
"He can cover such a wide range of functions," Frisell explained. "He can play 
bass (parts). Or play in the melody range where I am, or in the middle. So his 
function can be almost anything. That's actually true of everyone in the band. 
Kermit can play melodies, and Joey even plays some melodies on drums. 
</P>
<P>
"But more than the instrumentation, it's the person that I choose. Musically we 
relate on a high level, but we're also close friends. That's true with everyone 
in the band. I've been playing with Hank and Kermit since 1975. The band didn't 
really start until five years ago, but I played a lot with them over the years, 
so we already had a pretty strong connection." 
</P>
<P>
Always in search of freshness and spontaneity, Frisell includes little of his 
past material in his live shows with the group. Instead, he is using this tour, 
which opened Oct. 3 in Oakland, to develop music for an album he plans to 
record later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to play something new just about every day," Frisell said. "We're 
recording in the middle of this tour, and I want to do it very quickly and have 
it represent what the band is like live." 
</P>
<P>
Besides averaging an album a year of his own, Frisell keeps busy playing a 
variety of other sessions. In the past, these have included albums with Living 
Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, Power Tools (including drummer Ronald Shannon 
Jackson), saxophonist Jan Garbarek, bassist Eberhard Weber and drummer Billy 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, Frisell will work with Motian on an album of music by the late 
pianist Bill Evans. And a new album with Zorn is due early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned is a session pairing the risk-taking Frisell and such longtime 
associates as bassist Charlie Haden with saxophonist David Sanborn, whose music 
has generally had a broader, more commercial appeal than Frisell's. The meeting 
could bring new listeners to Frisell while expanding Sanborn's musical 
horizons. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another album will feature Frisell with clarinetist Don Byron. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Frisell originally set out to be a clarinetist himself. He played the 
horn seriously through high school in Denver, and only goofed around on guitar 
as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
In the late sixties, he heard Montgomery for the first time and began thinking 
more seriously about the guitar. He played clarinet through two years of 
studying music at the University of Northern Colorado, then hooked up with 
guitar instructor Dale Bruning, who exposed him to the jazz of Charlie Parker, 
Monk and Hall, all important influences. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell saw Hendrix in concert twice during the late '60s, but wasn't hit with 
the full impact of the music until years later: the inventive uses of echo and 
feedback, the slithering jazz-based runs, the slurred, plaintive blues cries. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more impressed with the fact that he was destroying his equipment," 
Frisell said. "The whole sound was so radical, it's taken a long time for 
people to figure out what he was doing. I wasn't that far along in my playing 
at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Some young guitarists start out playing rock and gravitate later toward jazz, 
but Frisell took a different path. From 1969 to 1974, he was dedicated to jazz, 
even though a part of him wanted to follow in Hendrix' tracks. That part came 
out of the closet for good in 1975, when Frisell heard fellow guitarist Mark 
Miller playing loud and aggressively in a small club, crossing freely between 
jazz, rock and other forms. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing that happened to me is I became open to any kind of 
music," Frisell said. "I always feel uncomfortable with labels and categories. 
I don't think they're very healthy. A few years ago, I figured out it was all 
potentially good. Rather than saying I'm rock or jazz, I don't know what to 
call it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell completed a program in music at the Berklee School of Music in Boston 
during the mid-1970s, then lived in Belgium for a year, recording his first 
album with German bassist Weber. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Frisell has played on nearly 50 albums. Yet, because his music is so 
unconventional, he gets virtually no exposure on commercial radio and remains 
relatively unknown to a large number of music fans. 
</P>
<P>
On this tour, he is playing many cities across the country for the first time, 
including San Diego. While he might spy some curious expressions on the faces 
of people hearing his music for the first time, he doesn't pay much attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more focused on the playing, the guys in the band. I definitely feel the 
energy the audience is putting out. I guess I get it more from what people tell 
me later. Someone will come up to me and say that when we started out, they 
didn't know what was going on, but then they got into it. If people give the 
music enough time, keep an open mind and listen to it a whole night, they 
usually end up liking it."

NEW HISTORY CURRICULUM STIRS PASSIONATE DISSENT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STATE PREPARES TO CHOOSE UNIFIED TEXTS, BUT ETHNIC GROUPS BATTLE FOR

<TEXT>
<P>
As the state Board of Education prepares to consider new history textbooks for 
California public schools this week, a fundamental question underlies much of 
the discussion: 
</P>
<P>
Is it still possible to write a single history for all Americans -- one that 
weaves together all of the ethnic, racial and religious experiences that have 
helped forge the United States? Or have California and the nation gone so far 
down the path of ethnic separatism that common links no longer can be taught? 
</P>
<P>
The question arises because the new books, as they have moved through the 
state's textbook adoption process, have encountered passionate protests by 
blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans, American Indians and fundamentalist 
Christians, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these groups wants to tell its version of U.S. and world history. Some 
would like to add "facts" disputed by some historians, while others insist that 
embarrassing material be ignored or minimized. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, the state board is likely to approve the textbooks 
because they are essential elements in an effort -- being watched around the 
country -- to breathe more life into the teaching of history in California 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum is being tested in a few school districts and, if adopted, 
will not be in widespread use for another year or two. It calls for much more 
instruction in U.S. and world history at earlier ages, puts a renewed emphasis 
on geography and includes instruction at every grade level in the history of 
religion, a subject often avoided because it is controversial. There is also 
much discussion about democracy -- how difficult it has been to achieve and 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"The California curriculum is an improvement in every way," said Gilbert T. 
Sewall, director of the American Textbook Council, which seeks to improve the 
quality of social studies textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
If the board approves the books at its meeting Friday, the battleground will 
shift to local school boards which must decide whether to buy the books. 
Protests are expected in large urban districts with heavy minority enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
Many critics concede that the books -- Houghton Mifflin social studies for 
kindergarten through eighth grade, and an eighth-grade book published by Holt, 
Rinehart &amp; Winston -- contain far more information about racial and 
religious minorities than earlier textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not whether people are included in the books or not," said Joyce 
E. King, a black woman who cast a "no" vote when the Houghton Mifflin and Holt, 
Rinehart &amp; Winston textbooks were approved, 10 to 3, by the state 
Curriculum Commission in July. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fundamental attitude that predominates in these books and that is 
not understood," said King, an associate professor and director of teacher 
education at Santa Clara University. 
</P>
<P>
That "fundamental attitude" is largely white and European, according to King 
and other black critics, who say the historical achievements of whites are 
over-emphasized, while those of nonwhites are ignored or given superficial 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
King, who was born and educated in California, said she did not learn about the 
Harlem Renaissance, the 1920s blossoming of black art, music and literature, 
until her junior year of college when she was a Stanford University student 
studying in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Some black educators want to supplement, or even replace, what they call 
"Eurocentric" history with an "Afrocentric" curriculum that stresses the 
accomplishments of blacks, especially of African-Americans. They contend that 
such a course of study would improve both the academic performance and the 
self-esteem of black youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
While many educators agree that textbooks have ignored or minimized the 
contributions of blacks and other minority groups, some call this new ethnic 
approach "happy history" or "feel-good history," which they say would be as 
much a disservice to black students as the discriminatory texts of the past 
were to whites. 
</P>
<P>
They also believe that teaching several different ethnic histories, instead of 
a unified U.S. history, could contribute to an unraveling of American society. 
</P>
<P>
"Pluralism is a positive value," Diane Ravitch, professor of history and 
education at Teachers College, Columbia University, recently wrote in the 
American Scholar, "but it is also important that we preserve a sense of an 
American community -- a society and a culture to which we all belong." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no overall community with an agreed-upon vision of liberty and 
justice, if all we have is a collection of racial and ethnic cultures lacking 
any common bonds, then we have no means to mobilize public opinion on behalf of 
people who are not members of our particular group," Ravitch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Said state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, "The question is, do we keep 
the society together or do we break up into tribal warfare?" 
</P>
<P>
But some who stress the ethnic approach to history dispute the idea of "common 
bonds." 
</P>
<P>
"These common values that people talk about are really the white man's values," 
said Herbert Kohl, a white author and educator. "There is this Greek, 
Eurocentric notion that there are values that come from the West against which 
the whole world should be judged. That simply isn't so. There are other values 
that aren't European that have equal merit." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA and chair of the Curriculum 
Commission subcommittee that supervised the textbook adoption process, said a 
new approach to history was badly needed because "kids are abysmally ignorant 
about history, a fact that has been confirmed by every major national 
assessment in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
California "wiped the slate clean," wrote new curriculum guidelines, then asked 
publishers to come up with textbooks to match the new guidelines. Most 
publishers declined, but Houghton Mifflin produced a "marvelous series -- it is 
not perfect but it is a great improvement over what is in the schools now," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we are seeing a power play on every side," Crabtree added. "If everything 
is going to turn out to be a bloody battle over the curriculum and over every 
word in the textbooks, then it will destroy the system." 
</P>
<P>
Several concerns have been raised in letters and at public hearings of the 
Curriculum Commission and the State Board of Education. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Representatives of several Jewish organizations said Judaism is subjected to 
a more critical analysis than Christianity in the Houghton Mifflin series. They 
also objected to references in the sixth-grade book to the participation of 
Jews in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
* Muslim speakers said treatment of the roots of Islam in the seventh-grade 
book is inadequate and some suggested that only a Muslim author could write an 
accurate account. 
</P>
<P>
* Henry Der, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, said the 
frequently brutal treatment of Chinese railroad workers in the American West is 
given scant attention. "We do not want 'ethnic history,' " Der said. "We want 
accurate history for all children of all races. We do not want to be 
marginalized." 
</P>
<P>
* Sam Rios, director of Chicano Studies at California State University, 
Sacramento, said the Houghton Mifflin series "does an injustice" to 
Mexican-American history, although Latinos have been less specific than blacks 
in outlining alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
* Representatives of several gay and lesbian groups complained that their 
organizations are excluded from the history texts. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest criticisms have come from blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Some African-American educators and scholars contend that ancient Egypt, the 
source of much that is valued in Western civilization, was a black African 
nation, not the multicolored, multiracial society that has been portrayed in 
most histories. 
</P>
<P>
Gary B. Nash, professor of history at UCLA and one of the authors of the 
Houghton Mifflin series, said this argument "is simply not accepted by most 
African historians, black or white." 
</P>
<P>
The debate is not surprising to Nash, who described history as "a form of 
property" that has been "generally used by elites" to control what is known 
about their societies. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've seen since the 1960s," Nash said, "is a massive redistribution of 
the property of history. It is no longer exclusively the property of white 
males. We are hearing from many groups -- blacks, Asians, Latinos, women, even 
gays and lesbians, who all want to erase this historical amnesia." 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge for people like me is to weave all these stories together in an 
accurate and balanced way," he said. "In order to do that, you have to decide 
how much attention to pay to what, or you would wind up with a book you had to 
carry around in a wheelbarrow."

SEPARATISM COULD LEAD TO CIVIL WAR, GORBACHEV SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: UNLESS NATIONALIST CHALLENGES ARE MET, HE WARNS, THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY WILL BECOME IRRELEVANT.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Monday that the failure to halt the 
growing separatism among the Soviet Union's ethnic republics could thrust the 
country into civil war and disintegration such as that in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, opening a meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central 
Committee, also urged party members to recognize the country's urgent need to 
develop a market economy -- even if it means the abandonment of their long-held 
views on what socialism is. 
</P>
<P>
And he offered to form "a coalition with all progressive and patriotic forces," 
effectively sharing power with the country's emerging democratic movements on 
the basis of an "anti-crisis" program to win broader support for the tough 
reforms ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Battling to reassert his leadership in the midst of a national crisis of 
confidence, Gorbachev told the party leaders, gathered from around the country 
for a two-day strategy session, that unless they quickly meet nationalist and 
economic challenges, the party will soon become irrelevant and probably lose 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The most important task for the country's 18 million Communists is to preserve 
the Soviet Union's integrity as a state and "resist pressure from separatist 
forces," Gorbachev said, according to a text of his speech provided by the 
official Soviet news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be frank," he declared. "If these tendencies are not overcome and are 
permitted to develop further, the country could face a real threat of 
'Lebanonization' and all the well-known consequences of it." 
</P>
<P>
"Separatists" are creating "an atmosphere of fear and terror," he continued, 
and "in these conditions people are afraid to say what they think." 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of a new federal political structure, allowing the Soviet Union's 
different ethnic groups maximum autonomy but preserving the country's unity, is 
"gaining decisive importance," Gorbachev said. "Practically everything boils 
down to it." 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not elaborate on his offer to form an "anti-crisis" coalition, 
he implied a new willingness to work with nationalist and democratic movements 
outside of the party on the basis of preserving the Soviet Union and 
establishing a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's message was not new, but there was added urgency in his words at 
the Kremlin meeting, for the country's economy is disintegrating almost daily, 
political order is breaking down, much of the government is paralyzed and 
social unrest is mounting. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Ivashko, the party's deputy general secretary, cited the collapsing 
economy, including the failure to curb inflation, the decline in industrial 
production and difficulties in bringing in the fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature of our long-seriously-ill society has reached a critical 
point," Ivashko said. "Shortages are all pervasive; speculation and price rises 
that have hit consumers poison the lives of millions of Soviet people every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is a loss of confidence -- in the reform program, in 
Gorbachev, in the nation's ability to cope with its problems -- and Gorbachev's 
own leadership, both as president and party chief, is being questioned openly. 
</P>
<P>
"The capacity of the president to remain in the center, which I admired in 
March, does not inspire me with the same delight today," Irina Ovchinnikova, a 
political commentator for the newspaper Izvestia, wrote last week in a 
front-page article. "Like many others, I would prefer more definite, decisive 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the party leadership as lacking energy and ideas, a political 
scientist from Uzbekistan in Soviet Central Asia asked in the party newspaper 
Pravda on Monday "whether the Communist Party will be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
"It may well happen that not only the party but also the Soviet Union itself 
will fall apart," Ruben Safarov wrote, warning that the country is in danger of 
breaking up before a new treaty of union can be concluded by the republics. 
"Then there will be no one to sign the much-touted new treaty." 
</P>
<P>
And another political scientist, writing in Izvestia on Monday, said: "The 
moment of truth has come for Gorbachev and his team. Maneuvering between the 
right and the left has run out of steam. Continuation of this line may result 
in the president falling behind and never catching up again. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what happened in Eastern Europe to a lot of leaders who started the 
reforms but failed to drop the old stereotypes and obsolete political course 
fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, replying to such direct and unprecedented criticism, urged the party 
to redeem its promises of sweeping economic reforms, starting with the 
development of a market economy governed by supply and demand and based on 
private as well as state and collective ownership of property. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary reason for our many economic and social difficulties is the 
state's monopoly on property," Gorbachev said, laying the new political creed 
he wants the party to adopt. "That turns property into no one's and undermines 
the motivation for harder work and economic initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an understanding of the need for multiple forms of ownership; when we 
approach the practical problem there is, unexpectedly, a lack of understanding 
that grows and becomes an obstacle." 
</P>
<P>
Although the party's 28th congress approved a fundamental transformation of the 
economy after much debate in July, many in its ranks are now balking, Gorbachev 
said, and the whole reform program is in risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the whole problem in the inertia of old thinking," Gorbachev said. "In 
this, I see the danger that presently threatens the party -- the danger of 
losing the initiative when changes are overdue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"All our previous ideology presented socialism as the direct opposition to the 
market and view recognition of the market as an encroachment on socialism. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we are encroaching on socialism," he continued, "but only that socialism 
that was built bureaucratically and under which the country veered off the path 
it embarked upon (with the Bolshevik Revolution) in 1917." 
</P>
<P>
Justifying the changes in ideological terms, he drew a historical parallel 
between these reforms and the New Economic Program launched in the 1920s by V. 
I. Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, arguing that this program is necessary to save 
the socialist cause and the Soviet Union as a state. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in his parallel, however, was a comparison between the opponents of 
the current reforms and those party leaders, notably the late dictator Josef 
Stalin, who undermined and then killed Lenin's program. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev pledged that the program of economic reforms that he will present 
next week to the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, will be a bold 
document, not a hodgepodge of compromises, although debate continues over many 
of its elements and even its underlying philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow the party at this difficult, fateful moment to waste its 
political energy and potential on arguments," he told the Central Committee. 
"If that happens, it risks the loss of its authority with the masses."

POPULARITY OF BUSH PLUMMETS TO 55% IN POLL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As Congress and the Administration have struggled to reach an agreement on the 
budget, President Bush's popularity has tumbled to its lowest point since the 
earliest months of his presidency, as measured by a Times Mirror poll, which 
was made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted over a four-day period that ended Sunday, found that 55% of 
those surveyed approve of the way Bush is handling his job, and 28% disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
The job rating, although respectable by historical standards, nevertheless 
marked a significant drop over the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's popularity had shot up to 76% in early August -- and remained high, at 
68%, in September -- in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the massive 
deployment of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But the nationwide poll, done for The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; 
The Press by Princeton Survey Research Associates, indicated that this surge 
has largely dissipated and that Bush's popularity has fallen back to what 
poll-takers and political consultants consider potentially troublesome levels 
at a time of renewed public worries about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror Co. is the owner of the Los Angeles Times and other newspaper, 
broadcasting and publishing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in Bush's popularity occurs in the midst of what appears to be growing 
dissatisfaction with political insiders across the country -- as reflected by 
votes this autumn in Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Louisiana -- and could spell 
difficult times ahead for the President, whose ties to Washington go back 
nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the test comes," said Stuart Spencer, the California political consultant 
who was a close adviser to Ronald Reagan during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted between Thursday and Sunday -- a period that followed 
Bush's televised speech to the nation in which he urged support for the budget 
compromise worked out by congressional leaders and Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The survey covered the period when Congress rejected the budget plan on Friday 
and when the government closed down all non-essential operations over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that, despite the attention given in Congress to the impact that 
the now-discarded budget plan would have had on Medicare -- by increasing costs 
for beneficiaries -- only 11% of those polled were aware that Medicare fees 
would have been raised. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, 45% were aware that the plan entailed higher gasoline taxes, 40% 
knew that it involved higher taxes on alcohol and 38% were aware that it would 
have imposed higher taxes on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, although much of the opposition in the congressional debate dealt -- as a 
result of a concentrated letter-writing and telephone campaign -- with the 
impact on the elderly, many more people were aware of the impact that the 
budget cuts would have had on other groups. 
</P>
<P>
With the budget crisis dominating news from Washington over an otherwise quiet 
Columbus Day holiday, the White House aggressively tried to portray Congress as 
the cause for the impasse, and congressional leaders took aim at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
But there was at least anecdotal evidence that, outside of Washington, citizens 
viewed both power centers as worthy of blame. 
</P>
<P>
"The blame starts at the top -- people at the top should be able to plan ahead 
for this and they didn't," said Patrick Campbell, the 39-year-old doorman at 
the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"When I say people at the top, I think both the Congress and the President are 
at fault," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the past, frustration with Congress as an institution has not 
necessarily spelled difficulty for individual incumbents seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, said Steven Smith, a professor of political science at the University 
of Minnesota who studies Congress and the presidency, "any bad news about how 
the government is conducting its affairs rubs off on the President." 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, a President has an increasingly difficult time getting what he wants 
out of Congress, and Bush is discovering that," Smith said. "He, more than 
other presidents, has put off difficult choices until the end" of the 
congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than dive into controversy, Smith said, Bush "chose to be popular." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he concluded, Bush is being forced to make unpopular choices, "and it will 
cost him dearly and probably more than we've seen in the polls so far." 
</P>
<P>
The poll report was greeted with cheers by Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, 
who said that "Bush had this high-wire act going on, where basically the 
country did not feel good about itself and did not feel good about the economy, 
and yet Bush's popularity has remained high. It couldn't last forever." 
</P>
<P>
The overall job approval rating was Bush's lowest in 1990, as measured by Times 
Mirror polls. 
</P>
<P>
It came close to the lowest ratings of his presidency -- 51% during the first 
month of his White House tenure, January, 1989, and only a few percentage 
points higher in the subsequent months before the political upheavals in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A separate poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post, also showed that 
Bush's popularity has suffered as a result of the budget crisis. In that 
survey, the President's popularity rating fell to 65%, down from 75% a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC/Post poll said that a solid majority of Americans -- six of 10 -- now 
say that they disapprove of Bush's and Congress' handling of the budget 
deficit. That is a 14-point increase since late September. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Times Mirror survey, greater dissatisfaction with the way Bush 
is handling his job was registered by all demographic and political groups. But 
his approval ratings declined by 15 percentage points or more among older 
people, who registered a 47% approval rating; blacks, at 32% approval; and 
Democrats, at 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer pointed out that the 28% disapproval rating remained low. The 
popularity drop, he said, was simply getting Bush "back to reality" after the 
"abnormally high" popularity figures earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 -- creating the sort of foreign policy 
crisis that has historically generated an initial display of support for a U.S. 
President -- Bush's ratings had dropped from 74% in April to 64% in July. 
</P>
<P>
Without the boost Bush received from Iraq, said Times political consultant 
William Schneider, his rating might be below 50%. "When a President drops below 
50%, he's in trouble," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey measured the opinions of 1,213 adults. For results based on the 
total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to 
sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli police Monday shot and killed at least 19 Palestinians who were raining 
down stones on Jews worshiping in Jerusalem's Old City, in the worst outburst 
of violence in nearly three years of the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 other Palestinians were wounded in the bout of civil unrest, which 
was on a scale with the most serious in decades of Jewish-Arab strife. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the incident was the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Haram al 
Sharif, or noble sanctuary. Jews revere it as the site of the Second Temple, 
destroyed in Roman times, and Muslims believe it is the place where the Prophet 
Mohammed ascended to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 Palestinians had massed there amid reports that a fundamentalist 
Jewish group was preparing to lay a foundation stone for a new temple in the 
enclosure where the Dome of the Rock, Islam's third-holiest shrine, is 
situated. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish group, the Faithful of the Temple Mount, had been barred by Israel's 
Supreme Court from entering the enclosure. Nonetheless, the Palestinians hurled 
stones at worshipers at the Western Wall, which is adjacent to and below the 
Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs contended that police fired tear gas before any stones were thrown, but 
police officers and neutral observers insisted that the rocks were thrown 
without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians burned a police post on the Temple Mount as municipal and 
border police stormed the site, firing tear gas, rubber-coated pellets and lead 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
As panicked Jewish worshipers were evacuated by bus, ambulances moved in to 
evacuate the Arab dead and wounded. Smoke from burning tires enveloped the Old 
City and adjacent neighborhoods, creating an atmosphere of war. There were 
nightmarish scenes of mourning and despair at two hospitals on the nearby Mount 
of Olives. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III chided Israel for using 
what he said was excessive force, but he said the United States has not yet 
been able to determine which side was responsible for the confrontation. He 
noted that Israeli authorities and Palestinians were both accusing the other of 
provocation. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have all the facts, but it is fair to say that Israel needs to be 
better prepared and able to exercise restraint in handling disturbances of this 
nature," Baker said. "This tragic loss of life is obviously a cause for great 
sadness." 
</P>
<P>
Baker flatly rejected a suggestion by French President Francois Mitterrand that 
the incident inevitably links the Arab-Israeli dispute with the crisis in the 
Persian Gulf. Mitterrand told a news conference in Paris that "one cannot try 
to defend human rights here and neglect them there." 
</P>
<P>
"Rights are rights," Mitterrand said, according to the British news agency 
Reuters. "The U.N. Security Council and the U.N. find themselves facing 
problems that now risk becoming linked." 
</P>
<P>
Baker told reporters in Washington, "We do not see any linkage." He said the 
United States "will continue working on the peace process" but not because of 
any connection to the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Yossi Tuvia, commander of the Israeli border police, which was called in to 
storm the Temple Mount, said, "I think that in the last three years, this is a 
riot that we have not known the likes of." 
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Yaacov Turner called the incident "unprecedented in its 
gravity." 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he was 
"shocked and greatly dismayed" and that it appears that excessive force was 
used by the Israeli authorities. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Perez de Cuellar said that "in his view, today's incidents are 
a tragic illustration of the dangers inherent in the stalemate that has for too 
long characterized the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." 
</P>
<P>
The violence marked a break in the relative easing of Israel's suppression of 
the uprising, or intifada, which has been beset by factional violence and 
disarray for months. Since taking office in June, the right-wing government of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has restricted the use of rifles to disperse 
Palestinian mobs and demonstrations in a bid to reduce tension and take the 
uprising out of the news. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, tension has risen in Jerusalem. A spiral of violence 
began with the kidnaping and killing of two Israeli youths in August and the 
subsequent stoning death of an Arab motorist by enraged Israeli mobs. Last 
week, a police roundup of young activists in the Palestinian neighborhood of 
Issawiya touched off a stone-throwing protest, and border police responded with 
rifle fire that left three Palestinians dead. 
</P>
<P>
As far back as last spring, Arab neighborhoods of the city had interrupted the 
relative quiet with stone-throwing attacks on Israeli buses and cars. At points 
where Jewish and Arab neighborhoods meet, bitter civil clashes have broken out. 
</P>
<P>
The minister of police, Ronni Milo, said police reacted to Monday's riot with 
"great restraint." He turned aside charges that the police did not take 
preventive measures, yet he said the police had known something was afoot 
because young people had been gathering stones on the Temple Mount throughout 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
The numerous fatalities -- the highest previous one-day toll was 17, in April, 
1988 -- come at a delicate time for the United States, Israel's closest ally. 
Washington is caught up in the Persian Gulf crisis, and U.S. troops are 
positioned alongside Arab forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The violence at the Dome of the Rock puts pressure on the fault line between 
the United States and its Arab allies, notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. 
These three Arab countries are sensitive about Washington's support for Israel, 
especially during the suppression of the intifada, which began in December, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose invasion of Kuwait in August brought the 
U.S. troops into neighboring Saudi Arabia, has been using Washington's support 
for Israel as a wedge to divide Americans and Arabs. He has accused the Arab 
countries that support the U.S. move against Iraq of being tools of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Tunisia, the Palestine Liberation Organization, which supports Hussein, 
called Monday's shootings a "massacre" and called for U.N. sanctions against 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia announced recently that if Iraq and Israel go to war, Saudi Arabia 
will not help Israel in any way. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, after the shooting of seven unarmed Palestinians by a lone Israeli 
gunman and a series of violent incidents that resulted in 21 Palestinian 
deaths, the United States blocked a proposed U.N. resolution calling for an 
investigative team to visit the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. It 
is not clear how Washington will react if such a resolution resurfaces in the 
wake of Monday's violence. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have become alarmed at remarks by Western leaders seeking to 
link the settlement of the gulf crisis with progress toward settlement of the 
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. President Bush said last week that the end of the 
Kuwait crisis would raise opportunities to resolve other Middle East problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Prime Minister Shamir rejected any linkage that would imply an 
Israeli obligation to move out of the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million 
Palestinians now live. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been asked more than once to withdraw from these territories and other 
areas in Israel and have refused," Shamir said. "We will refuse to do so in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, according to Israel Radio, the Israeli Foreign Ministry sent 
instructions to its diplomatic missions abroad saying that the violence at the 
Temple Mount was an attempt by Palestinians to distract attention from the 
situation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek expressed fear that Iraq could use the incident in 
the Old City to its advantage. Other Israeli observers said the incident was 
contrived to put the uprising back on the front pages of newspapers, where it 
had been eclipsed by the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"They created headlines," said Gerald Steinberg, an expert on Palestinian 
affairs at Bar Ilan University in Tel Aviv. "This is a very carefully planned 
political event." 
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount has been the scene of a series of violent incidents in the 
course of the uprising. On April 7, 1989, Palestinians hurled stones at 
worshipers at the Western Wall. Police responded with tear gas and rifle fire, 
which resulted in three injuries. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, at Mokassed Hospital on the Mount of Olives, a room was set aside 
for the identification of bodies by relatives. The room was decorated with two 
Palestinian flags. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in bloodstained aprons scurried through the hospital's halls. Outside, 
ambulances weaved through border police in green berets facing off with 
stone-throwing youths. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the Old City was relatively quiet, but at times the border police, 
reacting to being stoned, raced down narrow alleyways in pursuit of their 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few hours earlier, the Western Wall had been festive. Worshipers in 
prayer shawls gathered to celebrate the feast of the priestly blessing, a part 
of the Succot harvest holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The main service, which had attracted 20,000 worshipers, ended before the first 
stones were showered down from the Temple Mount. So many stones were thrown 
that one onlooker said he thought a flock of birds had taken flight from the 
plateau above. 
</P>
<P>
Avner Shaki, the minister of religious affairs, said: "This is a very serious 
event that demands a response from security forces that is not routine. It is 
impossible that on a day of holiday . . . punks, envoys of Arab terrorism, can 
deny happiness to the hearts of the thousands at the most sacred place and 
upset the mass pilgrimage." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Faithful of the Temple Mount said they will continue their 
campaign to re-establish the Jewish temple on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue our struggle until the Israeli flag is flying from the Dome 
of the Rock," said Gershon Salomon, a leader of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kollek, trying to calm emotions inflamed by the incident, repeated his 
belief that Jews and Arabs must learn to live together peacefully in the 
ethnically and religiously divided city. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "an attack on a Jewish holy place cannot be countenanced any 
more than an attack on a Christian or Muslim site." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said the crowd had been incited to attack the Jews by amplified 
urgings, but a witness said he heard only the customary prayers, which in Islam 
begin traditionally with the chant, "God is great." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, workers were scrubbing bloodstains from the stone 
pavement of the Temple Mount. Scores of suspected rioters had been led away in 
manacles, among them Faisal Husseini, a leading uprising activist. The police 
said he was taken into custody for inciting the crowd, but Palestinians said he 
had come to the mosque to try to prevent the young people from throwing stones. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell, unrest was reported in Bethlehem, 10 miles south of Jerusalem. 
The army had imposed curfews on several towns on the West Bank and had 
restricted access by outsiders, including reporters, to the Gaza Strip.

DE KLERK MEETS KEY ANC DEMAND BY OFFERING AMNESTY PLAN TO EXILES

<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk announced Monday that political exiles can begin 
applying to return to South Africa, addressing a key demand of the African 
National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
His statement followed a three-hour meeting with ANC leader Nelson Mandela at 
which they discussed violence in South Africa's black townships, which has 
killed about 800 people since mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said exiles, many based in Zambia and other southern African nations, 
can immediately begin applying for amnesty for "political offenses." 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned: "No indemnity for anyone, or for any event or offense, is 
granted automatically." He said any possible indemnity would apply only to acts 
committed before Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The move could help resolve one of the major stumbling blocks to peace talks 
between the white-led government and the ANC, which has demanded the return of 
its estimated 20,000 exiles before beginning full-scale negotiations on 
black-white power sharing and ending apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, the government had agreed in principle but never announced a 
mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's statement said full details of the process will be announced later. 
It also said exiles from other organizations may be included. Smaller black 
opposition groups also have members who fled South Africa after committing 
politically motivated acts. 
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to release 15 more political prisoners this week, 
the statement said. Dozens have been freed in recent months, but up to 3,000 
remain imprisoned, according to the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, after the meeting with De Klerk, read a separate joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
"There was general agreement that all sides must do their utmost to bring this 
violence to an end," according to the statement. "Note was taken of the 
different current perceptions concerning the causes and handling of this 
violence. Both sides reaffirmed the need to keep the negotiating process on 
course." 
</P>
<P>
There was no specific reference to Mandela's repeated warnings that talks on 
South Africa's transition to democracy could be threatened by a continuation of 
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who refused to answer questions, has accused security forces of 
orchestrating the violence in the black townships. The fighting has been mainly 
between supporters of the ANC and members of the rival Inkatha movement, led by 
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
The government has repeatedly denied that police or soldiers are fanning the 
conflict.

KGB SEIZES GREENPEACE SHIP NEAR NUCLEAR SITE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: WARNING SHOTS ARE FIRED BEFORE VESSEL IS BOARDED. ACTIVISTS FEAR 
RESUMPTION OF TESTING ON ISLAND.

The Soviet coast guard Monday fired warning shots at a Greenpeace ship carrying 
anti-nuclear activists who were protesting plans to resume the testing of 
nuclear weapons in the Arctic, the official Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The coast guard vessel, an icebreaker operated by the KGB, the Soviet security 
and intelligence agency, then put armed sailors aboard the MV Greenpeace to 
escort it out of the Barents Sea, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB said it seized the ship "for deliberate violation of the state borders 
of the Soviet Union, failure to obey border authorities and landing people at 
prohibited places." 
</P>
<P>
"In order to detain the Greenpeace ship, the border guards had to fire warning 
shots," a KGB spokesman said. "The ship will soon be escorted to the Kola Gulf, 
where an inquiry will take place." 
</P>
<P>
The ship, operated by the Greenpeace environmental movement, had sailed into 
Soviet waters to protest the possible resumption of nuclear testing at Novaya 
Zemlya, two islands in the Barents Sea high in the Arctic. Four of the 38 
activists had gone ashore in inflatable rubber boats in the pre-dawn darkness 
before the coast guard intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged that the Soviet authorities have boarded our ship," Rebecca 
Johnson, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, said in London. "In attacking Greenpeace 
and defending nuclear testing, the Soviet military is defying the wishes of the 
Soviet people. Thousands of Soviet citizens came aboard the ship in Murmansk 
and Arkhangelsk to give us support. They too want nuclear testing to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Seven Soviet participants in the Barents Sea protest, including a member of the 
Congress of People's Deputies, the national parliament, and two deputies in 
regional councils, denounced the use of the land for nuclear tests as a 
violation of the rights of the native Nenets people, who were moved from the 
region decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We are there to help the Soviet people in their campaign against nuclear 
testing," Johnson said. "But this is really a struggle that must be waged in 
the United States above all countries. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States would stop its nuclear weapons testing, the Soviet Union 
would stop immediately," she continued. "The Soviets have made this pledge, and 
they have already had a moratorium for 19 months while the Americans continued 
to explode bomb after bomb. That nuclear testing continues should shame the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, like its predecessors, maintains that it must continue 
testing nuclear weapons to verify their reliability and to improve the multiple 
warheads on missiles. The Soviet Union continues to urge a total test ban, but 
it says that as long as the United States tests to improve its nuclear arsenal, 
it must also. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow today, the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, is expected to 
ratify two treaties the Soviet Union signed with the United States in the early 
1970s restricting the size of underground nuclear tests -- those in the 
atmosphere have been banned since 1963 -- and controlling peaceful nuclear 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Working out a verification program required years of negotiation, and those 
talks were effectively interrupted with the deterioration of Soviet-American 
relations in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Shallhorn, the voyage coordinator, said before the MV Greenpeace was 
seized that Greenpeace believed the Soviet Union was preparing a nuclear test 
on Novaya Zemlya soon.

"Our information is that they now have a warhead underground," he said. "We are 
not sure when they are planning to test it, but we are sure they are not going 
to do it as long as we are here." 
</P>
<P>
Shallhorn told Greenpeace officials in London that the Soviet coast guard 
ordered the ship to leave the area several times and then fired warning shots. 
Even after the vessel was boarded, Shallhorn and a radio operator continued 
broadcasting from it until, he said, armed Soviet sailors forced open the door 
to the radio room and broke the connection. 
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of the four activists who landed on Novaya Zemlya early Monday 
and were walking toward the test site was not known. They were identified by 
Greenpeace as Ted Wood of the United States, Jorn Haye of Germany, Bjorn Oken 
of Norway and Jeanne Ni Ghormain of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said its protest was part of the organization's "Let's Disarm the 
Sea" campaign, in which its vessels also will go into waters near U.S. and 
French weapons test sites. 
</P>
<P>
The MV Greenpeace, a 190-foot converted salvage tug, was involved in a skirmish 
with the U.S. Navy last December and was rammed while trying to disrupt the 
launch of a Trident 2 missile by a submarine off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the Dutch flag, the Greenpeace ship carries activists from the United 
States, Britain, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Austria and the Netherlands 
as well as the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Soviet coast guard briefly detained a Norwegian research vessel 
while it was taking water samples in the same area. Norway is about 370 miles 
from Novaya Zemlya. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Novaya Zemlya, an Arctic archipelago of two large islands and numerous smaller 
ones, was a primary test site for the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons from 1958 
to 1963. Environmentalists say it was used intermittently until 1988. Testing 
is likely to resume, Greenpeace believes, because of the suspension of tests at 
the main Soviet test site, Semipalatinsk in the republic of Kazakhstan, 
following widespread protests there.

HUNGARIAN LEADER PAINTS BLEAK PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, AN OIL SHORTAGE AND CORRUPTION DEPRESS PRIME 
MINISTER JOZSEF ANTALL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Jozsef Antall doesn't believe in sugar-coating the truth when 
describing the woeful state of the nation he governs. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-hour interview Monday, Antall ticked off every depressing detail of 
the Hungarian economy and likened his leadership task to that of Moses. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation and unemployment are spiraling upward while 90% of industry is still 
owned by the state, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly, Hungary's entire economy was designed to depend on Soviet oil 
deliveries that are now being curtailed, and factory output was aimed at an 
East European market that has collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Corruption remains rampant, Antall noted, requiring government monitoring that 
is slowing privatization. 
</P>
<P>
Workers rightfully fear for their jobs and are preoccupied with plunging living 
standards. Having lived high on borrowed money in the 1970s and 1980s, with 
little regard for investing in the future, Hungarians now face a $20-billion 
foreign debt, the highest per capita in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors will realize these problems soon enough, so it doesn't pay 
to lie about them," said Antall, concluding a grim balance sheet on Hungary's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the dour prime minister has made "the other hand" a trademark addendum to 
any assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike several of its neighbors, Antall pointed out, Hungary is not on the 
verge of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite these heavy economic problems, we are able to provide sound conditions 
for investment," Antall said. "I don't want to draw comparisons with other 
countries in the region, but if one wanted to compare Hungary with its 
multinational neighbors, our country is homogeneous. It is not marred by 
internal ethnic and nationalist rivalries." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Yugoslavia's threatened federation and continued political strife 
between Czechs and Slovaks as the best indication that Western investors -- 
especially Americans -- will eventually choose Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
In the company of advisers and Cabinet members only slightly more upbeat on 
Hungary's future, Antall travels next week to New York, Washington and Los 
Angeles to drum up financial and moral support for his nation's political and 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the $1 billion invested in Hungary by foreign companies has 
come from U.S. firms, and Antall said his government hopes to foster a large 
American presence by offering further tax breaks and other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"We aspire to let the United States play a predominant role in making 
investments," the prime minister explained. "Americans already have more 
invested here than in all other former Communist countries put together." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian delegation will also go to Washington in search of relief for the 
looming energy crisis, Antall indicated during a wide-ranging exchange with 
American journalists. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to assess the likelihood of gas rationing or other tough measures 
to deal with a 30% cut in Soviet oil deliveries and skyrocketing prices on the 
world market. But he conceded that Hungary and the nations of Eastern Europe 
have only about a week's worth of oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Western European countries like France have reserves adequate to cover oil 
needs for 110 days, whereas in Eastern and Central Europe they are sufficient 
to cover only six to 10 days," Antall said. 
</P>
<P>
Pessimism pervaded every statement the prime minister made in reference to 
Hungary's immediate future. But Hungarians in general take comfort in gloom, a 
comfort that is difficult for foreigners to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
Antall alluded to the dark side of Hungarian nature in pointing out that his 
people are the most suicide-prone in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he expects his compatriots to weather what are certain to be even 
more trying times ahead in the transition out of communism's mire, he predicted 
"great social and political tensions." 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians have experienced the least benefit of the democratic revolution 
among the peoples that threw off communism in 1989 because they enjoyed freedom 
to travel and fewer shortages than their Communist neighbors before the 
revolution, Antall noted. 
</P>
<P>
With a defensiveness that has become characteristic, the prime minister blamed 
opposition parties and the media -- both domestic and foreign -- for 
contributing to the dejected social atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the targets of attack from every side," complained Antall, who strikes 
the pose of a hostile witness when meeting with the press. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in a plush gold armchair under the brooding oil paintings that adorn his 
office, Antall lectured one journalist for asking about a reported rise in 
anti-Semitism that has been the subject of a recent and heated parliamentary 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Questions like this are something I dislike," he stated with barely stifled 
anger. "This government pursues the most consistent policy against any kind of 
anti-Semitism and has taken all the necessary steps to prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence, he produced a letter from the government of Israel inviting him to 
visit and a citation from the World Jewish Congress in honor of his father, 
whose Nazi resistance work during World War II is credited with saving the 
lives of thousands of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
After his bleak forecast of a continuing decline in living standards and 
mounting public resentment, he was asked whether he feels equal to leading his 
nation through the difficult transition. 
</P>
<P>
"I must make an attempt to do so, as I am the prime minister," Antall stated 
soberly. "Moses probably also had doubts, or he wouldn't have gone up the 
mountain for guidance."

A DOWN-TO-EARTH ASSAULT ON AN AGE-OLD PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
EXPERTS WILL GATHER IN NEW MEXICO TO SHARE WAYS TO PRESERVE STRUCTURE AND 
SPIRIT OF MUD-BRICK BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Out in the New Mexico desert, rows of man-made adobe walls lined up like 
tombstones are being treated with chemicals and soaked with water. Not far 
away, remnants of a 19th-Century adobe fort sit under a canopy of fabric 
specially color-coordinated to blend in with the Southwestern landscape. 
</P>
<P>
These simple structures at Ft. Selden soon will be the object of intense 
scrutiny as representatives of 30 countries from China to Chile gather next 
week in nearby Las Cruces to share research in how to halt deterioration of one 
of the oldest building materials on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsored by the Getty Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey and five 
other public and private agencies, the sixth International Conference on the 
Conservation of Earthen Architecture -- the biggest so far and the first to be 
held in the United States -- will bring together scientists, archeologists, 
architects and conservators. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conference will focus on the preservation of historic monuments 
made of sun-dried mud brick, organizers hope it will have a broader 
application, especially for developing countries. Nearly half of the world's 
population is believed to live in homes constructed from adobe, whose earliest 
known use (in unbaked form) dates to nearly 8000 BC in Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
Participants will hear from New Mexicans involved in community programs to 
maintain local churches and Moroccans attempting to revitalize oasis villages. 
"People will be brought into communication in a way that does not deal only 
with, shall I say, dry-as-dust structures," said Neville Agnew, director of 
scientific programs for the Getty institute, "but also with social history, 
social interaction and the maintenance of traditions." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, adobe usually is associated with the Southwest, where it 
is used in everything from multimillion-dollar haciendas to Department of 
Housing and Urban Development units built for Pueblo Indians. But adobe 
structures of varying architectural styles are found in various parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its many virtues -- it is cheap and accessible and adapts to desert 
climates -- adobe is vulnerable to rain, earthquakes, wind, fluctuation in 
temperature and humidity and damage from insects and rodents. Many important 
historical sites are showing the effects of long-term neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, New Mexico state officials have been conducting conservation 
experiments at Ft. Selden, a military post built in 1867 to protect the 
surrounding Mesilla Valley and abandoned 100 years ago. In 1987, the Getty 
Conservation Institute, funded by the J. Paul Getty Trust, added its scientific 
expertise and resources to what was essentially a "folk" experiment testing 
"all sorts of interesting things" from store-bought chemicals to cactus juice, 
according to Thomas J. Caperton, director of New Mexico State Monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Getty scientists report promising results from two types of chemicals that can 
be applied to adobe walls. One -- alkoxysilane -- is more easily absorbed than 
the other but is very expensive. The second -- isocyanate -- is cheaper but 
more difficult to work with. Both have "a tendency to slightly darken the 
appearance, and this might not be acceptable to people, especially to 
conservators," said Richard L. Coffman, a Getty geologist. 
</P>
<P>
Experimenters have not used chemicals on historic relics, choosing instead to 
build new walls for test purposes. "A big buzzword in conservation science is 
'reversibility,' " or the ability to undo the test, said chemist Charles 
Selwitz, a Getty institute consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Reversibility explains the appeal of the so-called hexashelters developed by 
Getty scientists. These are tent-like structures made of loosely woven fabrics 
-- called "aerotextiles" -- and secured by concrete footings. They can be 
placed over monuments, protecting them from the elements while still allowing 
access for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But, like most conservation measures, this has a downside, according to Michael 
Taylor, a National Park Service archeologist who is co-chairman of the 
conference with Agnew. The shelter itself may exacerbate wind turbulence, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew and his crew are working with other materials to protect newly dug-up 
relics from disintegration. Scientists have learned that the safest place for 
the discoveries is right back underground. Wrapping them with so-called 
geotextiles keeps insects and rodents away and enables archeologists to easily 
retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
In New Mexico, scores of sites have been "reburied" while awaiting new 
technology that will ensure their future existence, Taylor said.

Mayor David N. Dinkins promised Monday that his head will not rest at taxpayer 
expense, whatever the final price tag on a bed that a magazine said is going to 
cost $11,500. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek noted that the bed's arrival at the mayor's official residence 
coincided with municipal money woes that led Dinkins to freeze hiring, propose 
new taxes and talk about 15,000 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
If it costs what Newsweek said, that "will all be covered by private donations 
from friends of the city, many of whom have contacted me this morning to offer 
their contributions," the mayor said in a statement issued by his press 
secretary, Albert Scardino.

President Bush, noting the shutdown of non-essential government services, 
forsook his helicopter and limousine on Monday and returned from Camp David in 
a small four-wheel-drive truck -- which got stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a police escort, Bush's truck and the other 11 vehicles in his 
motorcade were halted behind a half-mile backup at a construction site on the 
heavily traveled Capital Beltway, about 10 miles from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the only mishap for Bush's motorcade on its trip here from the 
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, a tire blew out on the accompanying Secret Service "war wagon," 
and the heavily fortified station wagon had to pull to the side of the road. 
Agents toting machine guns hopped out, commandeered a Park Service police car 
and used it to rejoin the motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
The President opted for the 90-minute drive because of the partial government 
shutdown, an aide said. She said it was cheaper to drive than to take a 
helicopter as usual.

A Chinese man has died from injuries sustained in last week's multiple plane 
crash in Canton, bringing the death toll to 128 from China's worst air disaster 
in a decade, a government spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the cause of the crash, which occurred on China's 
National Day holiday, is still in progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to China's initial accounts, a hijacked domestic airliner crashed 
into two other planes while attempting to land at Canton's airport. 
</P>
<P>
One of the planes on the ground was a Boeing 757 full of passengers waiting to 
take off for Shanghai, and the other was empty. 
</P>

FLORES ACCUSES EU OF TRASHING TAXPAYER DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Milke Flores, Republican candidate for secretary of state, took her 
campaign to a large garbage bin in a Los Angeles alley on Monday, accusing 
Democratic incumbent March Fong Eu of "throwing away millions of taxpayer 
dollars" by mismanaging the office. 
</P>
<P>
Flores attacked Eu for failed or costly efforts to automate two of the office's 
seven divisions and for a series of proof-reading errors on state ballot 
pamphlets last June and in 1988. Flores said the problems cost more than $6 
million to resolve, including $621,000 to reprint millions of corrected 
pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
"California simply cannot afford these continuing careless mistakes," said 
Flores, displaying a T-shirt created by employees of the state Office of 
Printing bearing the words, "I Survived the Voter Pamflut of 1988!" 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign consultant, called Flores' charges "incredible 
distortions of the truth" and said some of the increased costs were beyond Eu's 
control. While acknowledging the proof-reading errors, he said Eu's "good 
detective work" in one of the automation projects saved the state from buying a 
computer system for the Uniform Commercial Code Division that did not work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Flores) failed to understand what was going on here, or interpreted 
it to her own satisfaction," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
With the election a month away and polls showing her running a distant second, 
Flores has moved her campaign into high gear. The allegations Monday came after 
a week of hard-hitting television commercials, aired in Los Angeles and 
Sacramento, that accused Eu of reducing fines for campaign violations made by 
her own reelection committees. 
</P>
<P>
Flores plans to air more television ads, and her campaign is furiously raising 
money from a loyal core of donors who have supported her during three terms on 
the Los Angeles City Council. Despite a challenge from Eu to abide by 
contribution limits under Proposition 73 that were recently ruled 
unconstitutional, Flores is soliciting donations well above the limits and 
hopes to top the $1-million mark in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The assault appears to have caught Eu's attention. During much of the campaign, 
the four-term incumbent largely ignored Flores' challenge, but this weekend she 
hinted that she may be feeling the heat when she ventured into Flores' own back 
yard for a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"This election year, we face a particularly difficult challenge," Eu told about 
400 supporters at a union hall in Wilmington, one of several communities Flores 
represents at City Hall. "The opposition is well-funded and committed to 
avoiding defeat."

PROBE LAUNCHED, SHUTTLE SET FOR TOUCHDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having successfully launched a solar probe to carry out the most ambitious 
exploration of the sun ever attempted, the space shuttle Discovery is set to 
land Wednesday at Edwards Air Force Base at a most appropriate time: sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dryden Flight 
Research Facility, located at Edwards, said the spaceplane is to land about 
6:54 a.m., just as the sun rises at the sprawling Mojave Desert base. 
</P>
<P>
The viewing site on the eastern shore of the dry lake bed there will be open to 
the public for the landing. The spaceplane is to cross the coastline near Santa 
Barbara, so the twin sonic booms that herald its arrival probably will not be 
heard over most of the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
This was an unusually short mission of only four days, and the primary goal was 
achieved six hours after the Discovery blasted off from the Kennedy Space 
Center on Saturday. The Discovery sent the European-built Ulysses probe off 
toward Jupiter, where it will "hang a left," as NASA Chief Scientist Lennard 
Fisk put it, and go into a huge orbit that will carry it over both poles of the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
Only the equatorial region of the sun is visible from the Earth, and scientists 
have long wanted to study such things as the sun's magnetic field and the solar 
wind over the poles. Ulysses, cornerstone of a $750-million joint U.S.-European 
mission, will make that possible for the first time. It will reach the sun's 
south pole in 1994 and the north pole a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the five-man Discovery crew carried out a series of relatively minor 
experiments Monday. Some of the experiments will be repeated today until late 
morning, when the crew will begin stowing its gear in preparation for landing. 
</P>
<P>
During the short mission, the crewmen have shared Discovery with 16 rats. The 
rats are part of an experiment to learn more about how weightlessness affects 
physiological responses to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The mission was described by the flight director, Ron Dittemore, as unusually 
trouble-free. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been no orbiter problems at all," he said. "We're just sitting here 
watching the data, and we're pleased everything is working just fine." 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery is commanded by Richard Richards, 44, and piloted by Robert 
Cabana, 41. The other crewmen are William Shepherd, 41, Thomas Akers, 39, and 
Bruce Melnick, 40, the first Coast Guardsman to fly in space. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the flight is good news to the troubled space agency. This is 
the first flight in more than five months because of a series of problems, 
including leaks from hydrogen fuel lines in the two other shuttles, Atlantis 
and Columbia.

Workers at the Kennedy Space Center are already preparing for the launch of 
Atlantis around Nov. 7 on a secret military mission, but that launch depends on 
whether the fuel leak problem has been solved. Even if that launch goes off as 
planned, no one is sure when Columbia will fly again.

CARTOONIST MYRON NATWICK; CREATED BETTY BOOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myron (Grim) Natwick, the creator of the popular cartoon heroine Betty Boop, 
has died. He was 100. 
</P>
<P>
Natwick died Sunday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center of pneumonia and 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Although she was never vulgar or obscene, Betty was a suggestion you could 
spell in three letters: S-E-X," Natwick said of her 60-year popularity in a 
Times interview earlier this year. "She was all girl." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Wisconsin at the turn of the century, Natwick hoped to become an 
illustrator for magazine and sheet music covers. He studied drawing and 
painting in Chicago, New York, and in Europe at the Vienna National Academy. 
</P>
<P>
But on returning to the United States in 1928, he jumped into the 
then-burgeoning animation industry, which he had flirted with briefly at Hearst 
International Film Service during his student years. 
</P>
<P>
Working for Max and Dave Fleischer, who had produced the famous bouncing ball 
sing-along "Song Cartunes," Natwick was asked to design a girl character for 
the popular song by Helen Kane, "Boop-Boop-A-Doop." 
</P>
<P>
Because the only character in the Fleischers' new sound cartoons was a little 
dog called Bimbo, Natwick originally drew Betty as a dog's head on the 
curvaceous figure of a woman. He patterned the spit-curl flapper hairdo on 
Kane's own hairstyle. 
</P>
<P>
Betty first appeared as a secondary character in 1930, singing her song in a 
cartoon starring Bimbo and called "Dizzy Dishes." She was so popular that the 
Fleischers quickly demanded more cartoons "with that girl in them." 
</P>
<P>
Natwick refined Betty, reducing her floppy dog's ears to bangle earrings and 
shrinking the black nose to a button. His understanding of anatomy made her the 
most realistic female cartoon character of the era. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years of art school and night classes, drawing what must have been 
thousands of naked models, had taught me a little bit about the female body," 
he told The Times. "I knew all the sexy angles and shapes, from the turn of the 
ankle to the shape of the heel of her shoe to where her waist belonged." 
</P>
<P>
His work with Betty led to job offers from "every cartoon studio in Hollywood." 
Over the years, Natwick worked for Walt Disney's former partner, Ub Iwerks, 
Disney himself, Walter Lantz, the U.S. Army (for which he made training films) 
and his own free-lance animation service. At Disney, he animated Snow White for 
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Richard Williams persuaded him to work on the feature "Raggedy Ann and 
Raggedy Andy," and to teach animation to younger artists working on the film. 
</P>
<P>
In that period, he did his final animation, the mad "holy Indian witch" in 
Williams' feature "The Thief." 
</P>
<P>
Natwick was frequently lauded by fans and co-workers for bringing his classical 
training as a painter to the modern field of animation. 
</P>
<P>
"I assisted Grim in 1976, when I was 18 and he was 86," Disney animator Tom 
Sito recently recalled. "His experience enabled him to distill the most complex 
motions into a few simple lines. His drawings moved beautifully, but they 
looked almost like shorthand, as if he couldn't stand to use a single 
superfluous line." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Boop enjoyed a comeback a few years ago, enriching Fleischer Studios and 
King Features Syndicate through the sale of T-shirts, videocassettes and other 
items. But Natwick, who had been left out when the Fleischers copyrighted his 
most famous character in 1930, did not share in the profits. 
</P>
<P>
Natwick is survived by his daughter, Nancy Matchell of Garden Grove, and two 
grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
Services and burial are planned in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis.

KEATING'S WIFE TELLS OF JAIL 'NIGHTMARE' FOR EX-S&amp;L CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Charles H. Keating Jr. says his three weeks in the Los Angeles 
County Jail have been a "living nightmare" as he awaits trial on securities 
fraud charges stemming from his time as chairman of American Continental Corp., 
former parent of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to several newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Mary Elaine 
Keating gave a glimpse of the jailed developer's life in maximum security, 
where he is being kept for his own protection from other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"He spends every day in a tiny concrete cell with an iron door," she wrote in 
the letter, published on The Times' editorial page today. "Except for court 
appearances, he does not see daylight. He is chained and shackled . . . when he 
is escorted to the attorney room to meet with his lawyers."

HITACHI, MOTOROLA SETTLE PATENT DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: NO TERMS WERE DISCLOSED BUT THE DEAL IS THOUGHT TO INVOLVE 
CROSS-LICENSING RATHER THAN CASH PAYMENTS. 
</P>

<P>
Ending an acrimonious legal battle that sent shock waves through the 
semiconductor and personal computer industries, Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. 
said Monday that they have reached a final settlement in their patent 
infringement dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the two semiconductor giants threatened at one time to cut 
off all shipments of Motorola's 68030 microprocessor, the brain inside many of 
the personal computers made by Apple Computer and several other companies. 
</P>
<P>
The fight began early last year when Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola sued 
Hitachi, claiming that the Japanese firm had illegally used technology obtained 
under a licensing agreement with Motorola to manufacture its own line of 
microcontrollers, chips that govern routine functions in computer peripherals 
and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi countersued, claiming that Motorola had pirated Hitachi technology in 
designing the hot-selling 68030 microprocessor. In a ruling that took many in 
the industry by surprise, a federal court judge ruled in March that both sides 
had infringed the other's patents, and he ordered both to pay damages and stop 
selling the offending parts. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hitachi was ordered to pay $1.9 million against $500,000 for Motorola, 
the ruling was far more damaging to the American firm because it involved the 
popular 68030, while Hitachi had only relatively unimportant products at stake. 
Motorola is believed to gain $100 million in annual revenue from the 68030; a 
cut-off in the supply to customers could have severely damaged the company's 
standing in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The sales ban was delayed while the two sides worked towards a settlement, and 
they announced last June that they had reached an agreement in principle to 
resolve the dispute. Analysts said Monday that the agreement probably involves 
the cross-licensing of various technologies rather than cash payments by either 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"This lawsuit made the semiconductor industry and their customers pretty 
uneasy. They'll be glad it's settled," said Jack Quinn, a senior analyst at the 
chip research firm In-Stat Inc. "It's made people think twice about having a 
sole source of supply" for vital parts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, chip vendors have licensed their designs to one or two other 
firms in order to provide customers -- primarily computer companies -- with a 
secure supply of products. But this practice, known as second-sourcing, has 
fallen out of favor in recent years as chip vendors seek to maximize profits on 
popular products. Motorola is the sole supplier of the 68030, which is used in 
most of the Apple Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Phelps, semiconductor analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, said the original 
ruling in the case had come as a big surprise to Motorola, adding that it might 
make companies more cautious about filing such patent infringement lawsuits in 
the future. The judge in the case said at one point that it was the type of 
lawsuit that should never have been filed, but rather settled by a 
cross-licensing arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said the case eliminated any presumption American companies might have 
had that U.S. courts would favor their patent claims over those of Japanese 
competitors. The protracted settlement negotiations, he added, probably 
revolved around which products each company should license to the other in 
order to achieve an equal balance.

LOW-POLLUTING AUTO PAINT DEBUTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE WATER-BASED PRIMERS ARE NOW IN USE IN 4,000 BODY REPAIR SHOPS 
IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When the South Coast Air Quality Management District mandated a switch from 
oil-based to water-based paints two years ago, auto-paint manufacturers and 
body-shop owners warned that the public had better prepare for lower-quality, 
more expensive repainting jobs -- if they could meet the requirements at all. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three months after the new rule went into effect, virtually all major 
auto paint companies have fielded the first of the new water-based, 
low-polluting products. And 4,000 auto paint shops in the Los Angeles area are 
learning to adapt to the change. 
</P>
<P>
"They cried earlier that they could not meet the standard," says Moustafa 
Elsherif, program supervisor in the rule development division of AQMD. "Now 
they are meeting it." 
</P>
<P>
However, to some extent, the manufacturers' fears have been borne out. For one 
thing, the new water-based paints are more expensive to use -- at least 
initially. For another, many auto body shops are suspicious of the quality of 
the new water-based primers, the first stage of complete new paint systems that 
will eventually include primers, cleaners, clear coatings, solvents and the 
different color coatings used to paint cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a surprise to find that major national paint companies could come out 
with new products, especially when they were so negative on the chance of 
coming out in the time frame allowed," said a cautious Jim Compton, vice 
president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the California Autobody Assn., 
which represents almost 700 body shops and associate members in California. 
"But lo and behold," he said, "when that time frame came to pass, we had 
products on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
DuPont Co., PPG Industries Inc., BASF Corp., Sherwin-Williams Co., and Sikkens 
Car Refinishes, a division of Akzo Coatings Inc., are among those that have 
marketed water-based primers to meet the new AQMD standards. 
</P>
<P>
Body-shop owners point out that consumers are increasingly picky about their 
auto paint jobs, and that the new paints will be difficult to judge without 
years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
"They are demanding more and more and more quality," says Robert Turnage, owner 
of Autocraft of Torrance, Inc., who has been in the auto body and paint 
business for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"How are we ever going to please these people?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet for some auto repair shop owners, their current complaints are directed 
more at the insurance companies than the AQMD rules. 
</P>
<P>
Some auto-repainters say that insurers have yet to adjust their rates to the 
increased costs of using the new paints. The paints are more difficult to use, 
require changes in equipment and the products themselves cost from 10% to 40% 
more than the old. 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent we've been totally unregulated," Turnage says of the 
auto-repainting industry. "The industry just isn't prepared for it, and we're 
not getting any help from the insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
Insurers say that under existing rate-setting procedures, the shop owners will 
have adequate opportunity to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
"If governmental agencies are making them incur more costs it would show up in 
an increased labor rate, which we survey every year around February or March," 
said Jay Guertin, a claims manager in the Costa Mesa regional office of State 
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm also added a requirement this year that auto body shops guarantee 
their paint jobs for one year, a change that Guertin denied was tied to 
uncertainties over the new water-based paints. 
</P>
<P>
The older auto paints contained what are called volatile organic compounds or 
VOCs, which are major components of photochemical smog. According to the AQMD, 
auto-spray paint shops, which had been unregulated until the district's rule 
1151 was set in 1988, were emitting far more VOCs than South Coast Air Basin 
oil refineries -- 38.5 tons daily, compared to 15.6 tons from the refineries. 
An estimated 1,200 tons of these VOCs have been released daily in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"And they were wasting a lot of paint, because the spray equipment wasn't very 
efficient," said Bill Kelly, a spokesperson for the AQMD. "The paint they were 
using was also extremely volatile, so much of it was evaporating into the air." 
</P>
<P>
All this will be a major topic of debate for repair shop owners Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday at the annual California Autobody Assn. trade show and 
convention, in Anaheim.

PEOPLE: 2 LEAVE DIRECTOR POSTS AT EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jennings International, Camarillo, announced the resignations of 
Robert G. Sutherland, chairman, and Terry Vandewarker from its board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sutherland and Vandewarker are affiliated with Industrial Equity (Pacific) 
Limited (IEP), a substantial stockholder and creditor of Everest &amp; 
Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
The reason given for the resignations was possible conflict of interest. 
Everest &amp; Jennings said potential conflicts between the company and IEP 
might arise as Everest &amp; Jennings seeks to reach agreement with its primary 
domestic lender on long-term financing arrangements. The wheelchair 
manufacturer has been operating for several weeks on the basis of informal 
day-to-day waivers and extensions by its primary domestic lender.

14 FIRMS TO BACK IBM STANDARD FOR PCS

In a new thrust in the ongoing battle over personal computer standards, 14 
computer companies are expected to announce Wednesday that they will join 
forces to promote an International Business Machines design called Micro 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Micro Channel is a pathway -- known as a "bus" -- that carries information from 
one point to another within a computer. It also allows computers to give 
instructions to peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. A rival 
bus design, known as Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), has the 
support of most of IBM's major competitors in the personal computer business, 
including Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
The new Micro Channel Developers Assn. will include IBM, Intel, NCR Corp., 
Chips &amp; Technologies and Ing C. Olivetti &amp; Co., sources said. It will 
provide PC vendors with technical data about Micro Channel and otherwise 
promote its use as an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
"This group is trying to breathe some life into IBM," said John McCarthy, a 
Forrester Group analyst. "They are afraid of losing out to EISA." 
</P>
<P>
EISA, created in September, 1988, was the brainchild of a group of computer 
makers known as the Gang of Nine. The group, led by Compaq, received a 
tremendous boost last October when Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled the first 
personal computer based on EISA. Since then, several computer makers have 
adopted the EISA standard for 32-bit computers. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's Micro Channel, introduced as part of the PS/2 family of computers, is 
still in more computers than the EISA bus. But lack of the sets of chips needed 
to implement Micro Channel has made it more difficult for computer vendors to 
use the design, hindering its adoption as an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the presence of Intel and Chips &amp; Technologies in the Micro 
Channel coalition could mean that the group will also unveil plans to develop 
chip sets for Micro Channel. Intel already makes a chip set for EISA.

Cousteau Wants Antarctic Mine Ban: To save the "last unspoiled continent of the 
planet," Jacques Cousteau has called for a permanent ban on mining on 
Antarctica. He has already forced France to endorse the effort, after gathering 
more than 1 million signatures in protest the Antarctic Mineral Convention, 
which would allow commercial prospecting and exploitation of resources in the 
Antarctic. Australia and New Zealand are among other nations opposing that 
convention.

DOLLAR SLIDES IN SHORTENED SESSION

<P>
The dollar tumbled against most major currencies in New York, pressured by 
concerns over the federal budget agreement in a quiet session cut short by the 
Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Most currency trading ended by 1 p.m. EDT, when trades in currency futures shut 
down. Most of the dollar's losses occurred in Asia and Europe before the start 
of U.S. trading. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar sank to 130.48, down from 132.20 Friday. 
Early today in Tokyo, the slide continued, as the dollar hit 129.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
"The yen was probably the strongest currency today, along with the pound," said 
Achilles Macris, currency trader at Chase Manhattan Bank. "The yen was catching 
up with gains already made by other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
An anticipated drop in U.S. interest rates is driving traders to favor other 
currencies over the dollar. Lower rates are expected to make U.S. investments 
-- and thus the dollar -- less attractive to world investors. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound was boosted by its official entry into the European exchange 
rate mechanism, a semi-fixed grid that cuts volatility. The pound soared to 
$1.974, up from Friday's $1.945. 
</P>
<P>
Against the German mark, the dollar ended at 1.532 versus 1.547 Friday.

CREDIT: Short-Term Issues' Prices Rise Abroad 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mixed Monday in light holiday dealings. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasuries changed hands only overseas, as domestic government bond 
markets were closed for the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 9/32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield rose to 8.81% from 8.78% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term government issues rose while intermediate-term and long-term bonds 
fell. Credit market analysts said that reflected nervousness about investing in 
longer-term bonds until the federal budget impasse was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of short-term governments rose 1/32 point to 1/16 point, intermediate 
maturities fell 3/32 point to 7/32 point and long-term issues lost about 1/4 
point, according to Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Federal funds quotes weren't available because the Federal Reserve was closed 
for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Harvest Slowdown Fuels Soybean Rise 
</P>
<P>
Prices of soybean futures soared as much as 17 cents a bushel Monday on the 
Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy speculative buying spurred by harvest delays 
in the soggy Midwest. Grain futures also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, energy futures rose, precious metals were mixed, 
pork futures fell sharply and cattle were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans settled 5.25 to 17 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
November up 17 cents at $6.34 a bushel; October soybean meal surged $8.40 to 
$191.80 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures opened modestly higher and climbed gradually until about an 
hour before the close, when sudden strength in the soy meal market sparked 
rounds of buying by chart-based speculators, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In the metals markets, October gold futures on New York's Commodity Exchange 
rose $1.30 to $394.40 an ounce, following oil prices. October silver inched up 
just 0.3 cent to $4.67.

Oil prices soared Monday as news that Western warships fired shots across the 
bows of an Iraqi vessel rattled the market. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery jumped 96 
cents to close at $38.95 a barrel, approaching the Sept. 27 high of $40.10 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The all-time high for cash crude oil was $41 in 1980 amid panic buying fed by 
the war between Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The market soared on news that Western warships had fired shots across the bows 
of an Iraqi cargo ship that refused to stop for inspection. American, British 
and Australian forces boarded the cargo ship in the Gulf of Oman. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was carrying rice, flour and other cargo prohibited under a United 
Nations trade embargo, a U.S. Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline for November delivery closed up 1.11 cents at 93.75 cents a 
gallon. Heating oil rose 0.26 cent to $1.0296 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was also unsettled by news that two U.S. military 
helicopters disappeared while flying a routine training mission in the northern 
Arabian Sea.

Raytheon Co. won a $70-million engineering contract to improve the quality of 
air emissions at two Tennessee Valley Authority coal-fired electric plants. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Philadelphia-based United Engineers &amp; Construction subsidiary 
will help the TVA with preliminary design for flue gas scrubbers on plants at 
Cumberland City, Tenn., and Drakesboro, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Raytheon said the TVA awarded the contract in anticipation of new clean air 
legislation expected to be approved by Congress before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the work likely will have no impact on employment levels 
because the work can be done in stages through 1995.

Santa Ana winds gusting up to 50 m.p.h. swept the Southland on Monday, whipping 
up fires that destroyed or damaged more than two dozen houses and forced 
evacuation of scores of homes and an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters in Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties battled the 
wind-driven blazes that destroyed eight homes as temperatures rose into the 
high 80s and low 90s and the relative humidity plummeted from a morning high of 
76% at the Los Angeles Civic Center to 13%. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities issued a red-flag fire alert for mountain and hillside areas 
because of the combination of drought-dry brush, heat, wind and low humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predicted that strong winds could continue into Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gusts up to 30 m.p.h. fanned a blaze that destroyed four homes and damaged two 
others in Diamond Bar on Monday afternoon. The 20-acre fire, possibly started 
by illegal fireworks, started in heavy brush on a slope and swept toward the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was moving pretty quick," Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Bob Grafton said. 
"Dry winds were pushing it." 
</P>
<P>
The four houses that were destroyed were two-story structures on Redgate and 
Shade Hill drives. All had wood-shingle roofs, fire officials said. About 280 
county firefighters, using water-dropping helicopters and bulldozers, brought 
the flames under control at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the fire and the next thing I know, within five minutes, it had reached 
my house," said Cindy Derr, 34, a massage therapist, whose home was heavily 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Derr said she had time to grab her 8-year-old son and two dogs and escape. But 
she lost several pets -- a turtle, two rats and an iguana -- trapped in their 
cages in an upstairs room. "I just couldn't carry the cages," she said. 
</P>
<P>
George Azpeitia, 42, said he noticed the fire about 3 p.m. as flames spread 
toward his home from his next door neighbor's house in the 1700 block of 
Redgate. Azpeitia said he unsuccessfully tried to fight the flames with a 
garden hose. "It's devastated," he said, hugging his wife, Blanca, as they 
stood outside their heavily damaged home. "But it's not the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Ray Hall said the fire may have been 
started by fireworks. "We talked to a couple of kids who said they saw some 
skyrockets go off and then saw the fire come up the hill. But we haven't been 
able to locate anyone who set them off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby San Dimas, fire erupted in a garage at the rear of a 150-unit 
townhouse complex in the 12500 block of Meadowglen Lane and was spread by high 
winds to the wood-shake roofs of three homes, which Los Angeles County 
firefighters could not save. Residents of the homes escaped without injury. The 
blaze was attributed to a faulty clothes dryer. 
</P>
<P>
County fire Inspector John Lenihan said "this could have been a repeat of the 
Sept. 15 West Covina fire" in which 70 units in an apartment complex were 
destroyed in a wind-whipped blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, a 125-acre fire gutted one house, damaged 17 others and 
forced evacuation of 40 to 50 homes and an elementary school, authorities 
reported. The cause of the blaze was labeled "suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Five people, including two firefighters, suffered injuries, ranging from heat 
exhaustion to a fractured shoulder, said Riverside Fire Capt. Ed Couchman. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started about 10 a.m. in a brush area of De Anza Narrows Park, just 
south of the Santa Ana River. Whipped by 20- to 25-m.p.h. winds and fed by dry 
cottonwood trees and bamboo, it spread rapidly, climbing a 65-foot bluff and 
reaching $150,000 homes overlooking the park. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people were briefly evacuated to a nearby church, Couchman said. 
Students at nearby Mountain View Elementary School school were sent home. 
</P>
<P>
"The winds just whipped it into a frenzy," said Faye Dalman, 62, whose home on 
Grassy Trail Drive had minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
Randy McMillin, 32, said he returned home from work Monday morning to find 
50-foot palm trees lining his block aflame. His wife, Mary, had been told to 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Grab whatever you can and get out,' " Mary McMillin said. "I got 
my wedding pictures, our guns and personal things." 
</P>
<P>
Their home escaped damage. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 firefighters from the City of Riverside, Riverside County, San 
Bernardino County and prison crews were called to the fire, which was reported 
contained about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents in the fire area complained that they had been asking the county 
for a year and a half to clear brush from the county park, but nothing had been 
done. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was going to damaged the natural habitat (of birds)," said John 
Dalman, 61, Fay Dalman's husband. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, about 150 firefighters battled a fire that raced 
through 148 acres of brush-covered land along the Cajon Canyon foothills, 
briefly threatening the Tree House Fun Ranch nudist colony. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday evening, winds had died down, and firefighters were able to contain 
the blaze just short of Glen Helen Regional Park, said Greg Cooper, spokesman 
for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Cause of the 
fire was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Another fire in San Bernardino County forced evacuation of 100 people in Duncan 
Canyon north of Fontana, authorities said. Winds reaching 30 m.p.h. fanned 
flames across grass-covered fields. A shed was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Fires were reported in Santa Barbara and Orange counties, but no homes were 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Steve Burback of WeatherData, Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said that Santa Ana winds are "frequent this time of the year" when 
high pressure forms over the Great Basin and winds flow toward areas of low 
pressure off the Pacific coast. The upper-level winds are heated as they flow 
toward the sea, picking up velocity as they are funneled through the mountain 
passes, he said.

MWD MAKING OVERTURES TO OPEN DELTA WATER TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tiptoeing around the phrase peripheral canal, Metropolitan Water District 
officials are making overtures to Northern California environmentalists to open 
discussions on new ways of moving water south from the Sacramento-San Joaquin 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
MWD officials, who continue to see the delta as a prime solution to Southern 
California's water shortages, are approaching the subject gingerly because of 
bitter experiences. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a plan favored by Southern California water interests to build a 
$1.2-billion channel around the edge of the delta was defeated at the polls by 
an overwhelming negative vote in the north. The loudest voice of opposition 
came from environmentalists who saw the Peripheral Canal proposal as a blatant 
effort to deplete northern rivers and reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a decade later, MWD officials are renewing their pursuit of a canal-type 
facility to take the place of drawing water directly from the delta -- a vast 
network of waterways spilling into San Francisco Bay and fed mostly by the 
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. Making their first approach to their most 
entrenched opposition, MWD officials have expressed a willingness to consider 
any alternative but they acknowledge that they can see none better for "water 
quality, fisheries and water transfer efficiency" than a canal of some type. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California water wholesaler used recent hearings before the State 
Water Resources Control Board to go public with its strategy. It asked the 
panel to initiate talks between warring water factions and announced a 
willingness to negotiate environmental guarantees as part of any discussions 
over the construction of water transfer facilities in the delta. 
</P>
<P>
In later interviews, Carl Boronkay, MWD's general manager, said he was willing 
to put anything on the table including limitations on water exports and the 
designation of an independent commission to operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is simply that no one is getting anywhere by beating each other," 
he said. "Problems are worsening for all of us. Why don't we sit down and see 
what kind of facility would make the most sense." 
</P>
<P>
The delta is a major source of water for Southern California, which is supplied 
through the State Water Project, a system of dams, reservoirs, aqueducts and 
pumping stations. The project delivers only about half the water it has 
contracted to provide. Southern California officials maintain that new 
facilities -- such as a canal -- would increase its capacity and at the same 
time improve the quality of water that is shipped south. 
</P>
<P>
A canal would take possession of upstream water before it starts its 
labyrinthine trip through the delta and into the California Aqueduct near 
Tracy, the main channel carrying delta water to Southern California. By 
increasing capacity, officials say, more water could be pumped to storage 
reservoirs in wet years so less would have to be taken in dry years. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of increasing capacity sends tremors through the environmental 
community, which blames too much pumping in the delta for damaging the estuary 
and destroying fish populations. Despite the conciliatory words from Boronkay 
and other officials, the overtures to environmentalists have done little to 
dispel their fears that the water agency's real agenda is to move more water 
south. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mistake they (MWD officials) made in the past and they are likely 
to make in the future is that they equate more water for Southern California 
with more water leaving the estuary and that is unacceptable," said Tom Graff, 
senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Graff and others say they would be willing to talk, but old wounds inflicted by 
the water district are fresh in their minds. An open sore is what they consider 
the raw power exhibited by the water agency when it and other water interests 
used political clout to force the withdrawal of a 1988 draft report by the 
Water Resources Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists viewed the report as a significant victory because it would 
have recommended strict controls on future exports from the delta. Southern 
California officials maintained that its effect on urban water supplies would 
have been devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"When MWD says they want to sit down and talk you'll have to appreciate I'm a 
bit skeptical," said Barry Nelson, executive director of the Save San Francisco 
Bay Assn. "What they've done is fight like hell to prevent any increased 
protection for the bay." 
</P>
<P>
In practical political terms, Jerry Meral, executive director of the Planning 
and Conservation League and a moderate environmental voice on the subject of 
the Peripheral Canal, sees little chance that the MWD will make headway on a 
canal until fisheries are restored. 
</P>
<P>
"From an environmental point of view there aren't going to be some facilities 
until there is something like real fish, not just paper fish," he said. "I 
don't think more exports are verboten forever, but we have simply got to 
restore the environment before we start taking about more exports." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the environmentalists see the MWD as having formed an unholy 
alliance with agricultural interests who gobble up the lion's share of delta 
water exports. They argue that the best source of water to feed Southern 
California's growing population is not the delta but cutbacks on agricultural 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cynicism about the MWD's motives, Boronkay argued that it also has 
an interest in preservation of the bay. He acknowledged that cutbacks in 
agriculture use can save some water, but would do nothing for what he sees as 
his best argument for a canal -- water quality. By bypassing the southern delta 
where water picks up organic substances from surrounding farms and bromides 
from invading seawater, he said, a canal would ensure safer drinking water 
supplies for the more than 15 million people that the district serves in 
Southern California as well as millions more in communities in Alameda County 
and Santa Clara Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Boronkay said he also believes opposition to the 1982 proposal was rooted in 
fears that a canal would be operated in a way that would wreak havoc with fish 
and wildlife more than on concerns that the canal would be environmentally 
unsound. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not eager to misuse anything," he said. "I don't figure protection of the 
fishery is the monopoly of environmentalists. We are interested in the 
fisheries as much as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
However, Corey Brown, general counsel of the Planning and Conservation League, 
said environmentalists' greatest fear is that once there is the capacity to 
take more water from Northern California rivers, Southern California water 
interests will find a way to use it regardless of any promises to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
"If you build a facility, you replace natural or physical restraints just with 
paper promises," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has become a major customer of the Metropolitan Water District in 
the last two years as environmental concerns and a drought have forced it to 
cut back on its water diversions from the Owens Valley and Mono Basin in the 
Eastern Sierra. In 1990-91, it is expected to take at least half of its water 
supply from the MWD, a water wholesaler that in turn draws more than half of 
its water from the State Water Project. The MWD, which also gets water from the 
Colorado River, serves 300 communities in six Southern California counties 
stretching from Oxnard in Ventura County to the Mexican border.

SERIAL RAPES FOCUS ATTENTION ON ASSAULTS; 
</P>

CRIME: EXPERTS DISAGREE ON WHETHER THE INCREASED MULTIPLE ATTACKS ARE ANYTHING 
MORE THAN A STATISTICAL COINCIDENCE. BUT MORE CASES ARE BEING REPORTED, ALONG 
WITH A GROWING LEVEL OF VIOLENCE.

<P>
While four serial rapists have been suspected in the past month of committing 
at least 20 rapes in Los Angeles County, investigators and counselors are 
divided about whether these serial attacks should be attributed to an alarming 
new trend or to a mere statistical coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
What is certain is that the cases, which brought fear to neighborhoods from 
Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles, have focused attention on a crime that 
apparently is becoming more common in Southern California and, in its 
execution, more violent. 
</P>
<P>
State figures show that rape was up 7.6% in California during the first half of 
the year, and up 6.3% in selected portions of Southern California, even before 
the widely publicized cases. The numbers reflect a reversal of a downward trend 
of nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four serial cases have resulted in arrests: Willie Damone Taylor, 
28, of South-Central Los Angeles was charged last week with raping three USC 
students, and Joseph Brian Socha, 29, of Rancho Palos Verdes was charged days 
later in connection with separate attacks on four women in Long Beach and San 
Pedro. Two of the Long Beach victims told police their hair was cut off with a 
knife and inverted crosses were carved on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manhunts are under way for two other suspected serial rapists, one 
in Hollywood and West Los Angeles and the other in Santa Monica. The Los 
Angeles rapist is believed to be responsible for nine attacks over a five-month 
span, all against elderly women, police said. One victim was 88 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica attacker -- who poses as a window washer or gas company 
repairman -- is believed to have committed three sexual assaults in a single 
night this month and may be responsible for as many as 10 previous rapes, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the spate of serial crimes means that more rapists are assaulting more 
than one victim is a matter of disagreement among experts in Southern 
California. Some police investigators say the four recent cases may reflect 
coincidence and an unusual amount of media attention. Others, however, argue 
that serial rapes are becoming more common, reflecting the general rise in 
street crime, homelessness and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, there seem to be more (serial rapists)," said Detective Frank 
Stastny, a sexual assault investigator for the Santa Ana Police Department. In 
Santa Ana, six serial rapists have been accused of at least 25 rapes in the 
last two years -- a substantial number in a city that investigates 70 or 75 
reported rapes a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems more frequent now (to find) repeat offenders," Stastny said. 
</P>
<P>
But another Santa Ana investigator, Lt. Robert Sayne, said, "They've always 
been around. I haven't observed an increase." 
</P>
<P>
Crisis-center workers say the trends are difficult to gauge because as many as 
90% of all rapes go unreported, according to some studies. The classic serial 
rapist -- the man who adheres to a particular style of attack and preys upon a 
defined segment of the population -- is thought to be rare, said Julie Dodge, 
executive director of the Rape Hotline of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, 80% to 90% of all rapists are believed to repeat their 
crimes -- sometimes again and again and again. "You get some rapists who may 
strike 30 times before being arrested," Dodge said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very compulsive behavior and I don't think there are many rapists 
who just commit one," added Gail Abarbanel,director of the Rape Treatment 
Center of Santa Monica. The overall rise in reported rapes has been seen in 
most large Southern California cities except Los Angeles, Anaheim, Santa Ana 
and Torrance. In Los Angeles, the 976 rapes reported in the first six months of 
1990 represented a 2.8% drop from the totals for the same period last year. 
However, other cities recorded significant increases -- among them, Long Beach, 
San Diego, Oceanside, Huntington Beach, Inglewood and Pasadena, according to 
the state Bureau of Criminal Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are not the only cause for concern. According to some social 
workers, there has been a worsening in the manner of the attacks, which are 
being committed with more brutality. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing more cruelty and violence inflicted on (rape) victims," said 
Abarbanel. 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Patalano, a counselor at the Rape Hotline of Long Beach, recalls cases 
this year -- such as the kidnaping and rape of a 14-year-old girl on her way to 
school -- of a type that did not occur, or occurred only rarely, in the past. 
"The violence . . . toward women is just increasing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no statistics to document that perception, however. Detective Steven 
Laird of the Los Angeles Police Department's rape investigation unit said it is 
possible that the crimes are provoking more outrage now, or that victims are 
more willing to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
Laird said police this year are disturbed because they have noticed more rapes 
involving multiple assailants. He attributed the trend in part to escalating 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Reported rapes in Los Angeles have declined over the last decade -- from more 
than 2,800 in 1980 to fewer than 2,000 a year now, according to LAPD 
statistics. But the numbers can be deceptive, skeptics say. 
</P>
<P>
Some police officers present the figures as evidence of progress wrought by 
stronger victims' rights laws in California. According to Laird, rapists now 
get longer prison sentences -- 80 or 100 years in some cases involving repeat 
offenders convicted on multiple counts. Those criminals are now off the streets 
-- they must serve at least half their sentences before becoming eligible for 
parole -- and unable to prey on the public, Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue, however, that increasing numbers of rapes are simply going 
unreported because of the ineffective and dehumanizing nature of the legal 
system. One Los Angeles Police Department detective who asked not to be 
identified said the number of arrests resulting from reports of rape is small 
-- running only about 20% in cases reported to the department so far this year, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
During one recent period, the detective said, 50 reports of rape or attempted 
rape were logged at one LAPD division. Only 14 suspects were arrested, he said, 
and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office chose to file charges in 
just one instance. "Fifty rapes, only one filing," the detective commented. 
"There's something wrong with that system." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Campbell, head of the district attorney's sex crimes/child abuse unit, 
disputed the numbers, saying that in a more typical period the office filed 
charges in about a third of the cases presented for possible prosecution. In 
most of those cases, convictions were obtained, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, some social workers see a discrepancy between the LAPD's declining 
numbers and the frequency of calls to rape hot lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever remember a (period) like this . . . where there's so much panic 
among women," said Patricia Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Commission on Assaults Against Women, a private, nonprofit group. "We get about 
300 calls per month regarding rape. We used to get 100." 
</P>
<P>
Fears are heightened by publicity over serial rape cases and worries about AIDS 
and other sexually transmitted diseases. Although social workers said they were 
unaware of any cases in which women contracted AIDS from an attacker, victims 
face the agonizing process of being tested for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Rapes on college campuses also seem to be increasing, Abarbanel said. At UCLA 
earlier this year, the issue was widely debated after the Daily Bruin published 
an anonymous letter from a student who described how she was given spiked punch 
at a fraternity dance party until she was so ill she had to lie down -- and was 
raped by two men. 
</P>
<P>
The account drew several letters from male students who blamed fraternities for 
emphasizing alcohol and sexual conquests. 
</P>
<P>
"Freshman girls, especially new sorority pledges, are conspicuous targets at 
parties," one fraternity member wrote, also anonymously. "I've heard many guys 
specifically say to make sure the sorority pledges get plenty to drink because 
they are easy 'prey' " 
</P>
<P>
The victims of rape fit no particular pattern. Some recover from the trauma of 
the assault in six months; others suffer for years with flashbacks, nightmares, 
compulsive showering, fear of men. Dodge recalled a woman who broke down in 
tears remembering a day she was raped. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was 70, Dodge said. She had been raped at age 15.

Sexual assaults -- In Tuesday's editions, the Times incorrectly identified a 
series of crimes in Santa Monica as sexual assaults. The suspect, who remains 
at large, is actually a flasher who has exposed himself to victims during at 
least eight residential robberies since mid-June, Santa Monica Police Sgt. Bill 
Brucker said. Police said the man poses as a window washer or utility company 
worker to gain entrance to homes. He is described as a black in his 30s, 
5-foot-10 to 6 feet tall, with a stocky build and short hair, who typically 
wears work clothes or casual clothes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL ARGUMENTS DUE IN SPY TRIAL OF EX-FBI 
AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge is expected to hear closing arguments today in the case of 
Richard W. Miller, who is accused of passing secret documents to his Soviet 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, who is hearing the case in 
Los Angeles, on whether to convict Miller comes at the end of the ex-agent's 
third trial. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely to put an end to the 6-year-old case that has been an 
embarrassment to the FBI. The case could end with Miller becoming the only FBI 
agent ever convicted of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with portrayals of Miller in the earlier trials, prosecutors during 
the past seven weeks have characterized him as a bumbling FBI agent who was 
smitten by Soviet emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikova. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 53, who has never testified in his trials, is charged with six counts 
of bribery and espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said he will decide the outcome of the case after hearing closing 
arguments Tuesday.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE SENDS UP 200-FOOT FLAMES AT RECYCLING 
FIRM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fire engulfed an acre-wide mound of paper and cardboard at a Sun Valley 
recycling firm Monday afternoon, sending up 200-foot-high flames and thick, 
black plumes of smoke visible throughout much of the San Fernando Valley, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported and the blaze was contained in the yard of Sun Valley 
Paper Stock Inc., Los Angeles Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gusty winds blew burning embers that spread the flames throughout the 6-foot 
high paper pile and sent blasts of hot air into nearby debris, igniting it. 
Fire raged over the pile of paper and inside two corrugated metal warehouses 
containing rags, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, Assistant Fire Chief 
Richard Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fagan, one of the firm's owners, said that his 20 employees safely 
evacuated the yard, where up to 500 tons of recyclable materials were stored. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was under investigation and no estimate of monetary 
damages was available.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Make a fat joke or toss an insult at an overweight man or woman and you're 
skating on thin ice, say activists demanding a change in attitude toward the 
obese. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance, or NAAFA, say they've 
had enough of discrimination and cruel attacks simply because they carry extra 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't joke about ethnic groups, and it's not OK to poke fun at the 
handicapped. Fat is the last safe frontier," said Dee Davey, chairwoman of the 
Los Angeles chapter of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Fear may be the reason for attacks on the obese, said Samuel Dambrocia, an 
Orange County psychologist. "People are saying, 'Being fat is something I do 
not want to part of,' " Dambrocia said. 
</P>
<P>
But NAAFA members, who have begun fighting alleged discrimination on the job 
and in the media with letters and lawsuits, say there are indications of 
change, citing such prime time televsion shows such as "Roseanne" and "Babes."

FIFTH-DOWN WIN THROWN BACK IN 1940 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago, aided by a confused referee who gave Cornell a fifth down with 
three seconds to play, the Big Red beat Dartmouth, 7-3, in a memorable football 
game at Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years later, on Saturday, much the same thing happened at Columbia, Mo., 
when Colorado beat Missouri, 33-31, on a fifth-down touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the two finishes are strikingly similar: Seconds remaining . . 
. confused officials . . . a winning play . . . angry protests. 
</P>
<P>
There is one major difference. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1940, no one had to demand, plead, beg or even ask Cornell to 
relinquish its victory. Cornell simply surrendered it. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 16, 1940, heavily favored Cornell, ranked No. 1 in the nation, carried 
an 18-game unbeaten streak into its game at Dartmouth, which was 2-5. Dartmouth 
took a 3-0 lead early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:30 to play, Cornell took possession at Dartmouth's 42-yard line. The Big 
Red drove to a first down at the Dartmouth six, with 45 seconds to play. After 
three running plays, Cornell had reached the one. The Big Red was then 
penalized for calling a timeout after it had used its last, and the ball was 
placed at the six. 
</P>
<P>
A pass play into the end zone on fourth down failed. Dartmouth's players and 
fans rejoiced. However, referee William H. (Red) Friessel placed the ball on 
the six and signaled fourth down for Cornell. The Big Red halfback, Bill 
Murphy, caught quarterback Walt School's pass in the end zone with three 
seconds remaining -- on fifth down. 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth captain Lou Young protested to Friessel, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 48 hours later, after reviewing films of the final five plays, and 
after referee Friessel had publicly acknowledged his error, Cornell President 
Edmund Ezra Day voluntarily forfeited the victory, and Dartmouth was declared 
the winner by a 3-0 score. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking that day at a campus rally, Day, a Dartmouth graduate, talked of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't made that decision," he said, "we'd have been explaining that 
game as long as football has a place in intercollegiate athletics -- and I want 
no 'Long Count' on Cornell's athletic history." 
</P>
<P>
Writing of Cornell's decision that day, Arthur J. Daley wrote in the New York 
Times: "This action is unprecedented in intercollegiate football. Friessel had 
the courage to admit he had been wrong and Cornell had the sportsmanship to 
yield a success it felt it had not rightfully earned." 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Friessel said: "The mistake was entirely mine as the 
game's referee, and not shared in or contributed to by any of the three other 
officials."

JIM MURRAY: TAKING THE WRAPS OFF STUPIDITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
I guess I have to address the Lisa Olson-locker room sexual harassment issue. 
Everyone else has. 
</P>
<P>
The party line, we journalists' stance, is: How dare these scumbag athletes 
harass this sportswriter in the dressing room just because she's a female? OK, 
I'll buy that. I'm a journalist. I'm on her side. 
</P>
<P>
And sexual harassment of any kind is unconscionable whether it takes place at 
the office water cooler or Central Park. It's ugly, dangerous. It's criminal. 
Do it in Central Park and you go to jail. Do it in the New England Patriots' 
locker room and the owner profanely defends you. 
</P>
<P>
OK, to sum up, here is my view: 
</P>
<P>
1) Lisa Olson, as an accredited journalist, had every right to be in the 
football locker room. As a woman and a citizen, she had every right to be free 
from sexual harassment by a gang of allegedly naked bullies. Anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
2) Harassment of journalists by athletes in locker rooms is not new and 
predates women in the locker room by about a century. It went on before women 
went in locker rooms. It'll go on after. 
</P>
<P>
Item: Sam Wyche, Cincinnati coach, was fined $30,000 for denying a female 
reporter access to his locker room. Jim McMahon never even got a reprimand from 
the league for blowing his nose in the direction of a reporter in another 
locker room in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Like most sportswriters, I have been abused, vilified, threatened and ignored 
in locker rooms, even thrown out of one once by a ballplayer who didn't like 
something I wrote. It's one of the hazards of the business. If you put out 
oil-well fires, you expect to get burned. You deal with athletes who have just 
lost a ballgame -- or a World Series -- you expect to get abused. 
</P>
<P>
When the harassment takes on sexual overtones, it becomes ugly, although there 
were jeers along those lines even in the all-male days. 
</P>
<P>
I am old-fashioned enough to have been shocked when the first women appeared in 
locker rooms. And, frankly, if I were an athlete, I would not want a chorus of 
strange women watching me take a shower. I do not look good in a shower. I 
don't work out often enough and I prefer to meet women in a tuxedo if possible. 
</P>
<P>
However, having said that, I must admit that I have never seen a female 
reporter behave in anything but a highly professional manner in a locker room. 
I have never heard one tell a leering, off-color joke about it afterward. I 
have heard plenty from male reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting point about equal access is that most of the time male 
reporters are not permitted to enter women's locker rooms, so female reporters 
have to be barred (from women's locker rooms), too. In other words, if men 
can't go in, neither can women. 
</P>
<P>
So, tennis and golf and volleyball and track dressing rooms are generally 
off-limits to all reporters, and the cognizant associations require their 
athletes to consent to a news conference immediately after the competition in a 
neutral site where dress is not optional. 
</P>
<P>
It's come to this anyway in major athletic events. A Super Bowl. With upward of 
1,500 sportswriters on hand, the league has had to resort to the postgame 
tactic of bringing the star performers to a mass interview staging area where 
they stand on platforms to field questions from the media. The World Series has 
had to do that, too, although in both cases the locker rooms are also open. 
</P>
<P>
The rub is, in this day of super-saturation of an event by television, print 
reporters have to come up with another dimension to the story, other than 
who-won-and-how. To do this, they need the one-on-one, locker-side interview. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always this way. Back in the old, pre-TV days, plenty of beat 
reporters never bothered with the locker room. Jim Brosnan, who pitched for 
several seasons in the old Coast League, was at my house and I idly mentioned a 
writer who had covered the team for years. "You know so-and-so?" I asked 
Brosnan. He shook his head. "But you must have seen him in the locker room in 
all those years?" "Never," said Brosnan. "He never came in." 
</P>
<P>
You can't do that today. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution guarantees equal rights for all. There are laws to protect 
women from sexual harassment. These are facts that should have been known by 
the owner of the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
To me, the reactions of the owner are as reprehensible as those of his players. 
Victor Kiam, as an owner, should know how important the media is to his sport. 
You don't expect rookie players to realize that they're getting $2 million a 
year to bounce a ball upcourt or fall on a fumble because of the millions of 
words of free publicity given to their sport. Owners should know it. Owners 
should also know the Constitution. Football players sleep through classes. Guys 
who own electric-razor companies presumably don't. Kiam's insensitive remarks 
smacked of those guys who cheered a rape in a Massachusetts bar. 
</P>
<P>
Equal access has been court-ordered by a federal judge (and a woman at that), 
Victor, and you and your team better get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
The social scientists tell us we are tending toward a unisex society anyway. 
Well, the hell with that. On that, I'm on the side of the French, Vive la 
difference! 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship between athlete and journalist in a locker room is, too 
often, an adversarial one. There are mature adult athletes who recognize the 
value to their profession of publicity. Then there are those who refuse to talk 
to the media at all. Their privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the cretins who profanely and obscenely knock you out of their 
space. It's probably good news for everybody that they have been called to 
account, and Lisa Olson may have taken a big step toward promoting civility to 
all in the locker room. If you still have confidence in the system, that is. 
</P>
<P>
As Lincoln said, "To give any man (or woman) freedom is to give it to yourself. 
To deny any man freedom is to deny it for yourself."

<P>
In the middle of the second inning of what was supposed to be a pressure 
playoff game Monday, a beach ball dropped from the stands to left field. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, the Cincinnati Reds' left fielder, picked it up and began dribbling 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He dribbled left, then right, then cocked his hands and shot it into the arms 
of a ballboy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had more time," Davis said, "I would have put it through my legs and 
really showed you something." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have already shown the baseball world something. They are relaxed, 
irreverent and leading the National League championship series, two games to 
one, after a 6-3 victory over Pittsburgh Monday before 45,611 in Three Rivers 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In winning a second consecutive game against the favored Pirates, Cincinnati 
did it without production from its star hitters and without dazzling starting 
pitching, but also without worry. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan's wife predicted Monday morning that he would be the star, and 
the former Dodger laughed at her. Then he hit a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a dream day," he said. "Today I am the happiest man in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatcher didn't know he was going to be in the lineup until he arrived at 
the ballpark. The former Pirate hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
"The way things go around here, I'm not so sure I'll be playing in the next 
game," Hatcher said, smiling. "I better enjoy this now." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan and Hatcher combined to drive in all six Reds' runs, then Cincinnati 
clinched it with that predictable nastiness from its bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble, Norm Charlton and Randy Myers combined to hold the Pirates to one 
infield hit in the final 3 2/3 innings -- not one ball left the infield -- as 
the Reds won for the 13th time in 15 games that have featured all three 
relievers. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 1/3 innings pitched by the "Nasty Boys" in this series, the Pirates have 
one earned run and four hits and have struck out 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our personalities are all nasty," Dibble said. "But 
pitching-wise, that's a different story." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, with ace Jose Rijo pitching against the Pirates' Bob Walk in Game 4 
tonight, the Reds' chances have taken a big turn from last Friday, when they 
were trailing, one game to none, and facing Pittsburgh ace Doug Drabek. 
</P>
<P>
That was the game, eventually won by the Reds, in which players actually heard 
Manager Lou Piniella joking in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"It was late in the game and we were barely winning, and all of a sudden Lou is 
down at the end of the bench laughing up a storm -- somebody had told him a 
good joke," Todd Benzinger said. "It was then I realized, when you would think 
this team would be the most intense, it is the most loose. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, what is a playoff game? I think we realize we're playing to be the 
answer to a trivia question that, 100 years from now, nobody will be able to 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
Said Piniella: "We had so much pressure leading this division wire to wire, I 
told the guys, this is their reward. And man, they should enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
They have been listening, judging from the way they conducted their Saturday 
workout, which was complete with dogs running in the outfield and a mock church 
revival outside the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We are acting this way because nobody expects us to win," Dibble said. "I walk 
into the clubhouse after I pitch today and we are ahead three runs, and all Tim 
McCarver is saying on television is how the Pirates are mounting an attack. 
It's like everybody really wants the Pirates to win. Everybody but us." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates feel lousy, especially their top three hitters. Barry Bonds, Bobby 
Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke have combined for seven hits in 34 at-bats for a 
.207 series average with only one extra base hit and two "BIs. They had two 
hits in 11 at-bats Monday, failing to advance four runners. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry, Bobby and myself -- you don't want to try to do more than we're capable 
of doing," Van Slyke said. "But right now, we're all doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is their hottest pitcher, starter Zane Smith. After being traded 
from Montreal, he allowed three runs in 46 innings during September and 
October. But Monday he gave up five runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We remembered how we used to beat up on the Zane Smith of Montreal and Atlanta 
-- and that's how we approached him," Benzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in perhaps the most cutting blow of the day, the Reds noticed that 
even the Pittsburgh fans were down on the Pirates. There were 13,118 empty 
seats and a noticeable noise reduction from the first two games in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like another afternoon game here where both teams were out of it," 
Benzinger said. "The fans never really got into it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pirate Manager Jim Leyland: "It's a day game, a weekday game, and maybe 
those 10,000 people were smarter than I was. I thought we were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have much to cheer about in the second inning when Hatcher, after a 
single by Joe Oliver, hit his first homer since Aug. 1 to make the score 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the Pirates should have considered that an omen. They traded 
Hatcher to the Reds on April 3 for minor leaguers Mike Roesler and Jeff 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Leyland said Hatcher, who was with the Pirates for the last month of the 1989 
season, made too much money to stay and sit on their bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I could get in trouble for saying this, but I have somebody sitting making 
$700,000 and no playing time for him -- he deserves a chance to play," Leyland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates rebounded to tie the score with two runs in the fourth inning 
against winner Danny Jackson on Bonilla's run-scoring single and Carmelo 
Martinez's run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
But Bonds fouled out in that inning with runners on first and second. And Jose 
Lind struck out with one out and the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
And within 10 minutes the Reds led for good after Hatcher started the fifth 
inning with a double. Jackson bunted, Barry Larkin beat out a grounder down the 
third base line and Duncan homered to make the score 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has a sore knee, Larkin and Chris Sabo have combined to hit .152. 
But Duncan, Hatcher and Paul O'Neill have combined to hit .360 with two homers 
and drive in nine of the Reds' 11 runs.

MARSHALL MIGHT GIVE JAPAN A TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A part-time employee for the champions of the American League East, Mike 
Marshall might look for a job even farther east. 
</P>
<P>
Relegated to pinch-hitting with the Boston Red Sox, the former Dodger says he 
might follow the route explored by Cecil Fielder, who used a year in Japan to 
revive his career in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If something doesn't work out for me (in the big leagues) in the next year or 
two, I'm thinking about going to Japan for a couple years," said Marshall, who 
requested a trade from the New York Mets earlier this season when he was 
replaced at first base by Dave Magadan. "I've got to play. I've got to get my 
confidence and skills back, and I'd still be young enough to come back and make 
an impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like Fielder in that I'm the perfect player for Japan (being a power 
hitter), and I think it would be interesting. Besides, if I didn't do well I 
wouldn't know if I was being ridiculed because I don't speak or read Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has felt the jabs of teammates and media because of frequent absences 
from the lineup. In Los Angeles, he fought with Phil Garner and nearly fought 
with Pedro Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
His once-promising career is measured more in terms of skepticism than 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I started playing I always believed my teammates were sacred," 
Marshall said Monday as the Red Sox prepared for today's Game 3 of the AL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said anything negative about another player or questioned his ability 
to play, but the media (in Los Angeles) had to be getting that . . . from 
somewhere, and it was coming from the same people who ran to the bank to cash 
their checks when Gibby (Kirk Gibson) limped to the plate to hit that home run 
(in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series), the same people who then turned around 
and questioned why he wasn't playing last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, here's a guy who may have shortened his career by playing hurt in the 
playoff with the Mets that year, then he gets second-guessed for not playing. 
It's the perfect example of 'What have you done for me lately?' 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much you can do about it, and I'm obviously not the only guy it's 
happened to." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall is 30, but it's as if he misplaced his prime in the trainer's room. 
</P>
<P>
He has been on the disabled list seven times since 1984. Over the last five 
years, he has missed 271 games, the equivalent of more than 1 1/2 seasons. In 
1984, he had 20 home runs and 82 runs batted in in 144 games with the Dodgers, 
but that was the only season in the last five in which he played more than 105 
games. 
</P>
<P>
He opened this season as the Mets' first baseman, but he is closing it as 
nearly a forgotten figure with the Red Sox. He appeared in 83 games during the 
regular season, hitting 10 home runs and driving in 39. He last started Sept. 
17. In two pinch-hit appearances in the playoffs, he flied out against Bob 
Welch and singled off Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox acquired Marshall from the Mets for three minor league players July 
28. At the time, he was on the disabled list, sidelined by an inflamed 
intestine 12 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"My blood count was down and I was bleeding internally," he said. "I went in to 
see the manager (Bud Harrelson), and he didn't believe me because of all that 
went on with my back in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"He said if I didn't want to play I might as well go home because he was going 
to suspend me. The next day I was in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had traded Marshall to the Mets for Juan Samuel in December. 
Marshall said he had asked the Mets to trade him before he became ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed New York. I liked Buddy and Dave (Johnson) and the organization took 
great care of its players, but I wasn't playing and asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, you could go down the list of guys who weren't happy and wanted to be 
traded, but I say it and everyone wants to make a big deal out of it, like I'm 
hurting the club because I want to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that they had a lot of problems with left-handed pitching, and I 
could have helped out. Now Darryl (Strawberry) may leave, and I could have been 
the right fielder." 
</P>
<P>
With the Red Sox, Marshall said he understands his role, for the present. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it here, but I don't plan on being back," he said. "I was brought over 
as insurance, and I'm the perfect player for that because I can back up at 
first base, right field and DH. Joe (Morgan, the manager) got me a 100 or so 
at-bats as soon as I got here, and now he's going with the lineup he used most 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with that. I'm not going to make waves, but I think if the 
organization decides that I'm not an everyday player they'll trade me because 
I'm not the type to come off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 30. I've resolved my back problems and I need a place to play. If I get a 
chance to play every day I can put big numbers up again because I'm now 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has one year left on a three-year, $3-million contract he signed with 
the Dodgers before the 1989 season. A player traded with a multiyear contract 
can demand that his new club trade him, but there are technicalities involved 
in the Marshall case that may eliminate that right. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox situation is cloudy. Before Tom Brunansky's recent surge, it 
appeared the club would let him leave as a free agent, enhancing Marshall's 
desire to play regularly. Brunansky, however, has been such a pivotal force 
lately the Red Sox might be forced to meet his price. 
</P>
<P>
A recurring back strain is the one ailment that has sidelined Marshall most 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to do so much when I was healthy that I was reluctant to play and 
risk becoming less than a complete player when I wasn't healthy," he said. "For 
a long time I went with the assumption that a day or two off or an injection 
now and then was the answer, and I missed a lot of games because I wasn't 
really dealing with the problem. I finally went to a program of total 
rehabilitation where I'm in the weight room every day, and I feel great now. 
I'm convinced I can play every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if I had played 140 games a year I'd still be in Los Angeles, but I 
didn't and I have to start over again." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said he had only good feelings about his 12 years in the Dodger 
organization; that Manager Tom Lasorda consistently showed faith; that, 
although media reaction was rough at times, he realizes that's part of the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing to remember is that even just four or five years ago there weren't a 
lot of guys talking about back problems," he said. "Now every club has at least 
one guy who goes through it. Look at Jose Canseco, Don Mattingly, Wade Boggs. I 
mean, Dwight Evans has been out twice this year, but every time he's in the 
on-deck circle he gets a standing ovation. I miss a game or two and I'm treated 
like a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want this to be a sob story. This is my fifth playoff. I've had so 
many good times and am so far ahead of the game that it's not funny. I feel 
very fortunate."

RAIDERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN 5-0, BUT THEY ARE 4-1; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: WITH THE SEAHAWKS AHEAD, THERE IS LITTLE TIME FOR REFLECTING ON 
BLOWING A LEAD IN BUFFALO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders took 6 minutes 3 seconds Monday, the time it took Buffalo to score 
24 fourth-quarter points a day earlier, to reflect on what might have been at 
5-0. That's about all the time Coach Art Shell would allocate for Monday 
mourning after a 38-24 loss to the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't dwell on it," Shell said. "It got away from us. We should have won 
the game. We didn't. We'll watch (the film) today as a team, and then we'll put 
it away and get started concentrating on Seattle. . . . I think right now our 
team is more mature and can handle the situation better than they did in the 
past couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
You have to be mature to handle what happened Sunday in Orchard Park, N.Y., 
when a 24-14 Raider lead disappeared in minutes. You have to be mature to 
handle another team outscoring yours, 24-7, in crunch time. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-four points is too much to give to anybody," Shell said. "It's too much 
to give to a high school team." 
</P>
<P>
Before moving on, a few loose ends to tie up. The turning point? It wasn't 
Steve Tasker's blocked punt that led to a 38-yard touchdown return and 
Buffalo's first lead of the game with 6:52 left. It wasn't linebacker Cornelius 
Bennett's strip search of quarterback Jay Schroeder, in which Bennett sacked 
Schroeder, knocked the ball loose and recovered it, leading to a 23-yard field 
goal and a 31-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said the turning point came on the ensuing drive, when corner Nate Odomes 
stole the ball from Willie Gault after a reception at midfield and returned it 
49 yards for the final touchdown with 2:34 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we were ready to go right back down there and score," Shell said. "I 
felt we were in control of the game. We let them have control at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Shell also said the films revealed that Gault was out of bounds when Odomes 
snatched the ball from his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case, then the ball should have been ours going the other way," 
he said. "The officials didn't see it that way, so we have to live with it; not 
that we like it, but we have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
A few other inquiries before the Raiders move on to Seattle: 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the Raiders' pass rush? It led the league with 17 sacks going 
into the game, but remained stuck on 17 when it ended. Rookie linebacker Aaron 
Wallace, who had four sacks in two previous weeks, was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the Raiders' special teams? Solid as rock the first four 
weeks, the unit cracked against the Bills. Tim Brown fumbled a punt in the 
first half that led to a touchdown. A blocked punt in the fourth quarter turned 
into the go-ahead score. Shell said the Raiders didn't have a player assigned 
to Tasker, a special teams star, who ran untouched into Jeff Gossett's foot. 
Shell said he was free by design, and that Tasker just got a great jump off the 
snap. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's news wasn't all bad, though. Schroeder turned in another solid 
performance at quarterback, completing 17 of 29 passes for 244 yards and two 
touchdowns. His one interception came late on a desperate throw into heavy 
traffic. Schroeder entered the game as the AFC's second-rated passer, about 
eight or nine notches higher than some figured he would be at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay did an outstanding job," Shell said. "He threw the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive week against a formidable front, the Raider 
offensive line protected Schroeder well enough. Sunday, he had plenty of time 
until Buffalo's fourth-quarter adrenaline boost helped the pass rush break 
through the protection. 
</P>
<P>
"The line protected him really well early in the game," Shell said. "They gave 
up two sacks, and a couple of times they were nibbling at him, but he stood in 
the pocket and threw the ball. The line, they shut down a pretty good defensive 
front for most of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way again was left tackle Rory Graves, who in successive weeks has 
held Chicago's Richard Dent and Buffalo's Bruce Smith to nine tackles and no 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
So, other than a painful six minutes, Shell had no real gripes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good football team we've got here," he said. "We played hard, under 
adverse conditions again, with 80,000 people screaming and hollering. And we 
had control of the game. We just didn't put it away. Next time in that 
situation, I think we'll put it away."

LOSS TO BENGALS HAS RAMS RETHINKING DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: ROBINSON PROMISES THAT THERE WILL BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO PUT MORE 
PRESSURE ON THE OPPOSING QUARTERBACK. 
</P>

<P>
Even John Robinson, the ever-optimistic Ram Coach, has to squint nowadays to 
find a glimmer at the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Rams be as mediocre as their 1-3 start appears? 
</P>
<P>
A day after his team's 34-31 overtime loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Robinson 
was talking about dire consequences and schematic changes almost as much as he 
was seeking to point out the silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
Rose-colored glasses aren't quite as effective when your team is three games 
behind the 4-0 San Francisco 49ers and has shown little capability of shutting 
down passing attacks. Does Montana-to-Rice ring a bell? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're shaken by what has happened to us," Robinson said at his 
weekly Monday media luncheon. "We just have problems we have to solve, and if 
we solve those problems I think we can be a very good team. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't solve those problems," Robinson warned, "we're headed for a dismal 
season." 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday, the Rams' offense was ranked No. 1 in the league. The redesigned 
defense was ranked last, yielding 389 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur set a system in which they 
hoped to team up linebacker Kevin Greene with one of the Rams' big young 
defensive linemen on one side of a four-man line, giving the defense a 
consistent push every pass down. But partly because of injuries to Bill Hawkins 
and Brian Smith -- the big, young candidates for the job -- and Greene's 
holdout rustiness, rush has been non-existent, the scheme has bombed. 
</P>
<P>
After Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason's 471-yard passing performance, the 
most ever yielded by the Rams, this team is throwing up its hands and basically 
getting ready to start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't we get more pressure?" defensive end Doug Reed repeated, "I can't 
answer that. I just have nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he hasn't decided what the defense will do differently, only that 
it is time for a change. It could mean more blitzing by the linebackers, or 
switching around the four-man rush assignments, or more of the five-linebacker 
Eagle defense the Rams used so much in the past years. 
</P>
<P>
Although this week's opponent, Chicago, largely disdains the pass, Robinson 
said he wanted a solid pass rush in gear to better deal with pass-oriented 
teams such as Atlanta and Houston down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly have to do something to begin to put pressure on the passer," 
Robinson said of a defense that has only eight sacks. "Our initial plan to try 
to get more pressure this year has not succeeded. We're going to have to make 
some adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson did not rule out the possibility of trading for a pass rusher, but 
said that those elite kind of quarterback-hunters that could solve the Rams' 
malaise are hardly, if ever, offered on the market. 
</P>
<P>
So how hard is it to revamp a scheme the Rams have worked on from Day 1 of 
training camp after four games? 
</P>
<P>
"After the game Sunday, not difficult," Robinson quipped. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have been through worse slides than this, Robinson emphasized, most 
recently last year's four-game free-fall after a 5-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to create the impression that we're saying, 'Whoops, let's try 
something else.' We have to adjust what we do," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The key issue for us is to keep doing a lot of the things we're doing OK, so 
we're not abandoning the ship and trying to find a new one in the middle of the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have those hopes, and I still believe that this football team can win 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is we don't slide as a team, that we believe in ourselves. 
The solutions don't come from the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE STATISTICAL COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' disappointing 1-3 start is directly attributable to poor pass 
defense. Last in that category among the 28 National Football League teams last 
year, the team fared even worse this year.

HIGHLIGHT: BOOMER ESIASON 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't exactly a complete stranger to either the Rams or their fans -- they 
had watched some of his magic on television since 1985 -- but Boomer showed 
Sunday's Anaheim Stadium crowd conclusively why he was the AFC's top-rated 
quarterback the last two seasons. The Bengal left-hander completed 30 of 40 
passes for a club record 471 yards in his team's 34-31, overtime win. Not even 
nemesis Joe Montana of the 49ers has ever thrown for that many yards against 
the Rams -- his best being 458 yards last December. It was Esiason's third 
400-plus-yard performance as a pro.

THE DRIVE FINALLY GOES THE BROWNS' WAY, 30-29 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Bernie Kosar finally turned the tables on the team that has so 
often tormented him, leading Cleveland to 10 points in the final 3:21 and a 
30-29 victory over the Denver Broncos Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The winning points came on Jerry Kauric's 30-yard field goal as time expired 
after a 48-yard drive engineered by Kosar. A few minutes earlier, Kosar had 
completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Brian Brennan that cut a 29-20 deficit to 
29-27. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns had scored only three offensive touchdowns in their four previous 
games. But Kosar completed 24 of 38 passes for 318 yards and three touchdowns 
against the Broncos and could have had a fourth. A five-yard flip to Eric 
Metcalf for a touchdown was ruled a lateral and scored as a rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (2-3) ended a three-game losing streak that had left Coach Bud 
Carson's job in jeopardy. It came against a team that had beaten the Browns 
three times in the last four AFC title games. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say one game is the season, but if we had lost we would have been so 
far in the cellar we couldn't have dug ourselves out," said cornerback Frank 
Minnifield, who ended his holdout last week and had an interception Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"This meant a lot to a lot of people," Kosar said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost a 'must' win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Denver (2-3), which suffered five turnovers in a loss to Buffalo last week, 
took advantage of two Cleveland turnovers to overcome a 20-19 deficit early in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Kosar. He completed a 24-yard pass to Vernon Joines on fourth and two 
from midfield, then threw his third touchdown pass of the game, a 24-yarder to 
Brennan with 3:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
The final drive started with 2:04 left. Kosar completed passes of 15 yards to 
Joines, 20 to Reggie Langhorne and 15 to Brennan on a third-and-eight play to 
set up the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of heat on the team this year, and to come back in the 
fourth period the way we did is a tribute to a lot of guys," Carson said.

RAIDER, RAM QUARTERBACKS PLAY WELL; BILLS, BENGALS PLAY BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the Raiders, as well as the Rams, these are welcome-to-parity days. 
</P>
<P>
Their quarterbacks, Jay Schroeder and Jim Everett, played football about as 
well as it can be played Sunday in Buffalo and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But they were outplayed only by their opponents, Jim Kelly of the Buffalo Bills 
and Boomer Esiason of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Raider and Ram fans were saying Sunday night that their defenses collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
But that is what the other teams' fans had been saying when Schroeder and 
Everett were marching through the Buffalo and Cincinnati defenses. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that kind of year -- one in which the NFL has played a record 
number of good, close games, with more than 20 evenly matched clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the San Francisco 49ers, at 4-0, are three plays away from 1-3 -- three 
strange plays that barely beat New Orleans, 13-12; Atlanta, 19-13; and Houston, 
24-21. 
</P>
<P>
One of the conspicuously improving NFL quarterbacks is Schroeder, who didn't 
throw an off-target pass Sunday until the latter moments of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And even Schroeder should have lost in Seattle last month when an 
instant-replay malfunction saved the Raiders, 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
In a rematch, the Seahawks will be in the Coliseum Sunday when the Rams are in 
Chicago. No routs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
For Joe Montana, the 49ers' come-from-behind, fourth-quarter victory in Houston 
Sunday was his second in four games this season and 25th in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The man is still doing it the way he did it at Notre Dame long, long ago. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't even aging. At 34, he looks and acts 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel 24," the San Francisco quarterback said. "I remember how it was when I 
was 24, and the only thing that's really changed is that it takes me longer to 
heal now. 
</P>
<P>
"After a Sunday game, it used to be Tuesday before I felt whole again. Then it 
was Wednesday. Now it's Thursday -- and some weeks, Friday is starting to creep 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on how often I'm hit." 
</P>
<P>
He was only sacked twice in Houston Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't take a beating every week," he said. "I'm good for years. 
Retirement? I don't see it anywhere down the road." 
</P>
<P>
It is clear now that Minnesota Viking Coach Jerry Burns and his offensive 
assistant, Bob Schnelker, made a turning-point mistake last year when they 
accepted the trade that General Manager Mike Lynn completed to get running back 
Herschel Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, neither Burns nor Schnelker was aware of Walker's particular 
strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
As astonishing as it seems, they didn't know that Walker simply wouldn't fit in 
the Vikings' offense, which is based on trap blocking. 
</P>
<P>
They know now. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't change people. Runners, they have a style," Burns said. "Herschel, 
he's never been a guy to run that inside-trapping game." 
</P>
<P>
If Burns had only told Lynn that last year, the Vikings would have avoided the 
costliest trade they have ever made. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota and Pittsburgh are two of the NFL's more determined trap-blocking 
teams, and former Steeler Franco Harris, a Hall of Famer, is an example of a 
successful runner in that system. 
</P>
<P>
Walker is about Harris' size, but as football players they're wholly different. 
Always overrated as a running back, Walker could help any team that blended in 
his peculiar assets: extraordinary straight-ahead speed, great strength, 
uncommon pass-receiving abilities and an aptitude for leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But all that is wasted in Minnesota. The surprise is that an NFL coach hadn't 
thoroughly evaluated a prominent player before a big trade. 
</P>
<P>
With Jack Trudeau at quarterback, the underdog Indianapolis Colts beat another 
good team Sunday when they came from behind to surprise the Kansas City Chiefs, 
23-19, a week after they had come from behind to surprise the Philadelphia 
Eagles, 24-23. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing about this club is that no one has quit, no one has given up when 
we've been behind," said Trudeau, who is 2-0 in relief of injured rookie Jeff 
George, who started 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents didn't quit, either. The Chiefs didn't give up after Trudeau 
had rallied Indianapolis in the fourth quarter. They just aren't built for 
come-from-behind football. 
</P>
<P>
As a play-action team with an erratic quarterback, Steve DeBerg, the Chiefs are 
only at their best in two circumstances: when they're ahead or when they 
they're in favorable field position. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, the Chiefs are a Super Bowl club. No NFL defense is stronger. 
Nobody's special teams are more helpful. No NFL back is more powerful than 
Christian Okoye, and there are no noticeable holes in Kansas City's offensive 
line or receiver corps. 
</P>
<P>
But their play-action pass offense is based on faking a ground play before 
DeBerg throws the ball. They distrust dropback passing, and when they're in a 
catch-up mode -- when it's must-throw time for the Chiefs -- their opponents 
simply ignore the runner and rush the passer. 
</P>
<P>
That's what beat them this time. And that's the problem they'll have to solve 
to make a winner of DeBerg, who for 15 years has played NFL football as 
unevenly as he played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of a series of critical games in the NFC East this month, the 
Washington Redskins (3-1) will throw a young quarterback, Stan Humphries, 
against the New York Giants (4-0) and their veteran quarterback, Phil Simms, at 
Washington Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Redskins are professing confidence in Humphries, who, in his first 
start since replacing injured Mark Rypien this month, completed 20 of 25 passes 
for 257 yards as Washington beat Phoenix, 38-10. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes or breaks quarterbacks in this league is not hitting the things 
that are there," Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs said. "You'll find a lot of guys that 
can do that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hitting things when the plays aren't there. (Against Phoenix) Stan did a 
good job of creating things when the play didn't go as he expected." 
</P>
<P>
All the same, Gibbs is cautioning Redskin fans to be aware that Humphries isn't 
Simms, and that the Cardinals aren't the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Giant) defense is so good that it doesn't have to gamble," he said. "They 
say, 'Go ahead and see if you can do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
That would seem to be a big order for Humphries, who is only in his second 
season in the NFL after a college career at a Division I-AA school, Northeast 
Louisiana, where he began as an understudy to Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby 
Brister. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, battered in their last two games, have been enjoying the NFC East's 
14-day layoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if we had to pick a (bye) week, this would have been it," Giant Coach 
Bill Parcells said. "It will give (linebacker) Lawrence Taylor more time to get 
up speed and (tight end) Mark Bavaro more time to get ready." 
</P>
<P>
Preseason title contenders, the Redskins are scheduled against the Giants and 
Eagles four times in the next five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been tough with Rypien. Is it impossible with Humphries? 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done very well against the Giants with one week to prepare," said 
Gibbs, who is 0-4 in the last four Giant-Redskin games and 3-9 in the last 12. 
"Maybe the extra week will help." 
</P>
<P>
Quote Department: 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka, Chicago coach, on how the Bears lost to the Raiders a week ago: 
"Their line held us. And we missed 13 tackles." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moon, Houston quarterback, on former Coach Jerry Glanville, now of 
Atlanta: "Jerry wasn't a bad football coach. He just tried to do too much. He 
liked the attention that comes with the position." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville on Mike Holovak, Houston general manager: "Mike ran the draft, and it 
was my job to keep him awake." 
</P>
<P>
Mark van Eeghen, former Raider fullback, now a Cranston, R.I., insurance man, 
on his opposition to legalized betting on football: "It sends the wrong message 
to kids. They have minds like sponges, and are easily shaped."

When was the last time USC had a 200-yard rusher and a 100-yard rusher in the 
same game, as it did Saturday night against Washington State, when tailback 
Mazio Royster ran for 203 yards in 34 carries and fullback Scott Lockwood ran 
for 102 yards in 20 carries? 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't happened since 1929, when Russ Saunders ran for 234 yards, Jess Hill 
ran for 166 and USC piled up 753 yards on the ground in the first USC-UCLA 
game. 
</P>
<P>
USC won, 76-0. Its rushing yardage is still a conference record. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Marinovich hasn't thrown a touchdown pass since Sept. 15, when 
he passed five yards to tight end Frank Griffin with 3:05 left in the first 
quarter of a 19-14 victory over Penn State. That's 15 quarters without a 
touchdown pass for Marinovich, who threw three in USC's opener against Syracuse 
but has only one since. JERRY CROWE

COLORADO VICTORY UPHELD; SEVEN OFFICIALS SUSPENDED 
</P>

A play that never should have been run cost Missouri a victory, resulted in 
seven Big Eight officials being put on indefinite suspension and could affect 
the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Eight ruled Monday that Colorado's 33-31 victory over Missouri will 
stand even though game officials inadvertently allowed the Buffaloes a fifth 
down that resulted in the winning touchdown on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
Carl James, Big Eight commissioner, said in a prepared statement: "It has been 
determined that, in accordance with the football playing rules, the allowance 
of the fifth down to Colorado is not a postgame correctable error. The final 
score in the Colorado-Missouri football game will remain as posted." 
</P>
<P>
While there was confusion in the final frantic seconds, Colorado clearly had 
five downs. After spiking the ball on fourth down to stop the clock, 
quarterback Charles Johnson scored from the one-yard line on fifth down. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, ranked 14th, is 4-1-1 and could get a second consecutive shot at a 
national title if it repeats as Big Eight champion and returns to the Orange 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, whose collective experience totals 177 years and includes 19 
bowl games, were suspended indefinitely beginning with this week's games. Their 
future in the league was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
J.C. Louderback of Arkansas City, Kan., referee and crew chief for the game, 
said of the officials in a prepared statement: "We are human. We erred. And, we 
feel terrible in regard to the circumstances at the end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, who had charged that the field was so slick 
it was unplayable: "If Missouri had outplayed us and if the field conditions 
had been fair and an inadvertent mistake by an official had worked in our 
favor, I would call our squad and coaches together and discuss with them 
whether we should forfeit because we won unfairly," McCartney said. "But I 
don't feel like we did. 
</P>
<P>
"It was remarkable under the circumstances that we won the game. We counted 92 
times when our players slipped on that turf. That turf is treacherous and it 
took us right out of our game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dick Tamburo, Missouri's athletic director, of the fifth down: "I know no 
one purposely does anything like that. But we have seven people who were 
supposed to be monitoring that thing. The whole episode is most disappointing."

DONAHUE SEES SOME PROGRESS DESPITE DEFEAT 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a weekend to think about it, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue was philosophical 
about his team's 28-21 loss to Arizona Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky to beat Stanford and unlucky to lose to Arizona," Donahue said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his team's 32-31 victory over the Cardinal Sept. 15, 
achieved with one second remaining. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is 2-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference and 2-3 overall. Few teams with two 
losses have won the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that a cup is either half empty or half full, and he prefers the 
latter symbol in regard to his football team. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team has made substantial progress from a year ago despite our 2-3 
record," Donahue said. "We're getting better and we're close to being good 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins were 3-2 at this point last season. Then they didn't win another 
game, finishing at 3-7-1. 
</P>
<P>
While stressing that UCLA had several opportunities to beat Arizona and that 
officiating wasn't the determining factor, Donahue accepted one call and 
disputed another. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA led, 21-14, early in the fourth quarter when Scott Miller returned a punt 
51 yards for an apparent touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
However, a special teams player, Pat McPherson, was cited for clipping and the 
touchdown was nullified. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a close call and I see why he (an official) called it," Donahue said. 
"I can also say that 1,000 such blocks aren't called. But I have no complaint. 
I accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue disputed an offensive pass-interference penalty called against wide 
receiver Michael Moore in the third quarter when the Bruins had a first down at 
the Wildcats' 43-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"That call was very, very poor and very disturbing and certainly a costly 
call," Donahue said. "If anything, it should have been defensive pass 
interference, but that would have been a poor call, too. It was just two kids 
going for the football." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a non-call in the third quarter that was puzzling at the time. 
</P>
<P>
On the play preceding the offensive pass-interference penalty, UCLA's Brian 
Brown fumbled and Arizona recovered. However, the play was nullified because of 
an inadvertent whistle and the down remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will play San Diego State Saturday night at the Rose Bowl and the game 
could last nearly four hours because of the number of passes that will be 
thrown. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-3 Aztecs, 52-51 losers to Wyoming Saturday, feature quarterback Dan 
McGwire. The 6-foot-8 senior has thrown 133 consecutive passes without an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had to come from behind in the fourth quarter to beat the Aztecs, 
28-25, last year at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Tommy Maddox has assumed much of the blame for UCLA's loss to 
Arizona. He threw three interceptions, the last resulting in a 70-yard return 
by cornerback Darryl Lewis for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Said Donahue of the 19-year-old redshirt freshman: "Quarterbacks get too much 
recognition for victory and too much criticism for defeat. Tommy Maddox is 
going to be a quality football player. He's very young in terms of his age and 
in terms of his maturation as a player. He's going to be tremendously talented, 
gifted and successful. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to learn to keep the ball away from the opposite-colored jerseys. He's 
not doing a good job of that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Although Maddox has thrown eight interceptions in five games, he has also 
thrown seven touchdown passes and leads the Pac-10 in average yards per pass, 
8.65, and average yards per completion, 16.38. 
</P>
<P>
On the 70-yard interception, Maddox threw a pass intended for split end Reggie 
Moore on an out pattern on first down from the Arizona 36-yard line. Lewis 
scored with only 50 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to be a dangerous pass into the flat when the Bruins needed only a 
field goal to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The same people who called that play were the same people who called the 
fourth-down-and-two play to Scott Miller for a touchdown," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"My point is that sometimes you call them and they work and sometimes they 
don't work. Do we wish we had that play back? Yes. In hindsight we wished we 
had run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a poorly thrown pass and not a good (pass) route. We flat misfired."

NEWSWIRE: BIG EAST INVITES MIAMI TO JOIN UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Miami on Monday received an invitation to become the 10th 
member of the Big East Conference, and the school's board of trustees will 
decide Wednesday whether to accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Big East officials have been courting the independent school for several 
months, and had reportedly been awaiting a signal that Miami would accept an 
invitation before extending one. 
</P>
<P>
But Miami Athletic Director Sam Jankovich and President Edward Foote declined 
to predict how the 55-member board would vote. 
</P>
<P>
If the invitation is accepted, the role of Miami's football program in the Big 
East would be decided later. Boston College, Pittsburgh and Syracuse are the 
only Big East schools that play major college football, and all are 
independents in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
The other schools in the league are Georgetown, Connecticut, Providence, St. 
John's, Seton Hall and Villanova.

VINCENT: STEINBRENNER SUIT 'IMBECILIC'

Fay Vincent said Monday the filing of a lawsuit by George Steinbrenner's 
attorney challenging the transcript of testimony before the commissioner was an 
"imbecilic act." 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed last week against the firm that handled the transcript of 
Steinbrenner's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
It contends the testimony was changed to make Steinbrenner look bad. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner accepted the commissioner's findings that his dealings with 
gambler Howard Spira were not in the best interests of baseball, yielded daily 
control of the Yankees and signed an agreement preventing him from suing the 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the suit) is an imbecilic act which reflects enormous concern on his 
part about an agreement he signed," Vincent said. "He obviously doesn't like 
the agreement, and he is desperate to find ways of attacking it. He said in an 
agreement he would accept the findings, he would not attack it. And it's 
disturbing he's doing what he is doing."

REMEMBERING MARX AND LENNON; 
</P>
<P>
THE GREAT COMEDIAN AT 100: YOU BET YOUR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BROWN, Judy Brown is a free-lance writer who specializes in comedy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his opening monologue of the movie "Annie Hall," Woody Allen sets the tone 
of the film with a joke "usually attributed to Groucho Marx . . . 'I would 
never want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.' That's the 
key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Richard Lewis identified with Groucho's classic "club joke" growing 
up, in neurotic admiration. "That line screamed the low self-esteem I felt 
about myself, and I thought it was wonderful that Groucho said it with his head 
held high," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Julius (Groucho) Marx would have celebrated his 100th birthday last Tuesday, 
and the current crop of stand-up comedians, although generally considered the 
sons and daughters of Lenny Bruce, remember Groucho well -- from his movies 
with the rest of the Marx Brothers to his appearance as host of TV's "You Bet 
Your Life." Lewis and others consider his free-associating style, his sly 
innuendo -- even his poor posture -- crucial influences on their comedy and 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
When Lewis was traveling in Europe after college, he found a focus in Groucho. 
"When I was lonely, I'd check out the newspapers for Marx Brothers movies -- 
Groucho in Spanish was transcendent. Not only was he wonderfully sarcastic, but 
none of the surreal craziness of his relatives bothered him -- he out-crazied 
them. Which reminds me of my childhood. I should have brought this up with my 
therapist years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis estimates that he's seen "A Night at the Opera" and "Duck Soup" "400 or 
500 times. I've also shown these films to each of the women I had hoped would 
be important to my life -- about 30 or 40 women. If I could have told Groucho 
that he helped my performance in bed, he probably would have said, 'Well, 
forget the movie.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Groucho was the ultimate bad boy, he gave anarchy a good name," said Richard 
Belzer, who came to the realization as a teen-ager that "I was getting punished 
for the kind of wisecracks Groucho was getting paid for -- maybe someday I 
could be like Groucho." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Seinfeld was also struck at an early age by the possibilities Groucho 
presented. "I thought that the great thing about Groucho was that he was a very 
silly, full-grown man. ' 'What a good idea,' I thought. If you see one grown 
man acting silly, the next one does it more easily." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Reiser agrees. "I had just started getting into comedy as a fan when I 
discovered Groucho. Here was this comedy father-figure acting adolescent and 
producing irreverent, hip comedy that was so wonderfully incongruous." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewed as "abrasive, abusive -- and endearing," Bobby Slayton recently won an 
American Comedy Award as Best Comedy Club Comedian. Even before Slayton 
considered becoming a comic, "People would tell me I sounded like Lenny Bruce, 
but Groucho was more my hero. I've spent more time listening to and watching 
Groucho, and I've gotten more enjoyment out of him. Groucho had such a 
lightning, brutal wit, which was somewhat mean-spirited -- and I could identify 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Miller, a comedian who is a regular on the "Tonight Show" and who also 
improvised the role of the obsequious shop owner in the movie "Pretty Woman," 
is certain of Groucho's place in comedic history. "Did Groucho have an effect 
on stand-up comedy as we know it today? That's like asking, 'Did Roosevelt have 
an effect on J.F.K.?' " 
</P>
<P>
Groucho employed dozens of comedy writers in more than 50 years of performing 
-- including S. J. Perelman, Moss Hart and songwriters Harry Ruby and Irving 
Berlin. But the shrapnel ripostes Groucho fired off in private life were the 
forerunners of today's stand-up's one-line non-sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Saget's patter moves to a Groucho beat in his live act and (to a lesser 
degree on "America's Funniest Home Videos"). "Little did I know that I was 
raised by him subliminally," said Saget. "I've been told I use free association 
and twisted world allusions like Groucho, and it's been nice to be told I'm in 
the same free association with Groucho. Groucho had a mischievousness combined 
with a literacy. I'm mischievous and I'm trying to be literary, but I've got a 
lot of Cliff Notes to eat first." 
</P>
<P>
"Groucho is synonymous with the snappy comeback," Reiser said. "How many times 
have you seen even ordinary people raise an imaginary cigar and lift an eyebrow 
when making a retort?" 
</P>
<P>
"You hear a lot of comics breaking into a Groucho rhythm -- whether they 
realize it or not," said Saget. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian, writer and actor Robert Wuhl is sensitive to the sound of comedy. 
"Like all great comics, Groucho was also a musician with a great sense of 
rhythm. You can hear his influence in the delivery of every stand-up line 
spoken today and talk shows from Carson to Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Stone, the second banana on "Coach," loved Groucho's tongue-in-cheek sexual 
kidding on "Best of Groucho." "I can't tell you how liberating I found 
Groucho's sneaky sexual innuendo. At 6 I thought that his caustic quickness was 
sexy -- if I had been older, and he had been younger, he could have seduced me 
in a heartbeat. Of course, I also had a thing for Shemp, the sexiest stooge." 
</P>
<P>
Groucho had a career that skipped through 60 years -- not all of them 
successful -- and included nearly every entertainment media: vaudeville, 
Broadway, radio, TV, movies and, after retirement age, albums, books, live 
concerts and even dinner theater. Small surprise that comedians find that 
comedy span comforting. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Miller is an admirer of Groucho's longevity. "I loved his ad-libbing on 
'You Bet Your Life.' It was an event to see someone at that late point in his 
creative life who was so serene and confident, with such heart, and whose 
instrument was so finely honed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great joy to me to know how much had come before, and that he lived 
the last 10 years of his life as an elder statesman of comedy. Too many comics 
today think only of a cheap shot one year." 
</P>
<P>
Groucho's movies also provide a school for comedians in the lost art of broad 
comedy. As Seinfeld points out, "We didn't get to experience burlesque and 
vaudeville, us guys today, but we can see the Marx Brothers." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Tenuta learned the value of staying within character, and a crazy one at 
that, from Groucho. "The comics who last longest either do Jell-O commercials 
or smoke cigars. Groucho lives in me. I think he may be my father. I insult 
rich, aristocratic women -- have you ever noticed my walk? I'm thinking of 
growing that mustache." 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of the Groucho slouch, "Groucho Marx was enormously significant to 
me comedically, and his inspiration is exceedingly evident in my poor posture," 
said Stone. Lewis demurs, "I have the worst posture of any 'living' comedian -- 
I'm going to have a casket made with a little hunch." 
</P>
<P>
But, most of all, this generation of comedians misses Groucho. "I just did Dick 
Cavett's show, and I told him how much I envied his getting to know Groucho 
personally," said Lewis. "To me, Groucho's up there in the same pantheon with 
Lenny Bruce and Hendrix." 
</P>
<P>
"As a comic writer, to have met Groucho would have been like going to Lourdes," 
said Miller.

CRITIC AT LARGE: COMPOSER DOES HIS HOMEWORK IN MUSIC HISTORY; 
</P>

ALL-FUN CLASS ON THE BEAUTY OF MUSIC.

<P>
In a steely and stressful time, geopolitically speaking, it is curiously 
refreshing to step aside for an evening or several, and contemplate the course 
of musical beauty from the 14th Century forward. 
</P>
<P>
Composer Leonard Rosenman's cathedral-ceilinged living room has a grand piano 
flanked by a pair of hi-fi speakers capable of raising the dead. There is on 
one side of the room an open stairway and an open mezzanine. Both, toward 8 
o'clock of a Wednesday evening, are well-populated, like the living room 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenman takes a last sip of red wine, commands his three-dozen attendees to 
silence, and begins to talk about Richard Wagner. For 45 minutes, Rosenman 
talks eloquently about Wagner's departures from the musical past. He plays 
themes on the piano, plays the prelude to "Das Rheingold" at full volume so 
that it is both felt and heard. He reads reviews (scathing) of Wagner's work. 
(So much for critics.) 
</P>
<P>
The crowd adjourns to the kitchen for coffee and cookies and then Rosenman 
talks again for 45 minutes, fielding questions and steering discussions about 
Wagner, about all music, about the impact of the Industrial Revolution and 
other external forces on composers and audiences, about the growing personal 
and emotive content of music. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions began more than a year ago when Rosenman lived in Malibu and was 
newly remarried, to producer Judy Campbell. She knew more about her husband 
than about his music and considered taking a course in music history at UCLA. A 
friend of hers wondered if Rosenman couldn't do it himself just as well. He has 
taught theory and composition at USC and elsewhere and he thought he could. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with 14th-Century chants," Rosenman said before a recent session. 
"Now we're into the 20th Century and I'm going to invite some of my composer 
friends to join us. That should be lively." 
</P>
<P>
The group, which started with only half a dozen of his wife's friends in 
attendance, has grown by word of mouth and now attracts as many as four-dozen 
listeners, friends of friends of friends. The regulars include an eye surgeon 
who also plays concert-quality piano, an ad agency owner, actors (the Leonard 
Nimoys, the Arte Johnsons) and actresses (Joan Chen of "Twin Peaks" and "The 
Last Emperor"), models, producers and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"No cost (except to me; my wine bill has gone up considerably), no credit, no 
attendance-taking, no homework, just pleasure and maybe a new way of listening 
to music," Rosenman says. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenman began a career in film scoring with "East of Eden." One of his piano 
students, James Dean (for a short time before success distracted him), brought 
him to the attention of director Elia Kazan. He also scored "Rebel Without a 
Cause" and such subsequent films as "The Chapman Report" and "Fantastic 
Voyage." He won Oscars for "Barry Lyndon" and "Bound for Glory" and most 
recently wrote the music for "RoboCop 2." 
</P>
<P>
He has also written a good deal of music for television, with Emmys for "Sybil" 
and "Friendly Fire." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Brooklyn grocer, Rosenman first thought of being a painter, 
although he also studied piano. Hearing Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," he once 
said, persuaded him that there was much to be said for composition. He studied 
with Roger Sessions at Berkeley, with Luigi Dallapiccola and, briefly, with 
Arnold Schoenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The way of the serious composer is not easy anywhere, the supply of patron 
princes being in short supply, and most composers teach, not always happily. 
"They couldn't survive without the university, though most would be ecstatic to 
be liberated from it." Rosenman has taught a lot, never so cheerfully as in the 
present gig. 
</P>
<P>
Film and television composers are nicely paid, but it has historically been 
hard for them to be taken seriously thereafter, outside film and television, 
whatever their origins. "It's not true elsewhere in the world, but in this 
country, yes," Rosenman says. "It can make you schizophrenic." 
</P>
<P>
Up to 1953, he had had five major performances of his works, he says. After he 
wrote his first film score in 1954, it was 20 years before he enjoyed another 
major performance. Now, after the long, slow time, he appears to enjoy the best 
of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
He is working hard to finish orchestrating a 40-minute violin concerto 
commissioned by the National Orchestra in Washington. It will be performed by 
William Steck, the orchestra's concertmaster, with Mstislav Rostropovich 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a commission from the Kronos -uartet for a work for them and this 
week was asked by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Holland to write a 
concerto for its principal oboist. 
</P>
<P>
His serious work tended to be austere and intellectual, as if to demarcate it 
sharply from the more accessible, narrative music he was writing for the media. 
(Ironically, along with Alex North and Bernard Herrmann, Rosenman gets credit 
for helping to lead film music away from the massive, blanketing, 
post-Tchaikovsky sounds that characterized the Max Steiner-Dmitri Tiomkin era.) 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the last few years, Rosenman says, "I've been going back to my original 
ideas, back to the kind of music I was making in the early '50s, back to 
tonality." His work during the lean years, he says, "was hard as nails, 12-tone 
exercises. My wife calls it my root-canal music. The violin concerto will 
surprise people, I think. I don't worry about the old 12-tone problem, what 
note do I write next." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenman took up tennis at 50 and skiing at 60. "It seemed to me that the way I 
was going, I was using my head more and more and my body less and less, and if 
I kept on my body was going to shrink and my head would expand so I'd end up 
looking like a Martian." He looks admirably symmetrical. 
</P>
<P>
It pleases him that the regulars at his soirees in the Hollywood hills 
occasionally now catch him. "I played the last Beethoven quartet and carried on 
about the two themes. One of the women said, 'I think you're wrong. There's 
only one theme and a variation.' I said, 'My God, you're right.' "

HE WASN'T BUCKWHEAT, '20-20' ACKNOWLEDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'It was a real foul-up in research," a spokeswoman for "20/20" acknowledged 
Monday, referring to the ABC program's story last Friday about a grocery clerk 
in Tempe, Ariz., who it said used to star as Buckwheat in the "Our Gang" 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
The actor who actually played the role, William Thomas, died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"20/20" spokeswoman Maurie Pearl said that the magazine show had undertaken the 
segment after receiving a letter from a viewer who said that the man who had 
played Buckwheat in the films of the 1930s and '40s was living in Tempe. The 
man interviewed was named Bill English; he told "20/20" that he had changed his 
last name from Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
The network is looking into the matter and is likely to apologize when "20/20" 
airs Friday, Pearl said. Whatever disciplinary action is taken will be handled 
internally, she said.

BLIND WOMAN HIT WHILE TRYING TO CROSS INTERSECTION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 33-year-old woman was critically injured Monday as she attempted to cross 
Crown Valley Parkway not far from where a 3-year-old was struck and killed less 
than two weeks ago, reigniting concern about traffic along the heavily traveled 
route. 
</P>
<P>
Darcel Briones of Laguna Niguel sustained head and pelvic injuries and two 
broken legs in the early morning accident. Briones, who is legally blind, was 
listed in critical condition after she underwent brain surgery at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 8:30 a.m. as Briones, carrying a white cane, 
attempted to cross the intersection where Alicia Parkway dead-ends into Crown 
Valley. Friends and witnesses said that Briones, who lives about a half-mile 
away, was walking to the nearby shopping center when she was hit. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Briones, whose vision is restricted to a few feet, walked across 
the westbound lanes and stopped in the median. As she attempted to cross the 
westbound lanes against a green light in a marked crosswalk, motorists pleaded 
with her to stop, said Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates, who received a 
police briefing on the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Briones was struck in the intersection by a car driven by John 
MarcLagourgue, 21, of Laguna Beach. Lagourgue was not cited and an 
investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
State law gives the right of way to blind people carrying white canes, 
Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said. Investigators will attempt to determine 
whether the driver was in a position to see the cane, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was similar to a tragedy on Sept. 27 when a 3-year-old boy was 
killed after he and his baby-sitter were struck by a passing car as they walked 
against a green light at the intersection of Nueva Vista and Crown Valley about 
a mile up the road. 
</P>
<P>
The death of 3-year-old Thomas Burge reignited community concern about speeding 
motorists on Crown Valley, one of south county's most heavily traveled 
roadways. Some residents have dubbed the roadway "the Crown Valley Freeway" and 
have called on city and county officials to reduce the 50 m.p.h. limit along 
sections of the six-lane parkway. 
</P>
<P>
"The young man (driver) probably was not speeding, but each and every accident 
along Crown Valley should be a lesson for the powers that be . . . because 
something has to be done (about the speed limit) sooner than later," said 
Michael Roos, a Laguna Niguel resident who was shopping at a grocery store in 
the Alpha Beta shopping center after Monday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Vanderschams, Briones' next-door neighbor, speculated that traffic 
lights contributed to Monday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I've walked there many times, and you cannot cross the median without the 
'Don't Walk' lights coming on," said Vanderschams, 64. "Think how much more 
difficult it would be for someone who can't see well, or is legally blind for 
that matter." 
</P>
<P>
Bates, who launched her political career 10 years ago as a founder of a 
community group dedicated to reducing the parkway's speed limits, on Monday 
called the accident "an unfortunate tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the Sheriff's Department, which contracts to provide police services 
for the city of Laguna Niguel, had increased patrols on the thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that they have increased their numbers," Bates said. 
"Speeders are more mindful of their presence." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Pointe Niguel Apartments, the complex where Briones lives, 
expressed shock. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very independent person," said neighbor Jennifer Baker. "She takes a 
lot of pride in doing things for herself . . . like going to the store and 
entertaining her friends. It's so sad." 
</P>
<P>
Vanderschams said Briones lived alone but received support from her parents who 
live in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"She takes good care of herself," Vanderschams said. "Why did this have to 
happen?"

2 BRUSH FIRES FANNED BY DRY WINDS SCORCH YORBA LINDA;

<P>
A pair of small brush fires, fanned by hot, dry Santa Ana winds, burned up to 7 
acres in the Yorba Linda foothills Monday as the strong offshore gusts whipped 
up fires throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County fire officials sent extra crews to control the two blazes in the 
foothills, where winds reached 45 m.p.h. and vegetation was described as 
extremely dry. Officials feared the fires would get out of control and spread 
to thousands of acres of tinder-dry brush land. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, four homes were destroyed and two damaged in Diamond Bar in an 
afternoon blaze that started in brush at the base of a slope and burned uphill 
to homes with shake roofs and worth about $350,000 each, Los Angeles County 
fire officials said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside, one house was gutted by fire and 17 others in the Anza Narrows 
area near the Santa Ana River sustained minor damage; at least 50 homes and a 
junior high school had to be evacuated. By evening, the fire had blackened at 
least 125 acres, much of it covered by heavy brush. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, fire raced through about 148 acres of brush-covered 
land along the Cajon Canyon foothills, briefly threatening the Tree House Fun 
Ranch nudist colony. 
</P>
<P>
The first Yorba Linda blaze started at about 8:45 a.m. when gusty winds knocked 
down a power line near a Metropolitan Water District filtration plant at 3972 
Valley View Ave., said Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha. 
Two acres were charred in that blaze. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours later and less than a mile away, winds "arced" a power line, 
causing it to give off sparks that started a 3- to 5-acre blaze near 4024 
Valley View Ave., where Shell Oil Co. has a pumping station, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a battle," she said. "The winds are so erratic. . . . But we have 
been fortunate so far." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County fire officials sent out 10 engines, two bulldozers, a fixed-wing 
aircraft and two helicopters to battle the second blaze, said Jose Valbuena, an 
Orange County fire spokesman at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have easily gone to 1,000-plus acres," Valbuena said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze forced one crew to take off midway through the dedication ceremonies 
of a new, $1.6-million fire station on the east side of Yorba Linda, where a 
3,600-unit housing development is being constructed. Plans were to display the 
station's new engine at the ceremony, but it was taken to the fire scene. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bibeau, 31, who lives in a neighborhood where homes have shake-shingle 
roofs, said that at one point flames came within half a block of her house. She 
said that she was standing by to turn on a sprinkler system her family had just 
installed to wet down their roof in the case of such a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The response (of the firefighters) was great; it was really great," Bibeau 
said. "But this one is a little too close to home. With the winds, all it takes 
is just one spark to light it on fire on the roofs." 
</P>
<P>
Both fires were controlled within an hour, Cha said, but fire crews remained at 
the sites for several hours to guard against any flare-ups because of the 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
According to weather forecasters, hot, dry weather and gusty winds are expected 
to continue today. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as temperatures are concerned, it will probably be in the low to 
mid-90s (today) -- another hot day. And there will be a Santa Ana wind 
condition, though not as strong," said Ken German, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides weather forecasts for The Times.

WHAT THE $78 MILLION WILL BUY;

<P>
THIS TIME, DONALD BREN TREATED AS HERO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once considered the bad guy in Laguna Beach, Irvine Co. chairman Donald L. Bren 
was given a hero's welcome Monday evening as officials celebrated a landmark 
agreement to save Laguna Canyon from development. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many months there that I did not think we would come to an accord. 
But the last few weeks I was heartened and we did, and I am very, very pleased 
to be a party to buying Laguna Canyon," Bren said during a reception at Hotel 
Laguna that drew an estimated 450 people. 
</P>
<P>
For environmentalists who have been battling for more than a decade to block 
the Irvine Co.'s proposed Laguna Laurel development on 2,150 acres of unspoiled 
canyon land, Bren's attendance at the reception was ironic. 
</P>
<P>
After years of protesting -- including marching through Laguna Canyon and 
picketing Bren's Newport Beach home -- the environmentalists, city officials 
and Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and Bren jointly celebrated the 
preservation of open space. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, finalized Sunday, ended years of discord by allowing the city to 
buy the last undeveloped coastal canyon in Southern California for $78 million 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the agreement is very, very fair. It's fair from all sides," Bren 
said as he urged the crowd to approve Measure H, a $20-million bond measure on 
the Nov. 6 ballot. If passed, it will go toward the purchase of the land. 
</P>
<P>
The $50-per-person reception had been promoted as a fund-raiser for the Measure 
H campaign, which had been running in slow motion pending the outcome of land 
acquisition talks between the city and the Irvine Co. But the City Council's 
unanimous approval of the agreement Sunday set the stage for the campaign and 
brought life to Monday's festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bond measure crowded into the hotel's first-floor dining 
rooms and bar to hear the two sides exchange congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview following his brief speech, Bren said he never intended to 
sell the property -- independently appraised at $105 million -- below 
fair-market value. 
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that once we understood and we were educated by the Laguna 
community and they understood us, we were able to reach an agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bren also conceded that he was persuaded to meet the other side at the 
negotiating table after a march through the canyon last November drew an 
estimated 8,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struck with that -- the number of people who turned out. I believe the 
number and the sincerity of the people impressed me, and we moved forward with 
our discussions and our negotiations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After his speech, Bren accepted a T-shirt from Laguna Greenbelt Inc. president 
Elisabeth Brown and donned a button that read, "Don Bren says save the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mayor Lida Lenney predicted that voters would express their support 
for the canyon's serene rolling hills and natural lakes by approving Measure H, 
which needs a two-thirds vote to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though $78 million sounds like a lot of money, the $20 million that we 
will get from that bond issue is not going to cost the individual homeowners in 
Laguna Beach more than they are willing to spend," Lenney said. "I think that 
what they will gain from that will be much more than what it will cost them." 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the bond issue would mean a property tax increase of 6 1/2 cents 
per $100 assessed valuation. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had feared that without a viable financing plan to purchase the 
canyon property, the bond issue would not receive voter approval.

4 HURT IN CHAIN-REACTION CRASH AFTER MAN LOSES CONTROL OF CAR

A 21-year-old Corona del Mar man lost control of his car Monday and caused a 
five-car pileup that left him and three others injured, including a 77-year-old 
man who was hospitalized in critical condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The accident stemmed from a lane-changing dispute," Irvine Police Sgt. Tom 
Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
The collision, which occurred about 1 p.m. on MacArthur Boulevard south of 
Bonita Canyon Drive, forced the closure of MacArthur for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Hume said the driver of an Acura was heading north on MacArthur Boulevard when 
he apparently began arguing with the drivers of a red Porsche and a blue, 
four-door BMW over lane changing. 
</P>
<P>
"All three drivers were seen driving erratically," Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, the driver of the Acura tried to change lanes and lost control, 
Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver crossed the painted median and swerved into the southbound lanes, 
where his car collided head-on with a 1990 Honda driven by the elderly man, 
Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
The collision sparked a chain-reaction crash involving three other southbound 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The BMW and the Porsche sped away. Hume said investigators were looking into 
the possibility the accident is a "non-contact hit and run." 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify any of those involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old victim was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation and taken to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana in critical condition. The driver of the Acura 
was taken to UCI Medical Center and reported in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of a Pontiac 6000 LE and a Toyota sedan received minor injuries and 
were expected to be released from Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, police said. 
Occupants of a Volkswagen Fox, which was at the rear of the pileup, were not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Guitta Darbani, 17, a passenger in the Volkswagen, said all she saw was "smoke 
and green stuff coming from (the Honda). We thought it was going to blow up. . 
. . All I could remember was a really loud noise. I kept telling (the driver) 
to stop, but she said she couldn't." 
</P>

A stretch of MacArthur Boulevard from University Drive to Bison Avenue was 
closed in both directions for several hours while investigators combed through 
the wreckage and measured skid marks. 
</P>
<P>
Hume said investigators have not determined how fast any of the drivers were 
going or exactly what led to the accident. He also said no citations have been 
issued pending the outcome of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The (investigation) is a little sensitive at this point," he said. "We're 
still trying to gather all the information."

<P>
Police have requested that anyone who may have seen the accident or what led up 
to it to call either Hume or traffic investigator Keith Milledge at (714) 
724-7021.

QUILT BANNERS MADE FOR MIDEAST MARINES

<P>
The Battalion Landing Team 1/4 -- deployed to the Middle East since the Persian 
Gulf crisis began in August -- will soon receive handmade messages of love in 
the shape of four quilt banners made by the wives and family members of the 
Camp Pendleton Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. George Flinn led the battalion team's deployment, and his wife, Kitty, 
heads the support group for spouses at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Flinn organized the quilt project to raise spirits among the wives. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was on the downside because of what was happening, and this got them 
into an upbeat mood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and other family members joined the wives in making the 
6-inch-by-6-inch personalized squares that make up the queen-size banners. Each 
is decorated with puff paint, embroidery and fabric pens. 
</P>
<P>
Several spouses glued photographs and yellow bows as reminders of home. The 
children drew handprints or sprinkled fabric glitter. 
</P>
<P>
"As many wives as possible who left the base to stay with their families living 
out of the state were contacted about the project," Flinn said. 
</P>
<P>
The four quilts will be presented to the ships Cayuga, Ft. McHenry, Okinawa and 
Ogden by a first sergeant who has been on emergency leave but will return to 
the gulf region today. 
</P>
<P>
Flinn said she and the other wives hope that by late next week their husbands 
will all get to see the quilts. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 500 wives with husbands in the battalion participated in 
the project, according to Jeannie Baldwin, whose husband is with the 13th 
Marine Expeditionary Unit on the Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
The quilt bound for the Okinawa will feature the Creed of the Red Badge of 
Courage. Other banners have poems or the American flag as a centerpiece. ROSE

CHILDREN SIGN LAST HOSPITAL BEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Young patients at Children's Hospital of Orange County stepped into the 
sunshine Monday to sign the steel beam that will top the hospital's new, 
200-bed acute care facility. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 patients, some in wheelchairs and others trailing IV's, grabbed 
colored magic markers to decorate the final eight-foot beam of the new 
six-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
"For some of them, we had to get three or four of us under the beam and sort of 
lift it so some of the kids who are severely limited to wheelchairs could sign 
it," said Brian Mottishaw, assistant administrator of buildings and 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
Some patients simply printed their names on the white-coated beam, while others 
embellished their signatures with hearts and drawings, Mottishaw said. Those 
who helped to decorate the beam will see it bolted into place at a special 
ceremony Thursday, when a 200-foot crane will hoist it to the top of the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're building it for them and it's nice for them to be part of it," he said. 
"Their signatures will last as long as this new hospital lasts." 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new facility, which will replace the current complex at 
Main Street and La Veta Avenue, began in January and should be completed by 
October, 1991, Mottishaw said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no need for television recently," Mottishaw said. "(The children) 
have had their noses to the window with this thing going up." MARY HELEN BERG

GROUP SEEKS VOTE ON ROAD WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Fullerton citizens group has filed the signatures of more than 11,000 
residents who want voters to decide whether Bastanchury Road should be widened. 
</P>
<P>
If the city clerk validates the signatures, the measure will then go before the 
City Council, said Mary Homme, leader of the Save Our Bastanchury group. 
</P>
<P>
The council would then have three options: call a special election, adopt the 
measure or study the initiative further, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Bastanchury filed a similar petition in July, but an error in the 
wording of the ballot disqualified the 7,700 signatures that were submitted. 
The group opposes widening Bastanchury because of concerns that the expansion 
would cause traffic and noise problems. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Save Our Bastanchury re-circulated the petition which included the 
necessary language explaining the group's reason for sponsoring the measure, 
Homme said. However, the group was unable to refile the petition in time to 
qualify it for the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We mailed the petition to the people who had signed the original document 
explaining what had happened," she said. In addition, volunteers collected 
additional signatures in front of grocery stores in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The group was formed last year to stop the widening of a one-mile stretch of 
Bastanchury Road. The proposed measure would prevent the city from widening or 
improving any street if current or predicted traffic noise would rise above the 
levels outlined in the city's general plan. ERIK HAMILTON

CONSTRUCTION WORK KNOCKS OUT PHONES

<P>
More than 450 telephones in the northern section of the city were knocked out 
of service Monday, apparently after a construction crew severed an underground 
phone cable, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency phone service to the Fire and Police departments was also severed for 
a short time around 2:20 p.m. until backup systems came on line, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were back on line as soon as we noticed the interruption in phone service," 
said Jack Stubbs, emergency planner for the city Fire Department. "It was just 
a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Phone company officials say they believe the accident occurred when a backhoe 
operator doing construction work near the intersection of Avenida Presidio and 
Calle Neblina severed an underground cable. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got (to the construction site) there was nobody there," said Linda 
Bonniksen, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell. "But it appears as if that is what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Phone service was expected to be restored by midnight Monday, she said. FRANK

FEE STALEMATE CAUSES COUNCIL TO DELAY VOTE 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of a stalemate between the city and the developer over future fees, the 
City Council on Monday night postponed for a week a vote on a development 
agreement for the 768-acre Holly-Seacliff area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement would be between the city and the Huntington Beach Co. 
-- the largest and most influential landowner in the city. The company wants 
the 15-year agreement to exclude Holly-Seacliff from any new fees on 
development that the city may enact in future years. 
</P>
<P>
But City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga urged the council to insist that the 
development be subject to any future fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I am adamant on this," Uberuaga said. "The city is not as financially sound as 
it should be. I would hate to see us preclude ourselves from new fees in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Co. officials, however, said in a position paper that the city 
would be asking too much to expect the company to pay new fees in the future. 
The position paper said that the company has already "agreed to mitigation 
measures and the construction of public improvements well in excess of the 
project's impact. We have also agreed to pay increases to all existing fees 
that may be adopted in the future as well as any and all new citywide taxes. 
The project . . . therefore should be exempted from any new fees programs." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement would allow the Huntington Beach Co. to build 3,780 new 
homes in the Holly-Seacliff area, in addition to some commercial and industrial 
development. The agreement, in effect, would be a 15-year contract that would 
protect the company's right to build on the land. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the city would get increased park acreage donations, a new water 
reservoir, a police substation and a new fire station. The Huntington Beach Co. 
said it would give 41 acres of land to the county's new Bolsa Chica Regional 
Linear Park and an additional 12 acres for new city neighborhood parks in the 
Holly-Seacliff area. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents addressed the City Council on Monday night, urging the 
council members not to "rush" the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Dettloff, president of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, a major environmental 
organization, said: "The agreement is being rushed . . . the public is being 
denied an opportunity to carefully review the Holly-Seacliff agreement." 
</P>
<P>
She urged the council to insist that the agreement include an additional six 
acres of parkland at Ellis Avenue and Edwards Street that would connect the 
Linear Park to the city's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

BEACHFRONT ENCROACHMENT ISSUE GETS AIRING BEFORE CITY COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents crowded into City Hall Monday night for one of their last chances to 
voice opinions on illegal patio and fence extensions built by many beachfront 
property owners on publicly owned beaches. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70 people attended the first of two public hearings before the City 
Council. The first 1 1/2 hourswere devoted to a staff report on the issue and 
discussion of legal details involved in the council decision. 
</P>
<P>
Council members quizzed city staff members about issues ranging from who owns 
the easements to the jurisdiction of the California Coastal Commission, which 
must finally approve any policy. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the 600 homes between the Santa Ana River channel and the tip of the 
Balboa Peninsula, 295 infringe on the city's street right of way, which runs 
along the oceanfront between the houses and the water. Some of these patios, 
fences and decks extend up to 27 feet beyond the homeowners' property lines. 
</P>
<P>
Among options the council is considering is the recommendation of the citizens' 
beachfront encroachment committee -- which would allow encroachments of up to 
15 feet for a prorated yearly fee of between $50 and $200. 
</P>
<P>
The council also looked at a second proposal, developed in early August by the 
Planning Commission, which called for a limit on encroachments of 10 feet, and 
a three-year phase-out period for non-complying homes. Both plans specify the 
types of landscaping and development permitted within the patio area. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents say the patio extensions amount to a giveaway of valuable 
property, but others argue that the encroachments were not illegal when built, 
and that 15 feet is reasonable when the width of the beach is considered. They 
also contend that blowing and drifting sand can damage homes facing the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents built these walls and fences to protect their property, and they've 
made the area more attractive in the process," said west Newport resident Frank 
Spratt. "The time to have considered restrictions or annual permit fees may 
have been in the mid-'50s." 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal before the council deals solely with the encroachments of 
back-yard decks and sand walls onto public beach, much of the council's debate 
centered around the proposed extension of the city boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission, which must ratify any action taken by the council, has 
said that it would be more inclined to accept the extension of some property 
lines onto public property if there is an effort by the city to increase 
"lateral access" (parallel to the water) for the public in the form of a 
sidewalk or bike path.

DOCTOR DEFEATS RED TAPE JUNGLE IN BID TO SAVE WOMAN; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: AN IRVINE MEDICAL CENTER PHYSICIAN SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A MEDI-CAL ID 
NUMBER FOR A PATIENT IN DESPERATE NEED OF A LIVER TRANSPLANT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rayola Petersen's life hung in the balance. Comatose and suffering from 
multiple organ failure when she was admitted to Irvine Medical Center, doctors 
said that she needed a liver transplant to survive. 
</P>
<P>
But Petersen, 57, had no private health insurance, and though she was covered 
for a variety of illnesses under the county's Indigent Medical Services plan, 
that program does not pay for liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Dr. Jahangir Ahdout, an internist at Irvine Medical Center, 
intervened on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the liver, she was dead," he said Monday. "She wouldn't have had any 
chance of survival." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks mainly to his efforts and persistence, medical center officials say, the 
story has a happy ending. After three days of telephoning physicians, hospitals 
and state health insurance officials around the state pleading his patient's 
case, Ahdout obtained a Medi-Cal identification number for Petersen, enabling 
her to qualify for state health insurance and consequently gain admittance to 
Pacific Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen is now awaiting surgery at one of the few facilities in the state with 
an open bed for a liver-transplant patient. 
</P>
<P>
"For all of this to happen in three days is amazing with all of the 
bureaucratic stuff they had to go through," said Stacey Griffin, a medical 
center public relations spokesperson. "There was a 99% chance she would die the 
next day when she was first brought into Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
When Petersen was admitted to the hospital Oct. 1, she was eligible for 
Medi-Cal, a state insurance plan that serves the poor and elderly. But the 
process of obtaining an identification number can take several months through 
normal channels. In the meantime, her doctor feared, Petersen could die. 
</P>
<P>
Ahdout personally telephoned physicians, hospitals and state health insurance 
officials, pleading the urgency of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"They (hospitals) said, 'There is no way we're going to take this patient 
without a medical (ID) number,' " Ahdout said. "I was spending 10 to 15 hours a 
day on this patient, nights and days. I was coming home and getting on the 
phone to different medical offices and physicians to make them accept the 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 4 p.m. Thursday, Petersen received her Medi-Cal identification 
number and within 20 minutes was on her way to San Francisco.

WIFE CHARGES THAT OFFICIALS MADE KEATING A SCAPEGOAT; 
</P>
<P>
LETTER: IN HER STATEMENT, MARY ELAINE KEATING DESCRIBED HER HUSBAND'S 
INCARCERATION AS A LIVING NIGHTMARE INTENDED TO SILENCE ALL THRIFT OPERATORS.

Describing her husband's incarceration as a "living nightmare," the wife of 
jailed executive Charles H. Keating Jr. charged Monday that he has become a 
"scapegoat" for officials desperate to find someone to blame for the 
"destruction of our American banking system." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual statement in the case of the man who has become America's 
best-known white-collar inmate came from Mary Elaine Keating, wife of the 
former chairman of American Continental Corp., who has been in Los Angeles 
County Jail since Sept. 18, unable to post $5 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Her letter, sent to several newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, 
charges that the harsh treatment of her husband by authorities is designed to 
silence all thrift operators. 
</P>
<P>
She lashed out at Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who said that, as 
a warning to executives, Keating's mug shot should be hung in corporate 
boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to tell me that Charlie is not being used as a weapon of fear," Mary 
Keating wrote. "Try to convince me that he is not now being treated as a 
convicted felon." 
</P>
<P>
And she bemoaned the conditions of his incarceration: 
</P>
<P>
"He spends every day in a tiny concrete cell with an iron door," she wrote. 
"Except for court appearances, he does not see daylight. He is chained and 
shackled . . . when he is escorted to the attorney room to meet with his 
lawyers. He is allowed one visit per day, which consists of talking on a phone 
through a plexiglass wall while he is chained to a chair and guarded." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, which appears on The Times' editorial page today, comes in the wake 
of Keating's jailing on charges of committing fraud in the sales of $200 
million in bonds through branches of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Good, solid citizens, who have been stripped of their businesses and their 
jobs, are sitting back quietly -- ever fearful of becoming another Charlie 
Keating," writes Mary Keating in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Holding an "untried, non-threatening man" in jail before he can go to trial 
"runs counter to everything I always believed in the Constitution and civil 
liberties in America," Mary Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, long a critic of federal regulators, is charged with 42 counts of 
securities fraud and other violations of state law in connection with the sale 
of American Continental bonds to thousands of investors. Many of the investors 
were the elderly who thought the bonds were safe and federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
The company filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, rendering those 
bonds worthless. Regulators seized the Irvine-based thrift the following day. 
Lincoln's failure is expected to cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But to Mary Keating, her husband is "a loving, caring and honest individual who 
has time for all our concerns and needs, as well as those of the needy of the 
world. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She said the government "delights" in his inability to fight "this immense 
battle" from a jail cell. "The games they have been playing with him are 
ludicrous," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Keating scoffed at the idea that her husband should remain in jail because 
he posed a serious risk of fleeing the country. "Charlie Keating has never fled 
from anything," she wrote. "Why should he start now?" 
</P>
<P>
She also criticized the media. "He is lied about and mocked in the press and 
the media. Every day we read more and more horror stories about the things 
we've never done. Once one paper runs a story, others repeat it like it's 
gospel truth." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, on advice of his lawyers, has refused to grant any interviews while in 
jail.

IBM'S MODEL IN EAST BLOC IS HUNGARY'S OPERATION 
</P>

<P>
IBM Hungary is the giant computer company's window on the East. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary was one of the few Western companies to weather more than four 
decades of communism in Hungary. Now it is serving as IBM's model for expansion 
in the rest of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the reason communist authorities allowed a little bit of capitalism to 
survive all those years is that it filled a vital need: It serviced IBM 
machines that were used to perform the census and other record-keeping, said 
Eugen K. Hahn, managing director of Eastern European operations for 
International Business Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We took care of the equipment, so we protected the investment the government 
made," he said in an interview at IBM's modernistic headquarters building in a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
IBM Hungary employs nearly 100 people, all Hungarians, to sell and service the 
company's products. 
</P>
<P>
Zsuzsa Branyik, who resigned as general manager of IBM Hungary in April after 
about 20 years, recalled how the subsidiary managed to survive during the 
communist years even though it was limited largely to servicing equipment, not 
selling new machines. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the 1960s, even the service operation was shut down and the 
engineers transferred to the state. But in the early 1970s, the company was 
given back its employees and began to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wonderful for me to work today -- so many things are much, much 
easier," said Branyik, the only female head of a country organization IBM has 
ever had. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has sales and service representatives throughout the former East bloc, but 
it wants to establish a greater presence in these nations along the lines of 
IBM Hungary, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
To increase its presence, IBM has donated computers to universities in several 
Eastern European nations as part of what it calls its academic initiative. In 
exchange, the universities are expected to develop software and ties to local 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
IBM also plans to tie these universities together in a computer network, and 
then link that network to the West -- one of the first such computer 
connections in the former East bloc, Hahn said.

FileNet Corp., a maker of computerized document processing machines, said 
Monday that it expects to report a loss of $500,000 for its third quarter ended 
Sept. 30, compared to a loss of $1.8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues are expected to be $22 million, up 18% from $18.6 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
FileNet said it shipped 19 systems during the quarter, compared to 18 systems a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company had announced earlier that it expected its third-quarter earnings 
to be lower than expected, saying customers were delaying orders because of 
concern about the economy and turmoil in the Middle East. The company's 
projections were in line with most current Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects to release final results for the quarter by Oct. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
FileNet supplies equipment that is used by businesses and government agencies 
to convert paper records into electronic data that computers can understand.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PINKERTON'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT UP 61% FROM 1989 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pinkerton's Inc., a Van Nuys-based security services concern, said its fiscal 
third-quarter profit soared 61% from a year earlier despite a 4% decline in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter ended Sept. 7, Pinkerton's said its net income jumped to $2.79 
million from $1.73 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Its revenue slipped to $135.5 million from $140.6 million, which the company 
said reflected its decision to drop some marginal clients. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of its fiscal year, Pinkerton's profit was $2.99 
million, down from $3.73 million a year earlier. The lower earnings were due to 
a one-time, $2.8-million charge in the latest period stemming from Pinkerton's 
early repayment of debt. Its nine-month revenue fell 4% to $403.1 million from 
$419.6 million.

APSB BANCORP'S PROFIT INCREASES 30% FOR QUARTER

APSB Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks-based parent of American Pacific State Bank, 
said its third-quarter profit rose 30% from a year earlier, to $566,000 from 
$436,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its assets as of Sept. 30 stood at $204 million, up 15% from 
$177 million a year earlier. The asset growth was aided by APSB's opening of a 
new office in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
APSB, which has five branch offices, attributed the profit gain to cost 
controls and strong loan demand, particularly for its Small Business 
Administration loans.

AGENT TAKES AMWEST SUIT TO INVESTORS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMISSIONS: A MASSACHUSETTS INSURANCE EXECUTIVE WRITES TO THE COMPANY'S 
STOCKHOLDERS, SAYING THE FIRM OWES HIM THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not content to leave his gripe with Amwest Surety Insurance Co. to the courts, 
Massachusetts insurance agent Alfred D. Jordan has taken his case to some major 
stockholders of the company as well. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Diagnostics of Massachusetts Insurance Agency, which Jordan owns, 
filed suit against Amwest Surety Insurance Co. of Woodland Hills for about 
$340,000 in Superior Court in Van Nuys, claiming that the company owes it 
thousands of dollars worth of commissions for selling Amwest's insurance 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Diagnostics claims Amwest owes it commissions for marketing various 
surety bonds, which are like insurance policies that guarantee the performance 
of the holder, such as a building contractor, to a third party. The bond is a 
financial guarantee that the work will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan has also sent a letter to major Amwest stockholders complaining that 
the company was refusing to pay him the money he said he was owed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Goodell, chief financial officer of Amwest Insurance Group (Amwest 
Surety Insurance Co.'s parent), said the company has acted in good faith toward 
Jordan, but declined to comment further on the case, which was filed in April. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a judge ordered Amwest and Insurance Diagnostics to take their 
cases to an independent arbitrator before Feb. 1. The judge warned that if 
Insurance Diagnostics did not try to arbitrate the case first, he might dismiss 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday the law firm originally representing Insurance Diagnostics in court 
sought a judge's permission to stop working on the case because the company 
allegedly owes the law firm $17,621. The law firm, Pettit &amp; Martin of San 
Jose, complained in a court filing that Jordan had refused to communicate with 
his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan admitted that he could not pay the attorneys but denied that he had lost 
touch with them. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months that ended June 30, Amwest's net income increased 5% to $1.66 
million from $1.58 million a year before, and its net premiums -- an insurance 
industry measure of total revenue -- climbed 31% to $22.4 million from $17.1 
million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Insurance Diagnostics had an agreement, beginning in 
February, 1987, to be the exclusive agent for Amwest in Massachusetts in 
marketing the companies' surety bonds. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the case is the question of how much money Amwest owes Jordan 
and his agency on business Amwest did in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Diagnostics claims that it was to be paid a cut of any business that 
Amwest did in Massachusetts, whether or not it was generated by Insurance 
Diagnostics. Amwest was also supposed to pay Insurance Diagnostics a contingent 
commission as a kind of bonus if Amwest did a large amount of business in the 
state, the agency claims. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Amwest and Insurance Diagnostics disagree over whether 
that bonus agreement was in effect in 1989, and whether the bonus was to be 
paid only for business that Insurance Diagnostics generated -- or whether it 
was for all business Amwest did in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its lawsuit, Insurance Diagnostics tried to get a judge to force 
Amwest to immediately put up $135,692 -- the amount the Massachusetts agency 
claimed it could easily prove Amwest owed. But a judge ordered Amwest only to 
put up about $34,000.

WILL THIS PEACE PLAN FLY?; 
</P>
<P>
IDEAS: MAHARISHI SAYS FLYING, TM-INDUCED LEVITATION, CAN EVEN CALM PERSIAN GULF 
CONFLICT, IF PRACTICED ON A GRAND SCALE.

You know the '60s are really back when the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi starts talking 
to the press again. 
</P>
<P>
The maharishi, the Indian guru best known for introducing meditation to the 
West in the '60s through the Beatles and other celebrity followers, has an 
unusual plan for ending the crisis in the Persian Gulf. And, though he rarely 
grants media interviews, he wanted to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
By telephone, from Vlodrop, Holland, where he is visiting, the guru pointed out 
that lasting peace will never be created through the tactics of fear now being 
pursued in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace can only be stable if there is support, if there is nourishment and 
certainly not fear. What has happened to Kuwait can happen to any country at 
any time," he warned in nearly flawless English and in the lilting, sing-song 
tones familiar to viewers of his educational television shows. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the maharishi considers it a "laughing stock" that governments are 
using economic blockades and other tactics of intimidation to fight "the 
darkness, the madness of Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
"No wise man fights the darkness. What he does is he does not deal with the 
darkness. He just brings the light," the bearded, gray-haired guru declared. 
"It's not necessary to deal with any madman. It's only necessary to nourish his 
existence . . . and the next day he'll be a changed man." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, though, the maharishi's method of providing nourishment 
is bound to strike many as strange, if not downright impossible. Indeed, the 
maharishi summarized his prescription for permanently ending conflict 
throughout the world in just one, rather startling word: flying. 
</P>
<P>
For followers of the India-based teacher, flying is nothing new. But it's not 
particularly easy, either. 
</P>
<P>
It's an advanced form of their leader's stress-reducing Transcendental 
Meditation practices, which TM officials say have now been taught to nearly 3 
million individuals worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In flying, as taught by the guru, meditators attempt to levitate, which they 
believe is possible when their brain waves reach an altered state far beyond 
that of standard meditation. 
</P>
<P>
"Meditation is a process which widens the mind," the maharishi explained, 
describing the now-familiar practice of quieting the mind and using a word or 
sound known as a mantra to reach an expanded state of consciousness -- a 
procedure that was initially ridiculed by Westerners when he began advocating 
it 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying is a process which widens the mind via the activity in the body, 
because the mind is in a transcendental state of consciousness. . . . The 
phenomenon just demonstrates the integration of the mind and body. The body 
becomes so integrated with the mind that the intention of the mind is carried 
out by the body." 
</P>
<P>
Since the maharishi began offering his flying techniques in 1976, through the 
TM-Sidhi program, thousands of advanced meditators throughout the world have 
followed his instructions and attempted to fly. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he acknowledged, even the most advanced "flyers" are actually just 
exuberant hoppers at the moment, as journalists who have witnessed their 
exhibitions have attested. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, to the maharishi, who fully expects his hoppers to fly eventually, 
it doesn't matter. "When the first airplane flew, it actually hopped," he 
asserted. "But that hopping was celebrated in terms of flying. The first flight 
was a hop, but everyone said it took off. It doesn't matter what we call it. 
The phenomenon, that level of intelligence from which this phenomenon is 
promoted, is really a perfectly balanced state of natural law." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when large numbers of hoppers get together and attempt to fly, he 
insisted, their positive energy emits such a powerful force that the entire 
world cannot help but be affected, even to the point of laying down its weapons 
and moving toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
By the maharishi's calculations, 7,000 hoppers hopping together anywhere in the 
world, for half an hour twice a day, then meditating together for another 20 
minutes are enough to generate world peace. He claims the energy produced by 
such a group (roughly the square root of 1% of the world's population) would be 
powerful enough to produce "coherence and harmony in the whole world 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
"Not too much time is needed," he indicated. "Only the group should live 
together (and hop and meditate together) on a permanent basis, because we want 
positivity to be permanently lively in world consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the guru's followers have gathered at global assemblies to 
meditate and hop together for days. The maharishi claims that world peace has 
improved as a result. He attributes the end of the Cold War between the United 
States and the Soviet Union to the actions of these joint hopping and 
meditating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's completely possible to change the (Persian Gulf) situation within a few 
weeks, but it must be done so that the situation continues to last," he said, 
adding that the problem is that conflicts will continue to erupt unless the 
hopping and meditating can continue permanently. "My only concern is that when 
the assembly is dispersed, when the light is switched off, the same darkness 
takes over." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, the maharishi proposes that a government or group of concerned 
individuals subsidize a group of at least 7,000 hoppers to continually create 
"irreversible peace on earth." 
</P>
<P>
As for the cost, TM officials have offered to provide training for a group of 
7,000 free of charge. They ask that, in exchange, the sponsor provide ongoing, 
basic living expenses for the group so its members can continue their practice 
indefinitely. Such aid, the maharishi estimated, would be "whatever a man needs 
to survive in any poor country, 7,000 times that." Though the guru's group has 
taken out full-page advertisements in newspapers worldwide to advise leaders of 
the peace plan (it plans more ads in upcoming weeks), no government or group 
has yet offered to support the meditator-hoppers. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, a spokeswoman was asked if President Bush's staff was aware 
of or had investigated the maharishi's proposal. "I've just been told we don't 
have anything on that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, some researchers have been attempting to scientifically test the 
maharishi's notions. 
</P>
<P>
John Davies, research coordinator for the University of Maryland's Center for 
International Development and Conflict Management, has studied the effects of 
meditators and hoppers throughout the 1980s. But it wasn't until 1988 that a 
study he conducted in 1983 (in conjunction with researchers at Harvard 
University and Maharishi International University) was published in The Journal 
of Conflict Resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The study observed the effects of about 250 individuals meditating and hopping 
for two months in the Arab quarter of Jerusalem. Researchers studied their 
effects on Israel and Lebanon. Lebanon, in particular, was selected, Davies 
said, "because it was the site of the most, consistent, deep-rooted violent 
conflict, which has been virtually nonstop for 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
During the time the meditating-hopping occurred, Davies and his co-researchers 
documented "a significant impact": an average 75% reduction in the daily number 
of deaths, or about 10 as opposed to 40 a day. 
</P>
<P>
An upcoming issue of the Journal of Conflict Resolution will contain a critique 
of Davies' research by Philip Schrodt, associate professor of political science 
at the University of Kansas. Schrodt's chief objection is that the dates on 
which the meditation-hopping experiment took place were not chosen at random 
and were not compared with randomly selected dates in which the 
meditation-hopping did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
"We know, statistically, that levels of violence, if they go down, they tend to 
stay down a while or if they go up, they stay up for a while," Schrodt said. 
"If I was a meditator, if I saw the violence going down, I'd go join the crowd 
because the trend to lower levels of violence would normally continue. You can 
control for that by creating a randomized experiment. If they can ever do that, 
I'm perfectly willing to look at their articles again." 
</P>
<P>
Davies, who is a hopper-meditator but does not consider himself a follower of 
the maharishi, responds that the experiment's dates were picked two months in 
advance and publicly announced. He also said that independent scientists were 
notified of the dates when initially announced to further ensure objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't predict things such as death rates two months in advance," he 
argued, noting that purely random selection of dates makes it difficult to 
amass a large group of meditator-hoppers since the dates may not occur at 
convenient times for them to get away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's enormously expensive. You have to fly people in," Davies said. He also 
thinks that groups should also not be disbanded according to randomly chosen 
dates. (Closing dates for the experiments were determined, in part, by the 
amount of funding available to subsidize participants' stays.) 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the ability to maintain a group and it's saving 30 out of 40 
deaths a day, you don't, for the sake of satisfying critics, sacrifice 30 lives 
per day to be extra safe on these (methodology) points," he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Davies revealed he is not surprised that some scientists still find 
the research hard to believe: "We're hitting up against the edges of the 
current thinking . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, does not deter the maharishi and his followers in the 
slightest. From Oct. 14 to 21, for example, about 3,000 true believers are 
expected to hop together in Fairfield, Iowa, the site of Maharishi 
International University. 
</P>
<P>
According to the guru, "any man with the slightest intelligence can see the 
logic" behind this approach to creating peace on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But if it's so simple to understand, why haven't governments or other concerned 
citizens responded to the maharishi's proposals yet? 
</P>
<P>
Replied the guru, with the laugh of a merry elf, "That is the mystery I've not 
yet been able to solve."

DIVERSITY CAPTURES A FOLLOWING; 
</P>
<P>
ALL-DAY FESTIVAL FEATURES STYLISTS RANGING FROM HARD ROCKERS TO FOLKIES TO 
RAPPERS.

Chalk up one small blow for diversity, if not for overriding musical 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "A Gathering of the Tribes," the all-day pop smorgasbord at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre on Sunday attracted 9,000 to 10,000 people, according to promoters 
-- not a bad draw for a 14-act bill that lacked even a single marquee name 
capable of headlining an amphitheater in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This gathering sprang from British rocker Ian Astbury's idea of creating a 
festival of contrasting stylists ranging from hard rockers to folkies to 
rappers. While at least 95% of the audience was white, listeners' enthusiastic 
embrace of the lineup's two rap acts, and their willingness to sample and enjoy 
the 10-hour day's full range of performers, showed that diversity has a 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Any worries about rap being rejected, or merely tolerated, disappeared the 
moment Queen Latifah burst onto the stage late in the afternoon with hammering 
beats and exuberant personality. She instantly ignited an audience that was 
ready to rock after having been served a diet of much milder stuff. On a day of 
performances that were mostly mixed and occasionally dreary, Latifah and 
Michelle Shocked claimed the two strongest showings. 
</P>
<P>
(A traditional hoop dance by a chanter and a dancer from the American Indian 
Dance Theatre was another highlight, combining athleticism, symbolism and the 
almost magical manipulations of an escape artist). 
</P>
<P>
Latifah's raps offered overworked boastful themes, but what she said mattered 
less than how she said it. The New Jersey rapper's 20-minute set communicated 
zest, humor and friendliness and a healthy measure of confidence and 
self-respect. Latifah summoned her pal, Sinead O'Connor, from the wings at one 
point. O'Connor said one word -- "hello" -- then retreated, ending the day's 
best chance for a surprise combination of talents. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup's other rapper, Ice-T, was all profane bluster and attitude. 
Sometimes he made sense -- notably in his between-songs attack on anti-rap 
censorship. Ice-T suggested that race, not morality, is the motive behind moves 
to suppress rap: "It's not the fear of you hearing a word I might say. It's the 
fear of you liking me, the fear of white kids liking black kids, and us getting 
along again." 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles rapper's determination to be uncompromising makes him a 
blind fool when it comes to the subject of sex. Noting that he has been 
criticized for sexism, Ice-T flaunted it by calling a blond, buxom, 
halter-topped fan on stage, then using her as exhibit A in a lesson that women 
are sex objects first and foremost. 
</P>
<P>
Ice-T was hardly the day's only performer to sing about raw lust. But some of 
the others presented a few of the emotions involved. Hard rockers Soundgarden, 
for instance, were able to offer some contrast between the rampant hormones of 
"Big Dumb Sex" and the deeper longing of "I Awake." Some sense that Ice-T 
appreciates women as people, as well as mounds of manipulable flesh, would be 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy might have supplied another rap vision on that subject, what with 
the new-found respect for women on its "Fear of a Black Planet" album. But the 
popular and controversial politicized rappers didn't appear as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking angrily to the crowd at separate junctures, Astbury, Latifah and Ice-T 
said Public Enemy was missing because of pressure from local authorities. But 
Rick Pickering, Costa Mesa's assistant city manager, said Monday that he was 
not aware of any efforts by the city to keep the band off the bill. "That's not 
an area that we would typically get involved in," Pickering said. Costa Mesa 
Police Chief David L. Snowden and representatives of the band could not be 
reached Monday for comment. Alex Hodges, in charge of concert booking for the 
Pacific, had no comment when asked backstage Sunday whether there had been 
pressure from the city to take Public Enemy off the program. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy had been scheduled to perform at an identical "Tribes" show held 
Saturday at the Shoreline Amphitheatre outside San Francisco but did not appear 
there, either. In that case, Astbury said in an interview, the group's key 
rappers, Chuck D and Flavor Flav, failed to make the show because they missed a 
flight. It had been announced on Friday that Public Enemy would perform at the 
Bay Area Tribes show, but not in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Advising the audience that too much "political rectitude" can cause 
hemorrhoids, Shocked -- who has been known to deliver a political broadside or 
two -- offered good-time rocking blues that often romped with humor and energy 
thanks to sharp backing from her allies for the day, the 10-man Tower of Power. 
</P>
<P>
But Shocked interrupted the fun for "Cold Comfort," a stark folk song about 
dealing with grief. She said she wrote it for the Tower of Power drummer, whose 
mother was killed recently by a drunk driver. After that, bringing Tower of 
Power back for a closing "What Is Hip" was awfully abrupt, but there was no 
room for deft pacing in a 30-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
The Indigo Girls could take some hints from Shocked about the advantages of not 
being too solemn. The acoustic folk duo from Georgia mounted some lovely 
harmonies (there was a nice, rowsing version of the Youngbloods' "Get 
Together") but these women remain earnest to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
There was a reminder during Indigo Girls set that a gathering of diverse tribes 
creates lots of chances for misunderstanding: While the folkies were singing, 
Ice-T conducted a grand entrance, promenading along the aisle parallel to the 
stage and greeting fans before settling into a seat, where he attracted more 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't sit well with Indigo Girl Amy Ray. "The purpose to be here is . . . 
not to cause a scene. Everybody's given (his or her) time," she told the crowd, 
with justified annoyance. Interviewed at his seat, Ice-T said he meant no 
disrespect. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ice-T's stroll through the crowd was fun, and the diversion from the 
Indigo Girls was no great loss. Still, he should have saved it for a break 
between acts. 
</P>
<P>
The day's least-known performers, Canadian folk-rockers Crash Vegas and British 
'60s revivalists Charlatans U.K., emerged as promising newcomers who both 
deserve fuller hearings in more intimate surroundings. Crash Vegas' intense 
waif of a singer, Michelle McAdorey, is an intriguing figure, and the band's 
instrumental trio was adept at gradually building a song's intensity. The 
Charlatans' dominant Hammond organ sound conjured shades of early, pre-metal 
Deep Purple and "Revolver"-era Beatles among other '60s sources. Not exactly 
original, but it made for some nice, enveloping waves of sound. 
</P>
<P>
The other rookie rock band on the bill, London Quireboys, regurgitated old Rod 
Stewart and Faces stuff. They came up with spirited guitar cranking and piano 
banging on "7 O'Clock" but showed none of the warmth, humor or bonhomie of 
vintage Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The Cramps played longer -- and worse -- than any other band on the bill. The 
Los Angeles group's mix of rockabilly, '60s garage rock and campy 
sex-and-horror shtick would have been more palatable if it had been executed 
briskly. Instead, the Cramps' sound was a jumbled mess of ugly fuzz bass, 
inaudible guitar and hoarse vocals from scrawny Lux Interior. Lux is one of the 
last people on earth you'd want to see cavorting with nearly nothing on -- but 
of course he did, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Soundgarden's sludgy hard rock lacked a sharp honed edge, but the Seattle band 
did pack a rumbling wallop. Singer Chris Cornell's emotional howls on "Hands 
All Over" and "I Awake" lifted those numbers out of the instrumental murk. 
</P>
<P>
Mission U.K.'s barefoot singer, Wayne Hussey, was an extremely energetic 
panderer but still a panderer. His leaps into the audience and gambols about 
the stage were attention-getters, but the band's pompous music was at odds with 
his fun-loving persona. By the way, those were canned rhythm and keyboard 
tracks on the two songs that Hussey pronounced "the best you'll hear all day." 
</P>
<P>
Former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones makes a decent hard rock sidekick, but 
his singing was too weak to make him much of a band leader. Things improved 
when Astbury took over the vocals for the last three songs, and his partner in 
the Cult, Billy Duffy, arrived to add some guitar riffing. It was monolithic 
stuff, though, and not nearly enough to fire up a crowd that was clearly tiring 
near the end of a long day. 
</P>
<P>
Iggy Pop finished with a set that was awfully restrained, considering his 
well-earned position as one of rock's most combustive live performers. A 
mediocre band with a guitarist given to metal-style noodling didn't help. But 
Pop's material was mostly first rate, especially since he drew heavily on the 
repertoire of his original band, the Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
Pop was the only performer in the lineup who began recording in the 1960s (only 
Jones and the Cramps got their start in the '70s). No misty Woodstock 
sentimentality for Iggy, though. Singing the Stooges' song "1969," he 
remembered it as a time of alienation: "Another year for me and you, another 
year with nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
If Astbury is really serious about diversity, the next time the Cult -- an 
established arena headliner -- goes on tour, he'll insist on a Queen Latifah, a 
Michelle Shocked or a Charlatans U.K. as an opening act, instead of the usual 
"compatible" opener. That could mean some financial sacrifice, because 
"compatible" acts tend to increase the draw. 
</P>
<P>
But if that happens (and don't bet on it, because it would mean going against 
the principle of profit maximization), it will be interesting to see whether 
audiences not primed in advance for diversity are as receptive as the crowd 
that came to the Pacific on Sunday, open to anything.

LOUISE REICHLIN'S NEW TRIPTYCH FULL OF OLD-STYLE CHOREOGRAPHY

<P>
The difference between timeless and dated choreography is very subtle. The work 
of Los Angeles Choreographers &amp; Dancers too often veers into the latter 
state. There is no such thing as lock-step progress in the evolution of 
contemporary dance, but sitting in front of this company at the Newport Harbor 
Art Museum, one gets the feeling that the last 25 years have passed it by. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Reichlin directs a racially diverse ensemble of nine women and one man, 
some of whom are strong performers. "Urban and Tribal Dances," her new 
triptych, is another reworking of 1960s modern-dance conventions. It appears to 
contrast up-tight cultures, represented by women in large straw hats, with the 
less restrained movements of beribboned girls. 
</P>
<P>
In its second part, an umbrella tent with blinking green lights crawls 
tortoise-like onto the stage. After surveying the gallery space with a 
periscope, a woman wearing a black net body stocking and mismatched shoes 
emerges, still connected to the tent by a thick cord. Whether the choreographer 
here intends humor or a darker emotion is hard to discern. 
</P>
<P>
The third section, a sextet, blends dance cliches from many contemporary 
techniques. The blank stares of the performers are accentuated by whiteface 
makeup decorated with abstract motifs. 
</P>
<P>
Reichlin's 1987 work, "Grounding," and excerpts from "The Tennis Dances," which 
was made in 1979, complete her part of the program. All of Reichlin's dances 
here ignore the momentous developments in dance in recent decades; the oldest 
of them, "Tennis Dances," is actually the strongest structurally. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the Sunday afternoon program with Reichlin was Alfred Desio, whose 
Zapped Taps concept got national exposure in the 1989 film "Tap." Desio is a 
showman, eager to please with both his rhythmic tap execution and his 
technological innovation. His portion of the program became a 
lecture-demonstration in which the computer-assisted performance was explicated 
for an audience heavy with wide-eyed children. 
</P>
<P>
Wires on Desio's taps send signals to a bank of blinking machines at one side 
of the gallery space; each step triggers a pre-programmed sound. Unfortunately, 
we're so accustomed to complex electronics in concert that his performance 
seems little different from a simple tap dance to a recorded score, and his 
careful explanation only dilutes the sense of wonder he is attempting to 
create.

Judy Collins' concert here tonight not only represents one of the first steps 
in her return to major label status (see accompanying story), but also the very 
first step into pop music presentation for the new Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The 756-seat hall on the UC Irvine campus will be devoted primarily to theater, 
dance and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas Rankin, president of the Irvine Barclay, said that unlike the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, this will be a place for pop, folk and 
folk-rock as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we're not a pop venue, but I'll be experimenting a bit, to see what 
works," he said. With Collins, who happens to be one of Rankin's personal

So far, Rankin said, the only other performer with a pop background booked into 
the Irvine Barclay is Corky Siegel, a singer, pianist and harmonica player who 
in the '60s was co-leader of the Siegel-Schwall Band, a Chicago blues ensemble. 
Siegel will be backed by a string quartet in his concert on Jan. 16, 1991.IKE

The trial of Gen. Iulian Vlad, former chief of the hated Securitate secret 
police force that kept dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in power and the Romanian 
people in terror, resumes next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vlad is accused of complicity in genocide for his role in the bloody repression 
of anti-government riots last December. He testified in court last month that 
the Securitate was "a necessary evil" and justified the brutal crackdown on 
demonstrators in the city of Timisoara with charges that foreign instigators 
were behind the unrest.

Ceausescu's son and brother have already been convicted on genocide charges, 
which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

AN EMIGRATION LOGJAM IS KEEPING 12,500 REFUGEES IN ADDIS ABABA. THE MOVEMENT OF 
THESE PEOPLE TO ISRAEL HAS BECOME A TOUCHY ISSUE FOR BOTH COUNTRIES.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The villagers where Abebe Yalu lived had long since forced him into a life of 
sharecropping by burning his farm. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of hostility in town had never abated. So when word began to 
circulate that those who could make their way to Addis Ababa might be able to 
emigrate to Israel, he packed up his family, spent $75 on bus passage to the 
capital, 400 miles south, and departed to the taunts of the local people who 
coveted his meager possessions and who celebrated the family's departure with 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
That was three months ago, and today Yalu and his family (his name is a 
pseudonym) are among 12,500 Ethiopian Jews living in limbo in the capital, 
waiting for a logjam of emigration to break. The delivery of these people to 
Israel has become one of the most explosive issues in both countries since 
Israel and Ethiopia reestablished diplomatic relations in November. 
</P>
<P>
The affair has embroiled the United States too, in part because of the immense 
interest among influential American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last month in New York, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
reaffirmed to Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tesfaye Dinka "our strong support for 
free emigration and family reunification" -- diplomatic code phrases for Jewish 
emigration from Ethiopia -- and said the United States hoped that the rate of 
emigration to Israel, which has recently slowed to a trickle, would increase. 
</P>
<P>
American interests are also involved because stories have been circulating in 
this rumor-prone capital for months that the Israelis have promised Ethiopia 
arms in return for the guarantees of continued emigration so far extracted from 
the Ethiopian government. U.S. officials have continually warned the Israelis 
that to pass on any materiel of U.S. origin to the Marxist government would 
violate American laws. 
</P>
<P>
So far, according to diplomatic and other sources here, there is no hard 
evidence that Israel has provided even token military assistance to the 
tottering government of Mengistu Haile Mariam. But stories persist that Israel 
has provided arms ranging from bolt-action rifles and Uzi submachine guns to 
cluster bombs. There may also be 30 and 100 Israeli military advisers in the 
country, said one Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, it is clear that Mengistu's most pressing need is for military 
aid to replace what is being withdrawn by the Soviet Union, Ethiopia's main 
supplier for about 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Israel denies that it has given any military aid to Ethiopia or that there is 
anything like an arms-for-Jews deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard this, that we're going to replace the Russians (as suppliers)," 
said Haim Divon, charge d'affaires at the Israeli Embassy in Addis Ababa. "But 
even if we wanted to, we don't have the capacity to do so. The immigration of 
the Falashas is not linked to anything else." 
</P>
<P>
To most Ethiopians and much of the world, the black Jews are known as Falashas. 
But they reject that name, since the word is usually translated as "stranger" 
or "outsider," a label that reflects their low station in Ethiopia. Most prefer 
to call themselves "Beta-Israel," or "House of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere around a secluded compound at the center of the informal 
Ethiopian Jewish settlement in Addis Ababa leaves no doubt that the emigration 
operation is one of the most sensitive programs in Ethiopia today. 
</P>
<P>
A high wall hides what is the unofficial emigration headquarters from view, and 
its solid metal gate is heavily guarded. Cars from the Israeli Embassy silently 
pull up throughout the day to discharge official passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the wall, hundreds of people dressed in the same flowing shawls in 
which they made their way from remote villages stand silently. Within the 
compound two wide green tents shelter Jews undergoing processing. An air of 
open suspicion and hostility greets any outsider who manages to get inside. 
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, even as Ethiopian leaders were giving the State Department 
assurances of continued cooperation, officials here stepped up their harassment 
of people involved in the emigration project. 
</P>
<P>
At least two Americans working with the Israeli Embassy to facilitate the 
emigration, including Susan Pollack, an activist on behalf of Ethiopian Jews 
who has been in and out of this country for six years, were questioned about 
their activities by security officers. 
</P>
<P>
The officers ordered the Americans to move out of their rented private quarters 
and back into hotels. The rationale was that as holders of tourist visas, they 
are not permitted to lodge in private homes, but it is clear that the 
government intended to better monitor their activities. 
</P>
<P>
People working with the Ethiopian Jews are also concerned that some earlier 
emigrants who returned to Addis Ababa over the past few weeks to help those 
left behind will lose their tourist visas, forcing them to return to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, the emigration was sharply curtailed by Ethiopian 
authorities. The peak flow of 500 Jews a month out of Ethiopia between March 
and June all but ceased in July, and there has been little increase since then. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources and others agree that one reason for the slowdown was the 
opening in July of the annual Organization of African Unity summit meeting 
here, when the Ethiopians feared that incoming Arab delegates would see 
Ethiopian Jews lined up to depart for Israel from Addis Ababa airport. 
</P>
<P>
Sources here who ask to remain unidentified say the flow remains restricted not 
by any overt rejection of candidates by the Ethiopian authorities, but by 
myriad bureaucratic obstacles. To the extent that the bureaucratic delay is 
indistinguishable from the general pace of government action in Ethiopia, this 
makes it hard to confirm that a deliberate slowdown is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Israeli officials in Addis Ababa firmly deny that any major 
problems exist, beyond processing thousands of people and confirming their 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of a gap in emigration was designed to complete the story of 
'weapons for Falashas,' " says Divon. The slowdown in departures is "just a 
question of paperwork. No one takes into consideration that last year there 
were 2,000 Jews in Addis, and now there are 13,000." (Another 500 to 1,000 Jews 
are thought to still be in the countryside of Gondar province.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are signs of a deep division over the Jewish issue within the 
Ethiopian government. Foreign Minister Dinka is considered a soft-liner in 
favor of letting the Jews leave. But his position is thought to be opposed by 
Kassa Kabede, President Mengistu's influential brother. As factions shift, the 
current willingness of authorities to allow the emigration could change 
abruptly, they fear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of who has the president's ear," says one person working on 
the issue. "I don't think this government has a unitary position, so the winds 
could always change." 
</P>
<P>
One element is the government's sensitivity about giving a despised minority a 
right that millions of Ethiopians may crave: the chance to escape a land where 
the most evenly distributed thing is penury. Under Mengistu, Ethiopia has 
become the world's poorest country; the Jews here are among the very few 
Ethiopians with a place to escape to. 
</P>
<P>
That issue has already been dramatized by the arrival in the captial of 
thousands of people from a region known as the Foggera, where decades ago many 
Jews converted to Christianity to escape persecution. Unlike the Marranos of 
Spain, who converted to Catholicism during the Inquisition but continued to 
practice Judaism in secret, the Foggerese abandoned Jewish observance. 
</P>
<P>
Now their claim to the right of Israeli citizenship under the so-called Law of 
Return, which welcomes Jewish immigrants to Israel, presents a dilemma for both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Ethiopian standpoint, people are only allowed to leave once they've 
demonstrated they have relatives in Israel," says William Recant, director of 
the Washington-based American Assn. for Ethiopian Jews. "Under that system, the 
Foggerese are not able to leave." 
</P>
<P>
But the Law of Return grants citizenship to those whose parents or grandparents 
were Jews, and who have not themselves converted to another religion. So from 
the Israeli standpoint, many Foggerese may be entitled to the right. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a delicate issue because we don't want Ethiopians who don't have any 
contact whatsoever with Judaism to use this as a mechanism to leave the 
country," says Divon, the Israeli charge d'affaires. 
</P>
<P>
The people at the center of this great emigration saga were once among the 
powerful communities of ancient Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th Century a Jewish warrior queen, Yehudit, laid waste to the ancient 
Ethiopian capital of Axum. Even today Ethiopian schoolchildren are taught to 
abominate her name, and they sometimes taunt Jewish children with cries of 
"Yehudit Budit!" or "Yehudit the Terrible." 
</P>
<P>
When her kingdom was smashed, the Jews of Ethiopia went into a long decline, 
impoverished by a prohibition against their owning land and subjected to 
periodic violence. Their numbers dwindled to a little over 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years a few Jews made their way to Israel for schooling. The 
international Jewish relief organization ORT set up a school in Gondar 
province, where they lived, and conducted a census of 15,000 Jewish families 
that is today used to help verify the identities of the people camping on the 
hillside here in the capital. In 1985 about 12,000 were quietly spirited to 
Israel from refugee camps in Sudan during the project called Operation Moses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its current profession of determination on the issue, the Israeli 
government's interest in the Ethiopian Jews has waxed and waned over the years. 
In the period of closest Israel-Ethiopian ties, when the Labor government of 
Golda Meir was in power in Jerusalem and Emperor Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia, 
Meir never questioned Selassie's resolve to convert his country's Jews to 
Christianity or his adamant refusal to let them leave. Even to raise the issue 
with the emperor risked a diplomatic rupture. 
</P>
<P>
There was even a debate within Israel as to whether the Ethiopians in question 
were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Some have charged that racism was responsible for the Jewish state's skeptical 
reception of the Ethiopians' Jewishness. Similarly isolated communities of 
Yemenite and Indian Jews were accepted as immigrants much more happily than 
were the Ethiopians. They were compared unfavorably in public with other 
immigrants. If the concentration-camp survivors among the first Israelis were 
highly educated and worldly, the Ethiopians were illiterate and naive -- not 
likely to adjust well to life in a modern state, it was said. 
</P>
<P>
Some in Israel counter that there were legitimate doubts about the Ethiopian 
Jews on two points: whether they were genuine descendants of the "House of 
Israel," and whether their beliefs actually qualified them as Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The first point was legally resolved in 1975 when the government accepted a 
rabbinical judgment that the Beta-Israel were descended from the Tribe of Dan 
-- one of the Ten Tribes of Israel enslaved by Abysinnia in the year 722 BC and 
extinguished from history. To this day, that judgment is heatedly disputed 
among Judaic scholars, some of whom believe that the Jews of Ethiopia were 
originally ancient converts or are descendants of small migrant communities of 
Jews. But it did serve to get the Ethiopians recognized under the Law of 
Return. 
</P>
<P>
The second point is a philosophical and historical one. 
</P>
<P>
The first adventurers who came upon the Beta-Israel in the 19th Century found 
religious and cultural characteristics that seemed to have been preserved 
almost unchanged from antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
The Beta-Israel were ignorant of the vast body of Talmudic law that has 
governed Jewish rites and social behavior since the 4th Century. This suggested 
that their separation predated that period. Instead of rabbis, the Talmudic-era 
class of leaders, they follow priests, as did the earliest Jews. For a time 
they also adopted a monastic tradition foreign to the rest of Judaism. (This 
has only recently been abandoned.) 
</P>
<P>
They spoke no Hebrew, conducting their rituals in the ancient Ethiopian dialect 
of Ge'ez. While for most Jews the year revolves around the High Holidays of 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the Beta-Israel revere above all others an 
unusual November holiday called Seged, when they fast to mark the Jews' release 
from bondage in Babylon. They also find special meaning in Passover, the 
celebration of the deliverance from Egypt, with its alluring promise of an 
eventual return to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they do follow many biblically inspired practices 
recognizable to modern Jewry, not least of which are the circumcision of males 
and kosher dietary rules. 
</P>
<P>
Today, despite official Israeli protestations that rescuing the Jews of 
Ethiopia is the principal issue in its relations with Addis Ababa, it is clear 
that much more is at stake in the revived Israeli presence in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats here flatly deny that their government has any agenda in 
Ethiopia other than a willingness to help the country with development aid. 
</P>
<P>
But Ethiopia commands a large reach of the Red Sea shoreline; that swath is 
entirely at risk in the rebellion waged in the north by the Eritrean Peoples 
Liberation Front. If the Arab-backed Eritrean rebels were to succeed in 
splitting their province off from Ethiopia, the country would lose all of its 
shoreline and the Red Sea coast would be almost entirely in Arab or Arab-backed 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
An Eritrea hostile to Israel would be in a position to block overflight routes 
for El Al, the Israeli airline, to its only two African destinations, Nairobi 
and Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening of diplomatic relations with Ethiopia has also been a linchpin in 
Israel's effort to reopen embassies in the rest of black Africa, most of whose 
countries severed relations at the time of the Yom Kippur War in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons Israel may be treading carefully in its discussions with 
the Mengistu regime over stepping up emigration. Divon of the Israeli Embassy 
says he expects all the Jews to be out of Ethiopia in another year, suggesting 
he expects the rate to rise to about 1,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the would-be emigrants are wending their way through a maze of 
bureaucratic rules. The procedure requires Ethiopian Jews living in Israel to 
send formal requests, in legal boilerplate, that Ethiopia allow their relatives 
to emigrate with their families. To establish family connections, the requests 
are checked against the old census conducted by the ORT relief organization. At 
the same time, the government insists that the requests make a perfect match 
with the personal histories, or meshenyas, carried around by the Ethiopian 
families on worn sheets of lined paper. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Israeli and Ethiopian branches of some families have been separated 
for years, names and ages may be mismatched, children left out, meshenyas lost 
or forgotten. The discrepancies have to be formally corrected and certified by 
the Israeli consul in Addis Ababa and all the documents resubmitted to the 
government by the aspiring emigrants. The whole procedure can take months while 
the families inhabit hired homes and backyard tents in the capital, collecting 
at the Israeli Embassy to receive blankets, provisions and stipends. 
</P>
<P>
The stupefying procedure gives people like Abebe Yalu, the sharecropper, some 
time to reflect on what he knows of his community's history. 
</P>
<P>
"From my parents, and the old men, I learned that we had come from Jerusalem," 
he said, "and that maybe someday we would go back."

ACID-WASH PATENT HOLDERS TARGETING DEEP POCKETS OF JEANS MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acid-wash jeans are being put to a litmus test. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome could decide a burning issue in the denim business: Can anyone 
freely make acid-wash jeans? Or do jeans makers need to pay hundreds of 
millions in fees for the right to corrode pants and jackets? 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which involves past and future patent royalties, comes at a time 
when the popularity of acid-wash denims is, well, fading somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a wash we even carry anymore," said Nancy Rosen, a buyer for 
fashion-forward Judy's Inc., a women's apparel chain based in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
But, Rosen added, two or three years ago "when it was hot, it was incredibly 
hot. Everybody had to have acid-wash." 
</P>
<P>
And acid-wash clothes still are a very big seller at many less fashionable 
retail chains, continuing to account for an estimated 35% of U.S sales of denim 
pants this year. 
</P>
<P>
Acid-washing fades denims in a variety of ways. On dark blue denim, it can add 
white splotches. On black denim, it provides a white "topping." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, among different manufacturers, variations of the process have an 
array of names: blizzard wash, ice wash, powder wash and white lightening. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms trying to enforce acid-wash patent rights say they are entitled 
to royalties from such U.S. jeans giants as San Francisco's Levi Strauss &amp; 
Co. and the East Coast firms that make Lee, Wrangler, Jordache and Gitano 
jeans. They claim that Levi Strauss alone owes $100 million in back royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Waging the fight against the jeans makers are Golden Trade S.R.L. of Italy and 
its U.S. licensee, Greater Texas Finishing Co., an industrial laundry in El 
Paso, Texas. Golden Trade won a U.S. patent for acid-wash in 1988 and sold the 
exclusive U.S. rights to Greater Texas Finishing four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Greater Texas Finishing notified jeans makers that they were 
violating patent rights and would need to pay up. 
</P>
<P>
That drew some caustic comments from the jeans industry. Jordache Enterprises 
Chairman Joe Nakash scored Miles Rubin and Eric Rothfeld, the Stanford Law 
School-educated businessmen who own Greater Texas Finishing, for seeking 
"exorbitant" payments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair for American retailers and consumers to pay higher prices so that 
a couple of lawyers could make a killing on their purchases of the patent 
rights," Nakash said in a recent news release. 
</P>
<P>
Rothfeld replied that he has nothing to apologize for. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in an industry of opportunism and opportunity," Rothfeld said. 
"Businesses aren't in it for philanthropic purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Rothfeld added that he found it "peculiar" that a firm such as Jordache, which 
vigorously protects its own trademarks, would "fail to acknowledge and 
recognize someone else's property rights." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rothfeld said it was concern that Greater Texas Finishing might be 
infringing on Golden Trade's rights that prompted the El Paso firm to acquire 
licensing rights for acid wash in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle is shaping up largely as an argument over whether acid-washing 
meets the standards for a patent under U.S. law. Levi Strauss and Jordache 
haved filed suits in federal courts in Louisiana and Washington, D.C., to try 
to invalidate the existing patent, on the grounds that Golden Trade's process 
was neither original nor a genuine advance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an industry process that was available to any company before the patent 
was applied for," argued Robert A. Spiegelman, a Jordache lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The process is roughly akin to the way many college students beat up their 
jeans using pumice stones and bleach. Still, Rothfeld describes acid washing as 
the work of a "genius inventor" and says that the patent covers the use of 
other types of stones and oxidizing agents, too. 
</P>

<P>
SALES OF JEANS 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 400 million pairs of denim pants are expected to be sold in the 
United States in 1990, with market shares divided as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Acid wash: 35% 
</P>
<P>
Stone wash: 30% 
</P>
<P>
Pre-washed: 15% 
</P>
<P>
Untreated blue jeans: 15% 
</P>
<P>

Consumer confidence among Orange County residents fell sharply in the past year 
as worries increased about the nation's faltering economy, the burgeoning 
federal deficit and the threat of war in the Middle East, according to a UC 
Irvine annual survey. 
</P>
<P>
The local consumer confidence index fell 20 points from a year ago, the largest 
drop since UCI began measuring attitudes on the economy in 1986. The increased 
pessimism in Orange County mirrors a growing uneasiness about the economy 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a dramatic loss of confidence," said Mark Baldassare, UCI 
professor of social ecology, who conducted the Orange County Annual Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Orange County consumers are more optimistic than those elsewhere in the 
country, many of whom have already felt the effects of regional recessions. A 
declining majority of local consumers also say they are better off financially 
today than a year ago and that they expect to be so in another year. 
</P>
<P>
The views of local consumers, however, may reflect an ingrained belief in 
continued growth for the county and in its resilience to recession, Baldassare 
said. Many surveyed were pessimistic about the nation's economy but upbeat 
about their personal financial outlook, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's largely a loss of confidence in the big picture," Baldassare said. "They 
still feel confident about their own finances." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, however, the consumer confidence index in Orange County has 
dropped below the 100 base level. It fell to 85 from 105 last year, the biggest 
drop in consumer confidence in the five years that the survey has measured that 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, consumer confidence also fell 20 points, from 96 to 76. The 
national and the local indices -- based on five questions about outlook, 
spending and personal finances -- are measured against a base level of 100 
established in the national survey in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare sees two possible outcomes in the local survey results: less 
spending and more saving. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of spending over the next few months could affect retail sales in 
general as well as the key Christmas period, he said. Local consumers are 
"fearful enough about national trends that they're much more likely this year 
to cut back on major purchases and other spending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, more local consumers report that they are earning more money 
than they did last year, Baldassare said, and that extra income could well go 
into savings accounts at local banks and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 49% of the 1,016 adults randomly questioned by telephone 
last month were earning annual salaries of $50,000 or more. The median income 
of those being polled rose $4,000 over last year to its highest level, $49,000. 
</P>
<P>
The survey detected a number of significant changes in consumer attitudes: 
</P>
<P>
* Fewer Orange County people than ever before -- 40% of those polled -- believe 
the nation is headed for good times in the next year, the first time that 
figure has dropped below 50%. Last year, 68% of those polled were optimistic 
about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
* More local consumers than ever before -- 55% -- believe the nation is headed 
for tougher economic times, with a recession and higher unemployment, in the 
next five years. Only 30% are bullish on the long-term outlook for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only time since we've been asking questions about the economy that 
a majority of Orange County residents expects a five-year downturn in the 
national economy," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
* Retail sales could fall sharply. Thirty-one percent of consumers surveyed 
think that now is a bad time to make a major purchase. That is more than double 
the proportion -- 14% -- who felt that way last year, which recorded the 
largest previous negative rating. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like residents may be cutting back on their spending in the coming 
year," Baldassare said. That would confirm reports of slumping retail sales 
both nationally and in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
* Although 20% of those surveyed believe they are financially worse off than a 
year ago -- the highest level ever for the survey -- only 8% believe they will 
be worse off next year. Nearly half say they are better off today than a year 
ago, and more than half say they expect to be so in another year. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence could change significantly with major events. Baldassare 
said that if Congress adopts a budget that does not put too much of a crimp in 
consumer spending and if the world powers can resolve the Iraq-Kuwait situation 
peacefully, optimism could return quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The questions on consumer confidence -- the same ones the University of 
Michigan asks in its national poll -- are part of UCI's 9-year-old program of 
surveying the county's economic well-being. The margin of error is a plus or 
minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The local survey is supported by donations from 35 Orange County corporations, 
public agencies and foundations. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE 
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index in Orange County fell 20 points in the last year, 
as residents became concerned about economic trends, the federal deficit and 
Middle East crisis. But consumers here were more optimistic than those 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
The national survey, based on five questions about outlook, spending and 
personal finances, is conducted by the University of Michigan. Orange County 
residents were asked the same questions. The index is measured on a base of 100 
established in 1966.

A survey of 1,016 Orange County consumers shows that they think tough economic 
times have arrived and that this is not a good period to make big-ticket 
purchases. Still, most local consumers feel that they are better off

Orange County's Donald is poorer, but the Donald appears headed for the 
poorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren, the Newport Beach real estate developer, joined many of the 
nation's wealthiest last year in seeing a portion of his fortune slip away. 
According to Forbes magazine, Bren's net worth now is estimated at $1.6 billion 
-- $250 million less than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But that's nothing compared to the record of Donald Trump, the flashy real 
estate mogul and deal maker. Trump last year had a net worth $1.7 billion; this 
year he has less than $260 million -- probably much less. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, whose name had become synonymous with the high-flying, money-mad 1980s, 
earlier this year hit a cash crunch and had difficulty meeting debt payments. 
Now, Forbes says, Trump's fortune is within "hailing distance of zero." 
</P>
<P>
But the two Donalds were not the only ones with financial problems over the 
past year. Many of the nation's richest saw their fortunes decline as the 
nation nursed a hangover from its decade-long financial binge. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1990, the rich have been getting poorer," the Oct. 22 issue of Forbes 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's neighbor on Atlantic City's casino row, Merv Griffin, disappeared from 
Forbes' annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans as his Resorts 
International went bankrupt. Other notable losers include media moguls Rupert 
Murdoch and Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken, the junk-bond king turned convicted felon, remained on the 
list, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $700 million. Milken weathered 
the payment of a record $600-million fine earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the entire Forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and, on balance, 
started going down," the magazine states. 
</P>
<P>
The publication blamed much of the slide on the slumping stock market and 
drooping real estate prices. Fifty-three moguls on the list saw their incomes 
drop between $100 million and $880 million. The minimum net worth required was 
$15 million less than last year's $275 million. 
</P>
<P>
The richest person in the nation, according to Forbes, continues to be 
Metromedia founder John Kluge. A rags-to-riches German, he has made an 
estimated $400 million over the year, adding to a fortune now estimated at $5.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bren, three other Orange County residents made the list. William Lyon 
($350 million), Richard J. O'Neill ($300 million) and George L. Argyros ($290 
million), all of whom made their fortunes in real estate, made their usual 
appearances on the list without any significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., plummeted to 35th place on the list, down 
from 19th place last year, when Forbes put his fortune at $1.85 billion. The 
magazine does not allude to a specific cause for Bren's slide in its annual 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount of Bren's loss roughly approximates the award that a court 
recently ordered the Irvine Co., which is controlled by Bren, to pay Joan 
Irvine Smith for her 11% stake in the company. The court ordered the company to 
pay her $149 million plus interest, an amount expected to total about $250 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes also notes that the Irvine Co.'s development is being constrained by 
"strong environmental forces." Last week, the company compromised on a proposed 
2,000-acre development near Laguna Beach after environmentalists complained. 
</P>
<P>
Bren is described by Forbes as a 58-year-old, twice-divorced, one-time 
"Hollywood rich kid." He borrowed $10,000 to finance the construction of his 
first house. His home-building business took off, and he eventually bought the 
Irvine Ranch with four other investors in 1977. He subsequently bought off the 
others and was left with $1 billion worth of Orange County's most picturesque 
and desired property. 
</P>
<P>
A Bren spokeswoman said that the billionaire has a policy of never commenting 
on his rank on the Forbes list since he has never been consulted and is 
unfamiliar with the magazine's methodology. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the payment for her Irvine Co. stock alone would be almost enough 
to boost Smith, the granddaughter of the Irvine Ranch's founder, onto the 
Forbes list, she was left off. She was on the list several years ago before the 
criteria to be included skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
While Smith was conspicuous by her absence, Forbes lists Freedom Newspapers 
publisher Harry Howard Hoiles as still residing in Santa Ana. Hoiles, worth an 
estimated $375 million, now resides in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The list also includes some notables who have extensive ties to Orange County 
even though they don't live here. Gene Autry, best known locally as the owner 
of the California Angels, is listed at $300 million. Autry made his fortune 
buying and selling radio and television stations and listed by Forbes as living 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a smattering of Disney family members: Walt Disney's widow, 
Lillian, has an estimated $315 million; Roy E. Disney has $575 million; and 
Sharon Disney Lund has $275 million.

ORANGE COUNTY'S RICH 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County residents made the list of the nation's wealthiest 
individuals, according to the annual compilation by Forbes magazine. All four 
were also on last year's list. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $1.6 billion 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 35 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 19 
</P>
<P>
Summary: A slump in the real estate market, increasing political pressure 
against new development on Irvine Ranch-owned land and the court award likely 
to amount to more than $250 million to heiress Joan Irvine Smith all appeared 
to have contributed to Bren's fall in his ranking on the Forbes list. Still, 
the magazine notes, Bren owns one-sixth of Orange County and has presided over 
the building of some of the poshest estates, condominiums and office towers in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
William Lyon 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Coto de Caza 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $350 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 288 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 283 
</P>
<P>
Summary: Lyon, a retired Air Force general, made his fortune building low-cost 
homes for first-time buyers. He has dabbled in other business ventures as well, 
such as buying financially ailing AirCal in 1981 and selling it at a profit in 
1986. It was merged into American Airlines. Lyon, an avid car collector, is 
active in Orange County social circles and remains a major home builder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard J. O'Neill 
</P>
<P>
Residence: San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $300 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 350 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 354 
</P>
<P>
Summary: O'Neill shares a hefty inheritance with his sister, Alice O'Neill 
Avery of Los Angeles. He parlayed that into millions more through Southern 
California real estate development. He co-developed the massive Mission Viejo 
tract in the 1960s with Donald Bren and is currently building the 5,000-acre 
Rancho Santa Margarita planned community in South County. O'Neill has ranches 
in Mexico, California and Nevada. He is active in Democratic politics, and 
Forbes says he is known for his "disheveled appearance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
George Leon Argyros 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $290 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 370 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 386 
</P>
<P>
Summary: Argyros built a real estate empire after deciding it was a way to 
wealth. "If you work hard, it's one of the frontiers that are left," Forbes 
reports. He bought and sold baseball's Seattle Mariners, netting $50 million 
despite the team's losing record. He owns 5,200 apartment units.

ORANGE COUNTY FIRE OFFICIALS URGE CAUTION TO AVOID FLARE-UPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A hot Santa Ana condition that has caused desert-like winds to blow throughout 
most of Orange County this morning prompted fire officials worried about more 
flare-ups in the county's bone-dry hills to place firefighters on alert and 
urge residents to take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of two small brush fires in Yorba Linda that burned seven acres 
Monday, Orange County fire officials said they have put two strike teams on 
active duty, one in the Santiago Canyon area near Villa Park and one in Rancho 
Santa Margarita in South County. 
</P>
<P>
"They (firefighters) are loaded up, suited and ready to go," Orange County Fire 
Department Capt. Dan Young said. "They will be on the road within seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures reached as high as 95 degrees this morning, and winds blowing 
through the Santiago Canyon were clocked at 20 m.p.h., fire spokeswoman Maria 
Sabol said. With humidity at 15%, the department will put its stations on red 
flag alert, the highest alert status, if the wind speed increases by 5 m.p.h., 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol warned, however, that residents should take extra precautions, especially 
on the heels of a four-year drought that has reduced vegetation on the rolling 
hills of the county's rural areas to a tinder-like condition. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that fire trucks are out patrolling the county's trouble spots, not 
only looking for signs of smoke, but acting as psychological deterrents to 
people who may carelessly spark a blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"Our engines are out there in high profile," Young said. "They're monitoring 
and looking for problems. Just looking at a fire engine makes people think 
about fire prevention."

LENNON FANS 'IMAGINE' HIM ON 50TH BIRTHDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered today as his song 
"Imagine" was played simultaneously by radio stations for 1 billion people in 
130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Happy birthday, John. The world is better today for sharing a time with you," 
his widow, Yoko Ono, said at a U.N. ceremony before the playing of "Imagine." 
</P>
<P>
The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message 
that served as an introduction to the music. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. . . . Think of your children. 
Do you want them to be killed or don't you? And that's the choice we have in 
front of us. War or peace," said Lennon, whose son, Sean, turned 15 today. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, about 50 people -- some holding candles and others carrying 
birthday balloons -- stood near Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame on Vine 
Street near the Capitol Records Building and listened to the "Imagine" 
broadcast at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Peacenik Jerry Rubin planned to join other activists later in the day for a 
1960s-style "Give Peace and Our Environment a Chance" celebration at the trendy 
Spice nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard.

BUSH MAY TAX THE RICH TOO;

<P>
GOVERNMENT WORKERS BACK ON JOB

<P>
President Bush signed emergency legislation today restoring business as usual 
for the federal government, and said he is willing to raise income tax rates on 
wealthy Americans if a final budget includes his long-sought cut in the 
capital-gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would do "everything in my power" to see that Congress follows up 
in the next few days with a five-year plan to cut the deficit by $500 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Federal workers breathed a collective sigh of relief that there would be no 
forced furloughs. The government, closed over the holiday weekend due to the 
budget impasse, had faced the prospect of a shutdown of non-essential services 
today without an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The President met with reporters as lawmakers, exhausted after a string of 
late-night sessions, were returning to the work of deciding precisely which 
spending programs to cut and whose taxes to raise. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of raising tax rates on the wealthy, Bush said: 
"That's on the table. That's been talked about. And if it's proper, if it can 
be worked in proper balance between the capital-gains rate and income tax 
changes, fine." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Bush has said explicitly that he could go along with a 
hike in income tax rates. His opposition to changing the rate structure had 
been the last remnant of another campaign pledge: "no new taxes" 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me) said he was heartened by 
Bush's statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have personally advocated (an increased tax rate) on those making more than 
$200,000 a year for some time," he said. "And I'm pleased that the President 
has now come around, or apparently come around, to our point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Under Monday's late-night agreement between the White House and Congress, that 
work must be completed by Oct. 19 -- or the government faces the risk of yet 
another shutdown in services. 
</P>
<P>
The budget crisis erupted last week when the House rejected a bipartisan plan 
that called for $134 billion in tax increases and a wide array of military and 
program spending cuts. Increases in Medicare fees were rolled back slightly and 
an alternative plan has been approved, although it contains fewer specifics 
than the one that was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have complained the budget plans have been unfairly weighted against 
the middle-income taxpayers to the benefit of wealthier Americans, and Bush's 
remarks indicated that the final tax package is still in negotiation. One 
subject: the "bubble" by which some taxpayers pay a 33% rate rather than the 
28% rate applied to the wealthiest taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush pledged to work with Congress on filling in the gaping blanks in the 
deficit-cutting agreement. "I will do everything in my power to encourage 
Congress as it struggles to bring forth the most comprehensive and significant 
deficit cutting plan ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President took pains to defend his top aides for their help in the budget 
confrontation with Congress. White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and 
Budget Director Richard G. Darman have come in for criticism from Republicans 
and Democrats, who accuse them of high-handed tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"When passions get high, there's bound to be a little broken china," Bush said.

CUSTODY HEARING IN SURROGATE CASE OPENS 
</P>

<P>
A pivotal hearing in the landmark custody battle over a boy born to surrogate 
mother Anna Johnson opened this morning with testimony that any woman who 
delivers a baby is entitled to consider herself a parent, even if she has no 
genetic relationship to the child. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michelle Harrison, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh, said the 
genetic makeup of a child isn't all that dictates its parentage. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the mother of the baby because she gestated and gave birth to this 
child," said Harrison, referring to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes her a mother is her emotional and physical work in nurturing the 
fetus and the way in which her body builds the baby," Harrison said. "It brings 
oxygen. It takes away waste. It protects the baby from bacteria and external 
assault." 
</P>
<P>
Today's testimony kicked off what is expected to be a two-day hearing on who 
should be considered the legal parents of the boy Johnson delivered Sept. 19. 
Johnson, 29, who agreed to bear an infertile couple's child for $10,000, 
contends that she is the child's mother because she bore him and that therefore 
she should keep the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Mark and Crispina Calvert, the couple whose embryo Johnson carried, are 
fighting for custody, claiming they are the baby's only true parents because 
the child is made from their genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. will decide who the 
baby's parents are. If he rules that all three adults have parental rights, the 
decision could prove critical in future surrogate-parent cases. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who has counseled Johnson six or seven times over the telephone, said 
Johnson has expressed deep feelings of attachment to the child and that it does 
not matter to Johnson that she is not genetically related to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests have shown that the Calverts are the genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, asked Harrison if her feelings 
about Johnson's attachment to the baby were affected by a July 23 letter 
Johnson wrote to the Calverts in which she threatened to keep the baby if she 
was not immediately paid the remainder of her $10,000 fee. Harrison said that 
did not matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Pregnant women faced with the loss of their baby say and do a lot of things to 
keep them," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen also tried to question Johnson's credibility by bringing up her 
guilty plea to two misdemeanor counts of welfare fraud, but he was not 
permitted to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to try that case in here, Mr. Van Deusen," Parslow said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's attorney, Diane Marlowe, said in a brief opening statement that she 
objects to the "wrongful withholding" of the baby from Johnson. The infant is 
living temporarily with the Calverts. Johnson is permitted to visit twice a 
week.

CAMP SCHMOOZ, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a little bit of Adrian Kronauer in the Navy chief petty officer who 
started the first live armed forces broadcasts in Saudi Arabia today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 9:05 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Goooood Maaaaawrning Saudi Arabia," bellowed disk jockey Rich Yanku, echoing 
the famous Vietnam War era disk jockey, who was portrayed by comedian Robin 
Williams in the hit movie "Good Morning Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't want to do a 'Goooood Maaaawrning Saudi Arabia,' but it 
probably would be anti-climactic if we didn't," said Navy Lt. Arnie Pon, a 
Bronx native who heads the unit making the live broadcasts from an air base in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The first song on Desert Shield Network FM 107 brought the troops a little 
closer to home -- The Clash's "Rock the Casbah" about a fight over "boogie 
sound" in a traditional Middle Eastern city. 
</P>
<P>
The general format is mostly rock 'n' roll or country music from 8,800 compact 
discs interspersed with news, sports and public service messages. Those range 
from pep talks on Saudi Arabian customs to the dangers of snake bites in the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
The team named their two trailers Camp Schmooz because Pon had been accusing 
them of "schmoozing," New York slang for standing around gossiping. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the estimated 200,000 troops deployed in Saudi Arabia should be 
able to hear Desert Shield FM if they have radios.

ISRAEL SHUTS TEMPLE MOUNT IN BID TO QUELL STRIFE; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: TEAR GAS IS USED ON MUSLIM WORSHIPERS SEEKING TO BREAK THROUGH POLICE

<P>
Police closed the sacred Temple Mount today and fired tear gas after 200 Muslim 
worshipers tried to break through the cordon. Jerusalem's 80-year-old chief 
Muslim cleric was overcome by tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary closure came one day after riots on the Temple Mount, Islam's 
third-holiest site, in which at least 19 Palestinians were killed and about 140 
were wounded by police gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
In an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem today, a Palestinian stabbed two border 
policemen with a screwdriver. The attacker and another Arab were shot and 
wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between stone throwers and police also erupted in three other Jerusalem 
Arab neighborhoods, and widespread protests were reported in Israeli Arab 
towns, where leaders called for a two-day strike over the Temple Mount 
bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip have demanded 
U.N. protection and announced a protest strike beginning today, the start of 
the 36th month of the anti-Israeli uprising in the territories seized during 
the 1967 Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's violence forced the Palestinian question back toward the top of the 
international agenda. It was the bloodiest clash in Jerusalem since the 1967 
war and the highest single-day death toll in the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders denounced the use of deadly force by Israel. President Hosni 
Mubarak of Egypt said the violence could lead to "grave consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Also condemning the Temple Mount violence were Japan, the Soviet Union, the 
European Community's executive body and the president of the European 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders said today's closure of the Temple Mount marked the first time 
police had blocked entry to the 35-acre site and its two mosques since Israel 
captured the surrounding Old City in 1967. The keys to the gates of the wall 
around the Temple Mount were returned to Muslim officials this afternoon, and 
one of the mosque's doors was opened, Muslim clerics said. 
</P>
<P>
Before control of the Temple Mount was returned to the Muslims, the chief 
Muslim cleric, the mufti of Jerusalem, led 200 Muslims to a gate of the shrine. 
Border police blocked their way and ordered them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
When the Muslims refused, police fired tear gas, and the mufti, Saad al-Din 
al-Alami, was overcome, an Arab reporter said. The mufti was taken to Mukassed 
Hospital, where he was reported in satisfactory condition.

David H. Souter, a previously little-known judge from New Hampshire, became 
history's 105th Supreme Court justice today after pledging to "do equal right 
to the poor and to the rich." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief ceremony in the crowded courtroom, Souter, 51, was administered the 
judicial oath of office by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and almost 
immediately got to work hearing high court arguments with his eight new 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the oath, Souter said, "I do solemnly swear to administer justice 
without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Souter and Rehnquist posed for photographers outside the building on 
Capitol Hill before heading back inside for a reception attended by members of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, other Washington dignitaries and Souter's 
friends and well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
Souter, facing a group of photographers and television cameras outside, said: 
"I got to work on time this morning. I'm starting off on the right foot." 
</P>
<P>
As cameras clicked and whirred, Souter said: "Hurry and load up. I've got to go 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that he has found a place to live in the Washington area, but 
declined to give any details. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Souter took his seat at the end of the bench assigned to 
the newest justice for the start of the court's regularly scheduled 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Souter pledged to uphold the Constitution in a separate oath-taking ceremony 
Monday at the White House.

KNIFE-WIELDING BLACKS STAB 9 WHITES NEAR S. AFRICA BEACH

<P>
A group of blacks stole knives from a store and went on a rampage today, 
stabbing nine whites on a busy street near the beachfront of this Indian Ocean 
city, witnesses and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no motive for the attack, which seriously injured six of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in South Africa, there 
have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking whites. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting since 1986 in Natal 
province, which includes Durban. But the violence has been almost exclusively 
in black areas. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Lekota, a spokesman for the African National Congress, said the attack 
"was a desperate attempt to discredit the liberation movement as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
"They were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knives at anyone who 
was near them," witness Robert Trulock told the independent South African Press 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Five suspects were arrested, including two who were shot and wounded by police, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang of between 10 and 20 young men took the knives from a store 
specializing in weapons from the Far East, police said. The men then ran down a 
street next to the beachfront, assaulting whites at random, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Bleeding victims staggered into the lobby of the Lonsdale Hotel and collapsed 
in front of horrified guests. 
</P>
<P>
Nine whites suffered stab wounds and were admitted to nearby Addington 
Hospital.

An Air Force review found Northrop Corp., manufacturer of the B-2 stealth 
bomber, beset with problems in nearly every aspect of its business, a House 
lawmaker said today. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about Northrop's poor performance in the production of several 
weapons systems, the Air Force conducted an in-depth study of the company in 
June and July that found problems in six major areas. 
</P>
<P>
The service identified weaknesses in systems engineering, the transition from 
research and development to production, software management, subcontract 
management, organization and personnel, and business systems, which includes 
cost and schedule estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force team found that Northrop failed miserably in every key 
management area necessary to the successful development and production of a 
major weapons system," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee and its investigations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, 
said he found it "distressing that a company that has been entrusted with over 
$36 billion since 1980, and that has been counted upon to manage programs 
critical to our national defense, could have so many fundamental deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
Loye Miller, a spokesman for Northrop in the Washington, D.C., area, said the 
company had not seen Dingell's statement prepared for the opening of a 
subcommittee hearing today, and would have no immediate comment on the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials told the panel in July that the California company 
should be barred from government business. 
</P>
<P>
The officials described how Northrop falsified reports on the air-launched 
cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the Harrier AV-8B jet. Northrop 
also manufactures the B-2 bomber and is in competition with Lockheed for the 
contract on the Advanced Tactical Fighter. 
</P>
<P>
The company's action led to its guilty plea in February on 34 charges of fraud 
and a fine of $17 million, the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement for today's hearing, Dingell noted a June 5 letter to Kent 
Kresa, Northrop's president and chief executive officer, in which the Air Force 
said that "while some programs have shown improvement in the past year, others, 
including Tacit Rainbow (a missile program) and key classified programs, 
continue to reflect poor performance."

UAL REJECTS EMPLOYEES' LATEST BID FOR BUYOUT, DROPS MERGER ACCORD 
</P>

<P>
Directors of UAL Corp. today unanimously rejected a scaled-down buyout bid by 
United Airlines employees and terminated their merger agreement with the 
employee group. 
</P>
<P>
A UAL spokesman said the merger agreement was terminated because the employee 
group -- United Employee Acquisition Corp. -- failed to arrange financing for 
the original $4.4-billion, $201-a-share buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that the employee group presented a revised acquisition 
proposal but that the value was considerably below the $4.4-billion offer the 
board accepted in April. 
</P>
<P>
The employees last week had been trying to put together a deal believed to 
value the Chicago-based company at $165 to $175 a share, or $3.6 billion to 
$3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the interests of both UAL shareholders and employees 
would be well served by the company aggressively moving forward with its highly 
successful strategic plan and taking advantage of its position of strength in a 
time of difficulty for the airline industry," the board said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The board, facing potential labor problems with its three unions as a result of 
the buyout's failure, asked federal mediators to resume talks on new contracts 
for pilots and flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Directors also said UAL is prepared to resume negotiations with the 
International Assn. of Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
All three unions have been working under expired contracts while pursuing the 
buyout -- which would have made UAL the world's largest employee-owned company.

DOW DIVES ON BUDGET, OIL WORRIES

Wall Street stocks plunged in late trading today, with the Dow Jones industrial 
average off nearly 80 points at the closing bell due to worries about a sharp 
rise in oil prices, Congress' failure to complete details of the budget process 
and a major decline in the Treasury bond market. 
</P>
<P>
At the bell at 4 p.m., the 30-share average had tumbled 78.22 points to close 
at 2,445.54 -- a drop of 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Dow's 11th worst point drop, after the fall of 86.61 points on Sept. 
11, 1986, and the lowest close since July 6, 1989, when it was 2,462.44. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues swamped advancers by more than 4 to 1, while volume on the New 
York Stock Exchange was a moderate 145.61 million shares, up from 99.47 million 
shares on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was pushed down by a compromise agreement on the 
federal budget crisis that failed to give many specifics on how to cut the gap. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, oil prices soared, with some grades commanding close to $42 a 
barrel after a veiled threat against Israel by Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The oil price surge sent the bond market sharply lower, with the benchmark 
30-year Treasury bond down nearly 2 full points in late trading. That pushed 
the yield up to 8.97% from 8.79% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The rising oil price was "the minute-to-minute focus of the market," said Larry 
Wachtel, a first vice president with Prudential-Bache Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Streeters also had doubts about emergency legislation signed by President 
Bush to keep the government open for another 11 days. Bush said, however, there 
is "no assurance" Congress will reach agreement on a $500-billion deficit 
reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
The most NYSE active stock was Motorola Inc., down 6 1/8 to 53 5/8 after 
settling a patent infringement battle with Hitachi Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers Corp. fell another 1 1/4 to 13 1/8 amid continued concern over its 
recent losses. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp. was down 4 1/2 to 86 3/4 after its board rejected an employee buyout 
bid, which became the fourth failed attempt to take over the airline in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The climb in oil prices depressed the bond market by increasing the threat of 
higher inflation. Inflation erodes the value of bonds and also gives the 
Federal Reserve less room to ease its monetary policy and allow interest rates 
to drop. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders have been waiting anxiously for the Fed to relax credit, but they 
know higher oil prices and, more important, the lack of a budget agreement in 
Washington, will prevent the Fed from acting.

OIL TOPS $40 AGAIN ON LATEST HUSSEIN THREAT

Oil prices flared nearly $2 higher to more than $40 a barrel today in response 
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat to strike against Israel after the 
killing Monday of 19 Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"The war premium just went up another $1.50 a barrel based on rhetoric coming 
out of Iraq," said Brian Tagler, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
In early afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas 
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade, rose a hefty $1.75 to $40.70 a barrel, 
a record high for the futures contract. It eclipsed the old high of $40.10 set 
on Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said oil in the U.S. spot market was pegged at record highs, with some 
grades of oil fetching close to $42 a barrel. The last time spot prices 
approached this level was in 1980, when the Iraq-Iran War set off panic buying. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait because of fears 
that fighting would disrupt supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said they feared the crisis in the Mideast was near a flash point after 
Hussein's speech. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said crude will likely push to $42 a barrel in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
"Any way Israel provokes Arab anger cannot be positive," said Jayne Ball, 
analyst with New Century Resources Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But others agreed with President Bush's assessment that Israel's actions had 
little bearing on the U.S.-Iraqi confrontation.

Pete Rozelle, the man who led the NFL for 30 years, will have his name on the 
trophy awarded each year to the most valuable player in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"No name is more synonymous with the Super Bowl than Pete Rozelle," said Paul 
Tagliabue, who replaced Rozelle as commissioner last season. "It was his 
imagination and foresight that made this great event a reality, and his 
guidance that elevated the Super Bowl to an unofficial national holiday on 
Super Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving office on Nov. 5, 1989, Rozelle has been a consultant to the 
league. The first trophy bearing his name will be presented on Jan. 27 at 
Tampa, Fla.

MARYLAND PENALIZES ITSELF FOR BREAKING AN NCAA RULE

<P>
The University of Maryland has penalized itself for an admitted rules violation 
by delaying the opening of men's basketball practice five days. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Andy Geiger, in making the announcement, said the length of 
the self-imposed penalty matched the number of pickup games observed by Coach 
Gary Williams and his coaching staff before last season. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger said that Williams had watched parts of two workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider this pretty important, and I want to get this business behind us 
and not have to worry about this anymore," said Geiger, who assumed his new 
position last week. 
</P>
<P>
With the penalty, the Terps will open preseason practice Oct. 20 rather than 
the normal Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger was to meet today with Mark Jones, a director of enforcement for the 
NCAA, at the organization's headquarters outside Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Observing preseason workouts normally is considered a minor, or secondary, 
infraction by the NCAA. But the NCAA has examined this matter more vigorously 
because Maryland was under investigation for more serious violations committed 
under former Coach Bob Wade. 
</P>
<P>
The Terps subsequently were put on three years' probation, including a two-year 
ban from postseason competition and a one-year ban from live television 
appearances. Maryland's appeal of the sanctions was rejected by the NCAA in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the self-imposed penalty would ensure that the NCAA doesn't pursue the 
matter further, Geiger said: "I'm hopeful it will be a sign that we're taking 
this very seriously. There is a clear message that we want to have a firm hand 
at the helm." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "I won't comment on whether a self-imposed penalty by an 
institution is appropriate. Anything they report will be reviewed by the 
Committee on Infractions." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's Committee on Infractions will meet next in Hilton Head, S.C., Nov. 
8-10.

The financially troubled Portland Timbers professional soccer team is up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Art Dixon, the team's majority owner, said the Timbers have lost about $600,000 
during his two-year tenure. Current debts include about $10,000 owed to coaches 
and players in back salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said if new investors or owners are not found by Nov. 1, the team would 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
The Timbers are in the Western Division of the American Professional Soccer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said most of the financial losses occurred this past season, when the 
team suffered from poor home attendance and failed to qualify for the 
divisional playoffs. Attendance averaged 3,149 per game.

WORLD CUP: INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION HAS BEEN DEBATING REFORMS IN ADVANCE OF 
1994 COMPETITION IN U.S.

<P>
Sweden's Lennart Johansson, chairman of the European soccer governing body, 
UEFA, was quoted today as saying he is opposed to the rule changes suggested 
for the 1994 World Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Johansson indicated that the changes might please commercial sponsors but will 
be opposed by the powerful European soccer federations which are members of 
UEFA. 
</P>
<P>
The international soccer federation (FIFA) said recently it was considering 
increasing the size of the goal and making other changes in time for the next 
World Cup to make the game more attractive and boost scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
Johansson was quoted by the Milan daily, Corriere della Sera, as saying that 
"reforms must be carefully planned . . . proposals must not be just thrown in." 
</P>
<P>
Johansson said that commercial sponsors have been pressing for changes in the 
next World Cup final to leave more room for advertising spots. 
</P>
<P>
"UEFA is the most important association in world soccer and existing rules 
can't be changed without its approval," Johansson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is against increasing the size of the goal "as it would make scoring 
too easy," and is also against a reduction in the size of the team from 11 to 
10 players. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the low number of goals scored and the amount of playing 
time during this year's World Cup in Italy posed serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Gagg, an FIFA official who attended Monday's meeting in Coverciano to 
discuss the proposed rules changes, said that actual playing time of matches 
during the 1990 World Cup averaged 54 minutes. Soccer matches last 90 minutes, 
but play often is stopped following fouls, injuries and when the ball is kicked 
by defenders into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Gagg suggested that two halves of 35 minutes be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA's board is scheduled to discuss and possibly vote changes at its next 
meeting Dec. 13.

PIRATES CRY FOUL ON TICKETS

<TEXT>
<P>
Reds majority owner Marge Schott got a nice seat Monday at Three Rivers Stadium 
-- much nicer than some of the Pirates would have given her. 
</P>
<P>
Several Pirates were upset at the poor seating for their families when the 
playoffs opened in Cincinnati. Some Pirates received only one ticket each 
between the foul lines and another in the deep recesses of the center field 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I supposed to do, let my little girl sit by herself in center field?" 
Pirates reliever Ted Power asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the cheapest person I've ever met in the game of baseball," catcher 
Mike LaValliere said of Schott. " . . . It's the kind of thing where Marge 
doesn't care about her own players, and she's definitely not going to care 
about the other team's players. When we get back to Pittsburgh, if it was my 
choice, I would set Marge up in the upper deck all by herself." 
</P>
<P>
Schott got much better treatment than that. She got a first-row seat right 
behind the Reds' dugout and Reds players were given complimentary box seat 
tickets, some of them immediately behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Schott said the Pirates got poor tickets because the Reds sell so many season 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if we sell 15,000 season tickets, we'll never be like that," 
Pirates President Carl Barger said. 
</P>
<P>
The great debate in Boston concerns the premature -- say the natives -- hook 
used by Manager Joe Morgan in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan removed Roger Clemens with a 1-0 lead after six on Saturday and Dana 
Kiecker tied 1-1 after 5 2/3 on Sunday. The bullpen was charged with eight runs 
in Game 1 and three in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
Neither pitcher exactly complained, although Kiecker said, "I didn't think he 
was coming to pull me, to be honest. I thought he was coming out to recommend 
this or that. If I had known he was coming to pull me out, I might have tried 
to fight a little harder."

The first South Korean men's and women's soccer teams ever to visit North Korea 
arrived in Pyongyang today from Beijing, North Korean official media reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, said thousands of people 
warmly welcomed the visitors at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides' agreement on a soccer exchange, seen as an extension of 
increased contact and dialogue, followed talks between their sports ministers 
at the Asian Games in Beijing. It gave rise to talk of "soccer diplomacy" 
between the longtime bitter rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Since the division of the Korean peninsula in 1945, athletic teams from the two 
sides have met at international competitions in third countries, but never 
crossed to the other side in direct exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the South Koreans were met at the airport by Kim Yu Sun, 
chairman of the North Korean Olympic Committee.

The film's newest venue will include a fund-raiser in Moscow for fighting AIDS, 
said media tycoon Ted Turner, whose Turner Entertainment Corp. owns the film.

"It's a pleasure to share this crown jewel in the TEC library with the citizens 
of the Soviet Union," Turner said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The film's first Soviet screening will be Oct. 19 at Moscow's October Cinema. 
The following night it will be seen in Tbilisi. 
</P>
<P>

LIZ SMITH: DIVIDENDS IN 'GOODFELLAS'; 'RICHARD III' RAVES FOR KEACH

GOODFELLA PAUL Sorvino is reaping the benefits of appearing in Martin 
Scorcese's lavishly praised "GoodFellas" gangster flick. He has just signed two 
new movie deals. The first with Rita Moreno, called "Life in the Fast Food 
Chain," and then he moves on to Disney for an as-yet-untitled film with Timothy 
Dalton, who is taking a respite from his duties as James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
IN WASHINGTON, they are talking about Stacy Keach! Keach opened last week at 
the Folger Theater in "Richard III" to incredible reviews -- the kind most 
actors only dream of. Some critics have gone so far as to call Stacy, once TV's 
Mike Hammer, "the new Laurence Olivier"! (Oh, look, let's just leave that 
alone.) 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, his wife, Malgosia, and their new baby are settled in Washington until 
his sold-out stint as "Richard III" closes Nov. 10.

I TOLD you the other day that word of mouth on Barbra Streisand's "The Prince 
of Tides" movie is just great, and how happy Barbra is with her leading man, 
Nick Nolte. Well, it seems that everybody connected with Barbra's labor of love 
(she is the director, the star and the producer) is happy at this point. Pat 
Conroy, who wrote the book on which the film is based, has this to say: 
"Streisand's smart as hell to take this novel of biblical length and pretension 
and break it down into a movie. She's not afraid of anything. Her sheer will is 
the reason this movie is getting made." 
</P>
<P>
"The Prince of Tides" is still filming, and obviously nobody can predict a hit 
or miss, no matter the talent involved. But I do foresee that by the time this 
movie is ready for release, we will be in the grips of Streisand-mania. This 
is, after all, Barbra's first big screen effort since "Yentl," way back in -- 
can you believe it -- 1984?!

THE GREAT actress Sylvia Sidney was all but given up for dead earlier this 
year. She was dreadfully ill and even in a coma at one point. But now Sidney, 
who began her movie career in 1929, has made an amazing health comeback, and 
will be on hand to receive honors from the Film Society of Lincoln Center on 
Nov. 20 in New York.

Comedy actors Steve Martin and Rick Moranis joined hard-core chess fans at a 
world championship match between two bitter Soviet rivals -- and found 
something to laugh about. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about checkers," Moranis quipped, explaining that he 
came to the opening game Monday only because Martin "bought the tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he came for the excitement and "to see the fights in the audience," 
but the hottest crowd action came when someone in the back spoke out loud and 
miffed spectators let out a unified "shhhh!" 
</P>
<P>
The actors watched as defending champion Gary Kasparov and challenger Anatoly 
Karpov battled to a draw in the opening match of the 1990 World Chess 
Championship at the Hudson Theater.
