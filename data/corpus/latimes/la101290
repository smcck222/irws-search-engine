SCRIPPS GETS MAJOR GRANT TO STUDY AIDS DEMENTIA 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city's status as a major center of research into how AIDS affects the 
brain and central nervous system received a boost Thursday with the 
announcement that Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation has received a 
$14-million grant to establish an AIDS Dementia Complex Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year grant from the National Institute of Mental Health comes a little 
more than a year after the same organization awarded UC San Diego a similar 
$19.5-million, five-year award to study how the AIDS virus affects the 
neurological, psychological and behavioral condition of those with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this has to put San Diego at the forefront . . . it speaks to the 
enormous amount of talent in this area of research and patient care," said 
Leslie Franz, spokeswoman for UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Her view was endorsed by Scripps officials, who were touting their award as the 
largest single grant for biomedical research ever given to Scripps Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
While both grants deal with AIDS-caused dementia, there are fundamental 
differences in the approaches and tasks of both medical institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps researchers, led by Dr. Floyd Bloom, head of the clinic's 
neuropharmacology department, will delve into the underlying molecular and 
cellular basis for AIDS dementia mainly through basic scientific laboratory 
work on the central nervous system. This will involve analyzing the biological 
nature of persistent virus infections of the brain and how these infections 
affect communication among individual cells and, as a result, messages sent to 
neurons, the basis of the body's nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the focus of researchers at the UCSD-led HIV Neurobehavioral 
Research Center is studying people infected with the AIDS virus and finding out 
how the infection affects their behavior and central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
(Researchers have determined that AIDS -- acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
-- is caused by a virus known as HIV -- human immunodeficiency virus.) 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, in a prepared statement, said the Scripps study will be the only one of 
its kind that looks in a comprehensive manner at the biological underpinnings 
of central nervous system dementia, examples of which are lack of concentration 
or the inability to do simple tasks such as keeping personal checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Although virtually everyone with AIDS will express some form of dementia, 
researchers have been unable to determine how it is caused," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the central nervous system may be a repository for the HIV virus . . . 
being able to attack the virus in those cells that are infecting the brain may 
be a way to prolong the course and improve, to some degree, the survival of the 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
And there is a chance, Bloom said, that this research might lead to discovery 
of medicines to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps researchers will look at how the HIV virus takes hold in the central 
nervous system early in the disease and the role the infection might play later 
in the immunodeficiency itself. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people believe that a healthy nervous system is necessary for a 
well-functioning immune system," Bloom said. "It may be that the central 
nervous system infection is actually causing, or in some fashion changing, the 
way in which the virus can depress the function of the immune system." 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies, for example, have shown that brain abnormalities have been seen 
in AIDS patients who themselves have not yet noticed any signs of dementia, 
Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those studies, he said, are computer analysis of brain electrical 
activity tied to sensory stimulus such as clicks and tones, as well as 
measurements indicating abnormal sleep patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be," said Bloom, "that people with AIDS are tolerating some degree of 
decline in mental ability, attributing that to fatigue or in some way to 
general health decline, but without knowing that it may be indicative of AIDS 
dementia." 
</P>
<P>
Working with Bloom, at least initially, will be 22 researchers from various 
Scripps Clinic departments such as neuropharmacology, immunology and molecular 
biology, chemistry and the sleep disorder center, and one researcher from 
UCSD's department of psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps officials also said the work might provide information on causes that 
led to diseases such as schizophrenia.

BAN ON BARBECUE LIGHTER FLUID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (Part A, Oct. 6) has acted to 
cleanse the basin of the scourge of barbecue lighter fluid. 
</P>
<P>
This bold, damn-the-torpedoes move, we are told, will reduce our daily dose of 
air poison by two tons. 
</P>
<P>
With one of the new, cleaner-burning gasolines trimming 15 tons from the 6,300 
tons said to come from cars each day, we shall soon be back to blue skies 
again.

Any chance these guys are kidding?

HAVE WE DULLED OUR EDGE?; 
</P>
<P>
THOSE DISTRESSING REPORTS FROM THE GULF ON EQUIPMENT UNRELIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pentagon likes to say that U.S. armed forces are the best equipped in the 
world. Americans can only hope that evaluation is right, more than ever now 
that some 200,000 U.S. members of those forces in the Persian Gulf area are 
facing the prospect that their equipment could be put to wartime tests. 
</P>
<P>
What's best, though, isn't necessarily determined only by high cost or 
technical complexity. Above all, the tools of war must be reliable. Troubling 
questions have arisen about the reliability of certain key weapons, questions 
that may have been given even more ominous significance by the recent spate of 
air crashes in Saudi Arabia that forced a temporary grounding of all training 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
A new congressional report, for example, finds that at any given time only half 
the Army's Apache helicopter fleet is ready to do its job, against the Army's 
goal of having 70% of its Apaches "mission capable." That goal is being 
defeated by breakdowns that on average require major maintenance on the copters 
every 2 1/2 hours. The Apache, armed with anti-tank weapons, is being heavily 
counted on in the event of war to offset Iraq's large numerical superiority in 
armor. 
</P>
<P>
Army specifications call for the M1-A1 tank to be able to operate for 101 
minutes without a mechanical or electronic failure. In practice, something 
breaks down in an M1-A1 every 21 minutes. The catalogue of failed expectations 
doesn't stop here. The Air Force has problems with some of its advanced planes, 
the Navy with some of its ships. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons have long since been identified: Technological and 
performance goals that were set too high by the military itself, sloppy work 
and -- as we now know -- in some cases flagrantly dishonest testing and 
evaluation procedures by military contractors. The consequences, whatever the 
primary cause, are equally worrisome. American armed forces are depending for 
their success and maybe even their survival on a qualitative edge that in some 
cases may prove not to be there.

PROPOSITION 132; 
</P>
<P>
TOO BIG A NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 132 would ban the use of nets designed to grab fish by the gills or 
trap them in folds of fine plastic line. The ban on gill nets and trammel nets 
would cover all waters off the California coast for a distance of three miles. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the proposition probably is impeccable, even though commercial 
fishermen who use both kinds of nets say the measure's purpose is not to spare 
sea otters terrible deaths but to reduce the commercial catch so that sport 
fishermen can land more. 
</P>
<P>
But reaching the goal by writing the ban into a state document already three 
times longer than the national Constitution is the wrong way to go about it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the ban say they need a constitutional amendment to make certain 
that the Legislature could not lift the ban under pressure from commercial 
fishing fleets. But an initiative statute would give virtually the same 
protection to porpoises, sea otters and other creatures who are caught and 
killed in gill nets by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Standard language in such ballot propositions forbids the Legislature to change 
the will of the people except with amendments that strengthen the purpose of 
the initiative. Even a change in the right direction requires a two-thirds vote 
in both chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Gill nets are fiendish devices, never more than when they break free from boats 
and slide through waters killing everything in their path. 
</P>
<P>
It would be different if amending the Constitution were the only hope for 
marine life. But it isn't. A no vote on 132 is simply to suggest that the state 
Constitution shouldn't be a laundry list.

BAN ON BARBECUE LIGHTER FLUID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A deeply breathed, clean-air sigh of relief and thanks to the visionary and 
wise James Lents, executive director of the AQMD, for outlawing the profoundly 
polluting charcoal lighter fluid -- in two years. No more back-yard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
No more "put another shrimp on the barbie," for the Grinch has stolen back-yard 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not enough. Flatulence is a major source of foul pollution. Outlaw 
burritos. And exercise. Burning additional calories produces carbon dioxide, 
furthering the greenhouse effect and global warming -- heat pollution. No 
exercise. No cigarettes. No fried food (too smoky). Why, with a little thought 
and a lot of regulation, unelected Czar Lents could shut down civilization. But 
why wait two years to do it? Do it now. Then we can sit in our clean-air caves 
and enjoy.

L.A. COP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Help me understand. Officer Carl McGill has been such a fine cop that he's 
gained national recognition -- but now faces suspension for being loud and 
boisterous and disrespectful ("Officer Asks: Can Good Cop Excel in L.A.?" Sept. 
29, Metro). 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like charges of being uppity to me, and it shouldn't be so -- when I 
need help, I kind of like my protector being a little rough and loud! 
</P>
<P>
Punitive fault-finding destroys morale, and McGill already sounds affected. He 
speaks as if he hinges his praiseworthy efforts on being a member of the Police 
Department, and one gets the feeling such fine work will end if he feels 
compelled to retire. This is not good -- communities need their McGills whether 
they're cops or not!

L.A. COP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What irony! On Page 1 of Metro is a story of an extraordinarily talented and 
dedicated black LAPD officer who is battling a Board of Rights hearing (and 
possible month's suspension without pay), for yelling at his white captain for 
burglarizing his car. 
</P>
<P>
Then on the letters page is Chief Daryl F. Gates' "recruiting piece," which 
boasts of 1,128 blacks, 1,772 Latinos, 1,068 woman and a motto that LAPD 
officers "come only in one color -- blue." 
</P>
<P>
It would seem, however, that a few of his staff are green -- apparently with 
envy. Could it be that a black officer is accepted in the department as one of 
L.A.'s finest as long as he keeps "his place" and doesn't garner too much 
personal recognition? 
</P>
<P>
Since McGill admits to losing his temper and yelling at his captain -- who 
steadfastly denies the car burglary -- it will be interesting to see how the 
chief and his Board of Rights view captain-bashing by this black officer in 
comparison to perjury committed by a white sergeant.

ISRAEL'S DESTRUCTION IS ARABS' ONLY GOAL; 
</P>
<P>
THE EXISTENCE OF A JEWISH STATE, NOT THE ABSENCE OF A PALESTINIAN ONE, IS THE 
ISSUE. AND IT'S THE WEST'S VALUES THAT ARE AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS PRAGER, Dennis Prager is co-author of The Nine Questions People Ask 
About Judaism and of Why the Jews? The Reason for Anti-Semitism (Simon &amp; 
Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This past week thousands of Palestinian Arabs who fervently want Israel 
extinguished rained stones on Jews worshiping at the Western Wall. Israeli 
police responded with tear gas, with rubber bullets, and finally with live 
ammunition, and 19 Palestinians died. 
</P>
<P>
Then the U.N. Security Council condemned Israel for the "excessive" response. 
The only effect on Israel will be to further embitter its peace movement, for 
the condemnation gives new meaning to the word hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
In that council sit nations every one of which condemned Israel for destroying 
the Iraqi nuclear weapons plant in 1982. In that council sit, among others, the 
Chinese butchers of Tian An Men Square, the totalitarian state of Cuba, and the 
two greatest suppliers of weapons to Iraq -- France and the Soviet Union. And 
the condemnation was led by an American Administration that killed 50 to 100 
times more civilians solely in order to remove a leader in Panama whom we 
loathed -- not in order to repel a mob of thousands stoning people at prayer. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not these nations' hypocrisy alone that is most dangerous; it is 
their lack of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Israel, a state the size of New Jersey, surrounded by countries that 
are morally equivalent to Nazism and Stalinism. Here is a state that, a 
generation after the gas chambers, has to fit its children with gas masks 
because hundreds of millions of Arabs hate the Jewish state far more than they 
care for fellow Arabs. The torture chambers of Iraq and Kuwait, and the 
obliteration of an Arab country, mean nothing to Arabs; it is the existence of 
a tiny Jewish state in their midst that gives their lives and deaths meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab world, once a beacon of intellectual and religious thought, is today a 
caldron of hate and cruelty. It is the Jews' miserable luck (as it was the 
miserable luck of Lebanese Christians who once led the only free Arab country) 
to be stranded in this moral desert. 
</P>
<P>
If Israel were situated anywhere else, it would be seen for what it is: one of 
the world's most humane and energetic democracies. With its kibbutzim -- the 
only non-coercive social, economic and sexual egalitarianism in the world -- 
its hospitals and medical research, its desert irrigation and its cultural 
life, Israel would be regarded as the Prophets' "light unto the nations." 
</P>
<P>
Instead it has had to fight, and fight, and fight again -- not for land that it 
never sought, not in wars it never wanted. Just to live. 
</P>
<P>
Having viewed the West Bank as a moral cancer in Israel's midst, I am a Jew who 
since 1967 has wanted Israel to rid itself of this land for anything 
approaching real peace. But I have never deluded myself about the moral chasm 
that separates Israel from its Arab and Muslim enemies. 
</P>
<P>
I have never deluded myself that Palestinian self-determination prevents 
Arab-Israeli peace, since one never saw a single Palestinian flag, never once 
heard about the existence of a Palestinian nation, when the entire West Bank 
was under Arab control before 1967. 
</P>
<P>
And I have never forgotten the unique role that Israel plays in the world -- 
albeit involuntarily and perhaps unwittingly. For 3,000 years, ever since 
bringing the Ten Commandments and the Prophetic message to humankind, the 
Jewish people have been the world's miner's canaries: When Jews are killed, 
non-Jews with good values discover that there are noxious moral fumes about 
that will soon kill them, too. 
</P>
<P>
When there was a Hitler, the West ignored Nazism; his anti-Semitism was 
unfortunate for the Jews but irrelevant to non-Jews. Had the West understood 
that Jew-hatred is hatred of freedom, hatred of humanism, hatred of ethical 
monotheism, and had therefore confronted Hitler sooner, tens of millions of 
innocent non-Jews would have not have been slaughtered in World War II. So, 
too, had the West not dismissed Moammar Kadafi and Palestinian terrorism as 
"anti-Zionist" alone, and understood that "anti-Zionism" is simply the 
post-Holocaust expression of anti-Semitism, innumerable non-Jewish victims of 
Arab terrorism would have been spared. Indeed, Kuwait might now still be a 
living state. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't Yitzhak Shamir who causes the hatred. Israel-haters wanted Israel dead 
when it was governed by David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir. Nor is it the West 
Bank; Israel-haters wanted Israel dead when Israel had no West Bank. And it 
isn't Israel's reactions to the intifada; more Palestinians were killed by King 
Hussein in September, 1970, than by Israel in 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the hatred is the mere existence of the Jewish state, a state that 
embodies Western democratic and humanistic values in the midst of Arabs and 
Muslims who hate democracy and the West. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the issues. The rest is commentary. 
</P>
<P>
If the West learns this, and confronts the post-Communist threat to its highest 
values -- that of the Arab world and Muslim fundamentalism -- it will save 
itself great suffering later. If not, once again, Jewish children will be 
gassed, but they will not be the only ones.

THE EMPEROR HAS NO PRINCIPLES; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT: THE BUDGET FIASCO REVEALS BUSH'S LACK OF INTEREST IN OR BELIEFS ON 
DOMESTIC POLICY; HE'S VAGUE EVEN ON TAX ISSUES SO DEAR TO REPUBLICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder writes a syndicated column from Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The budget fiasco in the nation's capital has left few politicians untarnished, 
but the damage to President Bush is particularly serious -- for good reason. 
The President has revealed to the nation's voters that you can't have the 
courage of your convictions if you lack convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush reached the White House without ever pausing to reflect on what principles 
guide his approach to the domestic bargaining process. He not only appears to 
be rootless, he is rootless. He occupies a philosophical ground as ill-defined 
as his home bases in Connecticut, Maine and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
My guess is that the reason Bush cares much more about foreign policy than 
domestic issues lies in his personal history. Family wealth sheltered him from 
the consequences of the Depression, when the welfare-state questions that still 
dominate the domestic agenda were formed. But his life was wrenched out of its 
expected pattern by World War II, teaching him before he was 20 that 
national-security issues really are life-and-death matters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his lack of involvement in domestic policy is stunning. Although he 
served on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee back in the '60s, there is 
no evidence that the experience deepened his understanding of the revenue 
system. Even as vice president in the eight years of the Reagan Administration, 
when the tax code went through several major overhauls, Bush managed to avoid 
thinking about the basic principles that should shape the code. 
</P>
<P>
His original view of Reagan's crusade to reduce marginal tax rates was 
skeptical. The "voodoo economics" phrase he applied when running against Reagan 
in the 1980 primaries came from his aide, Peter Teeley, but it captured Bush's 
doubts. Once on the ticket with Reagan, however, he swallowed his reservations 
and kept them down during all his time as vice president. 
</P>
<P>
But his attention to the topic was fleeting and fragmentary. He lobbied for 
oil-industry tax breaks in the 1986 code revision as casually as he latched on 
to the proposal for a capital-gains tax cut in the 1988 campaign and again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
This absence of a guiding principle, let alone an overall plan, has left 
everyone -- including his own fellow Republicans -- in doubt about where Bush 
really is on the question of the tax policy that has been one of the two or 
three real anchors of Republican politics for the past dozen years. His 
flip-flops this past week are not out of character; they fit a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
That same equivocation applies to basic social issues, including abortion, 
education and affirmative action. And it applies to basic issues of governance, 
such as the question of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he can still "draw a line in the sand" of foreign policy and have 
it accepted. But his eroding domestic credibility will make even that strength 
harder to maintain.

La Quinta High School did not clinch the Garden Grove League title Thursday 
night, but the Aztecs definitely moved one of their biggest obstacles out of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (6-0 overall, 3-0 in league) relied on the pass-catching and running 
of Walter Dawkins and another exceptional performance by its defense to beat 
previously undefeated Rancho Alamitos, 10-7, in front of about 3,000 at Bolsa 
Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta entered the game as the county's No. 10 team, two positions below 
Rancho Alamitos (5-1, 2-1), and with a two-game winning streak over the 
Vaqueros. Rancho Alamitos presented a menacing offense that had scored 188 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Rancho Alamitos and its speedy tailback, Ulysses Trammell, 
couldn't generate many scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Things at least started well for Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros went to their bread-and-butter ground game on their first 
possession, as Trammell carried the ball nine times in a 13-play, 76-yard drive 
that included runs of 17 and 14 yards. He wrapped up the 6 1/2-minute march 
with a three-yard sweep around left tackle to give Rancho Alamitos a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive display of ball control by the Vaqueros, but La Quinta 
Coach Roger Takahashi apparently did a good job convincing his players the 
touchdown didn't spell doomsday. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the kids not to panic after their first score. We settled them down," 
Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta rebounded early in the second quarter on a 32-yard field goal by Mike 
Berg and a 32-yard scoring pass from quarterback Donald Hopkins to Dawkins with 
4 minutes and 41 seconds remaining before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, who caught five passes for 83 yards and had eight carries for 54 
yards, outjumped a Rancho Alamitos defender for the reception. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos had a pair of scoring opportunities thwarted in the fourth 
quarter. The first ended on a block by La Quinta defensive back George Sanchez 
of a 44-yard field goal attempt by Carl Foss. The second came a few minutes 
later, on a fourth-and-three situation at the La Quinta 33. Quarterback Chris 
Singletary fumbled the snap and Hopkins recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell, who last week ran for 244 yards against Kennedy, was held to 90 yards 
in 21 carries. He had a couple big gains nullified by penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"We committed suicide with all the mistakes and penalties," Rancho Alamitos 
Coach Mark Miller said.

Rick Odoardi's touchdown 14 seconds into the game got the ball rolling in 
Century High School's 14-10 victory over Estancia in a Pacific Coast League 
game Thursday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Odoardi, the Centurions' sophomore quarterback, cut around the left side, found 
an opening and raced 80 yards down the sideline to give Century (3-3 overall, 
1-0 in league) a 7-0 lead with 11:46 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In 25 carries, Odoardi gained 124 of Century's 151 rushing yards. He completed 
six of seven passes for 112 yards and recovered a fumble that stopped an 
Estancia drive at the Century 32 in the final six seconds of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Century's defense held Estancia (1-5, 0-1) to 37 yards rushing and six yards 
passing in the first half. The Eagles finished with 119 yards rushing and 94 
yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia trailed Century, 7-3, until Bill Sandro (79 yards in 10 carries) 
scored from the Centurions' 48 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Century scored the winning touchdown 11 plays later on Juan Garcia's one-yard 
run with 3:43 remaining in the third quarter. Garcia also recovered an Estancia 
fumble with 2:18 to play. BOB BORSUM

ORANGE, SANTA ANA VALLEY COACHES TONGUE-TIED IN 7-7 GAME

Dan Castanon, Santa Ana Valley High School football coach, called his team 
fortunate. Tom Meiss, Orange coach, shook Castanon's hand and said, "Nobody 
should have to do this for a living." 
</P>
<P>
The coaches stood at midfield, trying to explain a 7-7 tie in the teams' 
Century League opener Thursday night at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to be the craziest first league game I've ever coached," Castanon said. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended with Orange frantically lining up for a 38-yard field-goal try 
that would have won the game. But time ran out before the Panthers could snap 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Ten seconds earlier, Santa Ana Valley's Mike Castleberry and Bernie Enriquez 
burst through the line to block Micah Knorr's 33-yard attempt on third down. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange recovered at the Santa Ana Valley 21, bringing up fourth down. For a 
moment, that wasn't clear, and Orange had half its defensive unit and half its 
field-goal team on the field at once. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Panthers got it together, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley (3-1-2 overall, 0-0-1 in league) trailed, 7-0, after allowing 
Orange (3-2-1, 0-0-1) a 13-yard touchdown run by Acen Chiles on the game's 
first series. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing much happened -- unless you're into punts, interceptions, fumbles, 
penalties and a fair amount of good defense -- until Santa Ana Valley took 
possession at its own 38 with 5 minutes 24 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons drove, thanks in part to a 10-yard holding penalty on Orange, to 
the Panther 31. On second and seven, quarterback Gary Graves dropped to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sprint-out pass," Castanon would say later. 
</P>
<P>
Graves was nearly sacked, but slipped through the onrushing linemen, cut to his 
left and ran 31 yards for a touchdown with 2:33 left. 
</P>
<P>
After two timeouts, Santa Ana Valley lined up for a two-point conversion try. 
Again, Graves dropped to pass. As he did, penalty flags fell. He scrambled to 
his left and threw on the run into the end zone. An Orange defender tipped the 
pass away, but the officials threw another flag. 
</P>
<P>
The calls were illegal procedure against Santa Ana Valley and a roughing the 
passer penalty against Orange -- offsetting penalties, replay the down. 
</P>
<P>
"Things just didn't go right for us," Castanon said later. "Even the two-point 
conversion try didn't go right. I figured we better go for the tie." 
</P>
<P>
Armando Cueva, the Falcons' holder, handled a high snap well, and Isan Najera's 
kick went through the uprights as Orange defenders crashed into him.

UNBEATEN SANTA MARGARITA ROLLS OVER GAHR, 34-0

<P>
It took just 6 minutes 30 seconds for Santa Margarita High School to score two 
touchdowns, knock out Gahr's quarterback and establish dominance that 
eventually led to a 34-0 victory in a nonleague game at Gahr Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Ireland and Trevor Yankoff each ran for touchdowns within the first 6:30 
for the Eagles (6-0). 
</P>
<P>
Both touchdowns were set up by long kick returns. Mike Farris returned the 
first one 56 yards to the Gahr 40-yard line. David Shearer took the second 
kickoff 29 yards to the Gahr 16. Ireland's three-yard run culminated the first 
drive just 1:38 into the game. Three minutes later, Yankoff, the Eagles' 
quarterback, scored from the five. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play from scrimmage, Gahr quarterback Greg Van Lear was blindsided 
by defensive back Eric Brown and was taken off the field on a stretcher with 
what was preliminarily diagnosed as a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
His replacement, Randy Calhoun, had a rough time as well. He was sacked seven 
times, four times by defensive end Matt Deller. Gahr managed just 80 yards 
total offense and just four first downs in the game.

Serious Issue: Dan Quayle briefly considered running for President in 1988. In 
an interview in the Baltimore Sun, Quayle said: "I think Marilyn and I had a 
one-minute conversation one time whether I would even perhaps, maybe, sometime 
run myself in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And in this one-minute conversation, I just dismissed it, said no, not this 
time. George Bush is there; we'd have to take two years away from the family." 
</P>
<P>
Right Reception: Sen. Ted Kennedy showed up Tuesday night at the Heritage 
Foundation, that bunker of conservatism, but it wasn't anything sinister, and 
Kennedy wasn't bolting his party. He attended a reception for conservative 
columnist Cal Thomas' new book, "Uncommon Sense." Kennedy once signed one of 
Thomas' books, "Cal Thomas usually says the far right thing instead of the 
right thing, but I like reading him anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Big Stick: Syndicated columnist Jack Anderson is now seen about town, 
especially near his offices downtown, carrying a walking stick. It isn't an 
affectation or meant to help him walk. Anderson was mugged last month and 
robbed of $100 in the mid-afternoon near his office; the cane, with a heavy 
brass handle, is his equalizer. 
</P>

Driven to Expand: Gourmet stores will no longer be the only place to get 
Chrysler Corp. chief Lee Iacocca's olive oil. Villa Nicola oil, made from 
olives from the Iacocca family estate in the Tuscany section of Italy, will be 
mass distributed later this month. "What started out as a hobby, a labor of 
love . . . quickly grew into a project that requires the efforts of the entire 
family," said a company spokesman.

<P>
Re "Crime Fears Cramp New Yorkers' Style" (Sept. 16): It's not the city. It's 
the nation. New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago -- over the years the 
nation has grown mean, and, by extension, (so have) its people. 
</P>
<P>
I'm 55 years old, part American Indian. This is my country. I spent 15 years in 
the civil rights movement. I caught a freedom bus in 1960 and went to look for 
America. Meridian, Birmingham, Jackson, Chicago in '68 -- this wasn't the 
America I read about. 
</P>
<P>
And it has grown worse. Children starve, old people have no dignity. No food. 
No homes. Next month, I'm outta here -- putting my van, my cooking equipment, 
my body on a boat to Europe, and my dreams. I plan to open a restaurant in 
Prague and call it the American Dream -- anyone's welcome. Nothing to leave 
behind, except a note on the door: Gone to Czechoslovakia. Gone to look for 
America.

TWO OPINIONS ON NAVY'S SEAL TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Nora Zamichow's series on the Navy SEALs, I, like the men 
described at the conclusion of the story, was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
I have heard that it is considered quite an accomplishment to have become a 
SEAL; however, until now, I never knew what it took to achieve such an 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
The excruciating pain, both physical and emotional, these men endured should 
humble the most powerful of men. For true power is not in how much money, 
prestige or influence one has; rather, it is in courage, strength, perseverance 
and humility. 
</P>
<P>
The men who joined the SEAL program are the epitome of this description, and 
those who survived the seemingly insurmountable completion of "Hell Week" are 
beyond adjectives. They are miracles.

Guess Who's in Town? 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, looks are everything. Watch what happens when Claudia Schiffer 
graces L.A. in the flesh today. She's the Guess Girl (the baby Bardot of 
voluptuous pulchritude who appears in the Guess? jeans ads). Tonight she's 
scheduled to tape the Rick Dees show. Saturday her dance card is filled with 
appearances at three Robinson's stores (Santa Ana at 11 a.m., Del Amo at 1 p.m. 
and Puente Hills at 4 p.m.) pushing the new Guess fragrance -- Guess Parfum, 
$65 for .25 ounces. Saturday night, an intimate soiree has been planned at 
Arena for Claudia and 8,000 of her closest fans. Her appearance at Macy's in 
Manhattan drew 2,500 people, the third-largest celeb/scent crowd to date, 
surpassed only by the turnouts for Elizabeth Taylor and Cher. Not a bad stat 
for a 20-year-old German lass whose only claim to fame is those lips, those 
eyes and those ads.

NO-SHOWS: New York designer Charlotte Neuville has canceled her spring fashion 
show, usually held during October press week, and will donate a substantial 
portion of what a show costs ($50,000 to $100,000) to the care of AIDS 
patients. More reason to believe the fashion system is headed toward endangered 
species status: Last spring, London's Rifat Ozbek played a videotape of his 
newest styles. Giorgio Armani started this anti-show trend in the mid-'80s when 
he displayed his collection on hangers. Some designers say it is in reaction to 
the high cost of showing. Others say they're tired of the circus-like excess of 
typical presentations.

MAKES CENTS TO US: Maybe everybody else thinks it's odd that Cartier now has 
two stores on the same street, but Ralph Destino, Cartier chairman, does not. 
At a Tuesday night party for the opening of the new, smaller boutique, he 
pointed out that there are two Cartier stores on Fifth Avenue in New York, two 
more at Place Vendome in Paris, and now two on Rodeo Drive.

MAKING THE SHOPPING LIST: Teri Garr cruised by Ice at the Beverly Center, 
looking for something to wear on the talk show circuit; she's promoting her new 
film "Waiting for the Light." She waltzed out with a Carmelo Pomodoro ivory 
blouse and bronze-colored sarong skirt. Also spotted flipping through the 
hangers was Bridget Fonda (daughter of Peter). She left with a black wool 
pantsuit from Ice's private label collection.

THE MURDERER NEXT DOOR BY RAFAEL YGLESIAS; CROWN $19.95; 282 PAGES;

ADOPTION, A KILLING, A LIFE IN RUINS

<TEXT>
<P>
A bizarre court case was recently written up in which a transvestite man was 
indicted for the murder of his wife but retained legal custody of their young 
daughter. In "The Murderer Next Door," Rafael Yglesias has recast the story as 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Penetrating the disordered mind of the accused would be difficult enough, but 
the author has compounded the challenge by using a female voice throughout -- 
the victim's closest friend. The first person narrator is Molly Gray, a Maine 
lobsterman's daughter, who was virtually adopted at the age of 8 by a summer 
visitor impressed with the child's beauty and precocious intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Unstintingly loved, cared for and educated by Naomi Perlman, who transported 
her from a squalid house trailer to the warmth of a sophisticated Manhattan 
milieu, Molly willingly relinquishes her own bleak heritage and devotes herself 
to fulfilling Naomi's expectations for her. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, Molly is already established as a lawyer. The rigorous 
journey from grim past to successful present has provided her with an 
assortment of colleagues, acquaintances and admirers but no close friends until 
she meets Wendy Sonnenfeld at a Soho loft party. The gap in Molly's life closes 
instantly, and from that night on, the two young women are inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy is trusting, undirected and artistic, while Molly is skeptical, driven 
and purposeful. The friendship becomes a mutual benefit society of two, giving 
the dilettantish Wendy direction, and thawing Molly's austerity. 
</P>
<P>
Within a short time, Molly meets and marries a sweetly undemanding 
psychiatrist. Yearning for a husband and family of her own, Wendy precipitously 
follows suit, settling for the physically gross and domineering stockbroker Ben 
Fliess. Though Molly's gentle husband Stefan clearly doesn't care for Ben's 
blustery coarseness, he offers only token resistance when Wendy and Ben buy an 
adjoining apartment. Childless herself, Molly is enchanted when Wendy and Ben 
make her the godmother of their baby daughter and name the child Naomi in 
memory of Molly's benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator's tranquil marriage forms a bland background for the volatile 
relationship of Wendy and Ben Fliess. As time goes on, Ben becomes increasingly 
abrasive, abusive and irascible, humiliating his wife in public and frequently 
abandoning his family for days at a time. One evening when the child is still 
an infant, Molly glimpses Ben in the apartment laundry room, dressed in womens' 
underwear. Her free-floating anxiety for her friend turns to specific, acute 
fear for her safety and that of the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Her curiosity leads her to Ben's old bachelor apartment, which he has never 
given up and now apparently uses for his clandestine trysts. Despite grave 
misgivings, Molly tells Wendy of these discoveries. Like any good 
psychiatrist's wife, Molly naively believes that Ben could be helped by therapy 
and would agree to seek it once his secret was known. The Fliess family then 
leaves for their country house, and when Ben and the child eventually return, 
Molly learns that her friend has been brutally murdered, the bludgeoned body 
found in a dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
The appalling facts are delivered in the same controlled tone in which we've 
learned Molly Gray's own history -- the precise, neutral voice of a 
well-schooled lawyer. Once the murder is revealed and Ben is indicted, Molly 
begins to lose that equilibrium. Ben is released on bail and permitted to take 
charge of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Molly's interest in the child's welfare becomes an all-consuming 
passion, driving her to ever more reckless acts. Telling herself that she must 
stay close to her godchild in order to protect her, Molly becomes deeply 
involved with Ben Fliess, straining her own marriage to the breaking point. 
Though she insists she's disgusted by Ben, her revulsion is actually 
fascination, which in turn becomes aberrant obsession. 
</P>
<P>
By the time this complex story ends, the careful structure of Molly Gray's life 
is in ruins; the rational self she has assembled reduced to fragments. After a 
measured beginning, "The Murderer Next Door" becomes a chillingly plausible 
psychodrama, a headlong plunge into the whirlpool of the narrator's emotions.

MUSICAL: 'JEROME ROBBINS' BROADWAY' BRINGS BACK THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY AND 
REDISCOVERY OF THE CHOREOGRAPHER'S CLASSIC WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there is an inevitable thread of nostalgia that insinuates itself into the 
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway" that opened Wednesday at the Century City Shubert, 
but not because director/choreographer Robbins put it there. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who mined his own lifetime achievement on Broadway to re-create some 
of his best numbers for this all-singing, all-dancing archival collage of his 
work, is not averse to sentimentality. He uses it liberally -- in the 
"Somewhere" ballet from his suite of dances from "West Side Story" (1957), in 
the tender "I Still Get Jealous" duet from "High Button Shoes" (1947) and even 
in the glittering final ode to a Broadway-that-once-was in "Some Other Time" 
and "New York, New York" (from "On the Town," 1944). 
</P>
<P>
But nostalgia in the case of this show enters strictly through the front door 
-- with the audience. Older patrons will tune into their own past experience, 
while younger ones will have the thrill of discovering a mixture of verve and 
classiness rarely equalled in Broadway dancing any more. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' re-creation of 14 excerpts from shows spanning some 20 years on 
Broadway is much too vigorous and brash to be classed as nostalgic. The 
immediacy, even urgency of the dance, which originally took 22 weeks to 
rehearse, has the freshness of new mintings based on old blueprints -- a 
testament to the tremendous abilities of the director/choreographer and the 
durability of his work. 
</P>
<P>
A spectacular tribute by scenic designer Robin Wagner occurs at the end, when 
the stage is illuminated by all the titles of the Robbins' Broadway canon up in 
lights as the sailors from "On the Town" wander down the Great White Way. But 
it's the cherry on the cake, a moment topped only by the still unmatched finale 
of Michael Bennett's "A Chorus Line." 
</P>
<P>
What really counts is what has gone before it: the comical inventions in Act 
One of the "Charleston" number from the Comden and Green/Morton Gould 1945 
"Billion Dollar Baby," one of Robbins' earliest show biz ventures -- and the 
fluid patchwork of dances from "West Side Story" whose artful tensions have 
lost only a little of their vernacular pertinence and nerve. 
</P>
<P>
For all the quaintness of its presumptions, "The Small House of Uncle Thomas" 
from "The King and I" (1951) that launches the second act is something of a 
dazzler for the imaginative marriage of conventions that it represents: a tale 
of the American South told in a dance vocabulary borrowed from Thailand. It's 
all in how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
For this theatergoer the greater rewards in this choreographic compendium come 
in the purely comic capers such as "Charleston," and they reach their peak in 
the visual acrobatics of the second act's "On a Sunday by the Sea." This 
Keystone Kop high-speed chase equivalent from "High Button Shoes," with 
bathers, thieves, cops and even a gorilla darting in and out of beach cabins 
and narrowly missing each other, makes the flying sequences from "Peter Pan" 
(1954) look easy. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because strong recent revivals have made them familiar, "You Gotta Have 
a Gimmick" from "Gypsy" (1959) and "Comedy Tonight" from "A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum" (1962) come across as the weaker links in 
this chain of accomplishments. The same with the well-engineered compressions 
of "Fiddler on the Roof" that are ego-massaging but not nearly as remarkable 
here as in the full context of the musical. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Debbie Shapiro's torchy rendition of "Mr. Monotony," an Irving 
Berlin song cut in pre-Broadway tryouts from both "Miss Liberty" in 1949 and 
"Call Me Madam" in 1950, seems much more seasoned than it was when seen early 
in the New York run. Though it is now a proper standout, particularly since the 
pretentious pas-de-deux that accompanied it on Broadway has mercifully been 
dropped, it still feels more like a discrete audience concession than a part of 
the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a singer's show. "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" is entirely about dance 
and, despite a strong leader in Tony Roberts who takes us through the numbers, 
a stylish simplicity of design and a splendid ensemble, it has only one star: 
the director/choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
We've come a certain way since "Fiddler," Robbins' last Broadway fling before 
he entered the more rarefied halls of serious dance, but what progress was 
afoot owed much to him and has been all but stopped in its tracks. Such 
columinaries or inheritors of his tradition -- the Michael Bennetts, Gower 
Champions and Bob Fosses -- are no longer with us. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins reminds us at once of the tremendous playfulness and exhilaration 
possible in a certain kind of Broadway idiom and of how few people are left who 
can still deliver it. What you get in the end at "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" 
more than meets the eye: It re-awakens it.

Free-Market Bolshoi: A touring ballet company that will exist on ticket sales 
alone has been formed, announced artistic director Yuri Grigorovich in New York 
on Thursday. The 60-member group, named Bolshoi Ballet Grigorovich Company, 
will be independent of any government funding and will be made up of young 
dancers graduating from the leading ballet academies in the Soviet Union. It 
makes its debut appearance at Texas A&amp;M University on Nov. 23, with 
Grigorovich's "Nutcracker," followed by a five-city tour. BETH KLEID

'MR. DESTINY'S' VIEWERS DESERVE A BETTER FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near the opening of "Mr. Destiny" (citywide), Michael Caine as Mr. D. himself, 
must explain to ordinary guy James Belushi that what is and what might have 
been are, well, you might just say fated, but "That's how destiny works -- very 
subtly." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for moviegoers, very subtly is not how "Mr. Destiny" works. It's 
an attempt at fantasy so plodding that by its end it feels as though we'd 
walked the 20 years back to Belushi's past, then hacked our way out of it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
It's roughly the 83rd "if-only" sports movie: if only our hero had caught it, 
ducked it, dunked it, swung at it, not swung at it or sat on it . . . his life 
would have been completely different. If only these movies would be. 
</P>
<P>
Filmmakers James Orr and Jim Cruickshank, who co-wrote "Three Men and a Baby" 
and between them bear full responsibility for this soggy cruller, lay the blame 
for Belushi's present mundane life on his high school baseball championship 
strike-out. Now, at 35, he's a small cog in a sporting equipment empire where 
his wife Linda Hamilton is the union shop steward. The business is in danger of 
a take-over by insider shark Hart Bochner 
</P>
<P>
After the worst day in Belushi's life, he has one of bartender Mr. Destiny's 
drinks -- the Spilt Milk -- and is transported to a far, far better past, one 
where TV sitcom rules of class and caste apply. So Belushi finds himself 
married to the boss's daughter, Rene Russo and living in "Being There's" 
baronial mansion and the movie's arch and curiously dated humor comes from what 
the filmmakers call their Everyguy, wandering around his ritzy digs, goggling 
at the behavior of the swells. 
</P>
<P>
His English butler will not know what Belushi wants when he asks for "the can" 
and will turn the word brewski over disdainfully in his mouth. Belushi's two 
young kids -- mysteriously non-existent in his "real" life -- and his wife 
attend the op-er-ah, wearing velvet togetherness outfits like those families in 
mall photographer's Mother's Day studies. 
</P>
<P>
You can keep yourself awake by brooding about the fate of these kids in the 
time-travel switchback, but the only real spark to this infinite affair comes 
from Linda Hamilton's intrinsic warmth and from art director Catherine 
Hardwicke. She and set decorator Karen Steward created Caine's splendid 
nostalgic bar and The Golf of Mexico, a miniature golf course so hilarious 
it'll probably be in theme parks before Christmas. However the movie, whose 
pinnacle of self-discovery is, "I guess I just didn't know what I had," is a 
destiny to be avoided at all costs.

'ROXY' GOES FROM WILD TO WARMTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael" (citywide) isn't truly terrible, it's truly 
confused. It's as though director Jim Abrahams wanted to do heartfelt 
comedy-drama but couldn't quite shake off the wicked edge of his alma mater, 
ZAZ: Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker, the dementos behind "Airplane!" and "The Naked 
Gun." 
</P>
<P>
So on the satiric front we watch the modest town of Clyde, Ohio, turning itself 
inside out while it awaits the triumphant return of its 30-year-old prodigal 
Roxy Carmichael, who is coming back after 15 years in Hollywood to dedicate the 
Roxy Carmichael Center for Cosmetology and Drama. Reverential tours are being 
conducted through the place where Roxy spent her Wonder Years. Roxy's modest 
birthplace is deeply pink, from her pink refrigerator-cum-closet to the pink 
wrapping on her Almond Rocas, the most heavily plugged candy since E.T. ate 
that trail of Reese's Pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The town's ladies are outdoing each other buying and squeezing into garish 
clothes for the Roxy Ball. Jeff Daniels, whom Roxy "married" when she was 10 
and who fathered their baby when she was 15, is a very nervous man. Now 
properly married and the father of two, he is beset with enough what-ifs to 
drive his wife (Joan McMurtrey) crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the movie's joke is that no one can quite say why Roxy is so famous. We 
can see, from faceless glimpses of her skinny-dipping in her pool, that she's 
cellulite-free enough to be an extra on "Lucky / Chances." Yet Roxy is not an 
actress, a singer or a dancer. She did inspire a song, and inspire its 
singer-songwriter to the point of giving her the rights before she left him. 
Beyond that, her fame seems to come from being famous. 
</P>
<P>
So far, pretty funny. Mean in spots, peculiar in others -- but funny. But 
"Welcome Home" is really about Dinky Bossetti (Winona Ryder), a wise, brilliant 
high school misfit who wears all-black and glowers at the world from under her 
bangs. It's another of the all-purpose Winona Ryder roles, which are beginning 
to fit her like a straitjacket. After "Square Dance," it was clear she could do 
almost anything; it would be nice if someone would let her out to try. The 
bubble-gum bride from "Great Balls of Fire" wasn't it. 
</P>
<P>
But while Dinky is being Herself, the endangered adolescent, Abrahams and the 
film's screenwriter, Karen Leigh Hopkins, have to shift the movie's gears. Now 
it's no longer the world of wild pink satire but a warmer, more caring place to 
be. Dinky's so prescient she knows just what her nifty guidance counselor 
(Laila Robins) should do with her life, and so shockingly original she attracts 
the most interesting boy in town (Thomas Wilson Brown). Now we have to worry 
about Dinky's heart being broken by Roxy, who she's decided is her real mother. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this Dinky drama, Clyde and its citizens remain wild caricatures; no 
matter how good and how hard-working the film's actors are -- and they're fine 
-- the slippage is too great. "It's good to want things" is the movie's 
peculiar ad line; is it too much to want a little consistency?

JAZZ NOTES: BRITT/BROWN QUINTET STILL FIDDLIN' AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What started out as a six-week gig at a jazz brunch has turned out to be one of 
the longest-running engagements in town for the Pat Britt-Wilbur Brown quintet. 
Sunday, the fivesome celebrates its fifth year at the Cat and Fiddle Pub and 
Restaurant in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we started Oct. 10," said Britt, a tall alto saxophonist with a 
resilient tone. "A friend, saxophonist Bo Svensson, was a chef there." He 
brought Cat and Fiddle owners Kim and Paula Gardner over to the defunct North 
Hollywood jazz room Donte's to hear the group, "and Kim hired us for this 
brunch. 
</P>
<P>
"We started outside on the patio, playing from 1-4 p.m. (The band nows plays 
7-11 p.m.) It was supposed to be for six weeks, and when the weather got darker 
and colder, Kim said, 'Instead of quitting, why don't you just move inside?' " 
So Britt and Brown found a home: a small side room off the Cat and Fiddle's 
main bar and dining room during the winter, and the establishment's pleasant 
patio in warmer climes. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the anniversary, Britt and Brown -- a house-rocking tenor 
saxophonist who has played with jazz greats Kenny Dorham, Lionel Hampton and 
the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra and R&amp;Ber Lloyd Price -- will 
invite some friends in for a party. In addition to regular quintet members Pat 
Senatore (bass), Dwight Dickerson (piano) and Clarence Johnston (drums), Britt 
will enlist Svensson (baritone saxophone), Jerry Rusch (trumpet) and Dick Rinde 
(trombone) to enliven the proceedings. "We'll be playing our usual stuff -- 
blues, ballads, be-bop -- but there'll just be a bigger sound." 
</P>
<P>
One tune the band will definitely play is Miles Davis' "All Blues," which has 
become a sort of anthem for the band: It's the tune that Kim Gardner, a rock 
'n' roll bassist from Britain before he entered the restaurant trade, always 
plays on. "One day we were playing it and he sat in, and it's become a weekly 
tradition," said Britt. 
</P>
<P>
Britt and Brown have known each other since the early '60s when Britt, an 
up-and-coming Bay Area hornman, met Brown, an L.A. native who spent a good 
portion of the '60s in New York City, at a session. "We just started hanging 
out, and when he came down to this gig I had in San Mateo, he tore the place 
apart," Britt said. "We didn't see each for about 15 years when he was in 
Manhattan, but when we ran into each other again here in the '70s, we formed a 
band on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Britt sees his partner as the high point of each week's performance. "I love 
playing with Wilbur, learning from him," Britt said. "He can turn any 
situation, no matter how glum, into something beautiful, musically." 
</P>
<P>
LISTON BENEFIT: Earlier Sunday, the Britt-Brown quintet will join Randy Weston, 
Cedar Walton, Buddy Collette, Harold Land, the Cunninghams and many others in a 
benefit for trombonist-composer-arranger Melba Liston, the L.A. native who 
spent a good deal of her career in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The affair for Liston, who has played with and/or written for Dizzy Gillespie, 
Count Basie, Quincy Jones and the Supremes, will be held at the Proud Bird 
Ballroom, 11022 Aviation Blvd., at 2 p.m. Proceeds will help purchase 
computerized music composing and arranging equipment to aid Liston, who 
suffered a stroke in January and has not fully regained the use of her hands, 
as well as to offset her medical expenses. Minimum donation: $10. Information: 
(213) 462-5207. 
</P>
<P>
RIM SHOT: Rollickingly pianist Dorothy Donegan, plus saxman Teddy Edwards and 
singer Lorez Alexandria, highlight a concert Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Myron's 
Ballroom, 1024 S. Grand Ave. Information: (213) 351-1595.

NEW BEADLES WINS UNCLE JACK'S OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My Uncle Jack, a retired management wizard who now consults all over the world, 
is furious that the old Beadles Cafeteria in Pasadena is gone. "That place had 
atmosphere and history, and when you get to be my age, you appreciate those 
things. Not everything has to be brand spanking new." When I told him that the 
whole block had been torn down, he winced. "You kids used to love that long 
wooden corridor you had to walk through to get your tray," he said. "You used 
to call it the monster's tunnel. You remember that?" I did. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I want to go to a new Beadles for?" he kept ranting. "I know what 
happens when restaurants move and remodel. They get an inflated view of 
themselves. They hike up the prices. They cut corners on quality. They've got 
loans to pay off, contractors to settle with. And who do you think absorbs 
those costs? Who else? You and me and all the pensioners, that's who." 
</P>
<P>
His mood didn't improve any when I pulled up into the parking structure under 
Beadles' new building -- gone was the old parking lot with its familiar staff 
of valets who gallantly escorted the elderly and infirm to the cafeteria door. 
"I always lose my car in these places," he grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
The elevator door slid open to a bright new room. Gone were the ravelled edges, 
the years of cooking smells, all the oldness. Still, this well-lit, 
spanking-new hall was unmistakably Beadles. You know how we could tell? By the 
food and the service, and by the clientele. 
</P>
<P>
New green signboards announced the day's menu in easy-to-read white letters. 
Still entrenched were the turkeys and roasts and hams carved on the spot, the 
poached salmon steaks and the chicken croquettes, the lamb stew, egg foo young, 
baked beans. . . . The assortment may vary day to day, but the basic flavor 
never shifts; this is the food so many of us were raised on -- homeland, 
heartland food. PTA potluck food, church social food, grandma's food. June 
Cleaver's personal repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
We threaded our way through the new wooden maze. As I took a tray and a bundle 
of silver rolled in a napkin, I became aware of a pressure just under my left 
shoulder blade. It was Uncle Jack's elbow nudging me along. He had his eye on 
the last wedge of what we've always called jewel Jell-O: multicolored Jell-O 
cubes suspended in a sour cream-lemon Jell-O base. The server was just coming 
to help us, but Uncle Jack's arm snaked in and snagged his prize before she got 
there. 
</P>
<P>
I was already suffering with my standard Beadles' malady -- indecision. I love 
Beadles' short ribs more than anything else offered, but they only appear once 
in a blue moon. When there are no short ribs, I have to decide among a dozen 
other offerings, and if I'm not up to the task I always settle for the same 
thing: a consistently definitive macaroni and cheese and whatever vegetable is 
fresh, not frozen. I thought fast and picked the salmon steak. And macaroni and 
cheese. Uncle Jack took a plate of very rare roast beef and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"See, Uncle Jack," I said as we sat down. "The prices haven't gone up. The 
food's the same." 
</P>
<P>
He frowned and grudgingly agreed. "Yeah. They must have gotten some kind of 
redevelopment subsidy to build this place." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever complexity may be lacking in Beadles' food, is amply compensated for 
in Beadles' clientele. Here, as in the old Beadles, the Human Comedy plays 
nonstop, seven days a week, but the light's brighter, all the better to see 
that there are families of every size and color, old couples, dating couples, 
and odd couples. There's Mr. RTD drinking his coffee reading his romance 
novels, and displaying his thick stacks of bus schedules. There are hairdos 
from the '40s and hairdos from Mars. There are ancient dapper gents and elegant 
older ladies and young babies throwing spoons on the floor. In one evening at 
Beadles, I see my English teacher from the seventh grade and a famous artist 
whose work I've always admired. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Jack and I ate in silence, except for the clattering of skirmishing forks 
when he tried to spear a chunk of my truly delicious salmon. His roast beef was 
blood rare and helped out by horseradish. The Jell-O was sweet, the macaroni 
and cheese just the bit of childhood heaven it always was. Uncle Jack downed a 
slice of gooseberry pie, went to get us some coffee and came back with a huge 
wedge of Boston Cream Pie. "For a buck twenty-five, I couldn't pass it up," he 
said. He sat, leaned across the table, and whispered, "You know, this place 
gets a few years on it, a little patina of age, and it'll be as good as ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Beadles, 825 E. Green St., Pasadena, (818) 796-3618. Open daily 11 a.m. to 
7:45 p.m. No credit cards accepted, check or cash only. No alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>

baked salmon, $7.50.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: SAKANA: ELEGANCE IN WHITE GLOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sakana Club, 11600 San Vicente Blvd., Los Angeles (213) 447-7777, ignores 
the local bistro-trattoria trend and gives Los Angeles something not often 
found in new restaurants: elegant dining. White-gloved waiters set the tables 
with pricey crystal, silver and china. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room -- gutted and remodeled three times until the owners were 
happy, a waiter confided -- is modern and discreet, with an expensive Diva 
light carefully placed to hang over each table. Set in one wall are three glass 
panels of silently bubbling water -- it's like a giant-size executive toy from 
the Sharper Image catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
A glass panel in another wall reveals Sakana Club's pristine kitchen. The chefs 
working inside prepare elegant Japanese-French food. There are several delicate 
fish preparations, blood-rare duck breast with peppercorns and a few beef 
dishes, including a steak appetizer. The chef, Shigefusa Oku, ran several 
restaurants in Japan, and the pastry chef, Elmer Azuma is known to L.A. diners 
from his food at Truffles and Chabuya. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are at the high end, but at lunch there is a mini-kaiseki meal for $18 
(actually it's more like a bento-box lunch) that is a bargain considering the 
variety and quality of the food you get. If you call ahead, the chef will 
customize a seven-course dinner that will run $35 to $75 per person. LAURIE

<P>
A WHIRLWIND TOUR OF GEOMETRIC ABSTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geometry has the same pristine appeal for certain abstract artists that a field 
of new-fallen snow has for a child. The perfection of geometric art stands 
apart from the flaws and accidents of the real world. And the artist remains in 
full control, bidding line, space and color to resonate with spiritual meaning 
or wink with subtle perceptual trickery. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibit of geometric abstraction from the last 40 years by 20 American 
artists offers a whirlwind exposure to distinctive personal styles, from 
super-cool to hot-cha. Although the crasser forms of Neo-Geo are conspicuously 
absent, some of the younger artists give the pious tradition of geometric art a 
good kick in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
Influenced by Mondrian, Russian-born Ilya Bolotowsky evoked spatial equipoise 
by pitting numerous small horizontal and vertical bars of primary color against 
one another. Looking at his "Golden Tondo II," the eye works to straighten out 
a lurching vertical cushioned by a busy matrix of colored lines. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mangold's cerebral, reticent pieces also deal with alterations to the 
geometric norm. In "Square Within Rectangle (Blue Gray)," a white pencil line 
describes a misfit square that wanders off one edge of a light-blue painted 
rectangle, as if to acknowledge a world beyond the immaculate confines of 
geometry. 
</P>
<P>
John McLaughlin's uncompromising compositions of rectangular blocks on a 
rectangular field were ways of picturing emptiness, the sustaining void of 
Eastern mysticism. On the white ground of an untitled painting from 1951, a 
spare arrangement of small black bars of varying lengths and widths hovers 
sympathetically alongside a black rectangle. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the old guard include Joseph Albers, who persistently 
investigated the theme of color perception with his concentric color squares; 
Gene Davis, who specializes in rhythmically energized vertical sequences of 
color bands and lines; and Al Held, who turns geometry into a sci-fi landscape 
in "Geocentric I." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most quietly delicious pieces are Sean Scully's horizontally striped 
black square, revealing subtle shadings of rose and green, and Dorothea 
Rockburne's "Melancholia," a cut-out rectangle and triangle made of 
lithographed translucent paper, which cling forlornly to one another on a vast 
sheet of white paper. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the younger generation. Jim Iserman's untitled square piece 
has a square cut-out in the middle and an eye-popping circular pattern in noisy 
greens, pink and orange that gleefully shoves Pop Art down Minimalism's throat. 
In Mary Heilman's "Red Wave," a ragged, tortuously over-painted duo of right 
angled forms straggles over a white field, plaintively recalling stubbornly -- 
humanly -- irregular behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Richards Gallery, 2114 Broadway, Santa Monica, to Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Yuppie Geometry: Andrew Spence has no truck with spiritual matters, perceptual 
games or the meaning of art. His reworkings of the geometry of daily life are 
briskly elegant and down to earth at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic Circle" is a chunky black-and-white circle on a red ground; in "Garden 
Painting" a strict blue-on-white grid guards a central square of fresh green 
turf. Other large, cheerfully outgoing abstract paintings evoke the shapes of a 
basketball backboard, a race track, a stepladder, a tent and a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
In this medium-cool work, the act of painting obviously counts, even if it 
doesn't attain show-off status. You can see the traces of brushwork and 
perceive the pleasure involved in setting down one vivid color neatly next to 
another -- rather like a wistful throwback to Crayola days. 
</P>
<P>
The subject matter also exudes a sort of gung-ho yuppie mood, an abstracted 
edition of scrubbed L.L. Bean catalogue verities. Spence's world seems to be a 
bright realm of good sports, green thumbs and social harmony, served up in the 
preppie primary colors of old school ties. 
</P>
<P>
 James Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., Santa Monica, to Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Neutral Observer: German artist Thomas Ruff has perfected a way of making art 
that reveals absolutely nothing about himself and as little as possible about 
his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
He has made strictly frontal Cibachrome photographs of house exteriors that 
reduce each one to the flatly minimal terms of exterior walls, grass and sky. 
His Ektacolor portraits of attractive young men and women -- some of which are 
included in this exhibition -- resemble gigantic passport photos, taken at a 
moment when no one was blinking, smiling or registering the slightest 
perceptible emotion. 
</P>
<P>
These are faces telegraphing neither beauty nor ugliness, faces that lack 
identifying marks or blemishes. Other than obvious indicators of race, age and 
sex -- and possibly class (as a function of grooming) -- these people tell us 
nothing whatsoever about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Ruff has taken on the universe. His "Sterne" (Star) series 
consists of mammoth Ektacolor photographs of the night sky. In a simulacrum of 
scientific method, each image is labeled with the exact time of day and the 
position of the sky on the celestial sphere. 
</P>
<P>
All notions of "the sublime" -- that 19th-Century posture of awe at the 
grandeur of the cosmos -- are effectively stamped out. The blurry, blown-up 
stars look as insubstantial as flecks of lint on the black rectangles of sky, 
and arbitrary cropping makes it difficult to locate the constellations. This 
may well be the ultimate test of Ruff's method: light-produced images of real 
luminous heavenly bodies that exist as Platonic images, too utterly abstract 
for words. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Regen Gallery, 619 N. Almont Drive, to Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Dance of Life: What can a photograph say about a dance? How can a still image 
represent a work of art meaningless without movement? "Framing the Magic 
Circle," an exhibit organized by dance ethnologist Irene Borger, asks lots of 
provocative questions, gaily side-steps pat categories, and offers a blizzard 
of images in various media: professionals on stage, in film and in the studio; 
amateurs on dance floors, at home and outdoors; and the densely personal 
pictographs and charts some dance-makers have devised to put choreography on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a few of the photographs were made by "recognized" artists, like George 
Platt Lynes (elegantly lit photographs from the early days of American ballet) 
and Robert Longo (lithographed images of young urban women in the intense 
postures of contemporary social dancing). 
</P>
<P>
But the works as a group are absorbing primarily because of the expansive 
notion they give of what dancing is, who dancers are, how photographs lie and 
how dependent we are on context and external cues. The smart way of looking 
suggested by this show is offered as a friendly gift, not a highbrow lecture, 
and that is rare indeed.

NORTH STARS RALLY TO TIE BRUINS

Mike Modano scored the tying goal on a rink-length rush with 9:42 left in the 
third period Thursday night at Bloomington, Minn., and the Minnesota North 
Stars rallied for a 3-3 tie with the Boston Bruins, ending the Bruins' 
season-opening four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Modano, the top pick in the 1988 draft, also had two assists as the North Stars 
overcame a 3-0 deficit early in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins were the only unbeaten, untied team in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Jeremy Roenick had the first hat trick in the NHL 
this season as the Blackhawks beat the Penguins at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Roenick scored twice in a 1:55 span in the first period and then knocked in the 
rebound off Steve Larmer's 25-foot shot with less than six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 7, New Jersey 4 -- Jiri Latal scored twice in the Flyers' 
three-goal first period at Philadelphia, but the victory could prove costly as 
goaltender Ron Hextall left the game with a pulled back muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall, who missed most of last season with injuries, left with 3:06 remaining 
in the second period.

<P>
Denver Nugget Coach Paul Westhead's run-and gun style that he used at Loyola 
Marymount backfired as the Phoenix Suns routed the Nuggets, 186-123, in the NBA 
exhibition opener for both teams Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix rookie forward Cedric Ceballos, who made all 12 of his field-goal 
attempts, scored 29 points and Eddie Johnson added 27 for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, a second-round draft pick out of Cal State Fullerton, scored 18 
points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most points the Suns have scored in any game in their 23-year 
history. Their regular-season team record is 160, set against Portland on March 
21, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, whose regular-season team record for points in one half is 91 set 
Nov. 1, 1984 against Portland, led 89-64 at halftime despite missing 22 of 
their 50 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Denver committed 48 personal fouls, and Phoenix made 52 of 71 free-throw 
attempts.

Six players scored touchdowns for Buena High and the defense limited San Marcos 
to two first downs through three quarters in a 41-10 Channel League football 
win Thursday in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (2-4, 2-1 in league play) used three quarterbacks and amassed 441 yards 
in handing San Marcos (2-4, 2-1) its first league loss. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Seguine, who directed Buena's first three possessions, scored 
on a keeper with 10 minutes 9 seconds left in the first half to give Buena a 
6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dexter engineered the next drive, which Chuck Mullaney capped with a 
two-yard run that helped extend the lead to 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Buena scored second-half touchdowns on a 13-yard pass from Dexter to Prieto, a 
66-yard run by George Keiaho, a 74-yard run by Matt Kemsley, and Sean Popken's 
37-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Kemsley carried nine times for 108 yards and Keiaho gained 106 yards in 10 
carries for Buena. Dexter (five of seven for 60 yards), Seguine (three of three 
for 17 yards) and junior Matt Ertman (one of one for 18 yards) combined to 
complete nine of 11 passes for 95 yards and a touchdown.

THE BIG GAME / MIRA MESA-POINT LOMA; 
</P>
<P>
LOSER LIKELY TO LEAVE CITY EASTERN PICTURE

<P>
It's only the first week of league play, but it's already rush hour in the City 
Eastern League. Three teams are in a bottleneck jockeying to take the lead, and 
one will give ground today when the annual Point Loma-Mira Mesa rivalry resumes 
at Point Loma (3 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are undefeated -- Mira Mesa is 5-0, Point Loma 4-0 -- as is Morse 
(5-0). 
</P>
<P>
Morse, ranked No. 1 in the county, plays at 2-A Kearny tonight and is favored 
to win. For Mira Mesa, ranked No. 2, or Point Loma, No. 3, a victory today is a 
prerequisite for winning the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Point Loma pulled out a 27-24 victory when quarterback Danny White 
converted on fourth-and-10 to sustain a scoring drive late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
White is gone, and so too is most of the offense at Point Loma. The Pointers 
have scored only 60 points, averaging 15 per game. But their defense has 
recorded two shutouts (against Lincoln and El Camino) and allowed only seven 
points each to No. 4 Helix and No. 5 Rancho Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, our defense has out-shown our offense," Point Loma Coach Bennie Edens 
said. "We have good speed (on defense), we hit hard and have some outstanding 
football players." 
</P>
<P>
Two stand out. They are defensive ends and brothers, LaRoi (6-feet-2, 265 
pounds) and Darcel Glover (6-2, 220). They are the reason teams can't run 
against the Point Loma defense. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Pointers will attempt to stop the two-pronged attack of Wayne 
Pittman (71 carries, 884 yards) and Robby Edwards (52 carries, 493 yards). 
</P>
<P>
And despite his team's success against the run, Edens said he remains concerned 
with these two, especially Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Division I running back," Edens said. "If you're going to stop him, you 
better play good defense, have strong pursuit and a lot of people in the area." 
</P>
<P>
But if Pittman breaks through for even one touchdown, it could put the game out 
of reach for Point Loma. That's because Point Loma's young offense will 
continue its learning process against the No. 1-ranked defense in the county. 
Mira Mesa has allowed only 10 points in five games and recorded three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
The rub against Mira Mesa is that it has yet to play a ranked team. Until 
today.

A rainbow-colored flag intended to honor gays and lesbians briefly flew over 
the state Capitol, but it was soon ordered taken down by Gov. George 
Deukmejian's office. Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), whose district 
contains a large number of gays, asked the Joint Rules Committee to allow the 
flag, which has no writing on it, to be flown and permission was granted. But 
after only a few hours complaints were received by the governor's office and it 
was ordered removed. "Flags that represent special interest lifestyles or 
issues are not to be flown over the state Capitol," said Susan Trowbridge, a 
Deukmejian spokeswoman.

The former mayor of South Lake Tahoe was sentenced to nine years in prison on 
drug and money-laundering charges, but not before he tearfully accused federal 
investigators of threatening to kill him if he did not commit illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told if I went to the police, I'd be killed," said Terry Trupp, his 
voice cracking with emotion as he read a statement to U.S. District Judge 
Milton Schwartz. Trupp, 47, said he became involved in the illegal scheme 
because he thought that he was helping the CIA and that prosecutors 
orchestrated the entire transaction. He was arrested in June, 1989, with his 
wife, Kimberly, as the result of an elaborate 20-month federal sting called 
Operation Deep Snow.

LAW ENFORCEMENT: DRUGS? GANGS? THEY'RE COMMON WOES, SAYS ANDRE BOLOTNIKOV, A 
LENINGRAD COP ATTENDING A USC PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a typical scene in the national war against drugs. Citizens had 
complained about strange activities in an apartment, so late one night four 
detectives decided to poke around a bit. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing they noticed was the pungent aroma of acetone. Then they 
spotted two men who abruptly turned and started briskly down the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives followed. The suspects walked faster. Finally, the cops broke 
into a run and confronted the men. One suspect struggled, cursing about 
harassment as the police wrestled him into handcuffs. A passing cabdriver told 
the cops he had seen the suspect toss something. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives retrieved a vial containing the residue of a narcotic with the 
suspect's fingerprints all over it. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a search warrant, the detectives returned to the apartment. With 
their 9-millimeter automatics ready, they kicked in the door and stumbled into 
a makeshift laboratory where two more suspects were processing opium poppies 
into tar heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very bad stuff," detective Andre Bolotnikov said of the drug. But it is 
only one of many illegal substances he and his colleagues in Leningrad 
routinely encounter in their efforts to control a growing drug problem in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
For six weeks, Bolotnikov, 29, has been learning about the war on drugs from 
the American perspective. As one of four foreign exchange students enrolled at 
USC's respected Delinquency Control Institute, he plops down each weekday at a 
desk to study crime alongside 41 colleagues from police departments as near as 
Hawthorne and as far as Ghana, Thailand and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
He sees more similarities than differences between crime in Los Angeles and 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of class, for instance, instructors asked students, mostly 
active law enforcement professionals, to make poster-size charts listing their 
names, positions and their city's problems. Bolotnikov's poster blended with 
posters from Redwood City, Palm Springs and Los Angeles: Gangs. Family 
Violence. Drugs . . . 
</P>
<P>
For years, he concedes, the Soviets were reluctant to discuss such issues. But 
with glasnost, the situation changed. The Leningrad militia -- the Soviet term 
for its urban police -- now regularly releases crime statistics, which the 
media routinely publish and broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"The militia has become very much open to the society," Bolotnikov said. "Now 
people want to let us know about all kinds of crimes. I think it's good. It 
raises the level of public awareness." And that inspires citizens to come 
forward with more tips. "We get a lot of calls and letters sent to the 
department. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many problems in the militia -- a manpower shortage, lack of 
good equipment -- have become public, he said. "It made our jobs a lot easier. 
People came to understand the difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
"The general attitude" in Leningrad, he said, "is that the whole country is 
undergoing profound changes and there are all kinds of difficulties connected 
with that. People are experiencing the loss of conditions they believed were 
eternal. Some people have lost their direction in life. Everyone understands 
that with these quick changes, the militia will have more challenges." 
</P>
<P>
As Soviet society opens up, new forms of crime blossom, he said, noting that 
gang violence is increasing. "We don't have Crips and Bloods. We have groups of 
criminals, often juveniles, who use knives and nunchakus (martial arts weapons) 
to rob people." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Soviet criminals are not as well armed as criminals in the United 
States, although many do carry weapons, which they dig up from World War II 
battlefields and use, for example, to extort money from merchants running small 
business and cooperatives. Also, he said, "People are deciding to go into the 
drug business and make themselves wealthy with the production of illegal 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
With demand for drugs rising, the militia must deal with both traffickers and 
users, he said. Opium poppies have traditionally been grown in Soviet Central 
Asia; drug traffickers are skilled at getting raw materials into Soviet cities. 
Marijuana use is rising, criminals are manufacturing a drug with effects 
similar to those of methamphetamine, and enterprising Soviets have even 
developed "designer drugs," including a form of synthetic heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to stereotypes, the Soviet justice system is no more Draconian than 
that of the United States, Bolotnikov said, adding that possession of an 
illegal drug, generally, would draw a one- to three-year prison term, depending 
on the amount of drug. Convictions for drug thefts and other drug-related 
felonies earn longer sentences. "The criminal code says that if it is 
established that the drugs were possessed with the intent to sell, the criminal 
can get up to 12 years in jail." 
</P>
<P>
And anyone convicted of a drug-related crime in the Soviet Union is put through 
a medical anti-drug abuse program, he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with larger and larger sums of money involved in crime, even cops 
are occasionally tempted, he said: "It happens. Not often. But it happens." 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as the "code of silence" that allegedly exists in some 
U.S. police forces, Bolotnikov claimed: "It is always considered honorable to 
find traitors within the service. If we find someone (breaking the law) we 
prosecute him. We don't want anybody, even if he's your partner, who engages in 
criminality. If he's engaged in criminality, he has betrayed you. You get rid 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
Bolotnikov studied chemistry in college and planned to use his fluent English 
to teach at a foreign language university. But, like all Soviet men, he entered 
the military after earning his degree and decided that police work would be 
more rewarding: "I liked the action. I felt that was where my knowledge and 
skills could be best used." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet drug problem was growing, and he thought his understanding of 
chemistry would help in examining the complex evidence involved in drug crimes. 
After starting out in street robberies, he moved to the narcotics division, 
where he has worked four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the discipline, the camaraderie. It's a manly thing to do, I believe," 
Bolotnikov explained, as he sat in an empty classroom at the USC institute, 
dressed in a casual striped shirt, Levi's, and running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Between classes, he has addressed local criminal-justice classes, civic groups 
and the Rio Hondo police academy. His audiences, eager to learn about police 
work in the Soviet Union, are surprised by his willingness to talk. "They give 
him standing ovations," said Robert J. Barry, a 30-year veteran of the FBI and 
institute director. 
</P>
<P>
At the institute, Bolotnikov and his fellow officers joke and banter casually 
in the halls or around the "roach coach" that arrives each morning with food 
and coffee. Like most officers, he is clearly more comfortable talking with his 
colleagues than with outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
In private, he is self-effacing, almost shy, as he discusses himself, but open 
and enthusiastic in talking about his profession -- almost to the point of 
boosterism. 
</P>
<P>
The Leningrad militia, he says, maintains a force of about 1,500 detectives, 
most of whom have gone through a six-month academy training class. Detectives 
work mainly in plain clothes. Like their Los Angeles counterparts, they are 
equipped with 9-mm semiautomatic handguns, batons, handcuffs and flashlights. 
The force's patrol cars are yellow jeeps or minivans with blue stripes, red 
lights and sirens. But the militia spends more time on foot patrols than the 
cops in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet detectives work eight-hour days, five days a week. The militia does not 
have overtime and detectives do not expect to be reimbursed or given time off 
for working long hours on a case. "But when a case is real hot, you work all 
the time necessary," he said. "The chiefs sometimes have to shoo people out of 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Starting salary for a detective is about 260 rubles ($418) a month -- a 
middle-income Soviet salary, Bolotnikov said. 
</P>
<P>
He has a wife, Irina, a daughter, 3, and a son, 10. Because their girl has not 
adjusted to preschool, his wife, a teacher, stays home. Their marriage, he 
said, endures the same stresses as those of his U.S. colleagues. Still, he 
would not discourage his son, who sometimes boasts to his classmates about his 
dad's work, from pursuing the same career: "He's interested in police work, but 
I don't want to push him. I want him to see what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving in Los Angeles, Bolotnikov has been to a Dodger game, the beach 
and other tourist sites. What he has enjoyed most are the unofficial 
ride-alongs comrades from the program have offered through their turf. 
</P>
<P>
These close-ups of crime have not overwhelmed him. The difference between Los 
Angeles and Leningrad, he said, is that here "in one area you have no crime, 
and in other areas, you can't walk at all," while in Leningrad, the crime 
problem is spread evenly across the city. "Leningrad only has apartment 
houses," he said. "No district is much different than another. We don't have 
good income and bad income areas. The population is very much mixed. The 
affluent live in the same buildings where hooligans and winos live." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city as a whole has much less crime than some parts of Los 
Angeles and "the crime is much worse than in the good parts of L.A." But 
there's really no difference in crime fighting, "because the criminal is the 
same. Crime is the same. A rapist is a rapist is a rapist." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, the time he has spent with his colleagues from America, as 
well as the cops from Ghana, Thailand, and South Korea have convinced him of 
one thing: "It's just made me more sure that cops are cops everywhere."

MILAN'S READY-TO-WEAR DESIGNERS GO FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S FLASHY FOR SUMMER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian ready-to-wear designers are predicting a sizzling spring and 
summer. Five days of fashion shows covering the newest collections by the 
city's top designers were accompanied by a steady stream of hot flashes. 
</P>
<P>
They started blasting through town at the Dolce and Gabbana show on Sunday, 
when sequined bra tops and bustiers, black thigh-high stockings, ultra-short 
skirts and shorts -- all worn with long strings of pearls and gold beads -- 
sizzled down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
But designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were careful not to make the 
look too aggressive, interspersing black lingerie with ethereal white chiffon 
tunics and demure poof skirts. 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio Armani, the most popular Italian ready-to-wear designer and the one who 
made the man-tailored look fashionable in the late '70s, also succumbed to the 
heat wave of spring-summer 1991. 
</P>
<P>
His Emporio collection for the younger set, also shown Sunday, emphasized long 
legs in thigh-high miniskirts and thigh-baring shorts worn with high-heeled 
sandals. If other designers are predicting a steamy summer, Gianni Versace sees 
a scorcher ahead. His new styles are lively, sexy and avant garde with stretch 
pants and catsuits, mini-shifts, micro-miniskirts and fiery hot pants as key 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Milanese designers prefer shades of brown, gray and black. But 
as usual for Versace, he opted for circus reds and blues, neon greens and 
yellows, disco purples and pinks -- some enlivened with sequins. His geometric 
prints were combined with florals; pop-art-style pictures of Hollywood myths 
James Dean and Marilyn Monroe were painted onto stretch-fabric outfits or 
stitched in spangles onto blouses, tight pants or evening dresses. Even shoes, 
hosiery and jewelry carried the print motif. 
</P>
<P>
Versace is a pioneer in the new trend to reach beyond the classic, man-tailored 
styles that put Italian designs at the top of ready-to-wear. Perhaps it is 
Milan's way of fighting its longstanding rival -- Paris -- whose designers have 
gained greater attention in recent months with their more flamboyant, far-out 
looks. 
</P>
<P>
Versace received a standing ovation at his show, where he announced that 
proceeds from the worldwide sale of an elegant silk shirt in the collection, 
printed with Vogue covers, will go to AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
In many collections, the return of the '60s continues to be a strong theme, 
with miniskirts, hot pants, shift dresses and colorful prints all being recast 
in very sexy updates: Hemlines are shorter, hips tighter and breasts barer. 
</P>
<P>
In the makeup department, eye shadows are as bright as a Barbie doll's, with 
false eyelashes longer than anything real could ever be. 
</P>
<P>
The return of the dress is probably the most significant change in Milan this 
season, where trousers have been a staple. Many have a '60s feeling about them, 
but the '90s versions are tighter, especially when made in stretch fabric. 
Shifts, A-line and trapeze dresses, as well as halter-top sun dresses for town 
and beach wear, are leading '60s-inspired dress silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most successful at this particular revival is Mariuccia Mandelli for 
Krizia, who showed her collection Tuesday. Shifts in demure floral silk prints 
highlighted the first part of the show. For the cocktail hour, Krizia offered 
white silk shifts trimmed with silver or simple silk apron dresses. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening went on, hemlines got shorter, brushing the upper thigh. Micro 
shorts and bra tops were the hottest evening looks. 
</P>
<P>
Few of these clothes could go to work, unless women are aerobics instructors or 
nightclub hostesses. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the trim navy-blue suits spruced up with large gold buttons seen at 
Genny, a collection overseen by company president Donatella Girombellim, 
received grateful applause from fashion buyers worried about extravagant styles 
and shrinking pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean-print fabrics, carrying of starfish, coral branches and sea 
plants, appeared on Genny blouses, jewelry and belts for day. They became 
elaborate sequined prints on evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
Milan-based Gianfranco Ferre and Paris-based Karl Lagerfeld showed their 
Italian collections. Both designers also create at least one Paris collection, 
keeping one foot on both fashion runways. The result is a mixed fashion bag, 
not all of it the of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre creates his own label in Milan; in Paris, he designs ready-to-wear and 
couture collections for Christian Dior, one of the French capital's oldest and 
most respected fashion houses. 
</P>
<P>
Paris-based Lagerfeld designs his own line and one for Chanel, Dior's 
traditional rival. In Italy, he is the creative genius behind Fendi's 
ready-to-wear and luxurious furs. 
</P>
<P>
In his recent signature Italian collections, Ferre seems to be struggling to 
reconcile the purity of his sculpted fashion with the more daring look of Paris 
design. 
</P>
<P>
For spring, he showed blouses in crisp white organza with French cuffs and 
paired with slick patent leather hot pants. Well-tailored leather trousers were 
toughened by combat belts and goggles, reminiscent of the more aggressive 
Parisian leather look. 
</P>
<P>
Big bows are a Ferre specialty, but this season he decorated them with 
jewel-encrusted floral bouquets. Taken separately, they were lovely adornments; 
together, they were excessive. 
</P>
<P>
When Ferre stuck to his Milanese guns, the collection was stunning, as in the 
white- and ivory-striped pant suits, the white crochet shift dresses, the 
chocolate-brown leather perforated pants and the floor-length gowns with 
embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld had few problems adapting French coquetry to the sensible lines of 
tailored Italian fashion. 
</P>
<P>
He put zodiac prints on T-shirts, catsuits and swim apparel. But the central 
item of the collection was the blouse -- loose and often pleated at the back. 
</P>
<P>
True to the latest trends, the Fendi collection was full of pretty dresses.

DIETZ RESIGNS PASADENA PLAYHOUSE POST; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: ARTISTIC DIRECTOR SUSAN DIETZ IS GIVING UP THE THEATER TO PURSUE FILM 
AND TV PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Dietz has resigned as artistic director of Pasadena Playhouse, effective 
Oct. 21, in order to pursue film and television opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
No replacement is waiting in the wings, but "we'll look at a host of people who 
have expressed interest over the years," said the theater's managing director 
Lars Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting on Oct. 20 between Hansen, other key staff members and David Houk -- 
the developer who has an ownership interest in the theater -- will "examine our 
opportunities," added Hansen, but he declined to predict when a decision will 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the announced season will continue, and "guest producers may 
present attractions." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz herself will be one of the guest producers. She still plans to produce a 
spring season in the playhouse's smaller Balcony Theatre. The playhouse 
recently received a $35,000 grant from the Fund for New American Plays to 
present Ronald Ribman's "Rug Merchants of Chaos," and Dietz said it would be 
the centerpiece of the Balcony Theatre season. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dietz said her primary energies would now go into such projects as a 
Steven Banks TV pilot she recently produced for Disney -- which is a potential 
Showtime series, she said. Dietz initially produced "Steven Banks' Home 
Entertainment Center" at a small theater in Universal City and later brought 
his act to the Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre; she is also his manager. 
</P>
<P>
She said that while working on the Banks pilot, "the atmosphere was so easy. 
There was a whole lot less stress than in the theater, which is very 
stressful." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz also plans to start what she called "a management production company of 
writers, directors and actors" who will jointly develop projects, primarily for 
film and television. "But every once in a while, we'll go back to the theater." 
Dietz already has at least two ongoing theatrical projects; she co-produces 
"Love Letters" at the Canon Theatre and is associated with "The Baby Dance," a 
play that began at the Playhouse and has now moved on to theaters in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a positive thing for Susie," said Hansen. "I wish her all the 
best." He said her departure was not a complete surprise, and "this seemed like 
a logical time for it. Our projects (for the rest of the season) are firm, and 
we have a natural break between now and January," when the next mainstage show, 
"Ad Wars," will open. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen and Dietz denied that the theater is in danger. Owner Houk "is in there 
for the long haul," said Dietz. "It's not something he dabbles in. He won't let 
it go down the drain." Houk could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz also denied that her leaving is related to reactions to "The Wonderful 
Ice Cream Suit," the theater's current show. "It's doing better business than 
any show we've had in 18 months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen pointed to the theater's subscription base of 18,000 and an annual 
fund-raising campaign that is "very promising, running ahead of last year." 
</P>
<P>
He cited a challenge grant received last week from the Ledler Foundation. The 
foundation will contribute a dollar for every $3 that come in prior to Jan. 1, 
up to a $15,000 cap, said a Ledler spokesman. Movie star Kevin Costner will 
chair the campaign that will attempt to raise the $45,000 that would match the 
grant.

KUWAITI TREASURES TO GO ON U.S. TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
ART: STATE DEPARTMENT GIVES APPROVAL FOR EXHIBITION OF 107 PIECES OF ANCIENT 
ISLAMIC ARTWORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has given permission for a long-planned tour of rare 
treasures from the Kuwait National Museum to enter this country, according to 
officials at the Trust for Museum Exhibitions, which organized the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The plans for the tour were completely in place and approved before the 
invasion of Kuwait, but then everything changed," said Joan Michelson, 
administrator of the Washington-based trust. "We had to begin a staggering 
round of international negotiations to keep it on track." 
</P>
<P>
The tour of 107 Islamic art pieces from about 100 to 1,000 years old will open 
at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore and then appear at museums in Atlanta, 
Richmond, Va., and St. Louis before heading for Canada. It will then perhaps go 
on to Europe, depending on how well the art holds up to the rigors of touring. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the very survival of the art objects -- including textiles, 
ceramics, illuminated manuscripts, jewelry and carved metal pieces -- can 
perhaps be credited to the tour. The exhibition had just arrived at its first 
tour stop, the Hermitage in Leningrad, when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Those pieces on tour represent only a fraction of the priceless holdings of the 
museum in Kuwait City, which since 1983 has housed the collection amassed by 
Sheik Nasser Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah and his wife, Sheika Hussa. Sheik Nasser 
is the nephew of the exiled Emir of Kuwait and Sheika Hussa is the daughter of 
a former Emir. 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports from occupied Kuwait say that Iraqis have removed at least 
a part of the collection from the museum. Sheika Hussa was out of the country 
when the invasion occurred and Sheik Nasser later escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the U.S. tour were complicated by an executive order, in the wake of 
the invasion, barring the importation of objects from Kuwait. The trust had to 
obtain from the State Department a waiver and a guarantee that the objects 
would not be seized when in this country. Permissions had to be also obtained 
from the Treasury Department and various other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, these things are straightforward," Michelson said. "But in this case, 
everyone in the government was afraid to be the one to give us the permission 
we needed. They all wanted someone else to sign off on it first."

'MEMPHIS BELLE' CAST REALLY GOT DOWN TO BASICS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DIRECTOR MICHAEL CATON-JONES PUT HIS 10-MAN BOMBER CREW THROUGH EIGHT 
GRUELING DAYS OF BASIC TRAINING TO ACHIEVE A SPIRIT OF WARTIME CAMARADERIE. 
</P>

When the cast of producer David Puttnam's WWII movie "Memphis Belle" signed on, 
they knew they would be spending weeks in tight quarters in a mock-up of a B-17 
bomber. What they didn't know was that before filming began, they would go 
through basic training -- swimming through rat-infested waters and running 
through the woods trying to avoid stun grenades. 
</P>
<P>
The "Memphis" cast endured its own mini-war -- an eight-day ordeal on Dartmoor, 
an isolated area of southwestern England where a former member of Britain's 
Special Air Services whipped them into shape mentally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important to get that spirit of camaraderie," said director Michael 
Caton-Jones. "We didn't want them to have to pretend. However, the only way to 
forge them quickly was to put them through hell." 
</P>
<P>
For some, it was their worst nightmare; others found it invigorating and 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, boot camp was a tremendous experience," said 19-year-old Sean Astin, 
who plays the bellygunner, encased in a glass and steel bubble below the B-17. 
'We were 10 guys from totally different backgrounds, but we were portraying 
guys who are so close they know how each other smells. 
</P>
<P>
"Trudging through mud and staying out all night was physically tough, but now I 
know all their idiosyncrasies. Our days would start at 4:30 a.m. and go until 
2:30 or 3 the next morning. We'd be exhausted, and they were yelling at us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reed Diamond, 23, who makes his film debut as the plane's flight engineer 
and top turret gunner: "These guys are not comic book heroes. They're ordinary 
men who do incredibly heroic things selflessly. Part of it is not wanting to 
let the other guys down. In boot camp I did a lot of things I'd normally be 
terrified of doing. But there was a sense of selflessness for the group." 
</P>
<P>
D.B. Sweeney, the "old man" of the cast at 29, had already had a taste of 
military life while preparing for Francis Coppola's "Gardens of Stone" and he 
was less than enthused about the "Memphis" preparation. "Sure it was bonding," 
Sweeney said, "but actors can bond in a lot of ways and look after each other. 
It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but I was frustrated because I felt the time 
could have been better used." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the special training did its job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a character study of 10 men in the middle of an action-adventure war 
movie," said co-producer Catherine Wyler, who developed the project from a 1944 
documentary made by her father, the late director William Wyler. "It's really 
about how they depend on each other for their survival. 
</P>
<P>
"These men have been on 24 missions and have shared umpteen life-and-death 
moments. They're fused into a highly polished machine and are really intimate 
because of being through this horror together. When our cast went to boot camp, 
they were a motley band of '80s actors. They had to survive a lot of tests that 
drew them together and made them know each other's strengths and weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
Describing their week in the wilds, Caton-Jones said: "An SAS guy and I 
designed a special course that was basically sensory deprivation. We scared 
them. They all hated me." 
</P>
<P>
Caton-Jones, whose first feature at age 30 was last year's well-received 
"Scandal," is a tough-talking, wise-cracking, soccer-playing Scot. Luckily for 
the actors, he also has a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the boys, 'I'm going to rip you, shout at you, kick you and kiss you,' 
" he said. " 'We're all in this together. You can do anything you like, as long 
as I like it.' I treat them like my little brother. That's my manner, and it 
took some of them a long time to get used to me."

'20/20' PRODUCER RESIGNS OVER BUCKWHEAT INTERVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: LYNN MURRAY TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOGUS STORY. WILLIAM 
THOMAS, WHO PORTRAYED THE 'OUR GANG' CHARACTER, DIED IN 1980.

Lynn Murray, the producer responsible for an interview with what has proven to 
be a bogus Buckwheat on last Friday's installment of "20/20," resigned in a 
"mutual decision" with the network, an ABC News spokeswoman confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided that Murray did not 
properly handle the research of a segment entitled "Whatever Happened to 'Our 
Gang'? " and that it would be best if she resigned, said Maurie Perl, the 
show's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Murray had worked on the program in a variety of jobs for the past 10 years, 
Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, "20/20" claimed to have found the actor who played Buckwheat in 
the "Our Gang" comedies of the 1930s and '40s working as a grocery bagger in 
Tempe, Ariz. He was interviewed on the air. 
</P>
<P>
William Thomas, the man who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Downs will apologize on the air in tonight's broadcast of the 12-year-old 
news magazine "for any pain and discomfort" the mistake might have caused 
Thomas' family, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's show, Thomas' son, Bill Thomas Jr., and George McFarland, who 
played Spanky in the "Our Gang" comedies (later retitled "The Little Rascals" 
for television), criticized the "20/20" report, and ABC subsequently 
acknowledged having been duped. 
</P>
<P>
The imposter, Bill English, told ABC that he changed his last name and refused 
to sign autographs because it would interfere with his work at the supermarket. 
Perl said that the idea to interview English came in a letter from a viewer, 
not from English himself. English apparently has been telling people he is 
Buckwheat for the past 30 years, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
Several observers, including Richard W. Bann, who with Leonard Maltin wrote the 
1976 book, "Our Gang: The Life and Times of the Little Rascals," maintained 
that the mistake undermines "20/20's" credibility. "Next week, they'll find 
Elvis," Bann quipped to the Associated Press.

Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the colorful and eloquent mayor who finished second to 
Gov. Jim Florio in the 1989 Democratic gubernatorial primary, died early 
Wednesday, borough officials said. She was 51. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sigmund, who died at home, had been suffering from a recurrence of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
She was the daughter of retiring U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, a New Orleans Democrat, 
and the late Hale Boggs, who was the House majority leader and was scheduled to 
become Speaker of the House when he was killed in a plane crash in 1972. Mrs. 
Boggs reportedly decided to retire from the House to spend more time with her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sigmund was first stricken with cancer seven years ago. A malignant 
melanoma was found behind her left eye and the eye was removed in 1982. She was 
elected Princeton's first woman mayor in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
After losing her eye, Mrs. Sigmund made her large collection of fashionable eye 
patches her trademark, coordinating them with the color of her outfits. 
</P>
<P>
As a campaign gimmick during the primary, she distributed eye patches to 
businessmen, lobbyists and politicians boarding a Chamber of Commerce chartered 
train to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
She was a former Mercer County freeholder and was an unsuccessful candidate for 
the U.S. Senate in 1982.

TOLL TO REMAIN FOR CORONADO BRIDGE UNTIL '95; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: STATE DECISION IS A VICTORY FOR CORONADO, WHICH WANTS TOLL FEES 
TO HELP PAY FOR SOLUTIONS TO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN THE CITY. 
</P>

The $1 toll on the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge will remain in place until at 
least mid-1995, the California Transportation Commission decided Thursday, 
ending months of speculation about the future of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in San Luis Obispo, the commission voted 5-0 to retain the toll 
until June, 1995, and use the funds for improvements on the bridge and along 
Coronado's congested roadways, said Mariana Mejia, a Caltrans spokeswoman. The 
commission sets state transportation policy. 
</P>
<P>
The toll question will be reviewed again in January, 1995, Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
The toll already has provided sufficient funds to cover the construction costs 
of the 21-year-old bridge, one of San Diego's most recognizable landmarks, 
which stretches from near downtown across San Diego Bay to Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics had wanted the toll scrapped, contending that it was too 
burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
But Coronado city officials and others feared that rescinding the toll would 
prompt more people to use the bridge, thus worsening the city's already 
substantial traffic problem. Pro-toll advocates backed retaining the fee and 
using the proceeds for road and bridge improvements -- the precise option 
chosen Thursday by the state commission. 
</P>
<P>
The tolls are expected to generate $25 million in gross revenues between now 
and 1995, Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly we hope it (the toll) will help with some of the traffic issues," said 
Jacqueline Wilson, deputy Coronado city clerk. "Traffic seems to be Coronado's 
biggest problem. What are we going to do with all those cars on the roads?" 
</P>
<P>
In Barrio Logan, the low-income San Diego community most impacted by the 
bridge, many favor using toll funds for improvements in their inner-city 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner, whose district includes Barrio Logan, said he planned to 
approach state officials about directing toll monies toward community projects. 
Among the possible options: Use the funds to help alleviate bridge-related 
neighborhood traffic congestion or for the upkeep and expansion of the 
acclaimed murals painted on the bridge columns in Chicano Park. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to keep the toll, we should pay what's due to a community 
that has has suffered from it," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, construction of the bridge is remembered bitterly by many in 
Barrio Logan, who say that the structure split one of southern California's 
oldest Chicano communities, displacing many families. Chicano Park was born 
amid that controversy, symbolizing to many the determination of area residents 
to fight back after the devastation inflicted by the bridge construction. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is a victory for Coronado Mayor Mary Herron and the Coronado City 
Council, who have gone on record in support of a continued toll. Mayor Herron 
testified Thursday in favor of retaining the fee, as did councilman Michel 
Napolitano, according to Mejia, the Caltrans spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The elegant, 2.23-mile long, 246-feet high bridge, which was was officially 
opened on Aug. 2, 1969, was financed through the sale of almost $48 million in 
construction bonds. The accumulated tolls paid off the bond bill by 1986, some 
17 years ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The $1 bridge toll is charged only to westbound vehicles. (The toll had been 
$1.20 until it was reduced in 1988.) Car-pool vehicles are exempt. Commuters 
may purchase books of 20 tickets for $12, or 60 cents per round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge traffic has been increasing by 2% to 5% per year, according to Caltrans. 
The numbers of vehicles using the bridge in both directions rose from almost 
50,000 during the 1984-85 fiscal year to 62,000 during the 1988-89 fiscal year, 
the most recent year for which data are available, Caltrans said.

MAYOR TRIES TO SWEET-TALK GOP INTO PICKING S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to woo the highly sought 1992 Republican Convention, Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor told top GOP officials Thursday that San Diego is like a "beautiful 
girl" with a "warm personality" and a "strong spirit" who has only one problem 
in being courted by her "handsome young suitor: She doesn't have a dowry." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor greeted representatives of the Republican National Committee at a 
luncheon at the Catamaran Hotel by telling them San Diego was a "rose among the 
thorns of large urban areas" -- a pointed reference to Cleveland, Houston, New 
Orleans and St. Petersburg, Fla., the city's competition for hosting the event. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to several hundred dignitaries in the hotel ballroom, O'Connor 
described her city as a "gem of sparkling hope" and said, "Other cities have 
Little Italys or Little Chinatowns, but San Diego is Little America." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Judy McCarty echoed the mayor's words by telling the 
Republicans, "The analogy is perfect -- we may not have a dowry, but we're very 
pretty and can promise you a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a dowry -- or rather, up-front capital -- may be the city's chief 
negative in what some describe as a race in which San Diego is the clear 
leader. Business Week magazine reported this week that San Diego is the 
favorite to capture the event. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders say its chances are aided by White House official Sig Rogich, 
assistant to the president for public events and initiatives. Rogich, a former 
Las Vegas ad executive, is reported to be San Diego's biggest backer and a 
confidante of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, officials with the Republican National Committee tried to play 
down the talk of San Diego being the leader or even a top contender. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is no more or no less a favorite than any other city we're looking 
at," said William Harris, chairman of the Site Selection Committee. "It is 
inaccurate to say that San Diego is the top contender. I know some people have 
been saying that, but it's wrong. It's precipitous to say we're leaning toward 
any city." 
</P>
<P>
In her remarks to the crowd, Jeanie Austin, co-chairman of the Republican 
National Committee, disputed press accounts that Cleveland and St. Petersburg 
are out of the running by saying she intends to pass along those rumors to 
colleague Lee Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, the other co-chairman, is recovering from a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
"All cities will be equal in going to the drawing room table," Austin said. 
"It's been reported that an insider on the site committee said Cleveland and 
St. Pete are out. If I find out who said that, I'll drag that person over to 
Atwater's house, and he'll cut their tongue out." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier remarks, Austin said the convention site would not be voted on until 
a meeting of the 165-member national committee in January. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the GOP is leaning toward San Diego, Austin said, "I don't know how 
people can make that assessment." 
</P>
<P>
She said the Republicans need a pledge of $10 million from any city hosting the 
event but added that such funds are usually the culmination of private 
fund-raising. So, O'Connor's insistence on the lack of a "dowry" should be no 
problem, much less a strike against the city, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
GOP official Harris said San Diego is important because it gives the 
Republicans a "Western option" in a year in which the Democrats have tabbed New 
York for their convention. He conceded that New York is a controversial choice 
because of its litany of urban problems and that San Diego might offer a nice 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the politics of it," Harris said. "It gives us a strong range of options, 
and we like to have that as we narrow the sites." 
</P>
<P>
A factor that may work against San Diego surfaced Thursday in the form of sight 
lines at the new Convention Center. Technical experts who work for the Site 
Selection Committee -- their job being to evaluate halls and stadia for 
network-television potential -- said the roof of the Convention Center is too 
low and that numerous poles and pillars pose a view "obstruction" problem. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Miller, the director of news media operations for the committee, said the 
problem was not unlike watching a baseball game at Fenway Park or Wrigley 
Field, where a few fans would find themselves perched behind pillars and poles. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Diego Convention Center does have obstructions we'd have to work 
around," Miller said. "I'm not saying we couldn't do it, but it is a problem 
we'd have to overcome. Part of the difficulty would be putting the seats in so 
that everyone could see. But, it's more of a media problem than anything. We 
have lots of cameras and anchor booths to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, which committee members toured 
Thursday afternoon, might be used for one or two nights but not for the entire 
event. The stadium, he said, could easily accommodate an anticipated 15,000 
media representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem with having all convention events at the stadium, according to 
its manager, Bill Wilson, is that the committee needs a "six-week window of 
time" for set-up, and the stadium -- home to both baseball's Padres and 
football's Chargers in August -- would be available for only two, at most. 
</P>
<P>
Site Committee Chairman Harris said the Convention Center's technical 
shortcomings were not a "major problem," but when asked if they were a 
positive, he laughed and said, "No." He added that the sight-line issue was one 
of many considerations to be evaluated in San Diego's "total package." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said she had been assured that San Diego could provide the needed 20,000 
hotel rooms. O'Connor said the city needs the convention, partly because of a 
glut of hotel space but mainly because it would "jump-start" the new Convention 
Center, which "badly needs it." 
</P>
<P>
She said the Convention Center had been a disappointment in failing to attract 
"big-ticket" gatherings, which it needs, especially in a recessionary time. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons alone -- occupying hotels and hyping the Convention Center -- 
O'Connor disputed those who say the event would not be a boon to tourism. She 
and other city officials estimate the economic impact to the city at between 
$50 million and $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup, scheduled to be completed in San Diego in May, 1992, is 
expected to bring in as much as $900 million. O'Connor said that, potentially, 
'92 could be the most profitable in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
The '92 calendar is already crowded with the sailing regatta, as well as the 
Baseball All-Star Game and two arts festivals. City Councilman Ron Roberts said 
Thursday those events are a plus, rather than a minus, in wooing the GOP.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: COFFEE CAPER GRINDS TO HALT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Don't Get a Break 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Police Department is having trouble all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen prostitutes have up and gotten themselves dead and nobody knows 
why. A serial killer is stalking the women of Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
The city had a record 125 homicides through September, many drug- and 
gang-related. Cops seem to be shooting their guns with deadly abandon, often at 
people armed only with trowels and tomato stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this murder and madness, the department found enough manpower and 
equipment to bust open the Great Coffeegate Scandal. 
</P>
<P>
A hidden camera was installed for several weeks at the Eastern Division 
headquarters on Aero Drive near Montgomery Field to see who was filching from 
the coffee fund. 
</P>
<P>
Internal affairs got involved. Now the division commander has the careers and 
reputations of three sergeants in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
The three were found to have gone in arrears to the coffee fund. Grand total: 
about $10. 
</P>
<P>
The coffee fund is like that in millions of offices across the country. You put 
in a buck and take some change to buy some coffee or a candy bar from the 
vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
Somedays you're broke, but you're still hungry or thirsty. You take some change 
and make good on it later. 
</P>
<P>
When the undercover investigation was over, the sergeants were hauled in and 
read their Miranda rights. 
</P>
<P>
The three are street cops, with an average of 13 years in the department. 
They've got experience on the SWAT squad, the homicide squad, the sex-crime 
unit and street patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The case was sent to the district attorney's office, which declined to press 
felony charges. The case was sent to the city attorney's office, which is 
reviewing possible petty theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for charges to be filed. A deputy city attorney laughingly says that 
if coffee-fund filchers start being prosecuted there won't be an office in San 
Diego left untouched, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
The P.D. is also getting in its licks. The commander has the authority to put 
nasty letters in the cops' files or mete out suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
Nasty letters tend to haunt a cop at promotion time. Suspensions cost money. 
</P>
<P>
I talked to one of the sergeants. He's humiliated and twisted in knots by the 
whole sorry episode. 
</P>
<P>
He wonders why the department didn't simply post a sign over the coffee fund 
box warning cops not to float penny-ante loans. Good question. 
</P>
<P>
A police official says the amount of money involved is irrelevant. Theft of 
money, even in piddling amounts, is a serious matter and should be dealt with 
severely, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Why does that remind me of "The Caine Mutiny" when Capt. Queeg orders an 
investigation into a missing quart of strawberries? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restful Workout 
</P>
<P>
Speak for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
* Fitness revolt. 
</P>
<P>
At the National Assn. of Real Estate Investment Trusts convention at the Hotel 
del Coronado, today's agenda lists a "Fun Walk and Run" for 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Also listed is an alternative organized by Lou Garday of San Diego's Burnham 
Pacific Properties: "Fun Sleep In with complimentary coffee and juice delivered 
to your room." 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) had some lapses this week during 
a candidates' forum in Rancho Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
She was asked about ethics in Sacramento in the wake of the vote-selling 
convictions of Paul Carpenter and Joseph Montoya. She drew a blank on 
Carpenter: 
</P>
<P>
"Has he been convicted?" (Yes, a month ago.) 
</P>
<P>
Later she couldn't recall Propositions 131 and 132: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm suffering from Alzheimer's at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
The comment drew silence from her audience of 50 or so residents at the Casa de 
las Campanas retirement home. Average age: Seventysomething. 
</P>
<P>
* The Marine Corps needs a few good dental assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton is looking for civilian volunteers to work in clinics for 
dependents and retirees. All uniformed dental assistants are on toothache duty 
in the Mideast.

FIRE: INSECTS AND OTHER PROBLEMS HAVE RISEN FROM THE RUINS OF A BURNED CITRUS 
PLANT IN FALLBROOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They're almost too small to track individually, and there are too many to swat, 
and they've made life miserable over the past week at Maie Ellis Elementary 
School in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
They've been swarming in the shade of campus trees, hiding out in the closets 
where the kids store their lunches, hovering in the cafeteria and cowering in 
the corners of classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
And they're all from next door -- birthed within the remaining hulk of a 
historic lemon packing plant that burned virtually to the ground last August, 
leaving a legacy of rotting fruit and stagnant fire hose water that pooled in 
the basement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real sick of them," said an exacerbated Roberta DeLuca, the school's 
principal. "This is one of those things you've got to put in your book about 
dumb things they never taught you about in principal school." 
</P>
<P>
The fruit flies are just one of three problems created by the fire at the 
packing house, a 73-year-old landmark in the center of downtown Fallbrook that 
was still operating as the Lemon Twist Plant when it was destroyed in the 
pre-dawn blaze two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The water that the 50 firefighters poured on the flames pooled in a basement, 
mixing with assorted and unidentified chemicals stored there. It was further 
dirtied by ash, charred wooden timbers and old steel frames. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Page of the Fallbrook Sanitation District figures there are 600,000 
gallons of water in the basement, covering the floor to a depth of 1 1/2 feet. 
But he can't just pump the water out and into the community's sewers because 
it's filled with the kind of chemical crud that would send the town's 
waste-water treatment plant into a biological tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
So the water turned stagnant and smelly, and became a giant birthing ward for 
mosquitoes. No problem; county vector control officials heard of the problem 
and sprayed the water with chemicals to kill the larvae. The spraying continues 
weekly. 
</P>
<P>
What remains is getting rid of the water itself. 
</P>
<P>
Because the fire debris tainted the water, state law prohibits it from being 
pumped directly into sewers, Page said. Besides, there are various other 
chemicals in the water -- none so bad as to prompt county health officials to 
declare it technically hazardous, but nonetheless too nasty to be treated at 
the sewage plant. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough toxicity in the water to kill the bugs (bacteria) in my (sewage 
treatment) water," Page said. "The bugs treat the sewage sludge, and chemically 
it's a delicate balance." 
</P>
<P>
Page has asked the owners of the plant, Nielsen Citrus Products of Huntington 
Beach, to line up portable waste-water treatment machinery to give the water a 
once-over cleaning so it can then be pumped into the sewers. But it might cost 
$30,000 or so, he said, and the company is balking. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county health officials want the water drained, too, so they can 
stop spraying it to control the mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Nielsen Citrus did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
But while officials say the mosquito problem is being monitored, and that the 
water isn't causing anyone any immediate danger because it's contained within 
concrete walls and floor, the fruit fly problem erupted about 10 days ago, like 
some unwelcome fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened the door of a supply room, and the flies were so bad the custodian 
and I decided not even to go in. We just shut the door," DeLuca said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Holder, school district superintendent of maintenance operations, called a 
local pest control company. The school grounds were sprayed last Friday night. 
On Monday, the flies were back. They were sprayed again that night. They 
returned again Tuesday. Another spraying. They returned Wednesday. More 
spraying that night. On Thursday, though in reduced numbers, they were still 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll spray every night as long as they're there," Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
The county-approved insecticide being used is effective only in the immediate 
short term and has no residual effects, either on the flies or the students who 
return the next day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, DeLuca said, the children have maintained a good amount of 
civility. "We're a rural area, and you'd expect to see things like fruit flies 
in this area." 
</P>
<P>
"But we've never had a pest like this in the in-town area," she said. "We 
didn't invite these flies to school. We don't need them for any science 
projects."

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: 'NEW' CUISINE IS IN CAPABLE HANDS AT THE 
TREND-SETTING PACIFICA GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On balance, it seems well that Pacifica Grill executive chef Neil Stuart is a 
restless soul. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Stuart, this ever trendy, always stylish downtown restaurant changes 
its culinary course about as often as Zsa Zsa Gabor changes spouses, which is 
to say with some regularity. Over the years it has delved into the depths and 
shallows of California cuisine, promoted the short-lived (and locally abortive) 
"grazing" fad and introduced Southwestern nouvelle, and now has inaugurated a 
style of its own invention, Pacific Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Southwestern cuisine probably is one of those things that had to happen 
sooner or later, and it has come to life in competent hands. The menu defines 
this style as "blending the traditions and flavors of Mexico with the bounty 
and flair of California," which is a reasonably accurate if somewhat full-blown 
way of saying that Pacifica Grill has devised a varied menu of updated Mexican 
classics and seafood preparations with Mexican flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The cooking falls into the nouvelle category, and because the appetizers are 
inventive and served in portions that discourage an entree follow-up, the menu 
certainly seems suited to grazing. (This term means making a meal of several 
small plates and is so out of favor as to cause shudders among at least some of 
the restaurateurs who once took credit for inventing the idea.) 
</P>
<P>
Tortillas, chilies, the succulent herb called epazote, salsa (at least as a 
concept) and other familiar ingredients all play major roles in the 
restaurant's new style, but in a liberated fashion that often leads in 
intriguing new directions. A rather comprehensive example would be the entree 
of tortilla-crusted chicken with Mexican beer salsa, which translates into a 
crispy-crunchy bird with a flavor that suggests chicken breaded with crushed 
corn flakes. The salsa is pleasant but has rather a milquetoast character 
compared to some of the kitchen's notably hot creations. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best item in the hot category is the reasonably volcanic appetizer 
described as "burnt cheese," a molten amalgam of buffalo-milk mozzarella, 
onions and smoked chilies. Glazed under the broiler until the cheese acquires a 
bubbling, brown crust, this variation on the classic Mexican queso fundido 
features a heat that makes a sneak attack on the taste buds but leaves them 
gratified by the experience. It is served with tortillas, meant as chewy 
wrappers to be rolled around the gooey fondue and shared around the table. 
(Pacifica Grill recognizes and helps along the contemporary practice of sharing 
bites by stocking tables with piles of small dishes.) 
</P>
<P>
The appetizers seem uniformly attractive and intelligently designed. A 
longstanding house creation, the chili-crusted lamb ribs with burnt orange 
dipping sauce, remains a savory masterpiece of tender, potently seasoned meat 
set off by a dip of unusual pungency. The fajita of duck, sour cherries and 
Maui onions makes a novel luxury of an increasingly common dish, a comment that 
applies with equal force to the machaca of shrimp -- a thick, savory stew of 
deep flavors that, like the burnt cheese, is served with flour tortillas for 
optional rolling. As with the cheese, the tortillas make the dish so filling as 
to render a following entree somewhat pointless; many appetites might be just 
as happy succeeding the more substantial starters with a salad or a bowl of 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
In a lighter vein are such things as New Zealand mussels with tomatoes and 
herbs; a Mexican blue crab "hand roll" (a sushi impersonator in 
south-of-the-border garb) with tomatillo salsa; a pleasing, puree-like black 
bean soup brightened with epazote, and an engaging carpaccio of smoked ahi with 
goat cheese and fried capers. This last takes the concept of carpaccio rather 
far, but it is a well-made dish of tender, meaty fish, colorfully sprinkled 
with a fine dice of bell peppers, and given a savory accent by the caper-cheese 
garnish. Fried won ton skins add a welcome crunch to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list looks primarily to the sea and offers a swordfish steak asada 
with tequila and sun-dried tomato salsa (we are definitely in the realm of the 
wildly nouvelle here, but this unsampled offering sounds pretty good); grilled 
sea bass with roasted yellow tomato salsa; mahi mahi steamed in a banana leaf, 
and a remarkably delicious filet of king salmon barbecued in the style of 
Yucatan. The flavors were deep and resonant, not particularly spicy but well 
suited to the salmon, which was cooked not one moment more or less than 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also barbecues long-cooked duck and sets it in a pool of corn 
adobada, or crisp kernels stewed in a spicy sauce flavored with a good bit of 
cumin. The bird itself is cooked to the falling-off-the-bones stage, which 
works in this instance, and is spread with a highly seasoned, paste-like sauce 
whose faint but noticeable bitterness implies the presence of bitter chocolate, 
the ingredient that characterizes Mexico's famous mole sauce. 
</P>
<P>
A newly introduced section of the menu titled "sabores mexicanos" ("tastes of 
Mexico") offers a monthly three-course menu of traditional regional Mexican 
dishes. These can be ordered individually or as a $19 fixed-price meal, but 
frankly, this particular offering seems one of the menu's weak spots. The 
mushroom empanada appetizer featured a fine, flaky crust, but the cultivated 
mushrooms in the filling could not stand up to the strong accents of garlic, 
chilies and epazote. The entree of spicy shrimp stew, or camaron en chile rojo, 
was indifferent in flavor, and the rock-type shrimp were cooked to a rather 
mushy texture that was less than pleasing. The dessert, a crisp rice flan 
(dulce de arroz) won on all points and would more worthily follow any of the 
other entrees. 
</P>
<P>
This is a restaurant that makes much of desserts and turns out an excellent, 
mousse-like cinnamon-chocolate torte and a grand burnt cream, the smooth creme 
brulee that the Pacifica restaurants popularized locally and make better than 
just about any place else.

COURT DENIES APPEAL OF PEYER CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to hear an appeal by former 
California Highway Patrol Officer Craig Peyer, who was convicted of 
first-degree murder in June, 1988, for the strangulation death of Cara Knott. 
</P>
<P>
"The court denied a petition for review," said a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Peyer, 40, killed Knott, 20, on Dec. 27, 1986, near the Mercy Road off-ramp and 
Interstate 15 and tossed her body into a dry creek bed. The body was discovered 
the following day. 
</P>
<P>
He is currently serving a sentence of 25-years-to-life in state prison. A 
previous appeal to the state 4th District Court of Appeal was denied in June. 
His first trial ended with the jury deadlocked 7 to 5 for conviction in early 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
A 13-year CHP veteran, Peyer is the first CHP officer convicted of committing 
murder while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Schatz, Peyer's appellate attorney, was not availble for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Janelle Davis said that Peyer has exhausted his appeal rights 
in the state courts. Davis, who represented the state in Peyer's appeal to the 
4th District, said the only legal avenue left for Peyer is to ask the federal 
courts to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
"But he really doesn't have any more appeal rights," Davis said.

EARLY ANNEXATION RULING FOR SIMI DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a setback for Simi Valley's chances of getting an early ruling on whether it 
can annex Bob Hope's Jordan and Runkle ranches, the head of a county planning 
agency said Thursday that a study of the city's request for special 
consideration will take a month longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials said a delay by the Local Agency Formation Commission in 
deciding to change its procedures could hurt the city's chances for a speedy 
review of the proposal to expand its sphere of influence to include the two 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Director Bob Braitman said his staff needs more time to prepare a report 
on the matter and will ask the commission to delay a decision until Nov. 21. 
The commission was scheduled to consider the request at its next meeting on 
Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taking more time than we have," Braitman said of the staff report. "To 
put together a credible report needed by the commission, we're recommending the 
matter be held over." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials said a delay would mean that Simi Valley City 
Councilwoman Vicky Howard, who is a member of the LAFCO board, will not be able 
to vote on the matter. Howard's four-year term on the board ends Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "I don't think it bodes well 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
However, Stratton said there is a strong possibility that the city will still 
pursue annexation even though the process could take two years. He said the 
council will discuss the issue at its meeting on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If reelected next month, Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore, a LAFCO alternate, 
would take Howard's place at the panel's Nov. 21 meeting. Fiore has said 
repeatedly that he is against Simi Valley annexing Jordan Ranch -- where a 
750-house development and tournament golf course are planned -- because the 
city is separated from the property by a mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore said he would also oppose any change in LAFCO procedures for hearing the 
annexation proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Why fix something that's not broke?" Fiore asked. He said if the commission 
made an exception with Simi Valley, other cities and developers would expect 
similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Although LAFCO traditionally has not reviewed annexation proposals by cities 
until their general plans have been amended and the necessary environmental 
impact reports completed, there is no law prohibiting the agency from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials had requested an early ruling on the annexation proposal 
to avoid the lengthy and costly process of amending its General Plan if it 
appeared that the proposal would be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the County Board of Supervisors would reject the Jordan Ranch 
development, Hope and Potomac Investment Associates turned to Simi Valley in 
July with the annexation proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to 2,308 acres of Jordan Ranch property, Hope has also asked the 
city to annex 3,600 acres of Runkle Ranch. The properties are part of the Santa 
Monica and Santa Susana mountains. 
</P>
<P>
If annexation goes through and his development is approved, Hope and his 
attorneys have promised the city that he would not sell Blind Canyon, part of 
the Runkle Ranch site, to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts to be 
developed as a landfill. Runkle Ranch straddles both Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties.

THE POWER OF SHARING; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS, ADMINISTRATORS AND PARENTS HELP MANAGE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Hillside Junior High School in Simi Valley, students are starting the school 
day later this year than last, and the traditional daily homeroom period is a 
thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean View Junior High School in Oxnard, teachers decided that they needed 
training to help them emphasize writing throughout the curriculum, so they 
hired their own consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Those decisions were made by teams of teachers, administrators and other school 
employees, who are part of a nationwide trend in power sharing called 
school-based management. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is simple: to give teachers and other employees a voice in how their 
school is run. 
</P>
<P>
The management-by-committee approach allows teachers, other school employees 
and, sometimes, parents to have a say in shaping curriculum, deciding how money 
is spent and planning the day-to-day operations of schools. 
</P>
<P>
At its broadest, the concept allows schools to operate autonomously, increasing 
the power of teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The person actually involved in the activity -- the teacher in the classroom 
-- sometimes knows better what needs to be done to make the job better," said 
Ocean View Junior High Principal Frank Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, teachers and administrators at Ocean View Junior High met each month 
to hash out issues ranging from curriculum changes to spending money for books 
and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The group of about 10 -- including teachers, the principal, the assistant 
principal and a representative of other school employees -- debated every item 
in an effort to reach a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The small, 2,360-student Ocean View district is the only district in the county 
that has implemented the concept at all of its schools. 
</P>
<P>
As the Ocean View experiment enters its second year, teachers and 
administrators say they are looking forward to testing the boundaries of their 
new power. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that more than one head can help you get through a problem, and 
everybody can contribute to a solution," said Hugh Pickrel, principal of Laguna 
Vista Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, several other districts have some version of school-based 
management, including school districts in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks' Conejo 
Valley Unified School District and the Hueneme Elementary School District. Many 
principals in other districts also consult teachers informally when making 
decisions that affect them. 
</P>
<P>
The concept has taken on different forms in different districts. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, a far-reaching form of 
school-based management was started this year at 27 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Committees of teachers, parents, principals and administrators at those schools 
will have the power to make decisions about graduation requirements, the length 
of the school day, teacher hiring and evaluation, and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hillside Junior High School and the Conejo Elementary School in Thousand 
Oaks have received Mastery in Learning grants from the National Education Assn. 
to help fund their school-based management programs. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it makes good sense because resources are so limited in education 
now," said Conejo Principal Claudia Spelman. 
</P>
<P>
At Simi Valley's Hillside, which is beginning its second year under the 
program, parents are also members of the management council, Principal Kathryn 
Scroggin said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Scroggin and Assistant Principal Steve Kalan were selected for their 
jobs by a panel that included teachers and other school employees, but no 
district administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little bit different from L.A." Unified schools, Scroggin said. "We're 
more of a grass-roots movement. No one came in and said, 'This is how you do 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition to three parents, Hillside's group includes seven teachers, four 
students, two members of the support staff and the president of the teachers 
association. They meet at least monthly. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the decision to do away with homeroom has been the Hillside council's 
biggest change. Instead of homeroom, Hillside has shorter communications 
periods that meet only about 30 times a year. Some teachers felt the homeroom 
period was not an efficient use of time, Scroggin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically changed the structure of our day," Scroggin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley school board has been supportive, Scroggin said. "They may say, 
'You want to do what?' but so far they have never turned down the decision of 
the council. . . . I won't pretend 100% of the people are thrilled, but so far 
it seems to work very well." 
</P>
<P>
In the Ocean View district, each of the four schools has leadership teams of 
teachers and administrators who meet regularly to decide -- in a limited number 
of areas -- how their schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
When faced with budget cuts last year, principal Samuels consulted the team 
before he decided to discontinue home economics, to not replace a retiring home 
economics teacher and to reduce the number of courses offered in shop. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View Supt. Robert D. Allen said the teams in his district have a say in 
the hiring of teachers and in decisions about school supplies, department 
budgets, books and staff development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's working, and it's working very well," Allen said. The district's small 
size has made the experiment easier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean View's Mar Vista Elementary School, the leadership team used part of 
its $5,000 school budget last year to buy equipment called manipulatives, which 
are geometric figures used to help children learn basic math. The school also 
bought literature books to fit into a state-mandated language arts curriculum, 
said Principal Nancy Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were considered priorities by the staff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista teacher Marcia Turner said the council allows teachers "to know a 
little bit more about the inner workings of the school and the types of 
decisions that have to be made. Sometimes as a classroom teacher you don't get 
that perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Parents, however, are not allowed on the leadership teams in the Ocean View 
district. Although they play an advisory role at Samuels' school, they don't 
have an official vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we're ready to include parents on a leadership council," Samuels 
said. He said the concept is still too new and predicted that it may be another 
three years before the council is running smoothly enough to allow parent 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
Some Ocean View parents say they already participate in decision making at 
their schools. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista, for example, has a discipline committee, a library committee, a 
parent-teacher club, an advisory committee for migrant parents, and other 
groups that help make decisions in various areas, said Jane Yanagihara, 
president of the Parent-Teacher Club. 
</P>
<P>
Schools that receive state money for special programs, including migrant 
education, special education and classes for gifted students, are required 
under state law to have a council of parents, teachers and administrators to 
help decide how money for the programs is spent. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said there appears to be a growing desire on the part of parents to be 
more involved in the management of school affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Just how far Ocean View schools will take the concept of greater local control 
is still being explored, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
"We took baby steps at the beginning," Samuels said. "At this point, I'm still 
not sure we've tapped all the things we could do."

BANK WORKER CHASES ROBBER ON FREEWAY BEFORE ARREST MADE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: OFFICERS SEIZE THE OXNARD MAN IN A HOUSING TRACT. HE IS BELIEVED 
RESPONSIBLE FOR 10 HOLDUPS IN VENTURA AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES.

Police arrested a man believed responsible for 10 bank holdups this year after 
a red-dye packet exploded on a robber, and at least one bank employee chased 
the man onto the Ventura Freeway on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Villareal, 19, of Oxnard is being held at Ventura County Jail on 
suspicion of bank robbery and misdemeanor warrants. 
</P>
<P>
After a robbery about 1 p.m. at the Wells Fargo Bank at 460 Esplanade Drive in 
Oxnard, the robber was confronted by at least one bank employee outside the 
bank. The robber was told to drop the money. When the red-dye packet exploded 
and made a loud buzzing noise, the man jumped on it in an attempt to silence 
it, bank workers said. 
</P>
<P>
A bank employee then chased the man on foot for a few blocks through the 
Financial Plaza Shell Station on Vineyard Avenue and Esplanade Drive, onto the 
freeway -- where he jumped a fence -- and into a housing complex, said Gary 
Auer, who heads the FBI's Ventura division. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI reported that two tellers were involved in the pursuit, but a bank 
spokeswoman said only one employee chased the robber and she would not say if 
it was a teller. 
</P>
<P>
Bank employees are instructed to hand over the money if they are threatened 
with a weapon and are told not to try to apprehend a robber, Wells Fargo 
spokeswoman Kathleen Shilkret said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous," Shilkret said. "We don't want to have our employees put 
themselves in physical danger." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police unsuccessfully searched the College Park housing tract near the 
corner of Vineyard Avenue and St. Mary's Drive for about an hour before four 
undercover agents took over. The agents staked out the area for about another 
hour before seeing Villareal about 3 p.m., Lt. Stan Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Villareal was not wearing the clothes described by bank workers but matched the 
robber's description and "there was indication of the dye," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe he is responsible for robbing eight other banks in the county 
in the past three weeks, including two in Port Hueneme, one in Thousand Oaks, 
two in Oxnard, one in Ventura and two in Camarillo. He also reportedly 
attempted a robbery at a second bank in Thousand Oaks, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police suspect Villareal in two Los Angeles County bank robberies within 
the past six weeks, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the county's second rash of bank robberies in recent months. In August, 
officials arrested two men suspected of robbing seven banks and trying to rob 
two more. The men are awaiting trial in federal court, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's bank robbery was the 36th of the year, compared with 59 robberies 
in Ventura County at this time in 1989, Auer said. In 1987, Auer said, a single 
robber suspected of 16 Ventura County robberies was convicted of four. In 1988, 
a man pleaded guilty to four of 14 suspected robberies.

FIRE FROM BLAST DESTROYS HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: NO ONE IS HURT IN AN EARLY MORNING EXPLOSION THAT WAS HEARD ALL 
OVER THE CITY BUT NOT BY THE DWELLING'S OCCUPANTS, WHO WERE ROUSED BY A 
NEIGHBOR.

<P>
The early morning explosion woke the entire neighborhood and sent many 
residents scurrying out of their homes to see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
But Simi Valley resident Curtis McDowell, his wife, Carolyn, and a roommate, 
said they didn't hear a thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know there was a big explosion," Curtis McDowell said of the blast 
that blew the roof off his garage and the subsequent fire that destroyed his 
house Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 6 a.m. in the garage of the McDowell house in the 
1700 block of Wexford Circle, said Debra Davis, a spokeswoman for the Ventura 
County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a whole lot of phone calls," Davis said. "People thought the whole 
block blew up. The whole world in Simi Valley heard it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said it took 35 firefighters about an hour to extinguish the blaze. There 
were no reported injuries, but Davis said the house was destroyed. A restored 
1955 Chevrolet pickup truck in the garage was also destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Cronk, a Ventura County fire investigator, said the exact cause of the 
explosion has not been determined. However, he said that fire officials believe 
that fumes from some type of flammable liquid kept in the garage may have been 
ignited by the pilot light from a nearby water heater. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad everybody got out of there," said Curtis McDowell, who still 
appeared shaken as he talked with fire officials several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell, who works as a bottler at the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in Van Nuys, 
said he did not get home from work until 1 a.m. Thursday. Before he went to 
bed, he said, he took some pain medicine for a foot injury he suffered 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out," McDowell said. "I didn't hear anything." 
</P>
<P>
He awoke to the sound of Lorie Towne, who rents a room from the McDowells, 
pounding on the couple's bedroom door. He said Towne was screaming that a 
burglar was trying to climb in through a window. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell said he reached for a gun that he keeps in the house and went to 
confront the intruder, then realized it was neighbor Ken Van Eaton trying to 
get them out. 
</P>
<P>
Towne said she and Carolyn McDowell had gone to bed about 1:30 a.m. Thursday 
and they also did not hear the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody heard anything," Towne said. "The neighbors said maybe the impact went 
over our heads." 
</P>
<P>
Katheryn Emry said she and her husband, Curtis, live a quarter of a mile away 
and heard the blast loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like the sonic boom when the space shuttle lands," Emry said. 
</P>
<P>
The McDowells' next-door neighbor Pam Brewer said she thought there was an 
earthquake and that her house had caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
When Towne and the McDowells finally got out, they said, they were shocked to 
see the entire house in flames. 
</P>
<P>
"When we ran out and looked back, there was this big ball of fire in front," 
Towne said. "If it wasn't for Ken, we would have had a hell of a time getting 
out. We wouldn't be here."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PROPERTY TAX BILLS TO BE MAILED OCT. 19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PROPERTY TAXES The total assessed value of property in Ventura County has 
increased 59.5% in the last six years. The schools are the recipients of the 
greatest chunck of the revenue from property taxes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than $428 million in property tax bills will be mailed Oct. 19, and 
taxpayers have until Dec. 10 to pay at least the first installment. 
</P>
<P>
The bill can be paid in two equal installments, the second of which is due 
April 10, said John McKinney, assistant treasurer-tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
Bills postmarked after the due dates will be assessed a 10% penalty, he said. 
People who bought property after March 1 and do not receive a tax bill should 
contact the tax collector's office. Failure to receive a tax statement does not 
mean that delinquency penalties will be canceled, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Payments can be mailed or made in person. The tax collector's office will be 
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes represent 1% of the full value of the property. The $428-million 
figure for the county is $53 million more than last year, a 14% increase, and 
is mostly due to new construction, McKinney said. PROPERTY TAXES The total 
assessed value of property in Ventura County has increased 59.5% in the last 
six years. The schools are the recipients of the greatest chunck of the revenue 
from property taxes.

BILL BOYARSKY: CHILDREN NEED MORE THAN TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two candidates for governor have spent a surprising amount of time talking 
about how to improve the lives of California's poorer children. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising because the last two decades have accustomed us to political leaders 
who want to scale down or dismantle government social and educational programs. 
Ronald Reagan set the tone. Howard Jarvis wrote it into the Constitution with 
Proposition 13. Even Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, more liberal than Jarvis but 
sharing his contempt for government, joined the assault with his call to lower 
expectations. And Republican George Deukmejian, once a problem-solving 
pragmatist, has become a grumpy, nay-saying governor. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson are different sorts 
of politicians. They're ex-mayors, problem-solvers accustomed to providing 
basic human services. They really believe government can help. 
</P>
<P>
You can see that when they discuss children's health and schooling. They're 
both aware of the problems -- inadequate prenatal and pediatric care, poorly 
educated youngsters, physical and mental illness, crime, drugs and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein says start young. Almost every day, she talks about her plans for 
early childhood education, which requires strong government involvement. Wilson 
also speaks of children. In downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, he told Town Hall 
-- an organization of business people, lawyers, accountants and other 
bottom-liners -- that he'd raise the quality of California's work force by 
improving children's health and schooling. His goal: "Kids healthy enough to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
What neither candidate is talking about is how they're going to pay for it. For 
improving the lot of poor children would be complicated and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Take the matter of health. Last week I visited Los Angeles County's Hubert H. 
Humphrey Comprehensive Health Center at Slauson Avenue and Main Street. The 
crowded, but well-kept two-story center provides medical care to thousands of 
black and Latino residents of South L.A.'s poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Our health problems are really social problems," said Dr. Delores Gordon 
Alleyne, the medical director. 
</P>
<P>
Alleyne's been around. As a student, she was the second black at the University 
of Louisville Medical School. She interned at County-USC Medical Center, taught 
at the University of Washington and was at a Los Angeles County juvenile hall 
before coming to the Humphrey center. She and her husband, a UCLA law 
professor, have four children, the youngest a 19-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of our children are hungry," she said. "And a lot of our 
families have no visible means of support." 
</P>
<P>
The children at the clinic suffer from ailments common in poverty and 
overcrowded living conditions -- tuberculosis, parasites, lice, hepatitis, 
anemia, dysentery. The current measles epidemic has swept through the packed 
slum apartments and old houses of South L.A. 
</P>
<P>
And the children are afflicted with the emotional stress of living among drug 
dealers and feuding gangs. Alleyne said the Humphrey center sponsored a poster 
contest for fourth graders in two nearby schools. "We asked them to draw 
something about the neighborhood and doctors," she said. "They were all about 
people shooting at people." In the world drawn by the children, the 
neighborhood's most prominent feature is a police helicopter hovering overhead. 
A doctor is someone who arrives in an ambulance. Health means keeping out of 
the way of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Alleyne said, physical and mental health is just one part of a vast 
picture of social and economic ills afflicting poor families. 
</P>
<P>
How's the new governor going to deal with all that? Unfortunately, we won't 
know until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates labor mightily to avoid mentioning a state tax increase. 
Feinstein dodged it during a press conference at the Century Plaza Wednesday. 
The purpose of meeting reporters was to slam Wilson for missing votes in the 
Senate while he was campaigning in California. But toward the end, the subject 
of finances came up. 
</P>
<P>
She favored a federal tax increase, raising taxes for the wealthy as proposed 
by congressional Democrats. But when it came to the state treasury, she lapsed 
into bureaucratese, talking vaguely of managing the money better. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's no better. Also an aficionado of jargon, he wants what he likes to 
call long-term reform of the budgeting process. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein have pinpointed the problem of poor children. They've 
discussed it with a compassion missing from past campaigns. But there's a great 
distance between life around the Humphrey center in South L.A. and the promises 
of a political campaign. What they haven't spelled out is the route to a 
solution.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WON'T BE CHARGED IN FAILED STORE 
ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing insufficient evidence, county prosecutors declined on Thursday to file 
charges against a man arrested in connection with an attempted robbery of a 
Downey discount store and gunfight that left two officers injured. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Tim Fountain, 33, of Downey, was found in a brushy area near the Santa 
Ana freeway behind the Pace warehouse that was invaded before dawn Tuesday by 
six heavily armed would-be robbers. 
</P>
<P>
The holdup went sour when police, alerted by a call from a store employee, 
arrived on the scene. Officers said the robbers communicated with two-way 
radios and wore bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen witnesses failed to identify Fountain as one of the assailants, said 
Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Fountain, a 
parolee from Folsom Prison, remained in custody on a "parole hold" as Downey 
police continued their search for at least five suspects who have eluded a 
manhunt.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN LINKS HIGHER PAY FOR JANITORS TO CRA 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed Community Redevelopment Agency policy that could lead to improved 
wages and health benefits for thousands of Los Angeles janitors, hotel maids 
and low-paid workers received support Thursday from Mayor Tom Bradley and three 
City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, employers whose businesses are built with the help of CRA funds 
would be required to pay workers substantially more than the near-minimum wage 
rates that prevail in the service sector. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the proposal would help address the growing disparity of wealth in 
places such as downtown Los Angeles and Century City, where blacks, Latinos and 
others often work for low pay. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members Gloria Molina, Richard Alatorre and Robert Farrell also 
spoke in favor of the proposal at a City Hall hearing. The CRA is scheduled to 
vote on the plan in late November after a series of public workshops to review 
the policy.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK; 
</P>
<P>
BOARD SEEKS BAN ON ALL HATS AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that banning certain colored hats discriminates against Hispanic 
youths, the Moorpark Board of Education proposed a district policy to ban all 
hats at district schools. 
</P>
<P>
A rancorous school board discussion on the current dress code Tuesday night 
lasted more than three hours and ended with a direction to Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Duffy to develop a policy, approved by the district's legal counsel, that 
bans all hats, not just black, dark blue or red hats often worn by gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing a presentation on the dress code, which has been in effect since 
the beginning of the fall semester and was formulated because of several 
gang-related incidents aimed at Moorpark High School students, board member Pam 
Castro said she wished there had been more sensitivity regarding the dress 
code. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a focus on Hispanics . . . a change of tradition that shows an 
insensitivity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Castro added that many of the youths who hang around together "have been 
friends from day one. I think we should congratulate these kids who wear these 
hats and who maintain a low crime rate in Moorpark," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark High Principal Cary Dritz said that the policy is not discriminatory 
and that no disciplinary action has been taken against any student because the 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The board directed Dritz to continue the policy but to make sure there was no 
discrimination involved and to ask for more input from students. GERRY BRAILO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LICENSE ACTION TARGETS BIGGEST BINGO PARLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proceedings began Thursday to revoke the license of the largest-grossing bingo 
parlor in Los Angeles, with city officials releasing affidavits by four 
ex-workers of the Woodland Hills operation alleging they were illegally paid up 
to $300 a night from skimmed cash. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in an administrative hearing is the bingo license of Identity Inc., a 
charity headed by Edith Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Identity has grossed $28.7 million in bingo proceeds since 1982, almost 20% of 
the bingo take citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was revealed that the state attorney general's office has 
launched a separate civil probe of Identity to determine if the organization's 
officers misused charitable funds. The Los Angeles Police Department also is 
investigating possible criminal misdemeanor violations. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal under state law for people to receive a "profit, wage or salary" 
from the proceeds of a bingo game, all of which, after expenses, are required 
to go to charity.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLEA BARGAIN TALKS IN BRANDO CASE BREAK 
DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind-the-scenes plea bargain negotiations in the Christian Brando murder case 
have broken down, lawyers on both sides said Thursday, and a judge scheduled 
the trial to begin Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's talking settlement now," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Clark told reporters after a brief hearing in Santa Monica Superior Court. 
Both sides indicated last week that they were discussing a possible 
manslaughter plea, even before it became apparent that Brando's sister, 
Cheyenne, could not be forced to return from Tahiti to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said an offer by defense lawyer Robert Shapiro was not accepted. "I can 
tell you this, whatever he's offered we've turned down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said it appears likely that the case will go to trial, although he said 
he remains open to a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas ordered 250 prospective jurors to report, 
explaining that most will be excused for hardship and publicity reasons.

"I'm happy to report that, in the words of one USDA inspector, 'It's a whole 
new place,' " Wachs said after the inspection. He said a new drainage system 
has been installed, food storage areas have been improved and new quality 
control methods have been put in place during the last few weeks.

EFFORT TO REVOKE BINGO HALL'S LICENSE BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
WOODLAND HILLS: IDENTITY INC., WHICH HAS GROSSED $28.7 MILLION SINCE 1982, IS 
FOCUS OF SEVERAL INQUIRIES, INCLUDING ONE INTO WHETHER OFFICERS MISUSED 
CHARITABLE FUNDS.

Proceedings began Thursday to revoke the license of the largest-grossing bingo 
parlor in Los Angeles, with city officials releasing affidavits by four 
ex-workers of the Woodland Hills operation that they were illegally paid up to 
$300 a night from skimmed cash. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in an administrative hearing is the bingo license of Identity Inc., a 
charity headed by Edith Ryan, a woman known at City Hall as the "Queen of 
Bingo." Identity has grossed $28.7 million in bingo proceeds since 1982, nearly 
20% of the bingo take citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was revealed that the state attorney general's office has 
launched a separate civil investigation of Identity to determine if the 
organization's officers misused charitable funds and that the Los Angeles 
Police Department also is investigating possible criminal misdemeanor 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
A search warrant was served on Identity and Ryan on Aug. 13 and numerous 
records were seized at that time, according to Detective Roberta Squire of the 
Police Department's administrative vice unit. Squire said the records were 
being shared with the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi confirmed Thursday that his office was 
investigating Identity. Laws enforced by his unit, the registry of charitable 
trusts, primarily seek to prevent officers of charities from diverting 
charitable donations for their personal enrichment, Cordi said. 
</P>
<P>
Identity is licensed to operate a bingo hall on De Soto Avenue near Oxnard 
Street to raise money to support a free physical and psychological therapy 
program for disabled young adults. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 64, denied in an interview Thursday that she had ever paid her bingo 
workers and contended that, to the contrary, she was the victim of a plot by 
volunteer workers disgruntled by her refusal to pay them illegally and by her 
attempts to crack down on their pilferage of charitable funds. 
</P>
<P>
"They're lying," Ryan said of her accusers. She said she runs a "good, strong, 
legitimate charity" and that several Police Department officers who worked 
off-duty for Identity as security personnel would testify on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal under state law for anyone to receive a "profit, wage or salary" 
from the proceeds of a bingo game, all of which, after expenses, are required 
to go to charity. The "wisdom of this law is to prevent bingo from becoming 
commercial gambling," said Robert Burns, chief of the city Department of Social 
Services. Burns' department regulates charitable fund-raising activities in the 
city, including bingo games. 
</P>
<P>
City records show Identity grosses about $300,000 per month in bingo proceeds. 
Since February, 1982, when it first offered the games, Identity's gross bingo 
proceeds have represented 19.7% of the money raised by the city's 72 charities 
with bingo licenses, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Identity operates three games a week and generally has nearly 350 people 
playing per game, the nonprofit corporation has said in documents filed with 
the city department. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 19, Burns ordered Identity to suspend its bingo operations and notified 
Ryan of his intent to revoke its license. Soon after, Ryan appealed Burns' 
order, allowing Identity to continue operation while the case is heard. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said he moved to revoke Identity's license after former workers 
approached him with stories of receiving illegal salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Dean of Sherman Oaks, listed both as secretary and chief financial 
officer of Identity on various public documents, claimed that she was paid 
"$300 per night (three times per week)" in a sworn affidavit taken by the 
department Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I know bingo proceeds were used to pay me because I was there when Edith Ryan 
took the money from sales," Dean's affidavit said. "Payment was always in cash 
at some time during the evening. Most times I was paid in $50 or $100 bills 
unless I asked for smaller bills." 
</P>
<P>
City bingo regulators are entitled under the law to audit the books of bingo 
games to protect against illicit payments. Dean contended, however, that Ryan 
threw away records for one table where "extra games, early birds, late birds 
and jackpots are sold." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Houseman of Simi Valley said she was paid $100 per night and that a code 
was used by Ryan to indicate when her pay would be available under a first-aid 
kit. She said that "Edith Ryan puts the money under the box and tells us to go 
get our 'paperwork.' ('Paperwork' means our pay.)" 
</P>
<P>
Also attesting to the payments were Debra Basham of Van Nuys and Jeanne Maxey 
of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
All four of the women declined initially to talk to reporters. But Houseman 
finally said Ryan "always says she's the victim of thieving employees." 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a misdemeanor under state law to pay workers of a charitable 
bingo game, the Police Department is also investigating the women's charges, 
Squire said. 
</P>
<P>
Due to a mix-up in finding a court reporter, no testimony was given in the case 
Thursday. Additional hearings, however, were scheduled for Oct. 25, 29 and Nov. 
30.

5 RESTRAINED DRIVER FOR BLOOD TEST, OFFICER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: PATRICIA LEE GIUNTA, CHARGED WITH RUNNING DOWN A MOTORCYCLIST, HAD AN 
ALCOHOL LEVEL OF 0.29%, THREE TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT, RECORDS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Newhall woman on trial for allegedly killing a motorcyclist while driving 
drunk had to be held down by four officers and a jail nurse in order to test 
her blood-alcohol level after the accident, a California Highway patrol officer 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Lee Giunta, who has had five other drunk-driving arrests and one 
conviction, also struggled with officers when she was arrested after the crash, 
CHP Officer Frank Lewis testified at Giunta's trial on a charge of vehicular 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The accident on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley on Oct. 4, 1989, killed 
a Canadian student, David Jaggs, 24, and seriously injured his wife of one 
month, Janine, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Giunta, 41, twice agreed to breath and blood tests, but then refused 
to cooperate. Finally, Lewis said, he, another CHP officer, two jail officers 
and a jail nurse restrained Giunta on a gurney while blood was drawn from her 
arm to determine the amount of alcohol in her system. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Giunta's blood-alcohol content was 0.29% -- more 
than three times the level at which a motorist is considered legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs, ironically, was the son of an Anglican priest who counsels alcoholics 
and drug addicts in Windsor, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Robert Koetting, who investigated the case, said it is "highly 
unusual" for a drunk-driving suspect to resist a blood-alcohol test to the 
point where it must be performed forcibly. 
</P>
<P>
But refusal was not unusual for Giunta, who prosecutors said was acquitted in 
two previous drunk-driving cases largely because she had refused to submit to 
blood-alcohol tests, which are usually the key prosecution evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Officers cannot force a drunk-driving suspect to submit to blood-alcohol tests 
unless they are making a felony arrest for an accident in which someone was 
killed or injured, as was the case when Giunta was arrested following the crash 
that killed Jaggs. Refusal to allow such a test, however, is grounds for 
revocation of the suspect's driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Bill Gengler said Giunta's license was 
revoked for two years in January for the accident that killed Jaggs and again 
in April for refusing a blood-alcohol test after she was arrested on another 
drunk-driving charge while free on bail in the current case. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators describe Giunta as a shrewd defendant who knows how to manipulate 
the legal system and play up to juries in order to secure an acquittal or 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"After five trials, I think she knows what to do," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Carol Whyte. Whyte lost the case in August in which Giunta was accused of 
driving drunk while free on bail less than a month after the accident that 
killed Jaggs. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fernandez, Giunta's attorney, who also has represented her in three 
previous drunk-driving cases, said authorities are pursuing his client with 
unnecessary vigor and accused past investigators of lying about evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a mentality that she's slipped through the system and that they have 
to convict her at any cost," Fernandez said. "I do believe they want to put her 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who declined to talk about the current trial, said Giunta "has not 
beat the system through any kind of tactics. The juries absolved her." 
</P>
<P>
In all but one of Giunta's five other arrests, she has either been acquitted or 
had the cases dismissed. In 1983, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to 
perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ken Jaggs, the dead man's father, who has worked for 23 years 
counseling alcoholics and drug addicts, said Thursday that the death of his son 
has affected his work. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Jaggs, 62, said he now confronts patients more aggressively with the 
possible consequences of their addictions. He said jail is appropriate for 
repeat offenders provided they receive treatment while locked up. 
</P>
<P>
Although he refused to comment on the case against Giunta, Jaggs said "we want 
to see justice done." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors interviewed this week said they were discouraged that her previous 
arrests are not admissible evidence in Giunta's trial. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a danger to society and the sad thing is that you have 12 members of the 
community who don't know what a danger she is," Whyte said.

CASINO DATA SEIZED AS PART OF INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators served search warrants on 
a small casino in Huntington Park this week, seizing records and forcing the 
closure of the club for four hours, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The management of the Huntington Park Casino is the subject of a 10-month 
investigation, said Deputy George Ducoulombier. 
</P>
<P>
Search warrants were also served on three other locations, but records 
detailing which documents were confiscated were unavailable Thursday. There 
were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Records were seized from the Huntington Park Club Corp., the general partner 
that manages the Huntington Park Casino, sheriff's deputies said. Curtis J. 
Fresch, 39, is manager of the casino and president of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also seized documents from H.P. Disposal Co., of which Curtis 
Fresch's father, Eugene C. Fresch, 68, is president and primary owner. 
Sheriff's investigators would not disclose the other locations that were 
searched. 
</P>
<P>
The Fresches could not be reached for comment Thursday. A source close to the 
investigation said the probe was based on tips provided by a disgruntled former 
employee of H.P. Disposal Co. 
</P>
<P>
State employment and alcoholic beverage control officials were present during 
the searches. Representatives of the Internal Revenue Service and Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office also accompanied deputies, Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials on Thursday were awaiting word of the investigation. The 
stability of the casino is critical to Huntington Park because it provides the 
city with revenues of about $500,000 a year, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably (worth) about five policemen," Councilman William P. Cunningham 
said. "They are the largest taxpayer in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Detective Zoe Grillas confirmed the search took place but declined to 
reveal details of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Fresch and his brother, Eric T. Fresch, opened the casino in 1984. Their 
father, a former Las Vegas casino owner, founded H.P. Disposal in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council fired its previous trash hauler -- Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc. 
-- and awarded the contract to H.P. Disposal a month later, even though Fresch 
was new to the business, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other trash firms offered the city higher franchise fees, records show. The 
contract with H.P. Disposal generates about $1.5 million a year in gross 
billings. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas E. Jackson, who spearheaded the trash hauling negotiations for the 
city, said at the time that he was a friend of the Fresches and trusted them to 
do an excellent job.

CRA PLAN TO HIKE PAY OF JANITORS AND MAIDS WINS POLITICAL SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: BRADLEY, 3 COUNCILMEN AND LABOR LEADERS BACK PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE 
EMPLOYERS GETTING CITY FUNDS TO INCREASE WAGES. 
</P>

<P>
A proposed Community Redevelopment Agency policy that could lead to improved 
wages and health benefits for thousands of Los Angeles janitors, hotel maids 
and other low-paid workers received support Thursday from Mayor Tom Bradley, 
three City Council members and a host of trade union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would require employers whose businesses are built with the help of 
city redevelopment funds to guarantee wages substantially higher than the 
near-minimum wage rates that now prevail in the service sector. 
</P>
<P>
Future hotel and office construction projects in more than a dozen 
redevelopment areas from North Hollywood and San Pedro to Little Tokyo in 
downtown Los Angeles could be affected, CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the policy would help address the growing disparity of wealth in 
places such as downtown and Century City, where blacks, Latinos and others 
often toil for miserly pay in gleaming high-rise office buildings and luxury 
hotels. One dispute over working conditions for Century City janitors led to a 
series of boisterous protests earlier this year. The janitors eventually won 
union recognition, wage increases and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate that we turn our attention to sharing the wealth," Bradley 
told the CRA's board of commissioners. "Those benefits must be shared from the 
basement to the boardroom." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members Gloria Molina, Richard Alatorre and Robert Farrell also 
spoke in favor of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA board is scheduled to vote on the proposal, said to be the first of its 
kind in the nation, in late November. The agency will schedule a series of 
public workshops to review the policy, officials said. The plan does not need 
City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is likely to face especially strong opposition from downtown 
development interests. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Central City Assn. of 
Los Angeles said the policy, as now drafted, could limit future downtown 
commercial investment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about the overall economic ramifications of this at a time 
when the economy is slowing and the real estate market is flattening out," said 
Carol Schatz, director of government relations for the association. "There are 
other cities very close to downtown that are competing for development dollars 
and that do not have policies such as this." 
</P>
<P>
As drafted, the guidelines would apply only to projects employing more than 10 
full-time service employees and with construction costs greater than $100,000, 
CRA officials said. Only future CRA-backed projects would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 members of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, Local 11, and 
members of the group "Justice for Janitors" attended the City Hall hearing 
Thursday in support of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Guerrero, a 32-year-old bellman at a downtown hotel, told the CRA board 
members that he supports his wife and two children on an hourly wage of $4.45. 
</P>
<P>
"I take home less than $600 every month. . . . It's very hard," he said in 
Spanish. "We think this policy is very important for all the new hotel workers 
downtown who will face problems like the ones we are now facing if you don't do 
something to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
CRA board chairman Jim Wood, the No. 2 official in the Los Angeles County 
Federation of Labor, said the agency drafted the proposed policy after 
discovering last year that janitors who cleaned the agency's Spring Street 
offices were earning only $4.25 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major issue; it gets at the heart of our city," said Wood, a Bradley 
appointee to the CRA board.

DEPUTIES PORTRAYED AS CRIMINALS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: PROSECUTOR SAYS THEY CROSSED THE 'THIN BLUE LINE.' DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY 
THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE IS BASED ON SELF-SERVING TESTIMONY FROM A FORMER 
COLLEAGUE OF THEIR CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the opening day of their historic trial, seven Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
narcotics officers, accused of skimming $1.4 million in seized drug money, were 
portrayed Thursday by a prosecutor as corrupt deputies who "had crossed the 
thin blue line" from law enforcers to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
With those words, Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann began laying out the 
federal government's case against the veteran deputies who are the first 
narcotics officers charged in a two-year investigation into alleged thefts of 
seized drug cash within the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a case about good police work," Hagemann told jurors in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. "This is a case about police corruption. It's a 
case about cops turning to crime." 
</P>
<P>
Hagemann's opening arguments before Judge Edward Rafeedie and a six-man, 
six-woman jury marked the start of what is expected to be a weeks-long trial in 
a corruption case sheriff's officials have called the worst scandal in the 
department's recent history. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-count indictment against the deputies, who were once elite members of 
the sheriff's major narcotics investigation teams, claims that the officers 
skimmed money during drug raids in 1988 and 1989, lied in police reports to 
cover up those thefts, and later spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of the 
stolen cash on boats, cars, vacation homes, jewelry and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
In his 45-minute statement, Hagemann told jurors that the prosecution would 
provide financial documents outlining some of those purchases, including one 
deputy's expenditure of $44,000 during a single month. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors also will view a videotape in which some of the deputies allegedly 
stole $48,000 in cash from an undercover FBI agent during a 1989 sting 
operation. The panel will learn that some of the sting money was found in the 
homes and cars of several deputies, Hagemann said. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors will also hear drug traffickers and money launderers testify that 
deputies stole money from them. The jury will listen to secret tape recordings 
of conversations in which the deputies implicate themselves, the prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the government will produce its chief witness -- former sheriff's Sgt. 
Robert R. Sobel, who has pleaded guilty to his role in the thefts and has 
agreed to testify against his former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"(These) men, as the evidence will show, chose to cross over to the other side 
of the thin blue line," Hagemann told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, in their opening statements, wasted little time attacking 
the government's case as one built on misleading statements, an inconclusive 
videotape and allegations of excessive spending that can be explained by the 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In ripping into the prosecution's case, the attorneys reserved particular scorn 
for Sobel, who once commanded the defendants as their sergeant on one of the 
narcotics teams and who has been promised leniency by the government in 
exchange for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"He sold his soul and poured out his heart (to prosecutors)," said attorney 
Vicki Podberesky, who represents Deputy James R. Bauder. "Robert Sobel is an 
informant. He is a rat. And a rat will do anything he can to survive, even 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Sobel the key to the government's case, attorney James Riddet, who 
represents Deputy Eufrasio G. Cortez, said Sobel has an admitted history of 
thefts, beatings and planting of evidence on suspects by some of his earlier 
narcotics teams and is falsely accusing his former deputies to avoid 
prosecution on those misconduct charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show that Mr. Sobel turned that (legal) system upside down 
for his own greedy purposes," Riddet said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bauder and Cortez, the defendants are Deputies Terrell H. Amers, 
Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Macario M. Duran and Daniel M. Garner. 
Duran's wife, Maria, also is standing trial for allegedly laundering some of 
the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Two other indicted deputies, Nancy A. Brown and Michael J. Kaliterna, face a 
separate trial because of a legal dispute over the propriety of evidence seized 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
In their opening remarks, the attorneys representing the remaining defendants 
sought to depict their clients as experienced, decorated narcotics officers who 
had often risked their lives on the job and had unblemished records until they 
were swept up in the money-skimming scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"This was really the cream of the crop, the elite, the top officers of the 
Sheriff's Department," said Jay Lichtman, Daub's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Hagemann contended that the deputies had amassed a small fortune in stolen drug 
cash, confident that the practice would not be exposed because the victims were 
drug dealers and money launderers who would not be believed and that none of 
the deputies would break "the police code of silence" that protected their 
fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most damaging evidence that Hagemann said the prosecution would 
introduce is the discovery of marked money from the FBI sting at the homes or 
in the cars of several deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Charles Goldwasser, who represents Dickenson, said his client had 
found $2,940 in marked money in an envelope in his office desk on the day after 
the sting, but took it home because he was afraid someone was setting him up 
and he did not know whom to trust. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said Dickenson took the money home for safekeeping, with the intent 
of contacting someone he could trust.

RENEWAL THREATENS 3 TORRANCE LANDMARKS

<P>
Customers of the ancient Newberry's in old downtown Torrance have been sifting 
the shelves for bargains with added intensity in recent days, aware that the 
store soon could be a memory. 
</P>
<P>
Up the street at the Torrance Community Theatre, stunned stagehands and actors 
try to make sense of the news that their performing space also may be gone. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Torrance Supermarket, where the cashiers still know everyone's name, 
shoppers grumble about the disruptions that may upset their quiet lives. 
</P>
<P>
The three downtown landmarks are among more than a dozen buildings that might 
soon be shattered by a wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
A $35-million, four-acre redevelopment plan announced last month by a local 
developer and a major property owner calls for pumping life back into the 
flagging downtown economy by replacing a number of retail buildings with 175 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The project also calls for replacing a dilapidated downtown residential hotel 
with more than 25,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
The developers, who have not yet filed formal plans with the city, say they 
want to spend several weeks listening to community reaction before they do so. 
Once the plans are filed, approval could take six months, with groundbreaking 
coming six months after that. 
</P>
<P>
Although greeted warmly last month by City Council members and planners as a 
solid step toward revitalizing downtown's economy, the residents, merchants and 
customers of downtown are reacting to the plans with a mixture of anger and 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this place because it's a little downtown neighborhood where people are 
friendly and everybody knows everybody," said Linda Stokoe, who owns Linda's 
World, a small crafts shop on Cravens Avenue scheduled for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than trying to relocate -- something Stokoe said would be impossible at 
her current monthly rent of 45 cents per square foot -- Stokoe said she will 
retire early and leave the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of a project they're talking about, it's going to ruin the 
atmosphere in downtown Torrance," she said. "I don't blame them for wanting to 
make money off their property, but the original idea of redevelopment was that 
they would fix this up as a downtown area. . . . If you take out these 
buildings and put in condos, you're taking out all the memories, all that's 
good about downtown." 
</P>
<P>
John Geyer, owner of MCB Paint and Decorating Center on Marcelina Avenue, put 
it even more strongly. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put a residential building in the heart of the commercial area, 
eventually you will kill downtown Torrance," he said, adding that he intends to 
launch a campaign against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the project's backers, Gascon Mar Ltd. of San Diego and Sam Levy 
Investments of Torrance, say the idea behind the project is sound. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go back to the original plans developed for the downtown area, you'll 
see that it was always intended to be residential mixed with commercial," said 
Allan Mackenzie, a partner with Gascon Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely no intention of demolishing the commercial heart of 
downtown. We would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the three-site project would enhance retail activity in the 
area that makes up downtown's true commercial heart while providing sorely 
needed affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Plans calls for refurbishing the historic facade of the Newberry's store on El 
Prado and Sartori Avenue while removing the rear of the building to provide 
more parking. The site then would be divided into space for several smaller 
retail tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, the El Roitan/1920 residential hotel and two adjacent city-owned 
parking lots, which form a crescent-shaped parcel at Cabrillo Avenue and 
Torrance Boulevard, would make way for a 100-unit condominium complex and 
25,000 square feet of new retail space. Units in the complex would cost from 
$130,000 to $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mackenzie said Gascon Mar would build the Torrance Community Theatre a new 
space in that area to replace the old movie house that it now calls home. The 
theater company would be responsible for turning the structure into a theater. 
</P>
<P>
The third site, an L-shaped parcel to be created at El Prado and Cravens 
Avenue, is where most demolition will take place. Occupants now include the 
market and the theater, a used book store, a Salvation Army thrift shop, a 
coffee shop, and several offices -- all of which would be gone. 
</P>
<P>
They would be replaced by three-story condominium buildings with a total of 75 
units costing from $175,000 to $275,000. Mackenzie said the design would blend 
with existing downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The architectural style would include abundant use of arches, trellises, 
setbacks, lofts, decks, balconies and curved windows, Mackenzie said. "We don't 
want to do something like the Coleman Court building across the street, which 
is a flat street wall 40 feet high. That is very specifically something we want 
to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Medians uprooted by tree roots along El Prado and Sartori Avenue would be 
eliminated, Mackenzie said, to allow a return to parallel parking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their effort to win over downtown's merchants, residents and 
customers, the developers plan to open an information center in the next month 
near one of the project sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome everyone's comments, and we're trying to incorporate all kinds of 
ideas because it's not going to work if the community doesn't like it," 
Mackenzie said. "Once people understand the project . . . they feel much better 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers at the community theater say they are investigating how to have 
their old movie house designated a historic monument. But they hold little hope 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do what we can, but I think ultimately we are going to have to 
leave," said George Adams, who has been everything from director to producer to 
actor with the group. "I'm depressed about it." 
</P>
<P>
Joel McCloud, president of the Downtown Torrance Merchants Assn., said he is 
coming to grips with his remaining qualms about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We need changes downtown, and I respect what they're trying to do," said 
McCloud, who operates a real estate acquisition firm. "If you had an ideal 
world, it would be great to keep the commercial down here just where it is . . 
. but it's awkward to bring enough traffic in here to really justify better 
retail-type tenancy down here . . . without creating the additional residential 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime customers of the area, however, said they doubt they will ever get 
used to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible. I think it should stay just like it is," said James Mouton, 68, 
who stops by the Salvation Army thrift store on El Prado several times a week. 
"They want to make a human jungle out of it. All they're thinking about is the 
all-mighty dollar, the long green." 
</P>
<P>
Most said they fear the project will destroy the area's old-time atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it in here. It's old-fashioned and it just invites you to wander 
around," said Wilhelmina Routh as she searched for bargains at the Newberry's 
store. "It reminds me of the East, where we had little five-and-dimes where we 
could find special things. You don't have that anywhere else around here."

EDUCATION HERMOSA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL BOARD BACKS PLAN FOR SINGLE 3-CITY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle over reorganizing the beach cities' schools gained a new -- and 
controversial -- wrinkle this week, when Hermosa Beach trustees endorsed a plan 
to dismantle their tiny one-school district and create a single school system 
encompassing their city, Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous decision Wednesday before about 75 parents and teachers was 
greeted with a mixture of resignation and dismay -- resignation from parents 
who had once hoped to save their cash-strapped school, and dismay from trustees 
in the other two cities. 
</P>
<P>
"They know the other districts will never go for total unification," fumed 
Redondo Beach Board President Bart Swanson. Redondo Beach trustees, he said, 
have been working for more than a year on a plan to create a kindergarten 
through 12th-grade district for that city, and Manhattan Beach trustees want to 
merge their schools with Hermosa Beach to create a second unified district. 
</P>
<P>
If school officials in the three cities could agree on a unification proposal, 
they could bring it to the local voters within a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a stall," Swanson said. "This is just one small school district 
that has decided to hold everything up." 
</P>
<P>
Currently there are four school districts for the South Bay's three beach 
cities: an elementary district in each city, and a high school district for 
Redondo Union High School and Manhattan Beach's Mira Costa High School. Tiny 
Hermosa Beach, which is flanked by the other two cities, has no high school of 
its own, but has clung tenaciously to its local district, despite a shrinking 
budget and years of low enrollment, which eventually forced the closure of all 
but one of the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Unification has been under serious discussion among the four districts for 
almost two years. The matter first came up in 1989, when the South Bay Union 
High School District invited the elementary districts to consider merging with 
it in an effort to shore up sagging finances. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate has been emotional and fraught with longstanding divisions among 
the three beach cities. Redondo Beach trustees, for instance, decided soon 
after the talks began to try to create their own unified school district, 
because they feared only one high school would be needed in a new consolidated 
district and that Redondo Union might be closed. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, volunteers in Redondo Beach have been circulating petitions 
for a plan that would pull Redondo Union High School away from the high school 
district and unify it with the city's elementary schools for a Redondo Beach 
kindergarten through 12th-grade district. 
</P>
<P>
Left to their own devices, the other three school districts hired a consultant 
to help them decide on a reorganization plan. The consultant recommended in May 
that Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach merge their schools, pull Mira Costa 
High School from the high school district and create a unified school system of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach trustees support that plan. The high school district -- 
which would be dismantled under the two-district scenario -- has agreed to go 
along with whatever the elementary districts want. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hermosa Beach board has refused to commit to the two-district plan. 
Part of the reason has to do with the reluctance of Hermosa Beach to be the 
only one of the three cities to be left without a school system of its own. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, through baby booms and times of dwindling enrollment alike, 
Hermosa Beach has clung stubbornly to the notion of home rule for its schools. 
In recent years, however, the district -- like many others in the state -- has 
had to cut one program after another because of state-level budget cuts. 
Meanwhile, enrollment has risen sharply in recent years, crowding the 
classrooms of Hermosa Beach's one school and leaving its faculty short-staffed 
and overworked. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good singers here, and we don't have a good music program," Angela 
Jones, the school's business manager, told the board. "We have good artists 
here, but we don't have a real art program. We have children who can build 
things with their hands, and we have nothing to offer them. If you want a 
future for your kids, think about unification." 
</P>
<P>
But to reap what unification might offer in better programs and economies of 
scale, the districts would have to overcome longstanding and lingering 
differences that still haunt the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Manhattan has always treated us like ugly sister -- 'You can play with us, but 
we make the rules,' " charged Pete Tucker, a Hermosa Beach parent and Little 
League coach. "If we go with Manhattan, I'm afraid they'll steamroller right 
over us." 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach Trustee Joe Mark urged parents to overcome such "them and us" 
attitudes but added that he believed a single, unified district might allow 
Hermosa Beach to take advantage of unification without expense to its local 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
"You end up with just one administration, but Redondo Beach still has its 
school, Manhattan Beach has its school, and we have ours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, many in his city believe a single district is inevitable, 
and a two-district plan simply prolongs the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Wednesday will now force each city to come up with an independent 
reorganization plan and gather sufficient signatures to qualify it for 
consideration by state and county education authorities. Any plan that 
qualifies and passes muster at the state level would then have to be placed on 
a local ballot and voted on. 
</P>
<P>
To become eligible for consideration by the State Board of Education, any 
reorganization plan must be accompanied by petitions bearing the signatures of 
25% of the registered voters in the cities involved. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach trustees said they need about 10,000 signatures to qualify their 
plan, but so far have gathered only about 6,000, because voters in the city 
have difficulty grasping the complexities of school management. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach trustees, who want to unify with Hermosa Beach, would need the 
signatures of about 5,500 voters in Manhattan Beach and about 3,000 voters in 
Hermosa Beach, if they were to decide to press forward with their plan. 
</P>
<P>
And Hermosa Beach trustees would need to match the efforts of both those 
cities, gathering about 18,500 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
If all four districts could agree on a configuration, there would be no need 
for petition drives. The plan would go directly to the state level, and, if 
approved, would be sent back to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach Board President Mary Lou Weiss acknowledged that Hermosa Beach's 
task is daunting and said her board may be forced to compromise in a few 
months, if the petition drive fails to gather steam. But she said the slow pace 
of Redondo Beach's petition drive may be due to a lack of support for the 
two-district plan in that city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking the easy road by any means, but we're doing what we think is 
best," she said.

WORD PROCESSOR TO AID STUDENT WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By AMELIA CHAFFEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
English students at Santa Paula's continuation high school will do their 
writing on a word processor for the first time this year, thanks to a grant 
from a national writing program and matching funds from local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Anderson, English teacher at Renaissance High School, said she will 
receive $3,000 to buy a word processor and software from the Southern 
California Writing Project and Santa Paula companies. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old project teaches writing from an evaluation of how the brain 
creates, rather than from a grammar textbook, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said she sometimes finds herself at odds with other teachers who 
insist students learn grammar before attempting to write. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my contention that students already think -- the brain does that -- and 
if they can deep-think, it is easy for them to put what they already know on 
paper if it is presented to them properly, and they can write out their own 
lives," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's students will keep a family history scrapbook this year, collecting 
recipes, photographs and stories of their ancestors, "because the past is 
important and because they are experts about their own families," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They will use three electric typewriters Anderson already had, as well as the 
new word processor, to complete the project. As they begin to type their 
reports, Anderson has found the students become interested in style and 
grammar. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has also found her students write more willingly when they have an 
audience. This year, they are corresponding with servicemen in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an exemplary program, which turns the students on to writing," said 
Supt. Carolina Erie. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's students, many of whom have had discipline or attendance problems 
and haven't succeeded at the traditional high school, score very well in the 
reflective writing sections of California Assessment Program tests, Erie said.

TEACHERS ENDORSE 3 FOR SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teachers' union of the Hueneme Elementary School District has endorsed 
three of the nine candidates running for board seats in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
The Hueneme Education Assn. endorsed incumbent Elaine K. Garber and challengers 
Gail Suval and Bob Edwards for the three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, based on a unanimous vote of faculty members representing the 
district's 11 schools, was the first endorsement in the union's history, 
President Donna Branstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials and members of the California School Employees Assn. quizzed 
six of the nine candidates on issues such as the budget, bilingual education 
and class size. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt there were so many candidates that an endorsement would help people 
make an informed decision," Branstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Some challengers have complained that all the board members have held office 
too long and that none now have children in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Garber received the endorsement despite being one of the senior members of the 
board, with 31 years of experience. Two of the endorsed candidates, Suval and 
Edwards, have children in district schools. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates are incumbents Jose C. Babauta and James K. Tipton, and 
challengers Darlene A. Bruno, Cheryl R. Hamilton, Jon Van Tilburg and Toni 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
All the candidates have been invited to a PTA public forum scheduled for 7 p.m. 
Nov. 1 at Blackstock Junior High School, 710 Bard Road, Oxnard. ADRIANNE

DR. ROBERT F. BRANDON; FORMER COUNCILMAN, DENTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Robert F. Brandon, a retired dentist and former Burbank city councilman 
instrumental in the construction of the Burbank Central Library and the Golden 
Mall, has died of cancer at his Burbank home. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Bellevue, Pa., Brandon graduated from the University of Iowa School 
of Dentistry in 1936. He served as a dentist in the U.S. Army during World War 
II, at the rank of captain. After the war, he practiced dentistry in Westwood 
Village before settling in Burbank in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
His political career began in 1957 when he was appointed to the Burbank Park 
and Recreation Board. He resigned late the following year to run for the City 
Council, to which he was elected in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
His eight-year tenure on the City Council was marked by extensive capital 
improvements, including the construction of the Burbank Central Library, the 
Golden Mall, the Castaway restaurant and De Bell Municipal Golf Course in 
Burbank, said former Mayor Dallas Williams. "He was a very quiet, capable and 
professional man," Williams said. "I always knew where he was coming from; he 
stood there honestly. He was a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of rapid transit throughout Los Angeles, Brandon was appointed to 
the Southern California Rapid Transit District's board of directors in 1964 and 
predicted in 1967 that the ultimate grid of freeways planned for the county 
"will make the area unlivable because of the smog . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Brandon served twice as mayor, in 1961-62 and in 1966-67, leaving public office 
after he was defeated in his run for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
He served on the board of directors of the former Magnolia Park Chamber of 
Commerce, as president of the Magnolia Park Optimist Club in 1955-56, treasurer 
of the Burbank Symphony Assn.'s board of directors, president of the Burbank 
Red Cross, and as a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles City 
and County Health Board. 
</P>
<P>
An Eagle Scout himself, Brandon was a scoutmaster in Burbank and was involved 
with the Burbank YMCA. During the 1950s, he played the drums in a local group 
called the Tone Deaf Five. He was named Citizen of the Year in 1956 by the 
Burbank Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
He retired from dentistry in 1970. An avid boat racer and member of the Bahia 
Corinthian Yacht Club in Newport Beach, he participated for 12 consecutive 
years in the Newport Beach-to-Ensenada, Mexico, yacht race during the 1960s and 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Ione Brandon; a daughter, Debra Brandon 
of Chatsworth; a brother, Dr. Frank Brandon of Philadelphia, Pa.; and two 
grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 4 p.m. Sunday at the First United Methodist 
Church, 700 N. Glenoaks Blvd. in Burbank. Forest Lawn Mortuary-Hollywood Hills 
is handling the arrangements. Donations can be made in Brandon's name to the 
St. Joseph Medical Center hospice program.

RUSH-HOUR ACCIDENTS SNARL SAN DIEGO FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: IN ONE OF THE FOUR CRASHES, A CAR WAS CRUSHED BENEATH A GASOLINE 
TANKER TRUCK. THE DRIVER ESCAPED WITH ONLY MINOR INJURIES.

<P>
Four separate accidents on the San Diego Freeway, including one in which a 
tanker truck crushed a car, shut down the southbound lanes for more than an 
hour Thursday morning, jamming rush-hour traffic throughout the northern San 
Fernando Valley, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
In the most spectacular accident, a car traveling south near Roscoe Boulevard 
veered out of control about 6 a.m. and struck the front wheels of an empty 
gasoline tanker truck. The car was dragged under the trailer and was partially 
crushed beneath the back wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really remarkable, amazing," CHP Officer Dave Grajeda said. "This car 
was pretty much smashed with the truck wheels on top of his car, but this guy 
was able to sit in his vehicle while he was being rescued." 
</P>
<P>
The driver, David P. Schmidt, 47, of Muskogee, Okla., was conscious during the 
hourlong rescue and at one point offered to try to crawl out of his Dodge Aries 
rental car, Sgt. Richard Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt received only minor cuts and bruises. He was taken to Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys and was released after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which involved two other cars, shut down the southbound lanes 
from 6 a.m. until 7:15 a.m., backing up both the San Diego and Simi Valley 
freeways. The drivers in the two other vehicles were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
The three other accidents, all within a mile of the tanker crash, snarled the 
freeway during the morning rush hour from Victory Boulevard to beyond Roscoe 
Boulevard. Surface streets were also clogged, the CHP reported. 
</P>
<P>
In one collision, a Los Angeles Unified School District trash truck lost 
control and overturned when it swerved to avoid slamming into a lane of 
slow-moving cars, Barton said. The truck driver was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
The other accidents were minor collisions and the drivers were not injured, the 
CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is one big crash, everyone is in a hurry to get to work and they 
are not really paying attention," Grajeda said. "Everything kind of all fell 
apart out there this morning. It was a real mess."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANNERS VOTE TO LIMIT LANDFILL'S EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Planning Commission on Thursday sent its final 
recommendation on Sunshine Canyon Landfill expansion plans to the Board of 
Supervisors, which will make the final decisions in late November or December. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 3 to 0 to allow dump owners, Browning-Ferris Industries, 
to expand the landfill capacity by 17 million tons, rather than the 70 million 
tons the company requested. 
</P>
<P>
The commission did not close the door on later expansions but recommended that 
additional capacity increases require a new round of county approvals. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote finalized a tentative commission decision that was made on 
Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reduced dumping capacity, the commission approved the 
removal of about 4,000 oak trees in the canyon, which would be eliminated from 
county maps as an ecologically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
Dump opponents are expected to appeal the recommendation to the Board of 
Supervisors and ask members to deny Browning-Ferris any permit to expand. BFI 
officials will ask the board to grant them the full-expansion permit. 
</P>
<P>
County planners said the board will further review the proposal and hear more 
testimony from opposing sides before their final vote.

STUDENT PAPER AT HARBOR COLLEGE RESUMES PUBLICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNICE HIRABAYASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The student paper at Los Angeles Harbor College, which shut down last month 
because of budget cuts, resumed publication this week after a series of news 
stories publicized the paper's demise and students petitioned the 
administration for its reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tides looks great," said Chris McCarthy, director of the communications 
division. "It looks better than it ever has." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said publicity helped bring the campus voice back to the two-year 
community college in Wilmington. The semester's first issue came out Wednesday. 
McCarthy said two journalism classes, one of which puts out the paper, were 
targeted for cancellation in August by college administrators, who set 
enrollment limits for the classes to zero, effectively barring students from 
signing up. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first two weeks of the semester we didn't allow anybody to enroll," 
McCarthy said. "After the (newspaper) articles appeared, I got a call from the 
president saying we had part-time funds available." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said he then contacted Phillip Sanfield, a news editor for the Daily 
Breeze, who agreed to take the post as adviser for the student paper. Sanfield 
was co-adviser to the weekly paper last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the college could only offer Sanfield, 32, part-time pay for what 
amounts to a full-time job, Sanfield said he could not stand by and watch the 
paper fold. 
</P>
<P>
"You never want to see students who are interested in journalism not have 
anywhere to go," he said. "I don't think anybody who is associated with this 
business wants to see a college paper close." 
</P>
<P>
So Sanfield, who continues to work at the Breeze and did not plan to teach this 
year, began teaching the reopened journalism classes three weeks after the fall 
semester started. He said the paper would be published every other week instead 
of weekly because of budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Sanfield said many students learned about the paper's demise through articles 
that appeared in three local papers. Students who had not been associated with 
the paper petitioned college administrators to reinstate the paper, and past 
writers for The Harbor Tides bombarded the communications department and 
Sanfield with phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the students who called Sanfield was Alex Carrillo, 22. "The effect (of 
the publicity) was enormous," he said, adding that he learned about the 
shutdown from a newspaper story. "I've been writing for this paper for a year, 
and at this point in time, we have a bigger staff than we had for all of last 
year combined." 
</P>
<P>
Student Ed Waterman, 24, also read about the paper's shutdown in a local paper. 
"I was so shocked that I was considering writing an underground paper." 
</P>
<P>
Waterman, who had not planned to write for The Harbor Tides, became so involved 
with a petitioning effort to get the paper back that he decided to join the 
staff. The paper now has 10 reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty stoked," Carrillo said. "Not just to see my name in print, but 
to see other people's names in print that haven't contributed before. It's like 
starting something new again."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER CRUSHED WHEN TRUCK OVERTURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 46-year-old Tujunga man was crushed to death Thursday morning when his 
18-wheeler truck flipped over in Lancaster, pinning him inside, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
A 64-foot-long, 60,000-pound liquid propane gas tank fell off the truck and 
knocked down a power pole, causing an outage in the area. 
</P>
<P>
About 95 customers were without power for about three hours, said Southern 
California Edison area manager Denise Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 11:35 a.m. on Antelope Highway near Pearblossom 
Highway, Officer Miguel Siordia said. The driver was traveling 60 m.p.h. to 70 
m.p.h. when he rounded a right-hand curve and lost control of his vehicle, 
Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck flipped over, pinning the man in the cab for two hours. He was 
pronounced dead at the scene. The name of the victim was not released pending 
notification of relatives.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PHYSICIANS GROUP BUYS BURBANK HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors at Burbank Community Hospital on Wednesday completed an agreement to 
purchase the ailing facility from the nonprofit foundation that owns it as part 
of a financial strategy the doctors hope will boost falling revenue. 
</P>
<P>
And when the hospital changes hands, so will its name. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the new name will be Thompson Memorial Medical Center, in honor of 
the hospital's founder, Elmer H. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction was approved in principle in August, hospital Administrator 
William Daniel said. Under the terms of the agreement, Gateway Healthcare of 
Burbank Inc., a partnership of doctors, will take control Dec. 1 from the 
nonprofit Burbank Community Hospital Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the group needs to raise $600,000 to $700,000 as operating 
capital, Daniel said. The purchase price of the hospital's operations and 
equipment, about $2 million, will be paid over 10 years, Daniel said, and the 
structure will be leased from the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel said the physicians group will attempt to enter into limited 
partnerships with investors to raise the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Roberto Beaton, chairman of the physicians group, said in a prepared 
statement that the hospital will expand its outpatient services.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE POLICE OK 2-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance police union on Wednesday approved a new two-year contract, ending 
more than two months of tense relations between the union and city officials as 
police worked without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Terms include a 5% cost-of-living increase in the first year and an increase of 
4% to 7.5% in the second year, depending on the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Torrance Police Officers Assn. voted 90 to 39 in favor of the 
contract, said President David A. Nemeth. The terms won unanimous approval from 
the Torrance City Council Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The last police contract expired July 31. Relations between union leaders and 
the council deteriorated after council members rejected an earlier agreement 
worked out by negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cost-of-living increases, the contract provides special raises 
for newly hired officers and a system of graduated salary increases for senior 
staff. Thus, the starting salary for new officers will increase from $32,976 to 
$37,092, and top-scale salaries for officers with 20 years of experience will 
increase from $42,936 a year to $46,032.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMMONIA TANK HEARING POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South Coast Air Quality Management District panel decided Thursday to 
postpone until Nov. 16 a hearing on whether it should cancel a permit it issued 
for the construction of two anhydrous ammonia tanks at Southern California 
Edison's Redondo Beach power plant. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, originally set for Thursday, was rescheduled to give the city of 
Redondo Beach time to replace its attorney in the case, Curtis Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a former AQMD general counsel who left the agency in April, withdrew 
from the case when air quality attorneys expressed concern that he might have a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The city is seeking a hearing because it believes the AQMD failed to meet state 
environmental review requirements before issuing a permit Sept. 7 for 
construction of the twin 10,000-gallon tanks. 
</P>
<P>
City officials assert that the ammonia, a potentially toxic substance, could 
pose a public health risk. But Edison says the chemical is key to a pollution 
control system that the utility needs to install to meet AQMD air quality 
standards.

AF SECRETARY SAYS HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN NORTHROP'S CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN and MAURA REYNOLDS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice expressed strong confidence Thursday in 
Northrop Corp.'s top management, attempting to soften the impression created by 
a recent review of the aerospace firm that found serious problems in six major 
areas of its business. 
</P>
<P>
Rice testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has continued 
to support the controversial $62.8-billion B-2 Stealth bomber program in a 
political battle against efforts in the House of Representatives to kill it. 
Northrop is the prime contractor on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has the "ultimate in confidence" in the top management of Northrop, 
Rice said he personally knows Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa and the president of 
Northrop's B-2 division, Oliver Boileau. "I think we have every reason to have 
the confidence that you speak of," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Rice offered a sharply different slant on the Air Force review than that given 
by Brig. Gen. Robert W. Drewes, the Air Force deputy chief of staff for 
contracting who performed the review, in testimony Tuesday before a House 
committee. Rice said Thursday that it would be "inappropriate and unwise" to 
consider the review in determining the B-2's future. 
</P>
<P>
Drewes' statements and the review itself have been seized on by congressional 
opponents of the B-2 as a rationale for killing the program. So far, the House 
Armed Services and Appropriations committees have voted to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Air Force issued a statement Thursday, taking exception to an 
article in Thursday's Times that reported that the B-2 is continuing to fall 
behind schedule and that the second B-2 is nine months behind schedule for its 
first flight. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee hearing was hastily called and came just 
hours before a key vote in the Senate Appropriations Committee on an amendment 
to kill B-2 production funding in 1991. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), was defeated by a vote of 15 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Leahy said the Air Force review of Northrop has become ammunition in 
the battle to gain votes against the B-2. In August, the B-2 survived when the 
Senate voted 56 to 43 to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
Rice testified that it would cost the government $8 billion to phase out the 
program. So far, $27 billion has been appropriated for the program and $24 
billion has been spent, the Air Force secretary testified. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) what the taxpayers have received 
for the $24 billion investment in the B-2, Rice said Stealth technology 
developed in the program has "permeated" the U.S. aircraft industry and made 
possible such programs as the Navy A-12 attack jet and the Air Force advanced 
tactical fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"If the B-2 fails, we will see the atrophy of the air-breathing leg of the 
triad and that would be a great tragedy," Rice said. The triad to which he 
referred is the U.S. strategic offensive force composed of ground-based 
missiles, submarine-based missiles and the bomber force. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has been the center of Senate support for the B-2, and a series of 
questions he asked Thursday seemed designed to show that a cancellation of the 
program would be unwise. In a later interview, Nunn said Northrop's problems 
are not unique in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force had concerns about Northrop, and they are working with them to 
improve management," Nunn said after the hearing. "That's what you want them to 
do. If you cut out every defense . . . contractor that had some management 
problems, you would basically shut down defense production lines." 
</P>
<P>
In objecting to The Times' story, the Air Force said the second B-2 built by 
Northrop was originally scheduled to fly last spring and that it was delayed by 
five months as a result of a funding change and a strike at Boeing, a 
subcontractor. The schedule was adjusted to account for those delays and now 
the program is just one month behind schedule, because of a fuel leak, the Air 
Force said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force John J. 
Welch Jr., the service's chief acquisition executive, said he "guessed" that 
the second B-2 was originally scheduled to fly six months after the No. 1 
bomber first took to the air in July, 1989. On that basis, the first flight 
would have occurred in January, nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not object to the statement in the article that the B-2 test 
program is falling further behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he is not concerned that the B-2 flight test program is going slowly. 
"It is important for them to get the tests right," Nunn said. "If the Air Force 
slows down the tests for good reasons, I don't have any problem with that. The 
important thing is that the test be done correctly and accurately so that we 
can rely on the data that comes out of it."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: IN TOO MANY INSTANCES, A 'SALE' REALLY ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, advertising sale prices -- as in "70% Off!" and "Regular price $150, 
now on sale for $79.99!" -- has been the sure-fire way to draw a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It can also be meaningless, if there's no real price reduction involved (as 
sale implies), because the so-called regular price really wasn't. Maybe the 
goods never sold for that. Maybe they only bore that price the first week. 
Maybe their original tag had the regular price already crossed out and the sale 
price below. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's a popular gambit, particularly with today's department 
stores, which can hardly maintain full retail prices in a day of discounting 
and off-pricing. And it's no more trustworthy, in spite of the little litany of 
clarifications and disclaimers commonly added now beneath the hype: "Regular 
and original prices are offering prices only and may not have resulted in 
sales," or "Advertised merchandise may be available at sale prices in upcoming 
sale events." 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean, this magic language? That things never sold at the higher 
price, whether they were honestly overpriced or inflated for advertising 
purposes? That the advertised sale price is often the ordinary price, with a 
typical retail markup built in, and -- don't bother rushing in -- the stuff may 
be regularly, continually and always on sale. 
</P>
<P>
"The fine print," says Herschel Elkins, California's assistant attorney general 
in charge of consumer protection, "seems to be saying this isn't really a 
'sale.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nobody said the magic language had to be added, though this is a field full of 
suggestions and official "guidelines." For several decades, the standing 
commandments have been the Federal Trade Commission's 1964 guides against 
deceptive pricing, including "deceptive comparisons" with a "fictitious higher 
price." Proof that a former price was genuine would require "substantial sales" 
or a "reasonably substantial period of time" during which the product was 
offered at that price. 
</P>
<P>
But the FTC gradually stopped bringing price advertising cases -- a third of 
its activity before 1970. The higher priority, says Steven Baker, FTC regional 
director in Chicago, is deception in health and safety and product performance 
claims, against which "you can't protect yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Some states and municipalities may have their own regulations, defining regular 
price, for example, even more specifically in terms of the required number of 
sales or number of days. Others have filed suits under their general laws 
against deceptive advertising: New York's attorney general took on Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co. for such sale price advertising, and Colorado sued May 
Department Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Given the variation, a Council of Better Business Bureaus task force of 
retailers has drafted guidelines, intended for adoption nationwide. Generally 
following FTC guidelines on sale-price advertising, with somewhat different 
terms and language, they are already criticized by industry and the FTC as too 
restrictive and by consumer protectors as too permissive. 
</P>
<P>
There has always been some reluctance to be too strict and confining in setting 
such terms because comparative price advertising, in the FTC's words, "tends to 
enhance competition and lower prices." There's also some reluctance to pursue 
apparent offenders, because investigation takes days or months of following ads 
and prices, says Elkins, and sales records are difficult to get. 
</P>
<P>
Stores, therefore, are fairly free to use the word sale as they will, adding 
the magic language, just in case, as protection against any later accusations 
of deception. One Los Angeles department store, for example, recently 
advertised gold and gemstone earrings at $699 apiece, marked down from 
"regular" prices of $2,600-$3,200, when the earrings weren't even brought into 
some stores until the week of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
But the ads had magic language: "Regular prices do not necessarily reflect 
actual sales" -- an understandable statement under the circumstances, but 
hardly one proving a 75% saving. Indeed, the merchant claimed to have taken the 
line from another store's ads without looking into what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
Some stores are a lot more specific but not necessarily more informative. Take 
the one that carefully explains that its regular price is what applied "before 
the sale" and will apply again after the sale, while an original price is one 
that applied the previous season, may have undergone several markdowns and will 
never apply again. 
</P>
<P>
This is not easy to follow. It may be a sincere attempt at true disclosure. It 
may also, like other magic language, be implying great savings without proving 
anything. Who knows how those regular and original prices are set, and with 
what intent? Who knows how long tomorrow's higher price will prevail, and if 
it's any more "regular" than yesterday's? 
</P>
<P>
Retailers may use fine-print disclaimers just "to get them off the hook if they 
get into court," says Joel Windman, attorney for the industry-supported 
Jewelers Vigilance Committee in New York. "If they say it like it is, they 
shouldn't need disclaimers." 
</P>
<P>
Nor should the consumer, for whom disclaimers are a tip-off that comparison 
shopping is still necessary. The value of any price must be weighed against 
other prevailing prices, not against former prices, real or fictitious. "The 
most important thing," says the FTC's Baker, "is what it will cost you now."

U.S. PROSECUTORS FAIL TO GAIN GROUND AT MILKEN HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors got off to a shaky start Thursday in their attempt to pin 
additional crimes on Michael Milken beyond the six to which the former junk 
bond king has pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The government called two witnesses in the opening day of hearings to help U.S. 
District Judge Kimba M. Wood decide Milken's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But as prosecutors focused on a manipulation of Wickes Cos.' stock in 1986, 
neither witness definitively implicated Milken in the illegal transaction. 
</P>
<P>
One of the witnesses, Cary J. Maultasch, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader 
who prosecutors alleged directed the illegal bidding up of Wickes' stock on 
Milken's orders, told the judge he had "no factual basis" to believe that 
Milken was behind the decision to buy huge quantities of Wickes stock near the 
close of trading on April 23, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch's memory seemed foggy on many questions asked by prosecutors, and he 
seemingly failed to back up some of their main points. Maultasch last week was 
granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings are Milken's first chance to face directly some of the witnesses 
who for years have given secret testimony against him to grand juries and 
prosecutors. Milken, 44, the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills-based junk 
bond department, was escorted into the jammed courtroom flanked by his wife 
Lori, his brother, Lowell, and a coterie of other relatives, friends and 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a gray suit, white shirt and red-and-blue patterned tie, Milken sat 
at the defense table. At time he appeared pensive. At other times he rolled his 
eyes in response to testimony or scowled at Assistant U.S. Atty. John Carroll. 
Milken frequently passed notes to his lead defense lawyer, Arthur L. Liman. 
Defense lawyers haven't said whether Milken himself will testify, although some 
lawyers involved in the case say they think it's unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings are to last at least two weeks. Milken faces a maximum of 28 years 
in prison on the counts of conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud he 
pleaded guilty to in April. He already has agreed to pay $600 million in 
penalties. The hearings are to help Wood decide if there is enough evidence of 
additional crimes to justify a longer prison sentence than she might otherwise 
impose. 
</P>
<P>
Because the judge has limited each side to only 20 hours of direct examination 
of witnesses, prosecutors have chosen to focus mainly on only three 
transactions in which they claim that Milken broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wickes case, Drexel was the investment banker for the Los Angeles-based 
company. With Drexel's help, Wickes raised capital in 1985, in part by selling 
two issues of preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
The stock paid a big cash dividend, which was costly to Wickes. So as Wickes 
formulated plans to expand in 1986 and raise even more capital, it sought 
Drexel's help in reducing the burden of dividend payments. Under the terms of 
one of the preferred stock offerings, Wickes had the right to redeem the 
dividend-paying preferred in exchange for plain common stock, which paid no 
dividend -- but only on the condition that Wickes common traded above $6 per 
share for 20 out of 30 consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
The government charges that as Wickes stock neared that goal, Drexel and Milken 
secretly arranged with the firm of former stock speculator and admitted inside 
trader Ivan F. Boesky to manipulate the stock market so that condition could be 
met. 
</P>
<P>
At Drexel's request, Boesky's head trader, Michael Davidoff, bought 1.9 million 
shares of Wickes stock on the American Stock Exchange just before the close of 
trading on April 23, 1986. As a result, the stock closed at $6.125 that day, 
clinching the chance for Wickes to force the exchange of preferred stock for 
common. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the victims were investors who lost approximately $15 million 
per year they would have received in dividend payments. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is clear that there was a manipulation," Carroll told the judge 
as hearings started, adding later: "And we contend that Michael Milken was 
behind that manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
Liman's strategy, however, was not to dispute that a manipulation had occurred. 
He simply argued that there is no evidence linking Milken to it. Liman asserted 
that Milken wasn't responsible for all of the activities of his employees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to say that anything that ever happened at Drexel was his (Milken's) 
fault," Liman said. "We do not dispute that there was a manipulation of Wickes 
(stock). . . . What happened from our point of view is that he was not 
responsible for what happened in Wickes." 
</P>
<P>
Davidoff, who was the first of the two witnesses called by the government on 
Thursday, testified that Maultasch had ordered him to buy the stock. Davidoff 
said he had no conversations with Milken about the transaction and had no 
reason to believe that Milken had directed Maultasch to place the order. 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch, then based in Drexel's New York office, said he placed the order 
with Boesky's firm on orders from a Drexel trader in Beverly Hills, Peter 
Gardiner. (Gardiner is due to testify when the hearings resume on Monday. 
Prosecutors have said they don't plan to call Boesky as a witness.) 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch did testify, however, that he had advised Milken not to meet with 
Boesky in October, 1986, a few months after Drexel had made an illegal 
$5.3-million payment to the Boesky organization and shortly before it was known 
that Boesky was cooperating with federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told Milken on the phone that he thought there was a risk that 
Boesky had become a government witness, adding: "I thought it was a horrible 
idea that he attend that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch said Milken replied to the effect that, "Don't worry, I assume I'm 
speaking for the record." In fact, the meeting was secretly taped by the 
government. When Maultasch a short time later asked Milken if he had been 
careful in the conversation, he said Milken answered "that he was careful but 
didn't know if he was careful enough." 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch said that after he received a subpoena from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in November, 1986, he immediately flew to Beverly Hills in 
a near panic to meet with Milken. He said the two met alone at 4 a.m. in a 
Drexel conference room, with the door shut and a guard posted outside. He said 
Milken was so concerned about the possibility of government eavesdropping that 
they spoke in hushed tones. He said Milken frequently didn't speak at all but 
wrotes notes to him on a yellow pad, which Milken then erased. 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch said that as he left Drexel after the dawn meeting, a guard in the 
lobby tore up the slip of paper Maultasch had filled out to gain entry to the 
building. He said the guard told him not to worry and said "You weren't here." 
</P>
<P>
Maultasch said he didn't remember what was in the notes Milken wrote and then 
erased. Prosecutors have contended that the meeting was part of an obstruction 
of justice. But the impact of Maultasch's testimony about the meeting wasn't 
clear. He said Milken never told him to lie to the government or destroy 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The two other transactions that the government has said it will address in the 
hearings involve alleged insider trading in the stock of Caesars World, and 
alleged violation of securities laws by having Boesky secretly buy stock for 
Drexel in Storer Communications, a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MILKEN ON TRIAL Before sentencing Michael Milken for six felonies to which he 
has pleaded guilty, U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in New York has ordered two 
weeks of hearings on accusations that the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk 
bond financier engaged in a broad pattern of wrongdoing. The hearings will 
focus on government claims that Milken manipulated the price of Wickes Cos. 
stock, engaged in illegal insider trading of Caesars World stock and misused 
the securities of Storer Communications. Milken denies all of the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHO'S TO BLAME?Prosecutor John Carroll, on manipulation of Wickes stock: 
</P>
<P>
'The evidence is clear that there was a manipulation. If you look at the 
evidence, we contend there is no other conclusion you can reach. And we contend 
that Michael Milken was behind that manipulation.' 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Arthur L. Liman: 
</P>
<P>
'It's easy to say that anything that ever happened at Drexel was his (Milken's) 
fault. . . . We do not dispute that there was a manipulation of Wickes (stock). 
. . . What happened from our point of view is that he was not responsible for 
what happened in Wickes.'

Liman: 'Or to manipulate a stock?'

SOME FILES IN CHIP PATENT CASE MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gilbert P. Hyatt battled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for 20 years and 
built up a case history of more than 10,000 pages before the agency finally 
gave him a patent in July for inventing the computer on a chip. 
</P>
<P>
And now they've lost part of his patent application file. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Weidenfeld, director of public affairs for the patent office, said Thursday 
that the office is searching for three thick files containing hundreds of pages 
related to the processing of Hyatt's seven applications for a patent on the 
computer on a chip, or microprocessor, which made possible a wide range of 
electronic gadgets from personal computers to VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
The patent office has a case history accompanying the application that led to 
the patent issuance, but the missing files contain information from previous 
related applications which would be needed in case Hyatt's patent is challenged 
in court, Weidenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the missing files is Hyatt's original application, Serial No. 101,881, 
filed on Dec. 28, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no serious damage at all," said Hyatt, who has kept a complete copy of 
the litigation. "It adds a little to the romance of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks, the agency has been conducting an office-by-office search 
for the files, which have been missing for two months, Weidenfeld said. The 
files could be in the main record room or in one of several warehouses that the 
patent office maintains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not at all unusual for the patent office to lose files from time to time, 
especially those for cases that have been at the patent office for many years," 
said Gary Hecker, a patent lawyer with Hecker &amp; Harriman in Los Angeles. 
"My guess is it will make it troublesome for people who want to evaluate the 
patent's validity." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ladra, a patent attorney with the firm Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; 
Rosati in Palo Alto, said he has been attempting to get the entire file for 
several weeks without success. Ladra represents computer company clients who 
are interested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This couldn't hurt Hyatt because, under law, anything missing is presumed to 
go in his favor," Ladra said. "It's not good news for anyone who wants to 
challenge the patent." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the patent office has received 30 written requests for the complete 
file history, Weidenfeld said. Patent search service firms also report a 
backlog of orders for the case. 
</P>
<P>
Weidenfeld said the patent office can sometimes reconstruct the files or parts 
of them from microfilm records or those kept by the parties in the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a lot of effort," he said.

Keating Tries Again: Former thrift owner Charles H. Keating Jr., after 
exhausting appeals in the state courts, asked a federal court in Los Angeles to 
reduce or lift the $5-million bail that is keeping him in jail. Keating is 
accused of defrauding more than 17,000 people out of nearly $200 million 
through the sale of American Continental debt securities at Lincoln S&amp;L's 
29 Southern California branches during a two-year period ending in early 1989.

Trump Seeks to Restructure Loans: Developer Donald J. Trump is seeking to 
restructure $100 million in casino bank loans, a spokesman said. The move comes 
just two months after a bank rescue package was stitched together to keep his 
real estate and casino empire from unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, whose holdings are burdened with more than $3 billion in debt, has been 
trying to reduce interest payments on his bank loans and junk bonds. Current 
talks focus on borrowings used to buy two of Trump's three Atlantic City, N.J., 
casinos, the Trump Castle and the Taj Mahal, the glitzy property which opened 
earlier this year. He also owns the Trump Plaza casino, which is healthier than 
the other two. "We are having conversations with bank lenders at the same time 
we are talking with bondholders," said Trump's chief financial officer, Stephen 
Bollenbach.

flight, Rockwell Chief Test Pilot Ken Dyson traveled a top speed of 340 m.p.h. 
and flew to 10,000 feet, a spokesman said. The X-31 uses unusual flight and 
engine-thrust controls to enable it to turn and point at targets more quickly

SMALL BUSINESS: BARTER BOOM EXPECTED TO EXPAND AS ECONOMY SHRINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Barry Wood, founder of Botanical Decorators, picks up the phone to call 
his broker, it's not to play the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, Wood asked his broker at Barter Systems in Silver Spring, 
Md., to track down a computer repair service and a hot tub for a customer of 
his Clarksville, Md., retail nursery and landscape company. 
</P>
<P>
"Barter transactions make up about 5% of my business," said Wood, who since 
1978 has traded for printing, advertising, painting, electrical and concrete 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our employees are on a dental plan through barter, and that's how we put on 
our Christmas party," said Wood. "I'm really hot on the barter system -- I 
think it's great." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, thousands of small-business owners bartered about $1 billion worth 
of goods and services through 300 American trade exchanges. Major corporations 
are also enthusiastic about bartering, especially when dealing with the Soviet 
Union and Eastern European nations lacking in hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial trade exchange executives said barter has increased in popularity in 
the past 10 years, and they are bracing for a new wave of clients because a 
drooping economy makes trading more attractive than buying. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, bartering had a shady reputation as a less than legal way to do 
business. But in the early 1980s, the Internal Revenue Service recognized 
barter as a legitimate way to do deals as long as "trade dollars" are treated 
exactly like real dollars for all tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on where you live and how big your business is, expect to pay a 
membership fee ranging from $100 to $1,000 to join an exchange. Most exchanges 
also charge a 10% transaction fee on every deal. A bona fide exchange will 
provide members with monthly account statements and a year-end 1099-B form that 
tells the government how many trade dollars changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Exchanges publish directories and newsletters promoting members' firms. They 
also employ brokers who seek out the merchandise or services their members 
need. The benefit of joining an exchange is that you don't have to trade your 
products or services directly for someone else's. You build up credit and can 
trade it for anything offered by another exchange member. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is a lack of awareness about how barter works," said Susan 
Groenwald, who serves as president of the Chicago Barter Corp. and president of 
the International Reciprocal Trade Assn. in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The international association represents about 10,000 businesses in the United 
States, England, New Zealand and Australia, among other nations. The Chicago 
Barter Corp. has about 1,200 members who traded $13 million worth of goods and 
services in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sondra Ames, whose husband, Michael, founded Orange-based Trade American Card 
about 20 years ago, bartered with her obstetrician for the delivery of her 
daughter, Allyson. Because the doctor and a local pet store owner both belonged 
to her exchange, the doctor got some Alaskan malamute puppies in exchange for 
services rendered to Ames and her baby. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1970's, during the gasoline crisis, we experienced a 30% growth rate in 
the business," said Ames, who expects a similar upturn as the economy slows 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest advantage is getting things without spending business dollars for 
them," said Don Gibas, owner of Gibas Golf Products in Huntington Beach. Gibas, 
who belongs to two barter exchanges, uses barter for his business and personal 
life. He recently bartered for hotel rooms in Las Vegas to attend a trade show 
and used trade dollars to wallpaper and repaint his home. 
</P>
<P>
Exchange representatives say membership can increase sales by 5% by bringing a 
business customers it would not have otherwise found. 
</P>
<P>
"Barter cannot save a company that is going under, but it can lead it away from 
its competition," said Ronald Daversa, vice president of marketing for Barter 
Systems, which serves about 1,000 members in the Washington metropolitan area. 
"If more companies knew about it, they would participate." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lichtle, president of Lichtle Flat Roof Co. in Detroit, belongs to two 
trade exchanges and does about $100,000 worth of bartering a year. "When I join 
an exchange, their six to eight brokers become my sales people," said Lichtle, 
who is currently bartering for supplies to build a new home in Sterling 
Heights, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, he has bartered for his firm's advertising, accounting 
services, printing, equipment rentals and propane. 
</P>
<P>
He sometimes pays his workers in trade dollars, which they can spend at a 
barter store set up much like a K mart. He recently bartered for several rooms 
worth of furniture and $2,500 worth of scuba diving equipment.

MAKING BARTER WORK FOR YOU Barter works especially well for companies with 
excess inventory or manufacturing capacity. Professionals can also fill in 
their schedules with barter clients. Some tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't pay more for an item through barter than if you paid cash. 
</P>
<P>
* Be willing to wait a bit longer to receive goods or services. 
</P>
<P>
* Join a legitimate trade exchange that reports transactions to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
* Encourage trade brokers to promote your company to other members. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep a good balance between barter and cash transactions so you don't 
jeopardize your cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't accept more bartering deals than you can handle.

MCI Communications Corp. offered the federal government a plan Thursday to 
thwart telemarketers who switch phone customers' long-distance service without 
their permission. 
</P>
<P>
This customer switching, known as slamming, has generated tens of thousands of 
complaints to state and federal telephone regulators, particularly in the wake 
of recent advertising wars among MCI, US Sprint and American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. 
</P>
<P>
With all three leading long-distance carriers now offering about the same 
prices, they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and 
telemarketing trying to lure customers from their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has 65% of the market, MCI 14% and Sprint 10%. 
</P>
<P>
MCI called on the Federal Communications Commission to establish uniform, 
minimum disclosures in all telephone sales solicitations; monitor procedures 
for phone solicitors; independently verify sales to insure that the customer 
has authorized a change in service, conduct independent audits and ensure "free 
and convenient return to the original long-distance carrier in the case of 
unauthorized service conversion."

ADVANCED MICRO WINS A ROUND IN FIGHT WITH INTEL; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: INTEL COULD BE FORCED TO SHARE THE 386 MICROPROCESSOR, THE BRAIN 
INSIDE MANY PCS. DAMAGES WON'T BE DECIDED UNTIL NEXT YEAR.

Advanced Micro Devices won a potentially important victory Thursday in its long 
and bitter fight with Intel Corp. when an arbitrator ruled that Intel had 
deliberately breached a technology exchange contract with AMD and is liable for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was harshly critical of Intel's conduct, stopped short of 
ordering the Santa Clara firm to grant AMD the right to produce a 
microprocessor known as the 386. That popular product forms the brain inside 
many advanced personal computers and could generate as much as $1 billion in 
revenue for Intel this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the arbitrator, retired Judge J. Barton Phelps, left open the possibility 
that Intel could be forced to share the 386 with AMD following the next phase 
of the arbitration proceedings, which will determine damages. That phase will 
begin in November, and a decision is not expected until next year. 
</P>
<P>
W. J. Sanders III, chairman of Sunnyvale-based AMD, called it "a great day for 
Advanced Micro Devices" and said the company would ask for $500 million as well 
as the rights to the 386. 
</P>
<P>
Intel, meanwhile, took comfort in the fact that Phelps did not order an 
immediate transfer of the 386, and noted that the arbitrator had largely upheld 
Intel's contention that AMD had failed to uphold its end of the 
technology-sharing deal. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from a 1982 agreement, amended in early 1984, that called for 
the two companies to exchange products of equal value, based on a point system 
that rated parts according to their complexity. At the time, Intel was eager to 
have AMD act as a "second-source" for its 8086 microprocessor, because computer 
companies -- notably International Business Machines -- that were choosing 
parts for their computer designs wanted to be able to obtain them from more 
than one supplier. 
</P>
<P>
AMD produced the 8086 and its more powerful successors, the 80186 and the 
80286. But late in 1984, the agreement with Intel began to break down, and 
Intel refused to turn over the rights to the next-generation processor, the 
80386. 
</P>
<P>
Intel claimed that AMD had failed to produce parts Intel wanted and thus didn't 
have the necessary points to justify access to the 386. But AMD maintained that 
Intel unilaterally refused to accept AMD parts that had already been agreed 
upon in order to prevent AMD from gaining the 386. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps, though agreeing that AMD had not performed adequately on the products 
it was supposed to supply to Intel, concluded that Intel decided "to ditch the 
relationship with AMD and, at the same time, to pretend externally to AMD that 
the relationship still existed," simply because it was in the best interests of 
Intel's business to do so. 
</P>
<P>
He called Intel's behavior "unbecoming" and "a classic example of a breach of 
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, preaching good faith but 
practicing duplicity." The arbitrator said Intel therefore was liable for 
damages for its general repudiation of the contract and for its specific 
refusal to turn over updates of several Intel parts produced by AMD under the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
AMD was found liable for not acting in good faith regarding a flawed part that 
it had delivered to Intel and was also criticized for demanding valuable parts 
from Intel without having anything to offer in return. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew J. Kessler, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said it was 
unlikely that Intel would be forced to turn over the 386. Even if it was, he 
said, that would not happen until late next year, when the product was already 
well past its peak in the market. Kessler estimated that Intel might eventually 
have to pay about $50 million to AMD, a figure that has also been cited by 
other analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, AMD is widely expected to 
introduce a "clone" of the 386 -- an issue over which it is engaged in two 
other legal disputes with Intel. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a trial will be held to determine whether AMD has the right to use 
Intel microcode, the instructions written into a microprocessor, under an 
earlier technology exchange agreement between the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
Intel also has sued AMD for trademark infringement to prevent the company from 
using the numbers "386" in any future product.

MARKET BEAT: WARY VENTURE CAPITALISTS LOOKING FOR AN INCENTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Wall Street in a depressing plunge that shaved another 6% from the average 
stock price this week, it's not exactly the best time for small companies to go 
begging for capital. But 32 such hopefuls still showed up in Newport Beach on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, mostly very young, private, Southland firms, made presentations 
to venture capitalists and other big investors at brokerage Cruttenden &amp; 
Co.'s fifth annual conference on emerging growth companies. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the conference was a microcosm of the sad state of business and 
financial markets worldwide today. There are plenty of entrepreneurs with hot 
ideas. But the sliding economy, plummeting stock market and dangerous Mideast 
situation have left investors more skittish than ever about pumping money into 
new ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, many of the conference attendees agreed that the global capital crunch 
will become more severe before things bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Yet C. Gerald Diamond, general partner with the investment firm EG&amp;G 
Venture Management in Mountain View, said the problem isn't the supply of 
capital. His firm, for example, runs a $50-million venture fund. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous amount of venture money available," he said. Rather, the 
problem is the rising reluctance to commit capital. "You just have very 
cautious venture capitalists now," he said. "Almost all institutions are 
frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Many investors say the venture-financing outlook is more tenuous because the 
government refuses to create an incentive for long-term investing. Most 
attendees at the Cruttenden conference decried the battle in Congress over a 
new capital gains tax cut. The investors say the need for such a cut is 
glaring. Not surprisingly, they are hoping that Congress will resurrect an idea 
from the original budget compromise, that of giving tax breaks to investors who 
fund small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Crisis' is probably not too strong a word" to describe the funding 
environment for young businesses without some new mechanism to encourage risk 
taking, said Harvey Dixon, a financier with Palmer Partners in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
For an entrepreneur like David L. Auchterlonie, that attitude is of deep 
concern. He is president of Airtrax, a Los Angeles-based start-up company that 
has developed an electronic system that verifies whether commercials run on 
network and independent TV stations. Verification is a key issue for 
advertisers, who now must manually confirm that their ads ran as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Airtrax has spent three years creating its system of encoding and monitoring 
commercials. Now, it is seeking up to $8 million in capital to launch the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Auchterlonie is worried that the cost of capital will only rise in the years 
ahead, if the nation's savings rate doesn't improve and if foreign investors 
desert U.S. markets as the dollar falls. So his firm hopes to get what it needs 
now, before things deteriorate further. 
</P>
<P>
For a small firm hoping to survive, he says, "Only two things count now: sales 
and cash." 
</P>
<P>
At Carlsbad-based Microbics Corp., about $4 million in cash would come in handy 
to fund its rollout of new products. The firm, which lost $600,000 in fiscal 
1990 on sales of $3.53 million, produces systems that measure levels of 
toxicity in liquids and solids. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government and numerous water waste-treatment plants already use 
Microbics' systems, which quickly test for poisons by exposing a light-emitting 
bacteria to a sample of water or other substance. The amount of light thrown 
off by the bacteria indicates the poison level. 
</P>
<P>
As bullish as the company is about its own prospects, however, one of its 
officers admits that the economy as a whole looks very scary. James W. Dowe 
III, Microbics' executive vice president, said he has studied previous periods 
in U.S. history when government, business and personal debt has piled up 
wildly. In each case, he said, the debt spiral was followed by a major 
deflation cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Then why did scores of venture capitalists and other firms show up at the 
Cruttenden conference? Because as dismal as the outlook may appear, business 
isn't just going to grind to a halt in this country. People with good ideas 
will find financing harder to get, but many will still get it, because 10-to-1 
payoff potential still lights up the eyes of every seed-capital investor. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of return might be found in a young firm like Image Data of Pasadena, 
which has developed software for enhanced three-dimensional imaging on computer 
workstations. Or a big payoff might await someone willing to finance Ruth 
Feinberg's Jewish Mother's Soup Inc., an Anaheim firm that this year expects to 
sell $160,000 in low-sodium chicken soups that Feinberg markets as "My Liquid 
Hug to You." 
</P>
<P>
How many of these companies will survive and prosper is anyone's guess. But 
Peter Pomeroy, who represents financiers OSCCO Ventures, an $18.5-million fund 
based in Menlo Park, says that no matter what happens to the broad economy, 
entrepreneurs will continue to create new products and services that satisfy 
unfilled needs. 
</P>
<P>
If the need is great enough, he notes, smart capitalists will realize the 
potential in funding the venture and marketing the product. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to commit cash is always a function of fear versus greed. Fear has 
the upper hand now, but greed remains a powerful force long term. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: A comment from more than a few venture capitalists at the Cruttenden 
show: Stocks may go much lower, but many already are looking pretty cheap. In 
fact, a financier from a big New York venture firm said he believes that "the 
public market (stocks) is more attractive than the private market (venture 
investments)" now. Given that the average venture capitalist expects venture 
deals to return 30% or more annually, that suggests the long-term potential in 
stocks is even better than that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New York's Chemical Bank on Thursday became the latest major bank to slash its 
dividend. The market is speaking loud and clear about the other banks and 
S&amp;Ls that are likely dividend-cutters: Just look for dividend yields that 
are already in the stratosphere. That tells you that the market sees no hope 
the payouts will last. CalFed sports a whopping yield of 31.1% -- a $1.40 
annual dividend on a stock that now sells for $4.50 a share. Other candidates: 
First Interstate, yielding 16.6%, and Glenfed, at 13.5%.

S.F. BALLET A BOX OFFICE FLOP IN S.D.

The San Francisco Ballet inaugurated the fall season for the San Diego 
Foundation for the Performing Arts last weekend, but despite the company's 
international reputation and critical acclaim, the four-performance run at the 
3,000-seat seat Civic Theatre was a flop at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some interesting signals," managing director Fred Colby said after 
the close of the last show. "We've increased our subscriptions 100% over last 
year. We sold about 1,450 season tickets this year. That's the most 
subscriptions we've had in over three years. On the other hand, we're having 
trouble drawing single-ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We only missed our projections by about 7%. We expected to fill 65% of the 
house, and we ended up at 58%. It's a good thing the rest of the season is at 
the Spreckels," a much smaller venue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, we budgeted very conservatively," Colby said. "We lost money, but 
we're only talking about maybe 3% or 4% of our entire budget. That means it 
won't really affect anything on stage. It will only mean making cutbacks in 
internal things, like marketing, and maybe some outreach programs." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 students attended San Francisco Ballet performances free of charge as 
a result of that community outreach program. However, Colby said, "the only way 
I can block those tickets off, is if we have more (underwriting). Even if we 
sell out, we're still losing money. People don't understand that, but it's a 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
Although the poor turnout for the San Francisco Ballet will have no effect on 
the 1990-91 season, it might carry over to next year's programming. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is not ready for a lot of major ballet," Colby said. "We had the 
Bolshoi here, and then the New York City Ballet up the road (in Orange County). 
Some people exhausted their budget on the Bolshoi alone. We even had the 
symphony open its season on the same weekend. That probably accounts for the 7% 
drop in attendance from our projected figures. We didn't know the other dates 
when we were setting our schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"But with a city this size we should be able to support them all. That's why 
City Moves is so important," he said, referring to the foundation's new 
educational arm. "The first year alone, it will introduce 2,500 kids to dance. 
We had sell-outs the first time we brought in major dance companies like the 
American Ballet and the Joffrey. We've got to teach (audiences) to go back each 
time they're here. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also got to retrain people to come downtown. We know what we're putting 
on stage is good, and people aren't seeing it. That's what's so frustrating," 
said Colby. "We don't expect to make money on this. We just want people to see 
these things." 
</P>
<P>
Overall financial support for the foundation's efforts is good, Colby said. "We 
have about $425,000 in contributed income either already in or pledged, so 
we're way ahead of the game. This (the four-day stint at the Civic) was a 
calculated risk. Now, we'll have to feel our way back to the Civic Theater. But 
this won't stop us from doing what we have to do for the rest of the season. In 
November, we'll have an improved plan for next year. We're still learning."

Community concert associations are the Price Clubs of the classical music 
world. You have to buy their concerts in bulk, they offer a mixture of brand 
names and unknowns, and they have a location near you. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California alone, there are 33 of these nonprofit, independent 
associations, all of which are overseen by Community Concerts, a New York-based 
talent booking agency founded 63 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the individual associations sponsors a concert season in its community. 
Locally, the San Fernando Valley association, based in Van Nuys, kicks off its 
season tomorrow night with a performance by the Bel Canto Trio, an ensemble of 
three young vocalists. The Lancaster Community Concert Assn. opener is Monday 
night, also featuring the Bel Canto. And in Glendale, the season begins with a 
Sunday afternoon concert on Oct. 21, featuring the Empire Brass. 
</P>
<P>
Convenience is nice but not the biggest attraction at membership stores or 
community concert associations. People come for the bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best deal in music, these days," said Owen Gruber, a long-time member 
of the San Fernando Valley association, where a regular season ticket good for 
four concerts this season, costs $20. 
</P>
<P>
"Where else can you go to a classical music concert for $5?" Gruber asked. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary slightly at the other area community concert associations. In 
Lancaster, the cost of a four-concert season ticket is $25, and Glendale offers 
the best bargain of all -- a six-concert season for $22. 
</P>
<P>
The deals are even better for season ticket holders willing to do a bit of 
traveling. Most of the associations in this area honor one another's season 
tickets under a reciprocity program. Without leaving Southern California, a 
roving ticket holder could take in a concert almost every weekend during the 
October-April community concerts association season. 
</P>
<P>
"How could anyone turn down a bargain like that?" Gruber asked. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently, people have. Community concert associations have played an 
important role in American music history this century, and many associations 
continue to be a vital part of their community's cultural offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the associations in Glendale, which has 1,950 members, and Lancaster, 
which has 1,100 members, are at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
But since the years following World War II, when community concerts 
associations were in their heyday, almost half have disbanded, including those 
in Burbank, Thousand Oaks and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley association, which was founded 45 years ago, is in 
danger of suffering the same fate. It is a victim of changing times and a 
dearth of new members. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a critical point," said John Matola, treasurer of the San Fernando 
Valley Community Concert Assn., which at present has about 550 season ticket 
holders. When Matola joined the organization 13 years ago, there were 900 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 more subscribers are needed this year if the association is to meet 
its budget without additional contributions, Matola said. "There is a lack of 
support and lack of volunteers," he said. "And that's what you need to make 
these associations work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that, unless something is done, our demise could be imminent." 
</P>
<P>
J. Stewart Nall, the president of Community Concerts in New York, acknowledged 
that the concept has seen better days, but he believes a resurgence is on the 
horizon. "It has been rough in some places, but we have worked hard to sharpen 
our promotional techniques and develop the kind of enthusiasm that brings in 
more members and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found ways to be competitive with everything else that is going on out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Community Concerts was born in 1927 when there was not much "going on" in 
classical music in many cities and towns across the country. Concert 
presentation, back then, was a risky business at best. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a situation where there were entrepreneurs in communities all over the 
country trying to make a go of it by putting on concerts on an individual 
basis," Nall said. "It was very unstable. If it happened to rain the night of a 
big concert and people did not show up at the box office, the event would be a 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
To remedy this, a few prominent artist managers in New York came together to 
promote a concept they called the Organized Audience Plan. They would go into a 
community and offer to help form associations to sponsor several concerts every 
season. Admission to the concerts would then be sold on a season-ticket basis 
only. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sell enough season tickets, you guarantee a season," Nall said. "Then 
there is money in the bank to cover costs, even if a particular concert during 
the season does not attract a big audience." 
</P>
<P>
The plan was an almost instant hit, and in 1930, a group of managers banded 
together to form one big agency, Columbia Concerts Inc., to handle the bookings 
for the associations. The agency also sent representatives across the United 
States and Canada to bring new communities on line. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, now known as Columbia Artists Management, eventually grew into an 
industry giant that represents many of the superstars in the classical field. 
It still oversees Community Concerts, although that is only a small part of its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Columbia did not collect any fees from the individual 
associations. It made its money off the usual booking commissions (which now 
amount to about 20% of the booking fee) from the artists hired to play 
community concert recitals. 
</P>
<P>
In the years following World War II, with war-weary communities hungry for 
cultural attractions, the number of associations grew to more than 1,000. Some 
of the biggest names in classical music played their concerts, as did numerous 
young performers on their way up. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando association, for example, presented concerts by soprano 
Leontyne Price and guitarist Andres Segovia. 
</P>
<P>
But as the years wore on, the Community Concerts system began to lose ground. 
Nall puts the blame primarily on competition for the entertainment dollar. "In 
many places, we were practically the only game in town," he said. "Then came 
other music series, not to mention television." He also cites population shifts 
and a lessening of interest in classical music due, he believes, to cutbacks in 
school music education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 550 associations left, with a total of about 500,000 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Ominously, the vast majority of subscribers at many associations are senior 
citizens, and there is little evidence that younger people are signing up. "We 
have tried to get a younger crowd," said Caroline Matola, the San Fernando 
Valley association's membership chairman. "I went to a few PTA meetings to try 
to get parents with children interested. But it just didn't seem to work." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Eugene Golay, membership chairman of the Glendale association, which 
regularly sells out its season held in the Glendale High School auditorium, 
acknowledged that senior citizens dominate his group, too. But he does not see 
it as a drawback. 
</P>
<P>
"People grow into this kind of music," he said. "I just don't think that 
people, no matter who they are, are going to go out and see a rock band when 
they are 70. And it's perfect for people who are retired and living on a fixed 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose some every year because they die, but we have a waiting list of people 
who want to join." 
</P>

JOURNAL BIDS GOODBY -- WELL, SORT OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, the San Fernando Valley lost one of its most popular hangouts for 
poetry readings, BeBop Records. Now The Moment -- a small but notable poetry 
journal out of Woodland Hills -- is also calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're burned out," said Kevin Bartnof, who along with Eric Lyden published the 
magazine every two months or so from Lyden's hillside residence. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has perhaps a dozen poetry publications, and The Moment reached, at 
most, only 3,000 readers with each issue. Yet during its four-year life, this 
magazine received a surprising amount of attention, including a note of support 
from Lawrence Ferlinghetti and a mention on MTV. Charles Bukowski submitted 
poetry. So did Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
More important to Bartnof and Lyden, The Moment included poets who ranged from 
the famous to beginners. The work ranged from avant-garde to amateurish. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a wild and unorthodox feel . . . put together by instinct, whim, 
chance," said Dave Dutton, whose four Dutton's Books stores in Los Angeles 
usually sold out of the magazine within a week. "I, for one, will be very sorry 
to see The Moment pass." 
</P>
<P>
As a farewell to their dedicated coterie of readers, Bartnof and Lyden have put 
together an "all-star" issue that should hit the stands Monday. Bukowski did 
the artwork for the front and back covers. Allen Ginsberg sent a haiku. There 
will be an interview with Edie Parker Kerouac, Jack Kerouac's first wife, and 
work from numerous local poets. 
</P>
<P>
There also will be a disclaimer: though this is being touted as a goodby, the 
publishers warn that they may surprise readers with new issues from time to 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're not going to do one for a long time, but we might do one in 
another year," Lyden said. "We'll be like Batman. We'll show up when we're 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
Bartnof and Lyden, both in their early 30s, began publishing The Moment in 
1986. The $3 magazine soon appeared on the racks at various bookstores in Los 
Angeles and at City Lights in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to bring poetry to a wider audience," Lyden said in a 1988 
interview. "To the guy who works at 7-Eleven or the accountant who writes 
occasional poetry." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy proved fatal. The Moment became known for its open-mindedness. 
Lyden and Bartnof now receive as many as 500 submissions a month. 
</P>
<P>
"People are sending us stuff from Europe and Japan," Bartnof said. "And we get 
a lot of poetry from Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
Both men have day jobs -- Lyden is a youth counselor and Bartnof is a 
sound-effects man for the movies -- and their free time is obliterated by a 
continuous avalanche of mail. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to read everyone's poem and be good guys, but it's impossible," 
Bartnof said. "It's gotten to be a major job." 
</P>
<P>
There are also the money concerns and paperwork that go along with publishing a 
magazine. "We're not businessmen," Lyden said. In fact, both men are poets who 
prefer to spend their nights writing or attending readings. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the decision to stop publishing The Moment came soon after the 
magazine was awarded a $1,500 cultural grant from the city of Los Angeles. 
Lyden and Bartnof learned that to accept the money they had to become a 
nonprofit corporation. That meant more paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically, we're not sure we want to be, as artistes, supported by the 
government," Lyden said. "We like to put pictures in our magazine of Jesse 
Helms spanking the Pope's butt. We don't want to have to censor ourselves to 
get grants." 
</P>
<P>
So the publishers have decided to dig their magazine even deeper underground, 
hinting at infrequent and unannounced future issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bartnof and Lyden will continue their poetry hot line, 992-POEM, which offers 
recorded listings of Southern California readings and a short poetry selection. 
They will continue to publish small books of poetry, mostly by local poets, 
through their Shelf Life Press. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be around," Lyden said, "in some fashion."

A 'PARENT-FRIENDLY' CHILDREN'S FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
AGOURA HILLS: ABOUT 5,000 ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE TWO-DAY EVENT, WHICH WILL 
INCLUDE PLAYS, MIMES, MUSIC AND OTHER ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>

Zany puppets, mimes, clowns, storytellers, singers, dancers and largerthan-life 
Victorian pigs, frogs and porcupines -- TAFFY, the annual creative arts bash 
for children of all ages, is back this weekend for a sixth year. 
</P>
<P>
Also known as the Theatre Arts Festival for Youth, TAFFY will run from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday outdoors on three stages at the sprawling Peter 
Strauss Ranch in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
There will be strolling professional performers, arcade games such as Fish 
Boxing, Dunk the Dweeb and Quench the Queen, expanded workshops in puppet 
making, poetry and juggling -- and a 40-foot nylon whale to crawl through. 
</P>
<P>
And it's parent-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to say, 'The child in you will smile,' " said John Wood, who, along 
with his wife, Pam, produces the festival each year. "We intend to appeal to 
family audiences. We've geared the events from preschool to sixth grade, but we 
find parents love a lot of these groups too, and they enjoy sharing in their 
child's experience of discovery." 
</P>
<P>
TAFFY is becoming an annual entertainment staple for parents hungry to provide 
their children with movie and amusement park alternatives. When the nonprofit 
festival opened in 1984, attendance for both days was a meager 800. Last year, 
that figure expanded to 4,000. This year, based on the large number of tickets 
sold already, Wood estimates that at least 5,000 may attend. 
</P>
<P>
The Woods, co-founders of the veteran performing arts group J.P. Nightingale 
and perennial hosts of the Hollywood Bowl's Open House summer program, have 
been part of the children's arts scene for 16 years. They'll open and close the 
festival each day with "stories, songs, rhymes and mimes," they said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Marble Stage under oak trees, in the Penny Pit Theatre on the green and 
in the shady hillside amphitheater, some of the Southland's best-known 
children's entertainers will perform, joined by a few visitors from the North. 
</P>
<P>
Silly songsters and storytellers Dan Crow, Peter Alsop, Rob Evans and Courtney 
Campbell will appeal to funny bones. Joanie Bartels of Discovery Music and 
Canada's Bob Schneider and his Rainbow Kids will provide musical insights, 
while Craig Taubman and his kid-style rock 'n' rollin' Craig 'n' Co. appeal to 
parents and kids alike. 
</P>
<P>
There will be "The Wonderful World of Puppets" with the Jim Gamble Marionettes 
and "Folk Tales from the Americas," courtesy of Northern California's Magical 
Moonshine Puppet Theatre. A contrast in mime styles can be found in the 
performances of gentle clown Judy Garret and comic duo Schwartz &amp; Chung, 
noted for bizarre buffoonery and remarkable physical feats. 
</P>
<P>
The respected We Tell Stories theater troupe presents its "Spirit of Black 
Folklore" participatory show, and El Grupo Folklorico and Fujima Kansuma Kai 
celebrate Mexican and Japanese ethnic traditions in dance and song. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taffy Town Players, actors whimsically made up as Victorian-era 
animals living in the mythical town of Puddledumplin, will guide a treasure 
hunt, Maypole dances, perform a wedding, hold a rehearsal for "A Christmas 
Carol" and tell stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Huge Trolls looking like walking Shredded Wheat" will stroll the green, "and 
Florence Nightingale join nurses from the Children's Hospital Bear Clinic, 
where kids can bring their teddy bears and dolls," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
The crafts area has almost doubled from last year, to 14 booths and 11 
workshops. Young artisans can make masks, banners, crowns and hats, paint 
shirts, string necklaces, paint faces or try their skill at juggling and 
music-making. 
</P>
<P>
Children can crawl into Michael Marks' Inflatable Art -- an enormous 
transparent plastic square -- and paint it from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Roth's Moving Sculpture Society offers its "Nylon Zoo" activity: 50 
children at a time can dress up in animal costumes, learn dance moves, "then go 
into the belly of a 40-foot nylon whale" to hear a variety of storytellers. 
</P>
<P>
Booths will sell food and drink (with profits going to Tree of Life programs to 
feed the needy), as well as wooden signs, silhouettes and computerized personal 
books. One complimentary service for parents of soggy babies: changing tents 
providing free biodegradable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
The event is receiving growing support in the private sector, including a 
$7,000 contribution from Mervyn's department stores. It has been awarded a 
$4,500 city of Los Angeles Cultural Grant. As in the past, free tickets and 
transportation have been provided for hundreds of disadvantaged and disabled 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taffy Festival is at 30000 Mulholland Highway, Agoura Hills, from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Tickets: Adults $9; children 3 to 12, $8, under 
3 free. Free parking. For information, call (818) 99TAFFY.

SATURN, A SMALL CAR WITH A BIG MISSION, HITS THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SPRING HILL, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By its own admission, General Motors Corp. has only one more chance to prove 
that it can design and build a small car that can compete credibly with the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first shipments of Saturns, the small car carrying those big 
hopes for GM, left a sprawling new assembly plant here en route to dealers in 
California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn is GM's first new auto division since Chevrolet in 1918. Three versions 
of the car, a hybrid subcompact-compact with a starting price of $7,995, were 
displayed by workers who snatched away the vehicles' covers while their 
colleagues and state and local dignitaries cheered wildly. The cars were then 
driven to waiting tractor trailers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ship those cars to California. That's what we're here for," a Saturn executive 
ordered, referring to the most critical market for the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Notably absent from the ceremonies were executives from GM headquarters in 
Detroit, who deferred to officers of the subsidiary -- Saturn Corp. -- which 
the company created five years ago to design the new car from scratch. The 
public distance GM has maintained from the $3.5-billion project illustrates the 
marketplace burden that GM's name has become among buyers of imported cars. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturn leadership itself is a departure from the norm. In what the Saturn 
"team members" describe as a full-blown system of consensus decision-making, 
the venture is jointly managed by Saturn President Richard G. (Skip) LeFauve 
and a United Auto Workers officer, Richard Hoalcraft, who introduced themselves 
Thursday as "the Skip and Dick show," to the delight of 2,800 union members 
looking on. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Saturn can rise above its own cosmic hype, not to mention the 
formidable competition of about 30 established high-quality small cars, remains 
to be seen. Also, the car is being launched in an apparent recession 
accompanied by sharply rising gasoline prices, not the climate a car maker 
would choose. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the venture goes beyond GM's own fortunes. It is also seen as 
a test of America's ability to rebound from the beating its manufacturing 
sector has taken at the hand of foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturn officially goes on sale on Oct. 25 to a fledgling group of 30 
blue-chip dealers who invested up to $5 million apiece for the privilege of 
selling nothing but Saturns, although most have separate import franchises. 
Eight of these early dealers are in California, including five in the 
Southland. The number of outlets is to reach 130 by spring, building to 800. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Hand, a Toyota, Honda and Ford dealer who will shortly have Saturn 
dealerships in Torrance and near Los Angeles International Airport, describes 
interest in the car since an advertising campaign for it began as 
"extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Seventy callers to a Saturn toll-free number listed obscurely in print ads were 
referred to him in the last 24 hours alone, he said Thursday. Saturn says 
14,000 such calls were received nationally in the last five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Shortages seem inevitable as the assembly plant increases production more 
slowly than expected. The company will not say how many cars it is building, 
but dealers and workers say that UAW members have more than once halted early 
production out of concern for quality. Donald Hudler, Saturn's marketing vice 
president, concedes that there will be "fewer cars than we would like to have" 
by Oct. 25. He indicated that dealers, whom Saturn prefers to call retailers, 
would have 30 to 35 cars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some car dealers faced with heavy demand have charged whatever the 
market would bear, angering customers expecting to pay no more than the posted 
prices. In Saturn's case, executives concede, the practice would send the wrong 
signal from a venture that bills itself in its ads as "a different kind of car 
company." Hand said: "If a black market doesn't develop, my inclination is to 
sell at the sticker price." 
</P>
<P>
The car itself -- a four-door sedan and two-door coupe, to be followed in the 
next couple of years by a station wagon, convertible and other versions -- has 
generally received good reviews. Test drives suggest that it is above what are 
perceived to be Detroit's standards. 
</P>
<P>
"For a first effort, they've done a good job," said Chris Cedergren, analyst at 
J. D. Power &amp; Associates, the Agoura Hills, Calif., consulting firm whose 
auto quality surveys have for years documented the inferior quality of domestic 
cars and, more recently, Detroit's improvements. Some enthusiasts' magazines 
have described Saturn as generally comparable to the better Japanese cars. 
</P>
<P>
In concept, the Saturn venture bears little resemblance to the long trail of 
wreckage that represents GM's previous small-car efforts: the Corvairs, Vegas, 
Citations and sister cars whose notorious problems helped opened the door for 
Japan's little-known auto makers to triumph in this country in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
GM began working on the project eight years ago, envisioning it from the start 
as a clean-sheet approach. The project was staffed with volunteers attracted to 
the idea of cutting through some 80 years' worth of corporate insularity, 
acrimonious labor relations and other ills that have made the domestic auto 
industry vulnerable to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a separate subsidiary, LeFauve said, gave GM, the union and a 
few key dealers the legal freedom to write a new labor agreement and overhaul 
the retail distribution system, thus attacking two of the industry's most 
intractable problems. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn then chose the Tennessee hills, after a nationwide bidding war by 
hundreds of communities, for a massive manufacturing complex that not only 
assembles the car but casts its aluminum engine blocks and cylinder heads and 
builds its engine and transmission. This gave Saturn ground-up control over the 
heart of the car. 
</P>
<P>
The car shares just 2% of its parts with other GM divisions, chief engineer Jay 
Wetzel said. Everything else was designed exclusively for Saturn, although 
various GM component manufacturing units supply about 70% of the car. 
</P>
<P>
The size and cost of the project were cut sharply from the $5 billion and 
500,000 cars a year first envisioned by recently retired GM Chairman Roger B. 
Smith, who came up with the Saturn idea. But it is still a massive undertaking, 
and its scope -- when GM already had more plants and less money than it needed 
-- continues to raise doubts in and out of GM. 
</P>
<P>
Some saw it as an indulgence of Smith that drained money from elsewhere in the 
corporation. The reported delays in certain GM new car projects for the early 
1990s, said analyst Daniel Luria of the Industrial Technology Institute in Ann 
Arbor, Mich., is GM's way of "making room" for Saturn in the market at the 
expense of other GM divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of resentment at first, especially at Chevy and Pontiac," said 
a mid-level Saturn executive. "But I think that's subsiding." 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Maryann Keller, in a 1989 book called "Rude Awakening," which some 
company executives privately recommend as a good primer on GM, said progress in 
quality and labor relations elsewhere in GM -- notably at "Buick City" and a 
joint venture plant with Toyota in Fremont, Calif. -- made Saturn "almost 
redundant." 
</P>
<P>
But to LeFauve, a career GM engineer, that sounds more like a compliment to GM 
than a complaint. He said Saturn stands apart from the myriad of joint ventures 
with Japanese firms that GM and the other U.S. auto firms have entered in to, 
using Japanese designs and components. Saturn is home-grown. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's GM out there laying itself on the line and getting beat up for it," he 
said. "It's hard for me to see why. I think GM deserves a hell of a lot of 
credit. Saturn is an absolute statement by GM that we think there's need for 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The Saturn is aimed at such premier small cars as the subcompact Toyota Corolla 
and Honda Civic, although in size it straddles the compact and subcompact 
markets. Those categories of cars account for 4 million sales a year. Saturn 
hopes to be building 240,000 cars annually within a year, which would put it in 
the same sales league as Civic and Corolla and make it one of the top 15 
selling cars overall. 
</P>
<P>
But the big question is whether those sales are made to current import 
customers or are simply stolen from other domestic auto companies and, worst of 
all, from GM itself. Although some "cannibalization" from Chevrolet, Pontiac 
and other GM divisions is expected, Hudler said the new car won't be considered 
a success unless 80% of its sales ultimately come from non-GM customers. 
</P>
<P>
Such inroads are vital to GM, whose future has been slipping away as first-time 
car buyers opt for other makes. It is bad enough that the company's share of 
total U.S. sales has tumbled from 45% to 35% in recent years, but, among those 
under 45 years of age, GM has dropped to a paltry 25% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Even GM's small cars have old owners. The average buyer of a Chevrolet 
Cavalier, which outsells the Civic and Corolla, is over 50, a Saturn marketing 
executive noted. Saturn aims at those aged 25 to 45, 60% of whom have gone to 
college, who make $5,000 to $15,000 more a year than buyers of domestic cars. 
</P>
<P>
Saturn alone is unlikely to dramatically change that picture, nor is it likely 
to cause sales problems for the Civic and Corolla, market analysts say. More 
likely, sales will come from what one dealer called the "marginal" imports, 
such as Isuzu, Subaru, Hyundai, among others, as well as domestic makes. 
</P>
<P>
A case can be made that the actual sales results of Saturn are less important 
than the deep changes that this project is trying to make in the GM system. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to create a partnership across Saturn goes beyond the work force to 
its dealers, who helped create a unique distribution system that gives them 
large exclusive territories and lets them add their own sales outlets within 
their market areas as demand warrants. Typically, auto makers add nearby 
competing franchises when there are sales to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole new world," said Mike Smith, vice president and general manager 
of a Saturn agency in Santa Ana run by megadealer John Campbell III of Irvine, 
whose GM, Nissan, Ford, Mazda and Porsche franchises generate sales of more 
than $150 million a year. "Everything Saturn does is different." 
</P>
<P>
Dealer Hand said that the market-area plan was one of two factors that 
persuaded him to invest $5 million. The other, he said, "was when I realized 
just how serious the UAW was about producing quality cars." 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew a UAW guy before. Now, I'm on a first-name basis with several of 
them. I've been involved at a level in Saturn I never dreamed of. I mean, I sit 
there and approve the ads with Hudler and a UAW guy. Who'd have thought it?" 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of spreading such fundamental changes throughout GM has led to 
speculation that the auto maker is prepared to lose money on Saturn almost 
indefinitely, a notion that was fueled by the car's unexpectedly low prices. 
The $7,995 bottom price for a relatively well-equipped version of Saturn won a 
standing ovation from dealers when it was announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about profits on the car, analyst Cedergren said, "Who cares? We've 
been criticizing the Big Three for years for being short-term oriented. If 80% 
of Saturn's sales are new to GM, I don't care if it loses money for 30 years, 
it's a success." 
</P>
<P>
Saturn's executives guffaw at such talk but won't say when the subsidiary hopes 
to go in the black. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we can get there without screwing everything up," Hudler said. 
</P>

FOR KUWAITI EXILE REGIME: PHONES, FAXES, NIGHTMARES; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: FROM A MOUNTAIN HOTEL, OFFICIALS MANAGE GLOBAL ASSETS AND SEEK TO 
LEAD A SCATTERED PEOPLE.

TAIF, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a luxury resort hotel perched high in the arid mountains that rise up from 
the Red Sea, the government of Kuwait goes about the business of running a 
country in exile. 
</P>
<P>
By day, the desert wind whines eerily through the vaulted lobby, while 
white-robed security guards with machine guns in shoulder holsters roam past 
the reception desk. Government aides carry reports from the Defense Ministry, 
on the mezzanine level, to the prime minister's reception room, on the fifth 
floor. Reports arrive by facsimile from Kuwaiti embassies in London and 
Washington. The telephones ring relentlessly. 
</P>
<P>
By night, Kuwait's Cabinet ministers gather behind closed doors for hour after 
hour of meetings, then wander upstairs to a long, white-clothed table to dine 
on whole roasted lamb and spiced rice. 
</P>
<P>
Aides turn on CNN or Egyptian soap operas in a room off the main lobby. After 
dinner, Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, the crown prince, puts on tennis shoes 
under his long white dishdasha and leaves the hotel. His driver takes him to a 
spot not far from the hotel, and he walks back in the silent desert night. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely does anyone see the emir. Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, when he is at 
the hotel, spends most of the time closeted in his fifth-floor suite, walking 
up and down on the balcony that looks out over the majestic Sarawad Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there must be no more tiles left on the floor of the balcony: He just 
walks back and forth," a member of the royal family said. "You never see him 
sitting anymore. He's either walking or standing. Since right after the crisis, 
he didn't want to talk to anyone, he doesn't want to hear anything. He won't 
read the newspaper, he has someone read it to him. He doesn't say anything. He 
just keeps walking." 
</P>
<P>
If there is an air of unreality to this remote bureaucratic retreat, it is 
because there is an element of the fantastic in trying to govern a country 
whose population is scattered across Saudi Arabia, to other countries in the 
Persian Gulf, and to Cairo, London and Paris; a country that has been invaded 
and annexed by Iraq, and whose financial assets around the globe, estimated at 
$100 billion, must be harnessed to support day-to-day needs and a military 
buildup. 
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is a country that now consists almost entirely of hotel rooms," said 
one diplomat in Saudi Arabia, which has become host to the largest population 
of Kuwaitis outside Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At least half of Kuwait's native population has fled the country, and half of 
those people, perhaps 150,000, are in Saudi Arabia. Hotels in Dammam, Dhahran, 
Khobar and Riyadh are filled with Kuwaiti families. High-rise apartment 
buildings in Riyadh, Jidda and Dammam are being renovated to house thousands 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti children are enrolling in Saudi schools. Kuwaiti government branch 
offices throughout the country offer a monthly stipend for Kuwaiti families 
that averages $810 a month. All this, including medical care and educational 
expenses, is costing the Kuwaiti government nearly $150 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers are spread all over the world, making diplomatic contacts 
with foreign governments and keeping the Kuwaiti treasury afloat. The oil 
minister has negotiated to purchase crude oil, mostly from Saudi Arabia, to 
supply Kuwait Petroleum's 6,533 retail gasoline stations and three refineries 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The finance minister is helping oversee Kuwait's investments in auto 
manufacturer Daimler-Benz AG, chemicals manufacturer Hoechst AG, Britain's 
Midland Bank PLC, San Francisco's Santa Fe International Corp. and plantations 
in Malaysia. The defense minister is organizing military recruiting centers in 
Saudi Arabia that have signed up more than 3,200 Kuwaitis in the past 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Kuwait Airways is preparing to resume regular passenger service to 
New York, London, Bombay, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur with the eight Boeing 747s 
and 727s that were outside of Kuwait when the Iraqis invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Cairo to New York in eight hours and back to Kuwait any minute," says one of 
the advertisements scheduled to begin running in the Arabic-language press this 
weekend. "Until we're able to welcome you home, welcome aboard," says another. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living a dilemma, but we are trying to be up to the situation," said 
Housing Minister Yahia al Sumait. "We know this is not what the Kuwaitis 
deserve, but under the circumstances, we have tried as much as we can to give 
the Kuwaitis outside the country enough so that they maintain their dignity as 
Kuwaitis, and their pride, but where they also would not forget their brothers 
inside Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we are guests here, even as a government. This is a very serious and 
devastating thing to happen. We have been hurt in every sense of the word. Our 
people have been scattered all over the world. Everybody is looking for his 
brother or his son or his father. We pray day and night for this to end." 
</P>
<P>
In Taif, the sense of surrealism is magnified because it is the maelstrom of 
the Kuwaiti nightmare, a hotel full of fallen princes and their professional 
public relations aides who work round-the-clock to document their nightmares in 
the hope that the rest of the world might help end them. 
</P>
<P>
Blown-up photographs of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein line some of the hotel 
corridors, next to similar blow-ups of Adolf Hitler. Press releases document 
Iraqi atrocities inside Kuwait: tales of soldiers killing innocent civilians in 
their homes, slaughtering animals in the Kuwait city zoo, turning the ill and 
the mentally incompetent out of hospitals and into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis trade stories of the invasion, of how it was when they escaped, what 
the Iraqi soldiers did, how afraid they were. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, we are not used even to firecrackers -- firecrackers are forbidden 
-- and now we see bombs coming out from tanks?" a government official said. "It 
was like a dream. Planes and tanks. I saw so many people paralyzed on the 
streets. They don't believe what's going on. Tens of helicopters, like 
butterflies in our skies. Just imagine yourself there." 
</P>
<P>
At this point the man, the head of a government department, pressed his fingers 
to his eyes and refused to go on. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Jabbar al Mubarak al Sabah, a member of the ruling family and director 
general of civil aviation in Kuwait, said: "You don't understand how it is 
here, because your hand is in the water. Mine is in the fire. Since I came out 
from Kuwait, I don't remember that I slept before 5 or 6 in the morning. 
Whenever you lie there and look at the ceiling, things come to your mind, and 
other things become connected to that thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you sleep, you think about driving a car. Suddenly you see a mountain, 
you start thinking about the mountain, then you start to think about trees on 
the mountain, the birds, the river, it keeps going like this, you see? And this 
happens to me on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
When a listener seems not to understand, he talks about a doctor friend of his 
who left Kuwait recently and went to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"He locked his door," he said, "and he grew his beard, and he did not come out, 
he just lay on the bed looking at the ceiling. He did not talk to anybody. I 
don't know. Probably he saw strange things. I know if we go back to Kuwait, I 
think they should bring hundreds of psychiatrists." 
</P>
<P>
As the rest of the world debates the wisdom of military action against Iraq, 
and appears bent on holding out for a diplomatic resolution as long as 
possible, Kuwaiti officials fear that their country is slowly disappearing with 
every Iraqi family who moves into Kuwait city, with every telephone pole, 
computer, diagnostic machine and video recorder hauled back to Baghdad, with 
every Kuwaiti killed for fighting against the Iraqi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are impatient," the housing minister said. "Every day we receive 
information from inside Kuwait, the more impatient we are. Of course, all those 
leaders of the free world talk about peace, because they know what war is. If 
you have a wound, you try to cure it by all kinds of medicine, but if the only 
kind of medicine that will work is a hot steam, then that must be it. 
</P>
<P>
"If it can be done without war -- please. But the question is, how long? Those 
leaders talk about war and they know what it is, but Saddam (Hussein), this man 
doesn't want to speak wisdom. He doesn't care what happens to Kuwait, to 
Kuwaitis. Yes, I am impatient. But you have to forgive me for this."

GETTING THE MESSAGE BY COMPUTER;

NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NETWORKS ARE HELPING MORE PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE BY 
ELECTRONIC MAIL. SPEED, DIRECTNESS AND A SENSE OF ANONYMITY ARE ATTRACTING HOME 
USERS.

<P>
As Alice McLerran's father lay dying in a Rancho Bernardo retirement home, she 
was at his bedside -- with her laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
McLerran tapped out a stream of messages on her keyboard, sending updates on 
her father's condition to everyone from a sister in Lexington, Mass., to a son 
in Seattle to a cousin in Dublin, Ohio. Her scattered family shot back words of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that by having the laptop, I could keep everyone close by," said 
McLerran, a children's book author from Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
When Americans reach out and touch friends and loved ones, increasingly they 
are doing it by personal computer. Already widely used in the workplace and in 
scientific circles, electronic mail and computerized bulletin board networks 
finally are making inroads into the home and drawing a devoted following. 
</P>
<P>
Urban sprawl, the pressure on two-income families to get more done in less time 
and the need many people have for more human contact are creating demand for 
computer communications, proponents say. Shut-ins and lovers have met via their 
PCs. 
</P>
<P>
Many people find the speed, directness and sense of anonymity of computer 
messaging liberating, and some of the biggest fans of the technology hope it 
will inspire a rebirth in the art of correspondence. Social conventions, 
however, still are being established. Network users sometimes let loose when 
they dash off a message. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get the same kind of problems you do with any other social 
interaction," said Jack M. Nilles, a Brentwood management consultant who 
specializes in technology issues. "People can be rude, obnoxious and foul." 
</P>
<P>
The computer networks also offer a way to transmit annoying junk messages and, 
occasionally, pornography in the form of "digital dirty pictures" to a computer 
user's screen. Authorities say criminals have been known to tap obscure 
computer networks to negotiate drug deals, plot child molestation schemes and 
distribute stolen credit card numbers and other confidential data. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a truly mass medium, computer communications will have to win 
over far more of the PC-wary American public. By one estimate, 1.7 million U.S. 
households subscribe to public networks with bulletin boards and electronic 
mail, or e-mail. That's more than double the 1987 total, but the number of 
people who actually send messages from their home PCs every week still is 
believed to be only in the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
People talk with one another by PC in three basic ways: 
</P>
<P>
With e-mail, they can send a private written message directly to one person or 
to a defined group. Those who receive the note can read it at their 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
A related activity, typically known as chatting or conferencing, involves 
groups of computer users holding "conversations" by sending messages among 
themselves simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Bulletin boards, on the other hand, are forums where comments and questions are 
posted that anyone else scrolling through the board later can answer -- either 
by posting a reply on the board or by firing an e-mail message back to the 
original sender. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech hobbyists and others who work on computers at their offices were the 
first to embrace the technology for the home. With systems becoming easier to 
use, novices such as McLerran, a self-described "computer illiterate," are 
starting to join them. 
</P>
<P>
The handicapped, the elderly, AIDS patients and others with special concerns 
who crave companionship or a public forum rave about computer messaging. Carol 
Cunningham, a wheelchair-bound private tutor in Irving, Tex., got her first 
home computer as a Christmas gift last year, signed up for a network in 
February and quickly became an enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't always just get out and jump into a car and meet somebody. Yet we can 
sign onto a computer, and get onto e-mail," she said. Cunningham, 48, is in a 
pair of informal computer groups for the disabled that swap information on such 
things as new shower chairs and hotels with good wheelchair access. 
</P>
<P>
Computer messaging is helping many other ordinary Americans. Traveling 
salespeople sometimes check on their children back home by computer instead of 
by telephone. After last year's big earthquake, PC owners in the Bay Area used 
e-mail to let their loved ones across the country know that they were OK, using 
leased transmissions lines spared by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica residents correspond with city officials via computer about street 
crime and the homeless on a municipal computer network launched last year. 
</P>
<P>
The computer networks, largely through their bulletin boards on special topics, 
also are creating "virtual communities" of people interested in such diverse 
areas as Eastern European politics, model airplanes and science fiction. After 
last year's Tian An Men Square massacre, Chinese students around the world 
looked to bulletin boards to organize protests and compile lists of the dead 
and missing. 
</P>
<P>
"You see groups of people getting together who never would have before," Nilles 
said. Late last year, an Arizona man who had searched for his two sons for 29 
years located them by spotting one of their names on the CompuServe network. 
</P>
<P>
E-mail devotees say a big part of the appeal is that people let their hair down 
when they converse electronically. 
</P>
<P>
McLerran cites the case of her "computer niece," a close friend she made via 
computer. In normal social settings, the friend is "painfully, painfully shy." 
On the computer, McLerran says, "She's a social butterfly." 
</P>
<P>
Loosened inhibitions, however, can lead to trouble. "People who have a lot of 
pent-up hostility find this is a way to lash out," said McLerran, citing the 
overheated computer exchanges known in some circles as "flaming." 
</P>
<P>
She said she belonged to an e-mail writers group whose computer conferences 
deteriorated at one point into name-calling and vulgarity. She quit the group 
after discovering that she "really, really hurt" the feelings of another writer 
whose work she critiqued. 
</P>
<P>
McLerran said she realized that "if I can't see their faces and see how they 
react (to criticism), I might be doing something I shouldn't fool with." 
</P>
<P>
Still, enthusiasts say computer linkups are a great way to make friends. 
Dorothy Fulk, a day care center operator from Apalachin, N.Y., said she started 
using a computer "chat" line on the Genie network to cope with her loneliness 
after divorce. Fulk said she likes the way computer communications breaks down 
social barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"You really communicate with the person," she said. "You don't get distracted 
by how old they are, how fat they are, or whether they're black or white." 
</P>
<P>
It also can lead to romance. Fulk met her current husband, Steven, after 
chatting with him for nearly a year by computer. One of their first exchanges 
came after Dorothy, then a graduate student, posted an electronic note seeking 
volunteers to take a coffee marketing survey. Before long, they made a "date" 
to participate in a computer round-table discussion on space exploration, a 
mutual interest. 
</P>
<P>
They eventually arranged a face-to-face meeting, and the relationship bloomed. 
Last month Dorothy gave birth to their first child, a girl, and the Fulks put 
out their birth announcement over the computer. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't always work out that well. The clumsy singles bar pickup line, "Come 
here often?" has an e-mail equivalent, "I like the way you type." Also, some 
users complain about unsolicited electronic advances, including come-ons from 
men who portray themselves as women, or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of computer messaging seems to have caught some experts by surprise. 
Many of the newcomers to computer communications were brought into the fold by 
Prodigy, a fast-growing electronic information service owned by International 
Business Machines and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy was unveiled two years ago as an easy-to-use system for casual computer 
users largely for computerized shopping, banking and investing. But its 
less-emphasized e-mail service has proven to be unexpectedly popular, 
particularly among a hard-core group that the company says amounts to about 5% 
of its subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
When Prodigy announced plans in September to impose new charges next year on 
its heaviest users of e-mail, angry subscribers fired off thousands of 
complaints and started boycotting retailers that advertise on the system. 
"Those who like it, like it a lot, and are very vocal about it," said Gary 
Arlen, an information services consultant in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy said it is adding the e-mail charge to cover its costs. On top of a 
monthly fee of up to $12.95, Prodigy subscribers eventually will be charged 25 
cents a message if they exceed their limit of 30 free messages a month, under 
the current plan. 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe, at 10 years old the longest-running and biggest of the networks for 
home computer users, charges most users 21 cents a minute, on top of a monthly 
fee of $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases e-mail is cheaper than a long-distance phone call, and that cost 
advantage may be inherent because e-mail generally takes up less transmission 
time than voice communications. 
</P>
<P>
Over the short term, the chances of a continued boom in communications via home 
computer is generally thought to be bright. Arlen estimates that computer 
networks have signed up little more than one-quarter of the roughly 6.25 
million U.S. households that have PCs and modems, the telecommunications 
devices that let computers talk over the phone. Meanwhile, more people are 
buying PCs and modems for their homes, even if the trend is much slower than 
futurists once expected. 
</P>
<P>
Experts differ, however, on how far home linkups will go over the long run. 
Prodigy has lost hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is not clear whether 
its competitors are making enough money to stay in the business indefinitely 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the big companies that operate computer networks -- including 
long-distance telephone giants American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, US Sprint 
and MCI Communications -- are aiming more at business customers than 
residential users. MCI touted its MCI Mail service in 1983 as "the nation's 
next post office," only to see it take off slowly. 
</P>
<P>
France's Minitel network, using millions of simple terminals distributed at no 
charge by a government utility, is considered the most successful electronic 
information system overseas. But Robert W. Lucky, research chief at AT&amp;T's 
Bell Laboratories, noted that it has relied on subsidies and other types of 
public support that networks are unlikely to get in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Minitel's popularity is limited. Among the few big money-makers are its 
notorious "pink" erotic messages services, which critics say are used by 
prostitutes and child molesters to make contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many Americans are uneasy about working on computers. "Half the 
people in this country don't know how to program their VCRs," Lucky said. 
"People won't take to this naturally." 
</P>
<P>
Even as computers become easier to use, some experts say, the telephone will 
remain a formidable competitor, particularly as new telephone information 
services are introduced. 
</P>
<P>
And although an adequate PC and modem now can be bought for well under $1,000, 
the cost still scares off many consumers. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the technology is plagued with unresolved logistic, legal and 
ethical concerns. Once too many people start using a bulletin board, it tends 
to get cluttered with junk messages, Lucky said. The issue has fueled debates 
pitting computer users who support open access to bulletin boards against 
others who want some editing so they don't have to waste time wading through 
irrelevant messages. 
</P>
<P>
Still, enthusiasts predict that the problems will be worked out over time and 
that the coming years will bring an explosion in computer messaging. They are 
encouraged by recent negotiations between computer networks to arrange hookups 
enabling subscribers on different systems to communicate with each other. The 
lack of hookups between computer networks, experts say, has held back computer 
messaging much the same way the lack of a unified telephone network hampered 
the use of the telephone around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest thing computer messaging may have going for it is the human 
need to communicate, a need that the technology fulfills for many people. "When 
I touch my keyboard," Lucky said, "I really feel as though I'm in touch with 
the world."

STUDY OF TWINS EMPHASIZES IMPORTANCE OF HEREDITY; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: GENES ARE CALLED FAR MORE INFLUENTIAL IN SHAPING BEHAVIOR THAN FAMILY 
ENVIRONMENT.

A landmark study on identical twins raised apart offers new reassurance to 
parents who worry about the adequacy of their child-rearing efforts and 
rekindles the age-old debate of nature vs. nurture. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited study, the most definitive in a long series trying to separate 
the effects of genetics and environment in a child's development, comes down 
heavily on the side of genetics. It indicates that the broad outlines of 
personality and behavior are put in place in the brief instant when the 
mother's and father's genes mix during conception, establishing the basic route 
that the child will take during the rest of its life. 
</P>
<P>
Nurture -- the family environment -- plays a much smaller role, according to 
the study, published today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
"For most every behavioral trait so far investigated, from reaction time to 
religiosity, an important fraction of the variation among people turns out to 
be associated with genetic variation," wrote the University of Minnesota 
researchers, led by psychologist Thomas J. Bouchard Jr. This work "does not 
show that parents cannot influence those traits, but simply that this does not 
tend to happen in most families." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Robert Plomin of Pennsylvania State University called the 
Minnesota twin study "the single most important finding in behavioral genetics 
in the last decade." The results in general agree with many previous studies of 
the role of genetics in producing behavior. 
</P>
<P>
But the new research finds a stronger connection between genetics and behavior 
than the previous studies, said Norman Krasnegor of the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development. "It's a powerful statement and one which 
people will debate for a long time," he said. "It will cause some good 
controversy and make people work to come up with new data or alternate 
explanations." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist David Rowe of the University of Arizona agreed heartily with the 
new study. "Parents probably deserve less credit for when things go well, and 
much less blame for problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the study "does not imply that parenting is without lasting effects," the 
group wrote. "Parents can produce . . . effects if they grossly deprive or 
mistreat all their children. It seems reasonable that charismatic, dedicated 
parents determined to make all their children share certain personal qualities, 
interests, or values, may sometimes succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that 70% of the intelligence quotient -- IQ -- is 
accounted for by genes, the strongest correlation found for any characteristic. 
Genetics also accounts for about 50% of personality differences, including 
traits such as extroversion; 50% of religiosity, including how often someone 
attends religious events, and about 40% for job interest variations. 
</P>
<P>
Environment accounts for the rest of the differences, but the researchers note 
that even two children in the same family may not share the same environment. 
"The environment molds your personality, but your genes determine what kind of 
environment you . . . seek," said Minnesota psychologist David T. Lykken, one 
of the study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of genetically identical twins -- which occur about once in every 240 
births when a fertilized egg splits into two embryos during development -- are 
especially valuable to researchers. If the twins are adopted into different 
families at birth and raised separately, then the study provides a unique tool 
to separate the closely entwined effects of nature and nurture. 
</P>
<P>
Three previous studies of such twins have been conducted, but the Minnesota 
study, begun in 1979, is by far the largest, now enrolling more than 100 sets 
from around the world. The study has been widely profiled in the news media 
because of the eerie similarities that have been observed in reunited twins. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Levey and Mark Newman, for example, were twins who did not meet until the 
age of 30. When they were reunited, both had similar mustaches and hairstyles, 
aviator glasses, big belt buckles and big key rings. Each was a volunteer 
firefighter and made his living installing safety equipment. Each drank 
Budweiser and crushed the cans when he finished. 
</P>
<P>
Levey and Newman are the rule, not the exception, Bouchard has found. 
</P>
<P>
"We think of each pair of identical twins as one piece of music played by two 
different musicians," Bouchard said. "The music can be played fantastically, or 
it may not run right. But you'll always be able to recognize the piece. That's 
because nature writes the score. Environment is responsible for the playing 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Minnesota researchers report in today's Science paper, they have been 
able to quantify the contribution of genetics. 
</P>
<P>
But Bouchard also cautions: "Just because something's genetically influenced 
doesn't mean it's chiseled in stone. . . . If I see a child who has problems 
with aggression, I don't curse genetics. I recommend a therapist."

CENSUS STAFF TO INVESTIGATE UNDERCOUNT COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau has agreed to investigate the claims of 17% of the 
nation's cities, counties and towns -- including the city of Los Angeles -- 
that the 1990 preliminary census missed thousands of housing units across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the bureau has accepted for review the challenges of 6,602 communities, 
including 128 in Southern California, while rejecting 983 challenges 
nationwide. Over the next week or so, census workers are expected to recanvass 
homes in many of these communities and will add inhabitants of houses they 
missed to the census roll. 
</P>
<P>
The claims of inaccuracies surfaced last month when local governments across 
the country took issue with the Census Bureau's preliminary population count. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, cities and counties were given the opportunity to analyze the 
bureau's preliminary tally -- comparing the bureau's list of households with 
local inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the nation's largest cities reported discrepancies of more than 
570,000 housing units. Los Angeles city officials reported that the census 
missed nearly 49,000 dwellings, or almost 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities challenging the census in California are both slow- and 
fast-growing communities. Oakland, according to the latest census figures, grew 
6% to 360,000 people, but officials there believe the count missed 500 houses 
and apartments. Cathedral City was the state's fastest-growing city, jumping by 
600% over the last decade. Local officials contend the Census Bureau may have 
missed 4,000 people, or 12% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 39,198 local governments nationwide, only one in four communities 
officially responded to the preliminary census figures and as many as a quarter 
of those said they accepted the bureau's preliminary counts. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, census officials interpreted this as a sign that despite 
vociferous complaints from a number of large cities, including New York and Los 
Angeles, the vast majority of the nation's towns and cities were satisfied with 
the census. Many legislators, however, have taken a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara Bryant (director of the Census Bureau) argues that it's a sign the 
census is going well because 80% of the jurisdictions did not complain," said 
an aide to Rep. Thomas Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat who heads the congressional 
subcommittee on population and census. "Far from indicating that 80% were 
satisfied with the results, we believe that most jurisdictions lacked the time 
or the resources to mount a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's preliminary population count was 245.8 million, short of 
the 250 million mark the bureau had estimated before the 1990 census began. 
</P>
<P>
In both the House of Representatives and Senate, legislation has been 
introduced that would prohibit the Census Bureau from releasing official 
population figures until officials decide whether to revise the traditional 
head count by using a controversial statistical method. The technique, 
generally supported by big-city Democrats and opposed by suburban and 
small-town Republicans, would give relative weight to areas of the country that 
are thought to be routinely undercounted, such as inner cities with large black 
and other minority populations and rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
A number of cities challenging the preliminary census results have decided to 
join New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dade County (Miami) in a lawsuit, 
originally filed in 1988, designed to force the bureau to use the so-called 
post-enumeration survey.

NEW SLEEPING BAN REAWAKENS DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: ACTIVISTS SAY A SANTA BARBARA LAW RESTRICTING USE OF MANY PUBLIC 
PLACES IS DISCRIMINATORY. THE CITY SAYS IT IS BEING UNFAIRLY SINGLED OUT BY 
CRITICS.

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeless activists Thursday protested a new city law that prohibits sleeping in 
many public areas, the latest in a series of disputes between city officials 
and homeless activists that date from the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which went into effect Thursday, discriminates against the homeless, 
activists said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have similar laws and Santa Barbara has again been unfairly 
singled out for criticism, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the city was vilified by activists throughout the country for 
its treatment of the homeless. It was even lampooned by Garry Trudeau in the 
comic strip "Doonesbury." 
</P>
<P>
City officials complained then that Santa Barbara was targeted because of its 
proximity to President Ronald Reagan's ranch and the attendant publicity value. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the argument began anew as a few dozen homeless people and 
supporters, including a contingent from Los Angeles, picketed City Hall and 
camped out in front of the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"This law is not only ridiculous, it's downright unconstitutional," said 
Willard Hastings, director of the local Legal Defense Center. "You can't tell a 
segment of the population that it's illegal to fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sheila Lodge said Santa Barbara is being criticized because of its 
"unfair" reputation as a wealthy beach community. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Carpinteria, a beach town 12 miles south of Santa Barbara, has an 
ordinance prohibiting sleeping in public that is even more stringent than Santa 
Barbara's. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's law still allows people to sleep on city property that has not 
been developed, such as a 1 1/2-acre parcel near the beach called the "jungle," 
where many homeless people spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply not true to say we're preventing the homeless from sleeping in 
Santa Barbara. . . . We're just saying you can't sleep on the streets or in 
areas that will cause problems for people," Lodge said. "There are other areas 
to sleep, including the jungle . . . and this is a beach area where people pay 
$100 a night to stay . . . so it couldn't be too bad." 
</P>
<P>
While Santa Barbara has the reputation as a community with an income level 
comparable to Malibu or La Jolla, the comparisons really are more applicable to 
neighboring communities such as Montecito and Hope Ranch. The median household 
income in Santa Barbara is below the state average, according to the last 
census, and more than half the residents are renters. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and local homeless activists agree that Santa Barbara has more 
social services for the homeless than most communities of 85,000. There are 
four homeless shelters in the city -- a fifth during winter -- and more than 
2,000 units of subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a complaint with the city's social services . . . we object to 
this law that targets the homeless," Hastings said. "You couldn't get away with 
a law that said it was illegal for blacks or women to sleep in public." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's reputation as a community hostile to the homeless began in the 
mid-1980s when a transient was found shot to death near downtown. A few weeks 
later, leaflets appeared at a popular gathering spot for the homeless warning: 
"You . . . are low-life scum and will not endure." Eight months later, a 
transient was murdered by a cadet from a Santa Barbara military school. 
</P>
<P>
The city received further adverse publicity when a proposal -- which was 
rejected -- was brought before the City Council to outlaw removal of food from 
garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
Another city ordinance banning sleeping in public also generated controversy 
several years ago, but it was repealed when Mitch Snyder, a nationally known 
homeless activist, threatened to lead thousands of marchers from Los Angeles to 
Santa Barbara to defy the anti-sleeping ban. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy resurfaced early this year when a Santa Barbara Superior Court 
judge redefined camping in public areas, which was banned by the city, as 
temporarily living out of doors. Homeless activists complained that this ruling 
made sleeping in public, once again, illegal. City officials disagreed with the 
judge's ruling, and the city attorney issued a memo explaining the distinction 
between camping and sleeping outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless wanted the city to change the law, and the city refused. Last 
spring, a number of homeless people began camping out in front of City Hall in 
protest. Last month, the city relented and rewrote the ordinance so that people 
sleeping on bedrolls or in sleeping bags could not be arrested for camping. The 
protest in front of City Hall was called off. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city passed another ordinance banning sleeping in many 
public areas. Those found violating the law will receive a citation "like a 
traffic ticket," and could be fined up to $100, a city police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
This ordinance was passed, city officials said, because many of the City Hall 
protesters had urinated in public, accosted female city employees and openly 
used drugs. They wanted to prevent this from happening in the future, Lodge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the issue really comes down to the city trying to get rid of homeless 
people," said Mike Neely, of the Homeless Outreach Program in Los Angeles, who 
was protesting at City Hall. "One way to do that is arrest them for sleeping."

NEW TEXTBOOKS: OUT WITH DULL, IN WITH DIVERSE

<P>
They are not like any history books you've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
American history does not begin with the country's "discovery" by Christopher 
Columbus. The Italian explorer is not even introduced until the fifth chapter 
of one of the controversial history texts that received approval Thursday from 
a key committee of the State Board of Education for use in kindergarten through 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
The "melting pot" concept of American diversity taught to generations of 
students is tossed out in favor of the "salad bowl" approach. U.S. history is 
presented not just through the eyes of European immigrants, but through the 
stories of American Indians who were pushed off their land and blacks brought 
from Africa and enslaved. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a few oblique references to religious differences, the textbooks 
devote entire chapters to explaining the history, beliefs and customs of 
Judaism, Islam and Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-0 vote Thursday came only from the board's policy and planning committee, 
but approval seems almost certain when the full board votes today. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from traditional textbooks, the new series incorporates lessons 
in geography, archeology and language arts. The books -- Houghton Mifflin 
social studies for kindergarten through eighth grade and an eighth-grade book 
published by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston -- are a far cry from the dull 
collection of dates and places common to many history texts. The committee also 
added an eighth-grade book published by Scott, Foresman &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The new books are chockablock with colorful maps and graphs and rely on 
first-person narratives and excerpts from literature by a diverse group of 
authors. Students are encouraged to grapple with moral dilemmas and relate 
historical events to their own lives, giving history a decidedly personal feel. 
</P>
<P>
A speech by Martin Luther King Jr. is presented early in one of the books to 
establish a perspective for thinking about America. Pictures give a sharp 
indication of the cruelty and harshness of slave life. Half of a seventh-grade 
world history textbook -- compared to about one-third of the current text -- is 
devoted to non-Western, non-European studies. 
</P>
<P>
In-depth accounts of tribal life of various American Indian tribes are 
included, compared to one or two sentences describing the tribes in current 
texts. 
</P>
<P>
The differences, while exciting educators and historians, have brought a 
firestorm of protests from ethnic and religious groups, who argue that their 
stories are misrepresented or given short shrift. Thursday's committee meeting 
was free of such debate because it was not a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
After complaints from several groups, including representatives of Muslim and 
Jewish organizations, gay and lesbian groups, and Asian-American, Latino and 
black educators, the publishers made several corrections. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the wording of one passage in a fifth-grade text on exploring the 
American West was changed to reflect that John Wesley Powell was not the first 
man to walk the length of the Grand Canyon, as had been stated, but the first 
white man. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA who supervised the textbook 
review process, said many changes were made in the books in response to 
criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
Several Jewish organizations complained about a sentence that read, "a few 
Jewish leaders took Jesus before the Roman governor," an action that led to his 
crucifixion. This has been changed to, "his opponents took Jesus before the 
Roman governor." 
</P>
<P>
The state refused to order other changes to placate complaining groups, some of 
which wanted to add "facts" subject to historical dispute, while others wanted 
to ignore or minimize sensitive or embarrassing material. 
</P>
<P>
Crabtree said the state did not yield to demands from some black individuals 
and organizations that the textbooks' supposed "Eurocentric" bias be replaced 
with several different ethnic approaches to teaching U.S. and world history. 
</P>
<P>
State curriculum officials say they expected some uproar over the books because 
they take on controversial topics and employ a sophisticated approach. The 
breadth of the protests was "unprecedented" and somewhat troubling, said Dan 
Chernow of the state Curriculum Commission. "It's a totally new way of looking 
at (teaching) history, with an emphasis on geography, strong first-person 
accounts, a multicultural approach and lots of narrative," Chernow said. 
</P>
<P>
"The old books say nothing, so there isn't much to criticize," he said. "But 
that's the problem; they're bland and they're boring. We wanted something 
that's going to excite (children's) interest in history." 
</P>

Strange bread-fellows: At his $500-a-plate Century Plaza fund-raiser last week, 
Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith broke bread with some 
interesting dining mates. Smith, who supported the sweeping Proposition 115 
anti-crime initiative approved by voters in June, was introduced by Robert D. 
Raven. Raven, a former president of the American Bar Assn., is the Raven of 
Raven vs. Deukmejian, a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of 
Proposition 115. Also speaking was rock star Stephen Stills, whose sidekick, 
David Crosby, has had several scrapes with the law. "As I was walking in here," 
joked Stills, "I ran into somebody who . . . had this look on his face that 
seemed to say, 'What in the wide world of sports do you know about being 
attorney general?' What came to my mind was that anybody who has had David 
Crosby for a partner . . . knows something about going to court." 
</P>
<P>
Those tricksters: The state Republican party's unrelenting publicity machine 
went into overdrive this week, belittling at every turn the fact that 
Democratic candidate for governor Dianne Feinstein wrote words on her palm 
before her debate with Pete Wilson. The party even commandeered animated 
cartoon character Bart Simpson, a proud underachiever, to make their point. 
"Way too obvious, dude," was the Republicans' verdict, rendered in Bart-speak. 
Party officials did not seek permission to use the character. Said the 
character's creator, Matt Groening: "This doesn't surprise me. The Republicans 
think they own everything anyway. I guess they think they own Bart Simpson too. 
</P>
<P>
To the victor . . . : Both the state Democratic and Republican parties have 
named their get-out-the-vote committees "Victory 90." Republicans said their 
name is a sequel to Victory 88 while the Democratic Party switched to the more 
confident moniker for the committee that championed losing presidential nominee 
Michael Dukakis. Both sides said nobody has confused the two committees yet, 
but they pondered the question: If two contribution checks are made out to 
Victory 90, who gets the money? 
</P>
<P>
RATING THE ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Times Poll, men and women weigh the issues differently 
when deciding who will be California's next governor. Listed below are the 
results of the poll in which 1,892 registered voters were asked how they 
planned to vote and which issues are important in deciding how they are going 
to vote for governor.

 "In all the roles I've held, there's been a consistency. It is clear I have

From Democrat Dianne Feinstein, in contending the only change Wilson wants is a

ROCKET BLOWS UP ON LAUNCH PAD IN SETBACK FOR SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM

The Soviet Union's most advanced booster rocket, carrying what an American 
specialist believes was a spy satellite, exploded seconds after liftoff last 
week, Tass news agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The blast nearly destroyed the launch pad and may complicate Soviet efforts to 
sell launch services to the West, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the Zenit booster broke apart at the Baikonur spaceport in the 
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan on Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said no one was hurt and that a commission is investigating the accident. 
The brief dispatch did not identify the payload or give any other details. 
</P>
<P>
American author-researcher James Oberg said, however, that he believes the 
payload was a military spy satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Semyonov, head of the Soviet space agency's international department, 
said further Zenit launches have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet space program has suffered several setbacks in the last year, 
including the loss of two Mars probes and an exit hatch malfunction on the 
orbiting Mir manned station. 
</P>
<P>
The program also has faced spending cuts by legislators trying to trim a budget 
deficit. Officials are trying to make up for the cuts by wooing foreign 
customers.

Six bombs exploded in several cities in the northwestern Galicia region before 
dawn Thursday, including one in a crowded discotheque that killed three people 
and injured 46, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh bomb was defused. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the three people killed in the Santiago de Compostela club 
bombing were believed to have been planting the device when it went off. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the other five explosions, which targeted businesses in 
another province, Pontevedra, its civil governor, Jorge Parada, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Ramon Berra of La Coruna province, which includes Santiago de Compostela, 
told Spanish National Radio that police were investigating whether drug 
traffickers might be behind the disco blast. 
</P>
<P>
A Galician separatist group claimed responsibility for the Pontevedra bombings, 
said Parada. The bombs hit a clothing store, a car dealership, a cannery, a bar 
and a bank office. 
</P>
<P>
Parada said that police bomb experts defused another bomb at a bank in the 
Pontevedra province town of Villa Garcia after a telephoned threat by the same 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The group, the Guerrilla Army of the Free Galician People, seeks independence 
from Spain for the four-province northwestern region of Galicia.

Iranian moderates allied with President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government were 
the announced winners Thursday of nearly all seats on a constitutional body in 
elections in which many of their radical opponents were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said only 1.8 
million of Tehran's 10 million residents voted. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, was among the key members 
elected to the 83-member Assembly of Experts, whose main task is to elect the 
nation's spiritual leader and interpret the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Most radicals were prevented from running after the government said they had to 
sit for a test on their Islamic credentials, an apparent effort by the 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the current spiritual leader, and Rafsanjani to reduce 
the radicals' influence. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the radicals who took the examination flunked.

Tank-led Syrian troops closed in on major routes leading to rebel Maj. Gen. 
Michel Aoun's enclave Thursday, and police said an attack appeared imminent to 
evict Aoun from Lebanon's Christian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier, President Elias Hrawi, Lebanon's internationally recognized 
chief of state, had asked Damascus for help to crush Aoun's resistance to his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun commands about 15,000 mainly Christian troops from the presidential palace 
in East Beirut. He refuses to recognize Hrawi and rejects an Arab-sponsored 
peace pact for Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a dozen columns of Syrian T-62 tanks and thousands of soldiers 
moved up to combat positions to support Hrawi's army along a five-mile front 
from southern Beirut to the central mountains east of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
France was making an 11th-hour mediation bid to persuade Aoun to abandon the 
palace and leave for Paris, a Hrawi government source said. The source said 
that French Ambassador Rene Ala was in radio contact with Aoun, urging him to 
"spare Lebanon another blood bath." 
</P>
<P>
"If and when Ambassador Ala tells us his effort failed, our forces, backed by 
the Syrian army, will attack," he said. He mentioned no deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's radio station instructed inhabitants of his enclave, home for 150,000 
Christians, to ring church bells all night to "protest what looks like an 
imminent military thrust." 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate 
to end the long civil war between Muslims and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three weeks, 20,000 Hrawi troops and Syrian soldiers have ringed 
Aoun's 80-square-mile bastion in a bid to starve the maverick general into 
submission. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun has vowed to fight unto death if attacked.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad? Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson is airing a new 30-second television commercial 
that attacks the taxing policies of Democrat Dianne Feinstein during her tenure 
as mayor of San Francisco. The ad also promotes Wilson's record as mayor of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The commercial opens with side-by-side photos of Wilson and Feinstein, 
noting the years they served as mayors of their cities: Wilson in San Diego 
1971-82 and Feinstein in San Francisco 1978-88. Then portions of their tax 
records appear beneath their respective photos: "Wilson cut property tax rates 
25% and balanced 11 budgets." "Feinstein raised taxes 34%, but left a $172 
million deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Data provided by the Wilson campaign says the city property tax rate 
was $1.81 per $100 of assessed valuation in 1972, dropping to $1.36 per $100 by 
1978 when Proposition 13 set all property taxes in California at the same rate, 
effectively at $1 per $100 of assessed valuation. By the time Feinstein became 
mayor, she had no control over property tax rates. In San Francisco, the annual 
per capita tax burden grew from $429 to $576, a 34% rise, according to the 
state controller's office. All of Wilson's and Feinstein's budgets technically 
were balanced because cities, like the state, are prohibited by law from 
running deficits. Feinstein's final budget projected a $16.2 million surplus, 
but the incoming administration of Mayor Art Agnos claimed that in fact the 
city faced a deficit of $172 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "San Diego's taxes were among the lowest in the state." "Under Feinstein, 
taxes went up 50% faster than the state average." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: It can be argued that the ad attempts to mix apples and oranges. San 
Francisco is the only geographic entity in California that is both a city and a 
county so it serves many more functions than other cities. Also, San Diego's 
population was growing much more rapidly than San Francisco's, so the relative 
cost of San Francisco city services rose more quickly. San Diego adopted a 
hotel room tax while Wilson was mayor. Feinstein opposed some tax increases 
that were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The ad quotes the late Howard Jarvis, the author of Proposition 13 in 1978, 
as saying, "We wouldn't have needed Proposition 13 if everyone had run their 
cities like Pete Wilson." And a photo of Feinstein shows on the screen with the 
comment from San Francisco Controller Sam Yockey that Feinstein "robbed the 
bank and left us holding the bag." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Both Wilson and Feinstein opposed Proposition 13, as did most public 
officials. The major problem leading to the Proposition 13 tax revolt was not 
tax rates, but the escalating property assessments that drove up tax bills. 
Yockey became controller under Agnos, with whom Feinstein has quarreled 
bitterly, and who supported Feinstein's opponent in the Democratic 
gubernatorial primary.

A congressional report warns that shuttle flights and other space activity 
could become too risky within the next 20 to 30 years if nations continue to 
litter the most traveled paths. Already, the trouble-plagued Hubble Telescope 
has been given a 1-in-100 chance of being severely damaged by space debris 
during its lifetime, according to the Office of Technology Assessment. "Even 
small debris particles can produce high levels of damage," one expert said.

MODEST PASTOR SEES COSTA MESA FLOCK GROW FROM 25 TO 12,000

<P>
In an era of fallen televangelists and mass-marketed religion, Pastor Chuck 
Smith's Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa approaches its 25th anniversary unscathed 
by scandal and seemingly ever mindful of the pride that could precede a fall. 
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 people attend services at the chapel each Sunday, making it the 
third-best-attended Protestant church in the nation, according to a new survey. 
Calvary Chapel also claims 386 affiliated churches in the United States, 
Canada, Europe and the Far East; religious programs on about 140 radio 
stations; missionaries in 15 countries, and a booming book, music and 
Bible-on-cassette business. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike its better-known neighbors, Melodyland Christian Center and the 
Crystal Cathedral, Calvary Chapel does not advertise its services. It shuns 
publicity. And as an article of faith, it never solicits contributions. "If you 
ask for money, you'll probably get fired," said Assistant Pastor L. E. Romaine. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the church has even replaced the Sunday collection plate with a simple 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
"That way people aren't looking to see how much Joe gave this week, and 'Look, 
Bill just gave a dollar,' " said Lew Phelps, who manages the chapel's outreach 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Even Calvary Chapel's origins are low-profile. The fundamentalist church began 
amid the bean fields of Santa Ana, but membership had dwindled to 25 when Smith 
took over in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
After several moves to other churches and a two-year stint in a tent, the 
fellowship moved in 1971 to its present location, a low-slung building at 
Sunflower and Fairview avenues. By then, it was attracting crowds of young 
people, including many ex-hippies, in what later became known as the Jesus 
People Movement of 1969-1974.

"They were accepted just as they were -- long hair, granny dresses, fur-covered 
Bibles, whatever," said Romaine. 
</P>
<P>
Many still worship at Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Smith began conducting mass baptisms at Pirate's Cove at Corona del Mar, which 
continue to draw huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
A five-day Harvest Crusade at the Pacific Amphitheater in August drew 18,000 to 
20,000 people each night, church leaders said. The following week, Smith 
baptized 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, once a Foursquare Gospel minister, is a believer in the Pentecostal gift 
of "speaking in tongues" and takes a literalist biblical approach, including 
assumptions that the world's "last days" are near. But he has roundly 
criticized excesses in the Pentecostal movement, such as people collapsing as 
if "slain by the Spirit" and flamboyant displays of piety. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said some of his flock practice charismatic devotions such as 
faith-healing and speaking in tongues. But the tone of the church's public 
sermons is more restrained. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe in the actions of the charismatics which are so often 
excessive -- for example speaking in tongues in church and making a heavy 
emphasis on acts of faith," he said. "We have elders who pray for the sick, but 
we don't make a big display of it. It's not a circus-tent environment." 
</P>
<P>
At 63, Smith, who prefers to be called "Pastor Chuck," is unassuming and 
easygoing. On Thursday, he showed visitors around the chapel dressed in a 
Hawaiian shirt and said he was "totally and completely" surprised to learn that 
his flock is the third largest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The church's 21-acre campus includes a religious bookstore, the chapel, the 
newly expanded Maranatha Christian Academy with 1,500 pupils in kindergarten 
through grade 12, a fellowship hall and several overcrowded parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Smith graduated from LIFE Bible College in Los Angeles and was a pastor in 
Foursquare Gospel churches for 17 years before taking over Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Calvary Chapel's total budget was $9.5 million last year, all from donations, 
Smith said.Two-thirds of the income is spent on missionary work and one-third 
is used to operate Calvary Chapel. The church has no debts. Smith said 
surpluses are used to subsidize tuition at the Christian schools and to loan 
$10 million to affiliated churches to help them expand. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the church donated $453,000 to the Israeli government to 
help establish settlements in "upper Galilee," now known as the occupied West 
Bank, and built baptismal sites for Christian pilgrims on the River Jordan, 
church leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
The chapel was recently rebuffed in efforts to build a 550-acre religious 
resort and conference center in a quiet valley on Palomar Mountain. This month, 
it announced plans to build the retreat near Lake Arrowhead instead.

The ballot measure: Proposition 130, an environmentalist supported initiative 
that would substantially reduce logging on commercial timberland. 
</P>
<P>
Whose ad: Californians for New Forestry, No on 130 and Yes on 138, a counter 
measure sponsored by the forest products industry. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial shows scenes of forest fires. Firefighters do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Sponsors of the commercial, paid for by the forest products industry, 
refuse to disclose how much they are paying to run the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Producer: The commercial was made by Woodward &amp; McDowell, a political 
consulting firm in Burlingame. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ad, with an analysis by Times environmental writer Maura 
Dolan: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Poorly written, it would increase the risk of devastating wildfires. 
Trained forestry professionals will no longer be able to do what they must to 
prevent forest fires." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The timber industry burns sites that have been logged to clear them 
for future planting, improve access and reduce fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which applies to commercial timberland, would require the 
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to write regulations that 
would reduce as much as possible any adverse environmental effects, including 
air pollution and soil erosion, from such burning. 
</P>
<P>
No burning would be allowed unless the department found that no feasible 
alternatives existed to eliminate an unreasonable risk of wildfire or to ensure 
adequate new growth on the site. The timber industry complains that additional 
regulations will hinder its ability to clear sites, and raise costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I, in good conscience, can't say that it is going to have a deleterious effect 
on wildland fire protection issues," said Robert Paulus, chief deputy director 
for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. "It's going to depend to a 
large degree on how it is implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "That's why groups representing virtually every firefighter in the state 
oppose Prop. 130." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Proposition 130 is opposed by the California Professional 
Firefighters, which says its represents 85% to 95% of California's 
firefighters, and by the California Department of Forestry Employees Assn., the 
bargaining unit for most of the department's workers.

The ballot measure: Proposition 130, to reduce logging in California's forests. 
</P>
<P>
Whose ad: The Forest &amp; Wildlife Protection Committee, Yes on 130. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: A spokesman for the committee said $600,000 has been budgeted for this 
advertisement and another television commercial still in production. They will 
begin airing next week, according to the spokesman. The commercials are paid 
for by San Mateo financial adviser H.L. Arbit and by environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
The group's advertisement shows a burning forest and cuts to David Pesonen, 
former director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 
sitting in an office decorated with firefighting helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ad, with an analysis by Times environmental writer Maura 
Dolan: 
</P>
<P>
 Ad: "Proposition 130 maintains every current method of fighting fires in this 
state. In fact, 130 greatly reduces the chance of wildfires." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The initiative will prohibit the use of tractors on steep slopes for 
brush clearing, although brush still could be removed by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Burning on logged timberlands also would be discouraged. It would be allowed 
only if the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection determines 
burning is necessary to eliminate an unreasonable risk of wildfires. In 
addition, the department would have to determine that alternatives to burning 
are not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Burning will not be allowed just because it is more convenient or because it 
improves access to the site for planting. Supporters of the measure contend 
that current burning practices rob the soil of its nutrients and cause erosion. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is not designed to reduce substantially the threat of wildfires, 
although it does require that fire roads be maintained.

WITNESS DOUBTS SURROGATE'S CLAIM OF BONDING; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTODY CASE: A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY SAYS ANNA JOHNSON'S STATEMENTS WHILE 
PREGNANT DO NOT INDICATE THAT SHE HAD AN ATTACHMENT TO THE BABY SHE WAS 
CARRYING.

An expert on child psychiatry testified Thursday that he does not believe 
Orange County surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson became emotionally attached to 
the baby she delivered for an infertile couple, and he said he would be wary of 
giving her custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Justin D. Call, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at UC Irvine, said 
he is suspicious of Johnson's claim to a deep bond with the infant because of a 
statement she made in a newspaper interview and a letter she wrote to the 
baby's genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, is the first surrogate mother in the nation to seek parental 
rights to a child not genetically related to her. Her lawyer is already 
predicting she will lose in Orange County Superior Court because emotions in 
the case are overshadowing the legal issues. But he said he feels certain of 
victory on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In the July 23 letter to Mark and Crispina Calvert, the infertile couple who 
hired her, Johnson threatened to keep the baby unless they immediately paid her 
the rest of her $10,000 fee. Call said Johnson's use of phrases like "before 
your child is born" and "the child of someone else" indicates that she had not 
become attached to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson told The Times in early August, when she was seven months pregnant, 
that she did not feel bonded to the fetus because it was not made from her 
genetic material. The embryo implanted in her uterus was made from the 
Calverts' sperm and egg. 
</P>
<P>
Call, who testified for the Calverts in their bid for permanent custody of the 
boy born Sept. 19, said Johnson's statement "very clearly supports the idea 
that the mother has not made an attachment to the child." Lack of bonding by 
seven months into the pregnancy would "carry a very bad prognosis for 
continuing attachment after birth," Call said. 
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable person should be very circumspect about giving a woman full 
responsibility for a child she had not made a normal attachment to during 
pregnancy," Call testified. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's court-appointed lawyer, Harold F. LaFlamme, elicited Call's analysis 
of Johnson's letter and her statement to The Times in an attempt to explore the 
validity of her claim to true bonding with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson now denies saying that she did not feel attached to the baby. She 
argues that she is entitled to legal parental status because she carried and 
delivered the child and because infant-mother bonding is more important than an 
agreement she signed. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, tried to undermine Johnson's 
claims by asking Call if infants form bonds of affection toward their 
gestational mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Call testified that although there is ample evidence to show that most women 
develop deep feelings for their babies, there is none to demonstrate similar 
sentiments in an infant. 
</P>
<P>
That contradicted an expert who testified Wednesday for Johnson, saying that 
several studies indicate that infants form powerful emotional bonds to their 
birth mothers. Dr. David B. Chamberlain said that if 12 mothers were assembled 
in the courtroom jury box, a newborn could recognize the woman who bore him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Call acknowledged that an unrelated gestational mother plays an 
"obvious" role in nourishing the fetus, he minimized that contribution, saying 
a child's genetic makeup determines most of its future form and development. He 
said the baby's strongest connections are to its genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
Call said custody should be awarded to the Calverts.

STEINBRENNER LAWYER CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: VINCENT SAID TO BE RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WITH CHALLENGES TO HIS 
AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Claiming that Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent's conduct has constituted a 
"mockery of justice," an attorney for George Steinbrenner has formally called 
on major league baseball's executive council for an impartial investigation of 
Vincent's handling of Steinbrenner's removal from baseball, according to 
documents obtained Thursday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In the 135-page petition and 450 additional pages of documents sent to each 
council member, attorney Paul Curran claims that Vincent overstepped his bounds 
by wielding his power "corruptly," during the course of the investigation, 
hearing and resolution of Steinbrenner's involvement with known-gambler Howard 
Spira. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded letter marked "confidential" and sent out Tuesday to 
baseball's 11-member executive council, Steinbrenner's attorney charged Vincent 
with "serious and oppressive conduct . . . which calls for extraordinary action 
by the Executive Council." 
</P>
<P>
But the council -- made up of Vincent, eight major league club owners, and the 
presidents of the National and American League -- is basically an advisory 
group. It has no jurisdiction over the actions of the commissioner, who has 
enjoyed an autonomous role since the position was created in 1921. The 
commissioner's term lasts five years, and there is no provision for an interim 
performance review. Vincent's term ends April, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
However, this latest move by Steinbrenner seemingly did little more than 
further rankle the commissioner's office, where patience with Steinbrenner's 
challenges to Vincent's authority is growing thin. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is rapidly approaching at which patience with this campaign to 
undermine the integrity of the commissioner and of major league baseball will 
end," Stephen D. Greenberg, baseball's deputy commissioner, said Thursday in a 
statement from New York. "Mr. Steinbrenner and his advisers must recognize this 
and be prepared to accept the consequences of their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg dismissed Steinbrenner's petition as a further attempt to "circumvent 
established procedures within baseball and to avoid the consequences" of the 
July 30 agreement Steinbrenner entered into with Vincent. The agreement was the 
result of a ruling that Steinbrenner did not act in the best interest of 
baseball in his dealings with Spira, whom Steinbrenner allegedly paid $40,000 
in return for information on former Yankee Dave Winfield and Winfield's 
charitable foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In that agreement, Steinbrenner accepted Vincent's decision to step down 
permanently as managing partner of the day-to-day operations of the Yankees. In 
return, Steinbrenner is allowed to retain up to 49% of the team's ownership and 
to have input on specific major financial decisions, excluding player 
transactions. Steinbrenner also agreed not to "litigate or challenge" the 
decision or the sanctions imposed by Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Steinbrenner's continual challenges to Vincent's 
decision could result in further disciplinary action that could include his 
total removal from the Yankees and baseball. Since Steinbrenner was forced to 
resign as managing general partner of the Yankees on Aug. 20, he and his 
advisers have raised objections and questions to the methods employed in the 
investigation undertaken by Vincent and baseball's special prosecutor, John 
Dowd. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, who was en route from Oakland to New York, could not be reached for 
comment. Curran, reached in New York, did not wish to comment on the petition. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Steinbrenner filed a $1.56-million suit in Manhattan against a court 
stenographer and his company for allegedly tampering with sworn statements made 
by Steinbrenner and other Yankee officials during Vincent's investigation. 
Steinbrenner contends the testimony was changed on orders from Dowd to make him 
look bad. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new material detailed in the petition, Curran charged that Vincent 
and Dowd violated basic rights under attorney-client privilege by coercing them 
to produce notes for the investigation that were taken by Steinbrenner's 
attorneys during confidential communications. 
</P>
<P>
The petition states that Vincent and Dowd forced Steinbrenner to turn over the 
notes by the "bald and direct threat that if Steinbrenner persisted in 
asserting those privileges, such would be deemed conduct 'not in the best 
interests of baseball' and Steinbrenner would be suspended immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Curran also asserts that the Pete Rose case was handled entirely different in 
this regard. "Dowd specifically recognized the attorney-client privilege and, 
in fact, hid behind it in refusing to review evidence presented by Rose's 
attorneys," the petition said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the charges, previously reported, were detailed in the petition. They 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Suppressing critical evidence exonerating Steinbrenner; fabricating 
negative evidence and secretly tampering with deposition testimony given by 
Steinbrenner and other Yankee personnel during the four-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Not providing Steinbrenner with the Dowd Report, which contains the alleged 
evidence upon which Vincent's charges were predicated, denying him fair notice 
of the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Denying Steinbrenner the right to a fair trial because he did not allow the 
Yankee owner to present testimony from any witness other than himself or to 
cross-examine any witness, despite a previous agreement with Vincent that he 
would be able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Dowd arranged for the services of an attorney to defend Spira, at no 
cost, during Dowd's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Vincent breached the July 30 agreement by feeding the public selected 
information to encourage anti-Steinbrenner sentiment. It also claims that 
Vincent made efforts to cover up his "numerous improprieties." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if the executive council will address the petition. Dodger 
owner Peter O'Malley, a council member, would not comment on the petition. 
Other council members did not return phone calls.

THE BALLPARK IS GONE, BUT 30 YEARS AFTER HOMER, MEMORIES OF MAZEROSKI STILL

The sky has been gray all morning and now it's starting to drizzle, leaving 
students at the University of Pittsburgh to scurry between classes. 
</P>
<P>
Preoccupied, they walk with their heads down, never stopping to contemplate the 
nearby ivy-covered brick wall, the one that separates the campus from the 
torn-up softball field behind it. 
</P>
<P>
There's no plaque. No monument. There are two rusty beer cans and a sandwich 
wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad, isn't it?" says Peter Sukernek, a Pittsburgh real estate broker. 
"You've got to realize, most of these kids today could care less about this. 
But me, standing right here now, I get goose bumps, thinking what happened 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, everybody over the age of 40 in Pittsburgh remembers two things. 
</P>
<P>
"They can all tell you where they were when John F. Kennedy was shot, and 
exactly what they were doing at the time it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"And they can tell you what they were doing the moment Maz hit that homer." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago Saturday, at 3:36 p.m., Bill Mazeroski homered in the bottom 
of the ninth inning at Forbes Field, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates their first 
World Series championship in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fans poured onto the field the moment the ball cleared the wall, escorting 
Mazeroski to home plate as he wildly waved his cap in the air. Folks ran out of 
their homes onto the streets, sharing the celebration with neighbors. Horns 
began honking. Businessmen and secretaries began shredding everything they 
could find for confetti, leaving about 110 tons of it for city crews to sweep 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it in my life," said Bill Halloran, the Pirate 
clubhouse man. "It's like it brought a whole city together. You know, we won 
those championships in the '70s, but it was nothing compared to what happened 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a person in town who was here at the time who'll ever forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the physical remembrances of that glorious afternoon, however, have 
disappeared. They tore down Forbes Field in 1970, replacing it with student 
housing and a law school. The Pirates now call Three Rivers Stadium home. 
</P>
<P>
But there is the wall, a 12-foot high, 150-foot long section of the original 
center-field wall at Forbes field, still standing. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is a thin strip of bricks from the wall, and a plaque 
embedded in the sidewalk, reading: "This marks the spot where Bill Mazeroski's 
home run ball cleared the left-center field wall at Forbes Field on Oct. 13, 
1960, thereby winning the World Series championship for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
The historic hit came in the ninth inning of the seventh game to beat the New 
York Yankees by a score of 10-9." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the law school, along the main corridor, about 360 feet away from the 
outfield wall, is home plate from the final game played at Forbes Field. It 
sits under a clear pane of hard plastic, with students walking atop of it on 
their way to classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they're too young to understand the meaning," Sukernek said. "They don't 
realize what it meant to this city. Maybe you had to be here, because everyone 
that was will remember it until the day they die." 
</P>
<P>
It was a time when the nation feared the spread of communism. The second 
Kennedy-Richard Nixon debate was taking place that week. Lenny Bruce was 
playing at a Pittsburgh nightspot. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was taking 
off his shoe and slamming it on a table at a session of the United Nations' 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the week of the World Series, played between the powerful New York 
Yankees and the underdog Pirates, a team that looked woefully overmatched. The 
Pirates had not been in the World Series since they lost in four games to the 
team regarded as the greatest, the 1927 Yankees. The same was expected this 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony about it is that people compare our '61 team to the '27 Yankees as 
being the best of all the time," former Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek said. "But 
to tell you the truth, that '60 team was the best I ever played on. I know 
Pittsburgh won it, but I'd think they'd be the first to say they (beat) the 
better team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill Virdon, Pirate center fielder: "I don't know about everyone else, but 
I'd certainly agree. I'm not sure if we belonged on the same field with those 
fellas. But something special was happening all year for us, and it happened 
again in the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
It was a strange series. The Yankees beat the Pirates 16-3 in Game 2, 10-0 in 
Game 3, and 12-0 in Game 6. But even though they were outscored 38-3 in those 
three games, the Pirates managed to win three games of their own by a combined 
score of 14-8, setting up Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crazy series," Kubek said. "I don't believe in predestination, but my 
gosh, everything seemed to go their way. It was like it was meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees were six outs away from winning their ninth World Series in 12 
years when they went out for the eighth inning. Gino Cimoli led off with a 
pinch-single. Virdon followed with what appeared to be a routine double-play 
ball to Kubek at shortstop, but on the third hop, it took a bad bounce and hit 
Kubek in the throat, forcing him to leave for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know what happened," Kubek said. "That infield was a mess. It 
was so torn up with all of the baserunners that day, and all the scoring, there 
were divots everywhere. Remember in those days, they didn't drag the infield 
after the fifth inning, so you can imagine the condition." 
</P>
<P>
It proved to be the beginning of the Yankee demise. Dick Groat followed with a 
single, scoring Cimoli. Roberto Clemente then reached first when pitcher Jim 
Coates failed to cover first. Then came a three-run homer by Hal Smith, giving 
the Pirates an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But in the top of the ninth, the Yankees tied the game when Yogi Berra's ground 
ball to first scored Bobby Richardson, the eventual Series MVP, from third. 
There they went to the bottom of the ninth, the game tied. 
</P>
<P>
Mazeroski, who had hit a two-run homer in Game 1, and a two-run double in Game 
5, was the first batter. Reliever Ralph Terry was the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walked up to the plate, all I thought about was getting on base," 
Mazeroski said. "But deep in my mind, I just knew we were going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Well, you can't feel too bad taking the Yankees into the seventh 
game of the World Series and losing in extra innings.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Terry: "I didn't have a thing left, and I knew it. It's funny, I even 
started thinking, 'Geez, why didn't Casey (Stengel) start Whitey Ford in Game 
1? Then he could be pitching now. But we didn't have anyone. The whole staff 
was tired." 
</P>
<P>
Terry's first pitch was high. Yankee catcher John Blanchard went to the mound 
and, knowing that Mazeroski was a high-ball hitter, pleaded for Terry to keep 
the ball down. 
</P>
<P>
The next pitch dropped a bit, but it still was belt-high. Mazeroski swung with 
all of his might. Terry prayed with all his. 
</P>
<P>
"I was almost at second base when it finally went over," Mazeroski said. "I was 
running so hard, just trying to make sure I'd get to third. Then it took a 
moment or two to realize what happened. It was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, all I could think about was, 'We beat the Yankees! We beat them! We 
beat the damn Yankees!' " 
</P>
<P>
Terry remembers trying to fight through the crowd to get into the clubhouse, 
finally giving up, going through the Pirates' dugout on the first-base side, 
away from the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, it was the wildest celebration I've seen in my life," said Terry, 
currently playing on the senior golf tour. "It was pandemonium. I sat in the 
clubhouse, just feeling awful, and then I went into Casey's office. 
</P>
<P>
"He had told us before the game that he'd probably never see us again. We knew 
(the Yankee ownership) wanted him out, that they wanted to hire Ralph Houk 
before he got away. And that's why it hurt so much, knowing this would be the 
last game he'd ever manage for us. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked in, and said, 'Case, I feel real bad. I let you down.' He said, 'Kid, 
what were you trying to throw there?' I told him I was trying to keep the ball 
down and away to him, but I just got it up.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Good, because that's what you're supposed to do there. You followed 
my report, it just didn't work out. I'll sleep good tonight. Now, you forget 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Terry posted a 16-3 record the next year, then became a 20-game winner in 1962 
and was standing on the mound in Game 7 when Willie McCovey lined out to second 
baseman Richardson for the final out, making Terry the MVP of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I often wonder what would have happened to my career without Casey," Terry 
said. "If he had started screaming at me, blaming me for everything, who knows 
what would have happened?" 
</P>
<P>
Mazeroski, who spent his entire career with the Pirates until retiring in 1972, 
won nine Gold Gloves, was selected to five All-Star Games, and hit 138 homers. 
</P>
<P>
But yet, he is remembered mostly for one home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I get people coming up to me and talking about that home run all of the time," 
Mazeroski said. "But you know, for once I'd like someone to say, 'You were a 
damn good defensive second baseman. You were one of the best I ever saw.' 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, that's what I'm most proud of, that I could turn the 
double play as well as anyone that played the game. But no one remembers that. 
No one cares. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of funny isn't it? Thirty years later and people still are talking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have ever figured?"

GRETZKY GETS 5 POINTS, KINGS 1; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES SCORES TWICE IN FINAL 1:31 TO CATCH EDMONTON, 5-5. GRETZKY 
HAS FOUR ASSISTS AND TYING GOAL. 
</P>

<P>
As he stood and watched the puck rattle around in the Edmonton Oilers' net 
Thursday night, Wayne Gretzky lifted his arms and screamed with joy, looking as 
if he were about to raise the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't win a Cup Thursday, just some much-needed confidence and respect 
for his Kings with a come-from-behind 5-5 tie against the defending Cup 
champions before a Forum crowd of 13,831. 
</P>
<P>
After blowing a two-goal lead, and trailing by two with a minute and a half to 
play, the Kings scored twice in 42 seconds to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Sandstrom scored on a breakaway off a pass from Gretzky with 1:31 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
And then Gretzky tied the score with 49 seconds left on his first goal and 
fifth point of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was on the bench when Coach Tom Webster pulled goalie Kelly Hrudey, but 
Webster quickly sent Gretzky in. 
</P>
<P>
"He went right to the front of the net, where he was supposed to," Webster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And there Gretzky camped, until Steve Kasper, on the left side, spotted him 
alone at the right post. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really get open against them," said Gretzky of his former teammates. 
"I had a little time." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford spotted Gretzky, but a little too late. Gretzky 
took the pass from Kasper and shoved the puck home as Ranford dove to the ice. 
"I was excited," Gretzky said of his celebration. "It was an important win, 
especially the way we came back." 
</P>
<P>
Especially since it was the Kings' first game against one of the NHL's big boys 
after opening the season against the New York Islanders and Vancouver Canucks, 
two of the league's weaker teams. 
</P>
<P>
And especially since the Kings had to overcome the ejection of one of their 
remaining veteran defensemen, Steve Duchesne, for high sticking and drawing 
blood from Craig Simpson, and an Oiler lead that looked insurmountable with 
less than two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 2-1-1, Edmonton 1-0-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the first period, Rob Blake, at the top of the left circle, took a pass from 
Gretzky on the right side and slid the puck past the stick of Craig MacTavish 
and under Ranford's glove to give the Kings a 1-0 lead 9:03 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
That was the fifth point of the season for Blake, 20, who had played in only a 
dozen NHL games coming into this season. 
</P>
<P>
Another power play enabled the Kings to take a 2-0 lead in the second period. 
Larry Robinson, coming down the left side, fed Sandstrom in the slot. From 
there, Sandstrom, who had four points, scored between Ranford's pads at the 
2:29 mark. 
</P>
<P>
But, near the middle of the second period, it became a different game. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers turned on the offense that led them to last year's Stanley Cup title 
and the Kings fell back to the defense that has left them in the cold all too 
often. 
</P>
<P>
Before the period had ended, Edmonton scored four times in the following 
fashion: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 1 at 8:07. Petr Klima came face to face with King defenseman Rene 
Chapdelaine, but skated around him as Chapdelaine slipped to the ice, then fed 
the puck to the unchecked Anatoli Semenov, who shoved it in from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 2 at 12:31. MacTavish, unchecked in front of the net, redirected a 
shot by Geoff Smith through a helpless Hrudey's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 3 at 15:25. This time, Semenov was unchecked in the slot. Taking a 
centering pass from Esa Tikkanen, Semenov, without a defenseman within reach, 
had time to pause and aim before ramming the puck in on Hrudey's stick side 
from 20 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 4 at 17:44. Ken Linseman skated down the ice with defender Dennis 
Smith on his back. But Linseman kept his balance, kept the puck and, despite 
Smith's best efforts, flipped it past Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had a great opportunity to come back in the final period when Klima 
was hit with a five-minute major and automatic game misconduct for ramming the 
end of his stick into Brad Jones' stomach. 
</P>
<P>
With five penalty minutes to tie up the game, the Kings scored on their first 
shot, Gretzky centering a pass for Tony Granato. From the slot, Granato, at the 
7:10 mark, scored between Ranford's pads, bringing the Kings to within one goal 
at 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings failed to score again on the extended penalty, missing their only 
three shots. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was the Oilers who scored, getting a short-handed goal at 11:03 on 
a backhander by MacTavish to extend the lead to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is asking for back taxes on affected members of the 
Edmonton Oilers for their rings from the 1987 Stanley Cup finals. That has 
drawn outrage from the organization for what is believed to be a test case. If 
the government is successful in collecting, assessments could be made on all 
Canadians who won Stanley Cup rings over the last five years. The value of the 
rings has been set at $3,000. "It seems to me a Stanley Cup ring is as much a 
part of the uniform as anything," Edmonton General Manager Glen Sather said. 
"What's next," one club official asked, "engagement rings?" 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Marty McSorley practiced with the team Thursday before sitting 
out his second game with a twisted knee. He is expected back by Saturday's game 
against the Boston Bruins. Fellow defenseman Tim Watters (bruised ribs) and is 
not expected back by the weekend.

<P>
FOR ONCE, CLEMENS DIDN'T GET HIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Roger Clemens said to provoke his ejection from Game 4 of the American 
League playoffs Wednesday was not as disturbing as what he has become -- and 
what the Boston Red Sox, to some extent, have permitted him to become. 
</P>
<P>
Put it this way: The bravado of his performances is often overshadowed now by a 
personality that is pure brat. He is spoiled, selfish and self-centered. 
</P>
<P>
The sign over his locker at Fenway Park reads "Possessed Rebel," and he is just 
that. Possessed and obsessed. Driven by inexplicable demons. Wound so tightly 
he seems ready to shatter. Unable to enjoy his talent and fame. Respected by 
teammates who admire his competitiveness and ability, but not widely liked 
because of his intensity and abrasiveness. 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran Boston player noted Wednesday: "I worry about Roger because he 
always seems ready to detonate." 
</P>
<P>
The profane message Clemens directed at umpire Terry Cooney Wednesday was just 
the latest in a series of strange vibrations emanating from the Rocket Man. 
Call them postcards from the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Even before his ejection, while warming up in the bullpen, he threw a pitch 
into the right-field bleachers, in the direction of taunting fans. Later, he 
steamrollered a photographer without apology en route to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
He is considered one of the league's leading umpire baiters, and there was a 
suspicion that Cooney was responding to a history of Clemens' abuse rather than 
what was said in the second inning. Live by the mouth, die by the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Marty Barrett: "The way this came down, it makes you think it was 
personal. I mean, Roger had been pretty loud the whole series." 
</P>
<P>
And so loud Wednesday that he could be heard in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"Who can think with Roger Clemens?" Dave Stewart of the Oakland Athletics said 
as he criticized the Red Sox pitcher for his lack of control. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no excuse for what happened," Stewart said. "Baseball was here 
long before Roger Clemens and the Red Sox, and it will be here long after they 
are gone. 
</P>
<P>
"The umpires are out there working as hard as they can, as hard as the players 
do. A strike should be a strike, a ball a ball." 
</P>
<P>
But at 28, with a 116-51 record for six-plus seasons, Clemens has his own zone. 
He has been allowed to stretch the limits of leadership. He is an icon to the 
Red Sox, who pay homage out of fear he will leave as a free agent when his 
contract expires after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Clemens complained about security and the seating location for 
players' wives at Fenway Park, there were changes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When he and Dwight Evans stormed off a delayed team charter flight in 
Baltimore this season and complained about Jack Rogers, the Red Sox's longtime, 
respected transportation director, Rogers was taken off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Clemens demanded that media not be allowed on the team bus on trips to 
and from airports, the Red Sox agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When he told the club that he would speak with the media only after the 
games in which he pitches -- and sometimes not even then -- the Red Sox agreed 
again, failing to cite a clause in the standard player contract that requires 
players always to cooperate with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When it came down to deciding who would start Game 4 of the playoffs, 
Clemens made the call, Manager Joe Morgan agreeing with his choice of Greg 
Harris if the Red Sox won Game 3 and of Clemens if they lost that game. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that Clemens thinks he operates from his own pedestal and 
should always have his way? Is it surprising that he would childishly risk his 
career by slamming his fist into a clubhouse door when Red Sox management made 
a rare stand and rejected his recent demand that the media be deprived of 
clubhouse access for 30 minutes after the team clinched the division title? 
</P>
<P>
Is it also any shock that Clemens feels immunized against ejection, believing 
he can say anything to anyone, then deny what seems to be obvious -- that he 
used profanity Wednesday and made contact with umpires Jim Evans and Vic 
Voltaggio? 
</P>
<P>
It is symptomatic, of course, of an era in which umpires have virtually no 
accountability, and lifetime tenure after two big league seasons, that Cooney 
acted in haste, irrationally stealing the show, taking the game away from the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The cliche is correct. No one pays to see the umpires, but they continue to 
play a larger and more aggressive role, angering many owners who favor a 
hard-line stance when negotiations with the umpires' union on a new collective 
bargaining agreement begin early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney owed Clemens, his team and the game a trip to the mound in an attempt to 
quiet the pitcher or to get a clear reading of what he was saying. Since it 
served his purpose, Clemens made his first trip to the playoff interview room 
to offer his side, but it didn't jibe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stewart, Clemens told Cooney to "put his bleeping mask on and get 
his . . . behind the plate." An Associated Press photographer claimed that he 
heard Clemens twice demean Cooney's parentage. 
</P>
<P>
The recollections of what he said vary, but the portrait of Roger Clemens seems 
clear and is not a handsome one. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there much to be said for the way the Red Sox worship it. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: NBA'S STERN TALKS OF WORLD TITLE EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of Commissioner David Stern's plan "to make basketball the No. 1 sport in 
the world by the year 2000" is to have the NBA's 1992-93 champion participate 
in a world club championship before the 1993-94 season. But the rest of the 
world may not be a pushover. 
</P>
<P>
Stern spoke in Barcelona, where an Italian club came within a few seconds of 
handing the NBA its first loss in international competition Thursday night. The 
New York Knicks needed overtime and 34 points from Patrick Ewing to defeat 
Italian champion Scavolini Pesaro, 119-115, in the McDonald's Open. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had lost the game . . . it would have been one of our team's and the 
NBA's most embarrassing moments," Knick Coach Stu Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stern and Boris Stankovic, head of FIBA, the ruling body of 
international basketball, did not describe the future event as a true world 
championship, the NBA title-holder would compete among as many as 16 of the 
world's top national teams.

Cincinnati Bengal fans are chipping in to help Coach Sam Wyche pay the 
estimated $27,500 fine imposed by the NFL for his refusal to let a female 
writer into the team's locker room after a Monday night loss in Seattle last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a lively topic on radio talk shows, and now a window replacement 
company that uses Wyche as a spokesman has placed an ad in Cincinnati's two 
daily newspapers asking the public to contribute to the "Sam Wyche Fine Fund." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the first day the two-column by two-inch ad appeared in the 
Cincinnati Enquirer and the Cincinnati Post. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a Bengals fan, show you care," the ad said.

Quarterback Bobby Hebert, now residing in Manhattan Beach, is suing the Raiders 
for not signing him. 
</P>
<P>
Hebert, unable to reach a contract agreement with the New Orleans Saints this 
season, claims in a suit filed in Los Angeles that the Raiders, in observing 
the NFL's Plan B system for transferring players, are violating California law 
by preventing a person from pursuing his livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint claims that the Raiders "have actively tried to make a trade for 
Hebert, but have been prevented from doing so by the demand of New Orleans for 
enormous compensation."

DYKES REGAINS VISION; MAN IS ARRESTED

The eye injury wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes suffered in a scuffle outside a 
nightclub is healing well, and his doctor said he should be able to play when 
the New England Patriots meet the Miami Dolphins on Thursday, Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes wore sunglasses as he left Rhode Island Hospital Thursday, 36 hours after 
he and Patriot receiver Irving Fryar were injured in a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes would not comment, but his attorney, Peter DiBiase, said a witness told 
police that Dykes was being needled about how poorly the Patriots were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday night, police arrested a nightclub bouncer, 
William Earley, 35, at his home in Portsmouth and charged him with assaulting 
Dykes. Police said Earley called to give himself up. 
</P>
<P>
Ophthalmologist Robert Bahr, who treated Dykes, said: "He is dramatically 
better than he was yesterday. He's feeling better and he's seeing better." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes' eye was swollen and he had some blurred vision Wednesday but was seeing 
normally Thursday, Bahr said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to probably have to take it easy for a while," Bahr said, 
explaining it normally takes five or six days to recover from a blunt eye 
injury. He said it looked as if Dykes took a blow directly to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
He said Dykes, 24, should be able to attend practice by Monday.

THERE'S LITTLE DEFENDING RAM SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: INJURY-WEAKENED DEFENSE HAS EARNED ITS SPOT AS LAST IN NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith were part and parcel of the Rams' best-laid plans, 
which opposing quarterbacks have made go awry. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram coaches had hoped that Hawkins and Smith, 6-foot-6 second-year 
defensive linemen, could step into the middle of the defensive line on pass 
downs and cause chaos with their long arms and aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was expecting miracles, but the anticipation was for something more than 
the zero sacks and 14 tackles the two injury-weakened defensive linemen have so 
far produced. 
</P>
<P>
Now, four games and three defeats into the season, the Ram defense is ranked 
last and Hawkins and Smith clearly are feeling the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Just this week, Coach John Robinson called the tandem's lack of progress "the 
most disappointing thing" about a disappointing defense. 
</P>
<P>
Without Hawkins and Smith providing an inside push from the tackle spots, 
quarterbacks have been free to sit back in the pocket and wait for a receiver 
to break clear. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a real sense that until Smith and Hawkins start pushing around 
pass blockers, the Rams will be a defense without damage. So the Rams wait, 
worry and wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, (there's) definitely a lot of pressure on us to rush the passer," Smith 
said. "But that's just how it is. I mean, it has to fall on somebody. 
</P>
<P>
"When things aren't going well, everybody wants to know what's going on or 
what's happening or why this isn't getting done or why that isn't getting done. 
And the pressure has to be put on somebody. Somebody has to step up and do it." 
</P>
<P>
As the Ram coaches try to come up with a pass rush -- plan more blitzes, 
consider moving players around -- Smith says he knows it is still basically up 
to him and Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not begging down from it," Smith said. "I feel like I can do it. But so 
far it just hasn't been going, for whatever reason, I don't know. I feel the 
pressure, but it's not something I'm afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, who attributes almost all of his problems to the knee injury he 
suffered at the end of last year and is still limited by it, says he is sure 
that the absence of a Ram rush is not permanent. 
</P>
<P>
So far this season, the Rams have only eight sacks and Hawkins, who plays on 
most passing downs, has two tackles and no sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I feel like I'm letting down the team?" Hawkins repeated pointedly, "No, 
because I'm trying my hardest. I hope they (understand). I think it's more than 
just one guy or one position or a couple guys inside. 
</P>
<P>
"You always want to go out there and get 10 sacks, but you can't dwell on the 
negatives of it. You've got to keep pushing, keep getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins was the Rams' No. 1 choice from the University of Miami in last year's 
draft and played in the first 13 games before hurting his knee. Smith was the 
second of three second-round selections that year, coming into the pros as a 
rangy stand-up end from Auburn who had to learn how to play defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Both were college-tested sackers, and both seemed to fit a scheme that featured 
linebacker Kevin Greene from the outside and tall, strong tackles coming from 
the inside. 
</P>
<P>
They were supposed to develop together, transform the Rams from passive to 
aggressive. Instead, they have stalled together, and the Rams defense has 
stalled with them. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said: "The only thing we did do when we 
developed the scheme was to say, 'Hey, we've got some young guys we can put in 
this spot, make them productive as pass rushers and play the run OK.' And 
obviously, we haven't been productive in that area. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're looking for is production. Go in the game and make plays. Get to 
the quarterback, tackle the ballcarrier. That's what the deal is." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins says that up until about three weeks ago, he couldn't even bend the 
knee, and was unable to get any kind of push on the pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
He says he is coming along better now but acknowledges that this recovery is 
taking far longer than anybody expected and perhaps longer than the Rams can 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to be ready for mini-camp," Hawkins said. "In the 
beginning, up to about three weeks ago, it was the hardest thing I ever went 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I'm coming out here, getting the offensive guys mad at me a little 
bit. That's when you know you're doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson kept both Smith, who was nursing a series of little injuries after 
suffering a knee injury in the exhibition season, and Hawkins out of practice 
the week before the bye weekend, hoping they would come out of that layoff fit 
and ready to attack quarterbacks. Then came the Bengals last week, and neither 
was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Robinson seems almost ready to move on without them. Thursday he conceded 
that the team isn't going to spotlight the two so much on pass downs and that 
fellow second-year defensive tackle Mike Piel, a third-round pick who had a 
sack last Sunday, will play more. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be more integrated in the group, but I think we're going to keep that 
group playing," Robinson said. "(But) where we were featuring them to a degree, 
(thinking that) hopefully they'll develop into something, now we're kind of 
backing off of that." 
</P>
<P>
But Piel, who wasn't a big pass rusher in college, is coming off a serious 
elbow injury and is clearly a second choice. Hawkins and Smith were -- and 
continue to be -- the Rams' major hope as big-time pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's disappointing," Smith said. "You like to feel like you're 
putting yourself in position to help the team, and we feel like we aren't. It's 
just how it goes. When things aren't going well, that's just how it is."

ERIC DAVIS, CAUGHT IN SPOTLIGHT, IS FEELING THE HEAT; 
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE: REDS' OUTFIELDER IS FEARED BY OPPONENTS YET BOOED BY FANS IN 
CINCINNATI.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is the most influential player for the Cincinnati Reds in this National 
League championship series, yet he cannot run without pain. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, with every step, he feels it in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Always," Eric Davis said softly. "It hurts every minute." 
</P>
<P>
He is the most influential player, yet he cannot take a full cut at a pitch 
without pain. His shoulder is so badly bruised from a late-season collision 
with an outfield wall that his swings have become the tired jabs of a weary 
boxer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've given up trying to pull the ball. I can't do it," said Davis, who has 
pulled only three balls to the left side of the field in 20 plate appearances. 
"I'm just trying to get my bat on it." 
</P>
<P>
He is the most influential player even though he is hitting .158 in the 
playoffs, the lowest of any regular. He has one extra-base hit. He has driven 
in one run. 
</P>
<P>
But he remains the most influential player because, simply by being Eric Davis, 
he inspires fear, resentment and respect. 
</P>
<P>
When he takes to Riverfront Stadium field tonight for Game 6 against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, his team a victory away from the World Series, there will 
be one example of his influence. 
</P>
<P>
He will be booed. His teammates guarantee it. "It's funny that nowhere in the 
league do the fans hate Eric as much as they hate him here," Red pitcher Norm 
Charlton said. "Everything he does, they boo. They don't give him any breaks. 
Not one." 
</P>
<P>
And when Davis, the Reds' No. 4 hitter, is in the on-deck circle, there will be 
another example. The Pirates' pitcher will be throwing balls around the middle 
of the plate to the Reds' No. 3 hitter. Pitchers are afraid of walking the No. 
3 Cincinnati hitter, putting a runner on base for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
This fear has backfired. The batting average of the Reds' No. 3 hitter, a 
position held by four different players thus far, is .429. One of those No. 3 
hitters has been Paul O'Neill, a top candidate for the series' most valuable 
player award with a .467 average with one homer and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Other clubs worry so much about Eric, they forget about the rest of our guys," 
teammate Glenn Braggs said. "It goes back to the Rickey Henderson theory in 
Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Davis' teammates will provide a third example. Even though he can 
barely run or hit, they know that when they need him, he will be there. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Billy Hatcher chased that fly ball by Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla to 
the center-field wall in the eighth inning of Game 4? He knew that if he 
crashed into the wall and missed the ball, Davis would be backing him up. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, he hit the wall, but Davis was there to pick up the ball and throw 
Bonilla out at third base in what has been the outstanding play of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Davis struggled through most of the season after suffering a knee injury April 
24 that will require off-season arthroscopic surgery. He was batting .224 on 
Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
But his teammates remember how, during the Reds' stretch drive from Aug. 22 to 
Sept. 27, he hit .357 with nine homers and 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric's influence on this club is so great, you can't describe it," said 
Braggs, who compared him to a former teammate at Milwaukee. "I liken him to 
Robin Yount. You know that day in and day out, he's going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former star at Fremont High in Los Angeles, enjoys this spotlight. But 
he hates it, too. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter he signed a three-year, $9.3-million deal with the Reds, even 
though he could have become a free agent this winter, partially because he 
likes his niche on the team. He even bought a home in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not in love with Cincinnati fans. In an important game with Houston 
late in the season, he was booed in three consecutive at-bats. He responded 
with a three-run homer in his fourth at-bat that drew a standing ovation and 
demand for a curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
But he would not leave the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have any pride in yourself, getting booed hurts," Davis said. "They pay 
their money, they can say whatever they want. But man, I've even been booed 
when I get a base hit! People put you so high on a pedestal, you can't make a 
mistake. And that's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Said Manager Lou Piniella: "People expect Eric to do everything. He makes it 
look too easy." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it used to be easy. Davis averaged 31 homers, 91 RBIs and 47 stolen bases 
in each of his four big league seasons before this one. He won three 
consecutive Gold Gloves in center field. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, with his knee problems, he decided to cut back on his running -- 
he stole only 21 bases. He also cut back on his swing and his home run total 
fell to 24. And to save his legs, he has been moved to left field, where he has 
not been as comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in a couple of cortisone shots in the knee and nightly bags of ice on his 
shoulder and Davis has realized that all-star outfielders are also human. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he only wishes everyone else would realize it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was great every time, like everybody expects, there wouldn't be enough 
money in the world to pay me," he said. "Nobody is great every time. Everybody 
is forgetting a funny little thing about this game -- there is always somebody 
pitching a ball and trying to get you out. Why is it that the majority of 
people who see you strike out think that you're not trying?" 
</P>
<P>
The most influential player rubbed his knee as if trying to decide whether his 
influence was a blessing or a curse. 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't people realize that I give 110% and keep my mouth shut and that's 
all I can do?" he asked.

BEFORE FENWAY, BEFORE THEY WERE RED SOX, THEY WERE WINNERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: IN THE FIRST WORLD SERIES IN 1903, THE AUTHOR'S GRANDFATHER WAS A 
BATBOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

the Orange County edition of The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
Those of us who dared to hope that baseball's league playoffs might produce a 
rematch of the first World Series rivals, Boston and Pittsburgh, were done in 
by the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, well. The record books are one thing, but an oral history is something more 
personal. Boston fans, such as myself, younger than 80 will not remember 1918, 
the last time the Red Sox won a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But between that 1903 series and 1918, Boston won five of them, and that 
generation, of which my grandfather was a part, actually was raised on the 
unheard-of notion of regular championship teams. He was present at the 
beginning, a 13-year-old batboy on the Pittsburgh bench in Boston in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
The Baseball Encyclopedia dutifully records that Boston defeated Pittsburgh, 
five games to three, in that classic, which began on Oct. 1. It was a 
best-of-nine series, with three games played in Boston, then four in 
Pittsburgh, and one back in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
My uncle, Raymond A. FitzGerald Jr., now of New York, jotted some notes when 
his father, my maternal grandfather, Raymond A. FitzGerald, was near the end of 
a long and colorful life at 93. 
</P>
<P>
In that conversation, my grandfather crossed decades of wars and depression to 
recall the names of the entire Boston team, as if they were lifted from 
yesterday's box score. My own check of the Baseball Encyclopedia bears out the 
accuracy of that lineup, but in fact, there was a bit more detail in those 
all-too brief late-life recollections, such as exactly what positions the three 
outfielders played (not in the encyclopedia), and which player served as both 
manager and captain (answer later). 
</P>
<P>
Baseball fans today can be certain that the curtain's fall on Comiskey Park in 
Chicago at the end of this season will only add to the growing legend of Fenway 
Park in Boston as a grand and fabled old sporting place on America's landscape. 
But a measure of how long ago 1903 was in baseball time is that there was not 
yet any Fenway Park for that World Series. The games in Boston actually were 
played at a field on Huntington Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious assignment of batboy, which would quicken the hearts today of 
many a kid from coast to coast, was simply a matter of getting to the game 
early and managing to be the first to grab the team bats off horse-drawn carts 
when they arrived. It was not a chore that many turn-of-the-century youngsters 
even thought to seek; and its glamour is conveyed mostly by the passage of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
It did not seem at all to be that big a deal to my grandfather, who in similar 
fashion as a boy had managed to duck past the assembled dignitaries at a 
ceremony to ride aboard the first subway car ever to run in America, from 
Harvard Square to Park Street. As for the self-appointed role of batboy, 
connections with the high and mighty in the baseball front office, which seem 
today to be the ticket of admission to batboy status, mattered not a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
Any 13-year-old could have done what my grandfather did in the 1903 World 
Series, which was simply to get there on foot with a buddy early enough, and 
then to say the right thing or wink the right way at the guy driving the 
horses. These simple credentials were a mixed blessing, for they ensured also 
that exalted batboy status for Game 1 on Oct. 1 of that year would have to be 
earned again for subsequent games. After Games 2 and 3 on Oct. 2 and 3, the 
series moved to Pittsburgh for the next four games, where presumably, some kids 
would reenact their own similar ritual. 
</P>
<P>
So a batboy took what he got. If that meant being a Boston kid working the 
Pittsburgh bench, so be it. And with such a front-row view of the game, what 
mattered? The memory lingered on. 
</P>
<P>
After 80 years, my grandfather recited for my uncle the Boston squad: "Cy 
Young, pitcher; Lou Criger, catcher; Bill Dinneen, pitcher; Candy LaChance, 
first base; Hobe Ferris, second base; Freddy Parent, shortstop; Jimmy Collins, 
third base, (and we learn from the oral history, also captain, and manager); 
Patsy Dougherty, left field; Chick Stahl, center field; Buck Freeman, right 
field." 
</P>
<P>
And on the Pittsburgh bench with my grandfather was "the Flying Dutchman," the 
great shortstop Honus Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
I got to chat a lot with my grandfather about baseball over the years, and 
savored what memories he could share as a vital link in the passage of 
generations. His generation passed from the scene with the warm memory of 
Boston victories -- for Boston did win that year, and again in 1912, 1915, 1916 
and 1918 (and the National League Braves, then in Boston, won in 1914). 
</P>
<P>
In those heady, boyhood days, the team was not yet even called the Red Sox -- 
they were the Boston Pilgrims, a name short on gut inspiration -- and he opined 
to me later that the team in New York had a much lesser claim than Boston would 
have had on the name, "Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
My grandfather's coming of age was a time when Yankees were the dominant group 
in the cultural and institutional life of Boston, and he remembered the signs 
around town intended for him and his batboy friends that said, "No Irish need 
apply." Basketball fans of Irish-American descent were to get their Celtics, 
and there was a certain logic in his eyes that a New England baseball team 
should have been called the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
My uncle, who describes himself as a member of the Jimmy Foxx generation, and 
I, an eyewitness from the bleachers on a wonderful October night in 1975 when 
Carlton Fisk kept America up late, and my 2-year-old daughter, whose Red Sox 
teddy bear was her first toy and who went out to Anaheim this summer to see 
Roger Clemens pitch, have all come up dry in three subsequent generations. 
</P>
<P>
We who are the pained Red Sox fans of today have lost more than our dear 
relatives and their first-hand recollections. We have lost the living memory of 
longed-for victory.

HORSE RACING: OWNER AND BREEDER JIM RYAN SAYS THAT MORE ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE 
PAID TO DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE AT THE TRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jim Ryan gets up to speak, it's usually as much a performance as a speech. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of turf reporters a few days before this year's Kentucky Derby, 
the highly charged Ryan began talking about racing's ills with tears in his 
eyes. The venue was an outdoor picnic at Churchill Downs, and the crowd was 
inattentive and restless. Ryan put two fingers to his mouth and whistled the 
audience to attention. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, a breeder and owner of horses whose Ryehill Farm is located in Mt. Airy, 
Md., reflected on that appearance the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me an award (the Joe Palmer Award for meritorious service to 
racing), and if I had to do it over, I would just take the award, say thank you 
and get off," Ryan said. "I thought it would be a good time to make an appeal, 
but I was wrong. The Derby is a time for levity, and I picked the wrong time 
for something as serious as what I was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 57, has long been interested in improving the welfare of those in racing, 
and as he prepares to sell the last of his horses and leave the game, the 
former home builder is making a farewell gesture: Whatever his 19 horses bring 
during an auction at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky., on Nov. 12, he will 
contribute half of that amount toward drug- and alcohol-rehabilitation programs 
and backstretch-related organizations, providing that the industry matches 
those funds. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the horses in the Ryan consignment, Cefis and Ring Dancer, are stakes 
winners and offspring of Caveat, the colt who won the Belmont Stakes for Ryan 
and his partners in 1983. Ryan estimates that the consignment will net more 
than $2 million. Assuming that projection is realized, and if Ryan's challenge 
is met by race tracks and other organizations, it will be the second time the 
Maryland horseman has contributed a seven-figure amount to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
In January 1989, Ryan offered $1 million for rehabilitation programs if 50 
tracks -- about half of the national total -- would contribute $20,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
There was no stampede. After a month, 15 tracks had joined the effort, but by 
the end of April the total was stalled at 18 tracks. A professional counselor 
was hired to visit tracks and pitch the program, and finally, by the end of 
November, the matching $1 million had been raised. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has given racing a deadline of May 4, Kentucky Derby day, to match half 
the money that his horses bring at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his altruism, Ryan is not unanimously hailed in racing circles. 
Sounding like an evangelist -- he studied pastoral counseling in college -- he 
spoke at a conference of industry leaders late last year and told them that 
available statistics from tracks indicated that substance abuse in racing is 
three times as frequent as it is among the overall population. Some racing 
officials grumbled that Ryan made it sound as though everybody in racing had an 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ryan quit the Jockey Club, the New York group that is heavy on 
bluebloods and one of the most prestigious organizations in racing. Ryan said 
the Jockey Club's foundation for helping backstretch employees has about $7 
million, and during a heated meeting at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., he was denied a 
request to use some of the money. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that they were saving the money for a rainy day," Ryan said. "I 
told them that it was pouring out there. After they told me that I should get 
off the committee if I didn't want to participate, I voted with my feet and 
resigned." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Steele, president of the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn., which 
represents owners and trainers nationally, said 25% of uncashed betting tickets 
could be used to finance drug and alcohol programs. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars in tickets go uncashed annually, with the money, depending 
on local laws, going to states, the tracks and the horsemen. Steele's 
suggestion would result in about $5 million a year for programs that he and 
Ryan support. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the tracks that keep track of substance abuse, 35% to 40% of the licensed 
workers are in trouble," Ryan said. "The (overall) national average is about 
10%." 
</P>
<P>
The problems of some well known jockeys -- Pat Day, Julie Krone, Chris Antley 
and Pat Valenzuela -- have been documented through the years, but besides 
jockeys, Ryan said industry studies show that exercise riders, who ride horses 
during morning workouts, and assistant starters, who have the dangerous job of 
loading horses into the gate before a race, also have high rates of substance 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a pattern to all of those jobs," Ryan said. "They are all jobs where 
there is an ongoing sense of fear. Of the name jockeys, Pat Day, whose problems 
have been behind him for a long time, has been very vocal about how you can 
lick drugs. Chris Antley and Pat Valenzuela have been less vocal, because they 
are still dealing with putting the pieces (of their lives and careers) back 
together." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the Assn. of Racing Commissioners International showed that 
$27.5 million was spent on animal drug testing -- horses and greyhounds -- last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be testing the humans more than we test the horses," said Ryan, who 
recalled an incident that occurred as he left a winner's circle at a Maryland 
track last year. 
</P>
<P>
A woman approached him and said: "My husband is riding stoned. He's going to 
get killed. Can you help us?" 
</P>
<P>
The Jockeys' Guild, which represents most of the approximately 2,000 jockeys in 
the United States, is aware of the problem but won't support random testing of 
its riders. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous sport, and we certainly don't want to see anybody get away 
with riding and using drugs," said John Giovanni, a former jockey and managing 
director of the guild. (But) riders have rights, too. There is always the 
chance of a mistake with the testing, and we don't want to see a rider branded 
as a junkie because of a mistake. Random testing is supposed to be a deterrent, 
but it didn't work that way for Antley." 
</P>
<P>
Antley, 24, one of New York's top jockeys, has said his cocaine problems began 
in 1985, when he was riding in New Jersey, a state that tests riders randomly. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has been in racing for almost 20 years, and besides his association with 
Caveat, he has won Eclipse Awards with Smart Angle and Heavenly Cause. He said 
he has made money in racing but wants to spend more time with his family and 
friends. He would like to be remembered as someone who left racing with at 
least a seed program for drug and alcohol abusers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons there's more of a problem in racing than elsewhere is 
because more than 50% of the horse business involves money that's paid in 
cash," Ryan said. "Cash is the foundation for a (drug-pushing) business that's 
also built on sin."

MINOR HORSES CAUSE A MAJOR FLAP

<P>
Horses called Stick It to Me, Persian Amber and I'm Early are not likely to be 
familiar to the casual racing fan, but their names have been crossing desks at 
the California Horse Racing Board offices in Sacramento all year, in a 
complicated dispute that involves board members, track stewards and 
investigators, chemists, owners, trainers and state and private veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
The undistinguished careers of Stick It to Me and Persian Amber are over, their 
combined earnings amounting to $575, but the status of their owner, Skip 
Chernov, and his former trainer, Steven Rothblum, is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita stewards say that Rothblum is appealing a six-month suspension for 
testing positive for cocaine on the day he testified at a hearing regarding I'm 
Early. Henry Chavez, chairman of the racing board, said Chernov will receive a 
hearing before an administrative law judge, after Chernov appealed a stewards' 
ruling that suspended his owner's license for not paying Rothblum's bills. 
</P>
<P>
Chernov and Rothblum had a falling out at Santa Anita last winter when Chernov 
accused Rothblum of directing veterinarians to nerve-block the legs of Stick It 
to Me and I'm Early. Racing board investigators concluded that there was no 
evidence to support the charges. 
</P>
<P>
In the I'm Early investigation, Gerald Frey, a veterinarian who treated the 
6-year-old mare, was fined $200 by the stewards and put on probation for more 
than three months. It is illegal to treat horses with most medications less 
than 48 hours before they are scheduled to run, and Frey could not produce 
records that showed his injection of a joint-lubricating fluid was outside that 
time frame. The lubrication is sometimes given to sore-legged horses but is not 
supposed to be injected less than two days before they race. 
</P>
<P>
All of the horses involved are bottom-of-the-line claimers. Stick It to Me and 
Persian Amber, who suffered career-ending injuries in the same race at Santa 
Anita last March, were retired as 4-year-old maidens; I'm Early has won only 
one race. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chernov's repeated protests have aroused Chavez's sympathies. "I 
didn't like the way he was handled," the racing board chairman said. "He got a 
runaround, and that is unfortunate. Very few owners cooperate in our 
investigations, but he was one who did. The ruling against him came from the 
Del Mar stewards, and there is some question whether this case could even be 
within their jurisdiction, since two of the three stewards there were not 
involved in the original case." 
</P>
<P>
The morning after Stick It to Me broke down, Chernov said he asked the Santa 
Anita stewards to test the filly to see if she might have run with a local 
anesthetic that is used illegally to block the nerve endings in a horse's leg. 
A racing board investigator said the horse was tested the day after that, and 
the result was negative. 
</P>
<P>
"The stewards were more concerned about whether I was going to pay my bill 
rather than what happened to the horse," Chernov said. "They tested the horse 
45 hours after she raced, and a full day after I asked them to. Then they only 
tested for one drug, and there wasn't enough sample left to do any further 
testing." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stetson, supervising special investigator for the racing board, said the 
postrace test couldn't have been used as evidence, anyway, because there was no 
surveillance of the horse between the time she ran and the time the urine 
sample was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Chernov, 52, has been in racing since 1975, owning horses for the last three 
years in California. He was a rock concert promoter in Providence, R.I., in the 
1960s and '70s and in 1971 owned the New England closed-circuit television 
rights to the first fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
That fight grossed more than $1 million, but six years later Chernov was broke 
and trying to break a drug habit. He suffered a heart attack in 1976 while 
watching morning workouts at the old Narragansett track in Rhode Island and 
twice has had open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
During his short time owning horses in California, Chernov has been physically 
and verbally active. He said he once got into a fistfight with one of his 
trainers. Before this year, he went before the stewards with charges that his 
trainer cashed a bet on a horse that was running against their horse -- a 
violation of racing rules -- and there was also a squabble about a trainer 
refusing to turn over a horse's registration papers after Chernov fired him. 
</P>
<P>
"Chernov has had eight trainers out here," said Pete Pedersen, a Santa Anita 
steward. "An owner is entitled to change trainers as often as he wants, but 
having that many in just a few years is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he's been right about some of the things he's brought up, but we've 
investigated everything and we're not satisfied that any of his charges are 
legitimate. He can't say that we haven't listened to him, because he's had many 
a day in court. I think he was so hopeful about the horses he had, and when 
they didn't work out, he was bitterly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more downs than ups in this game. It seems to me that he's picked 
many of his trainers because they worked for less. In racing, it's the same as 
anything else, you get what you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
When Stick It to Me cracked her knee and Persian Amber chipped a bone in her 
ankle, Chernov put them on a van to Oregon, where they were scheduled to be 
bred. 
</P>
<P>
Chernov choked over the words as he related what happened to the two fillies. 
"The farm manager told me they were so packed with steroids that they were 
infertile," Chernov said. "I've found a home for them. I gave them away. I 
didn't get one dime for them." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, one of the country's top 3-year-olds, will make his first start 
against older horses tonight. The Preakness winner is a 2-1 favorite in the 
$500,000 Meadowlands Cup at 1 1/8 miles. Also in the 11-horse field are Beau 
Genius, who has won six straight races, and Mi Selecto, who won the stake last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven horses, including the Charlie Whittingham-trained pair of Ruhlmann and 
Lively One, are entered in Saturday's $200,000 Goodwood Handicap at 1 1/8 miles 
at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. Ruhlmann has been assigned top weight of 123 
pounds. Others running are Festin, Triteamtri, Edipo Rey, Asia and Miserden. 
</P>
<P>
Home at Last, winner of the 1 1/4-mile Super Derby, will be shortened up to six 
furlongs for the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Belmont Park on Oct. 27. Home at Last 
beat his stablemate, Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, in the Super Derby, and 
Carl Nafzger, who trains both colts, is planning to run Unbridled in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic. . . . Also expected to go in the Sprint are Corwyn Bay, 
who won Wednesday's Ancient Title Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita, and 
Prospectors Gamble, who finished fourth.

25 OF 100 LARGEST CONGREGATIONS ARE IN CALIFORNIA, SURVEY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The survey ranking Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa as the nation's third-largest 
Protestant church by Sunday attendance also found that 25 of the top 100 are in 
California, a state better known for secular pleasures than old-time religion. 
</P>
<P>
The California churches, 20 of which are in Southern California, generally 
teach a literal Bible, are theologically and socially conservative, focus on 
the family, have a dynamic pastor and are not aligned with a mainline 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
On an average Sunday, 12,000 attend Calvary Chapel, according to the survey by 
the International Mega-Church Research Center in Bolivar, Mo. Affiliated 
churches in Riverside, Downey, San Diego, West Covina, Albuquerque, N.M., and 
Jacksonville, Ore., also rank in the top two-thirds of the list. 
</P>
<P>
"They are one of the best-kept secrets on the West Coast," John N. Vaughan, who 
heads the research center at Southwest Baptist University, said about the 
Calvary churches. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan has tracked the largest congregations for several years. He noted that 
another Orange County church is one of the fastest growing, Saddleback Valley 
Community Church in Mission Viejo, a Southern Baptist church pastored by the 
Rev. Rick Warren. Vaughan said it went from 1,710 churchgoers in 1987 to 3,055 
in 1988, and to 4,000 last year, placing it in a tie for 62nd place on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 1 nationally is First Baptist Church of Hammond, Ind., with 20,000 
churchgoers. Second-ranked with 14,605 churchgoers is Willow Creek Community 
Church in South Barrington, Ill. The Rev. Jerry Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist 
Church in Lynchburg, Va., with 11,000 in attendance, ranked fourth. Texas was 
the second-highest state with 14 churches on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Polls have shown that church affiliation is relatively low in California 
compared to other states. However, church experts say that means relatively 
large numbers of people, often willing to drive long distances, are potential 
converts for evangelistic, multi-activity churches. 
</P>
<P>
"California has a growing population, and a large church is like a stronghold 
for reinforcing values when there are assaults on the family," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan's ratings will appear in "The Almanac of the Christian World," to be 
published late this month by Tyndale House, Wheaton, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The success of many of the "super churches" is linked to the popularity of the 
pastor, said Eddie Gibbs, a professor at Pasadena's Fuller Theological 
Seminary. "In a large, mobile society, people are attracted to the brightest 
star on the horizon," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan acknowledged that his attendance figures for First Baptist Church of 
Hammond, Ind., are much older than figures for the other churches. But 
evangelical leaders generally agree that it has the biggest Sunday attendance 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The evangelical magazine Christianity Today recently reported that its pastor, 
the Rev. Jack Hyles, has been the target of published charges of moral laxity, 
doctrinal heresy and financial impropriety. Hyles dismissed the charges as 
unworthy of response two years ago and has since declined to be interviewed on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The nondenominational Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, pastored for nearly 
22 years by the Rev. John MacArthur, ranks ninth with 8,000 churchgoers. "We 
give authoritative answers (from the Bible) to questions of the heart (and) we 
work with families, including classes in marriage and child-raising," MacArthur 
said in accounting for the drawing power of the San Fernando Valley church. 
</P>
<P>
Some Roman Catholic parishes in large archdioceses might make the list, but few 
Catholic officials keep those statistics, Vaughan said. "They can tell you how 
many members and baptisms they have, but not how many attend weekend Masses," 
he said. 
</P>

DIFFERENT IMAGE OF YOUTH OFFERED IN SLAYING

<P>
A picture captioned "Kill Saturday" and a letter referring to "getting that 
S.O.B." were found in a 17-year-old's duffle bag after he fatally shot a 
classmate in what he said was an accident, a prosecutor told a judge Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard H. Bourassa Jr. also allegedly told a friend that he wanted to join the 
military so he could get "paid to kill people," Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper 
said during a hearing at which she is seeking to have Bourassa tried for murder 
as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's hearing, Harper declined to elaborate on the meaning of the 
picture and letter found in the duffle bag, but Bourassa's attorney said he 
believed that neither referred to the victim. The evidence was presented, 
Harper said, to illustrate that Bourassa is not the "mellow" youth ignorant of 
guns, as he has told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa shot and killed 17-year-old Christian Wiedepuhl May 24 -- a Thursday 
-- in the study of the family's Anaheim Hills home. He told police that he was 
trying to get his stepfather's .38-caliber pistol from Wiedepuhl when the gun 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
In the same room on Sept. 13, 1986, Bourassa shot and killed another classmate, 
13-year-old Jeffrey Bush, after he said that a 12-gauge shotgun accidentally 
discharged. Police ruled it an accidental shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa, charged with murder and involuntary manslaughter in Wiedepuhl's 
death, is being held in Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson made no ruling at the hearing, which 
will continue Monday. A probation officer who investigated the case is expected 
to testify about her findings on whether Bourassa should stand trial as a 
juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators did not believe Bourassa's version of Wiedepuhl's killing, but 
because there were no witnesses, they spent four months collecting physical 
evidence to recreate the shooting. That included ballistics tests, clothing 
analysis and examinations of gunpowder residue. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Harper presented numerous police findings besides the duffle bag 
contents in seeking to have Bourassa, who turns 18 in January, tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining outside the courtroom later the significance of some findings, 
Harper revealed for the first time Bourassa's version of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
She said he has told authorities that Wiedepuhl got a gun belonging to 
Bourassa's parents and only after two demands handed it over to Bourassa in the 
doorway of the study. As Bourassa took the gun, holding it waist high, 
Wiedepuhl stooped to pick up a holster, Bourassa told police. The gun 
accidentally went off, mortally wounding Wiedepuhl in the head. 
</P>
<P>
But Harper contended that the gun could not have accidentally discharged 
because ballistic tests introduced Thursday showed that "no way the gun could 
have fired without direct pressure" on the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
In previous hearings, Harper has characterized Bourassa as having a fixation 
with guns, despite his statements of indifference to and ignorance about 
weapons to police in the hours after Wiedepuhl was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Harper told the judge that Bourassa wrote a recent school paper on guns, and 
friends interviewed by investigators allegedly quoted Bourassa as saying he 
wanted to join the Reserve Officers Training Corps so he could "shoot guns." 
</P>
<P>
The defense said little in court, but Bourassa's attorney, Edward W. Hall, said 
afterwards that Bourassa's "Kill Saturday" message was on a sheet of doodles 
where he had also written, "hart and soul" and "Richard and Allison forever." 
He said they were "like a thousand things found in anyone's locker." 
</P>
<P>
Hall suggested that it was teen-age bravado that led Bourassa to sound so 
gung-ho to schoolmates because he had spent Easter vacation -- just weeks 
before Wiedepuhl was shot -- at the Ft. Irwin Military Reservation with 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Hall also said what otherwise might be viewed as patriotism is now being 
interpreted differently by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the death of Christian," he added, "nobody would have taken a second 
look" at Bourassa's interest in weapons and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the judge will review police reports read in court Thursday, 
as well as the probation officer's findings on whether Bourassa should be tried 
as an adult. He also will view three videotapes: two of them are of police 
interviews with Bourassa, including his re-enactment of the shooting; the third 
features the inside of the home.

PSYCHIATRY PROFESSOR DOUBTS SURROGATE'S EMOTIONAL BOND

<P>
A renowned expert on child psychiatry testified Thursday that he does not 
believe surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson became emotionally attached to the 
baby she delivered for an infertile couple, and said he would be wary of giving 
her custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Justin D. Call, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at UC Irvine, said 
he is suspicious of Johnson's claim to a deep bond with the infant because of a 
statement she made in a newspaper interview and a letter she wrote to the 
baby's genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, is the first surrogate mother in the nation to seek parental 
rights to a child not genetically related to her. Her lawyer is already 
predicting she will lose in Orange County Superior Court because emotions in 
the case are overshadowing the legal issues. But he feels certain of victory on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In the July 23 letter to Mark and Crispina Calvert, the infertile couple who 
hired her, Johnson threatened to keep the baby unless they immediately paid her 
the rest of her $10,000 fee. Call said Johnson's use of phrases such as "before 
your child is born" and "the child of someone else" indicates that she had not 
become attached to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson told The Los Angeles Times in early August, when she was seven months' 
pregnant, that she did not feel bonded to the fetus because it was not made 
from her genetic material. The embryo implanted in her uterus was made from the 
Calverts' sperm and egg. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been my egg, it would have made a real big difference," Johnson said 
at the time. "But with (in-vitro fertilization), there's no connection to me. . 
. . There's been detachment from the baby from Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
Call, who testified for the Calverts in their bid for permanent custody of the 
boy born Sept. 19, said Johnson's statement "very clearly supports the idea 
that the mother has not made an attachment to the child." Lack of bonding by 
seven months into the pregnancy would "carry a very bad prognosis for 
continuing attachment after birth," Call said. 
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable person should be very circumspect about giving a woman full 
responsibility for a child she had not made a normal attachment to during 
pregnancy," Call testified. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's court-appointed lawyer, Harold F. LaFlamme, elicited Call's analysis 
of Johnson's letter and her statement to The Times in an attempt to explore the 
validity of her claim to true bonding with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson now denies saying that she did not feel attached to the baby. She 
argues that she is entitled to legal parental status because she carried and 
delivered the child, and because infant-mother bonding is more important than 
an agreement she signed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert, sought to have a Times reporter and 
photographer excluded from the court as potential witnesses about Johnson's 
statements, and then expanded his request to include all news media. But 
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. denied the requests. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, tried to undermine Johnson's 
claims by asking Call if infants form bonds of affection toward their 
gestational mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Call testified that although there is ample evidence to show that most women 
develop deep feelings for their babies, there is none to demonstrate similar 
sentiments in an infant. 
</P>
<P>
That contradicted an expert who testified Tuesday for Johnson, saying that 
several studies indicate that infants form powerful emotional bonds to their 
birth mothers. Dr. David B. Chamberlain said that if 12 mothers were assembled 
in the courtroom jury box, a newborn could recognize the woman who bore him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Call acknowledged that an unrelated gestational mother plays an 
"obvious" role in nourishing the fetus, he minimized that contribution, saying 
a child's genetic makeup determines most of its future form and development. He 
said the baby's strongest connections are to its genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
Call advocated that custody be awarded to the Calverts, saying that it is more 
important for a child to be with his genetic parents than with the unrelated 
woman who delivered him, because much of a child's sense of identity is derived 
from knowing his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
A "shared parenting" arrangement, such as the one Johnson seeks, in which all 
three adults would help raise the baby, could be upsetting to the child because 
he could be caught between conflicting sets of values or parenting styles, Call 
said. That kind of upset could impair the boy's ability to form bonds with 
others in the future, Call said. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, Gilbert attacked Call's assessment of Johnson's bond 
to the baby, saying that surrogate mothers who feel ready to relinquish their 
children at birth have been subjected to "mind-control programs." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert asked for Call's opinion on Johnson's use of the news media to 
publicize her case. Posing the question as a hypothetical situation, Gilbert 
said the birth mother feared her baby would be taken from her, so she "left a 
trail of bread crumbs" -- notified reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you criticize her for making a public record if she did it to leave a 
trail of bread crumbs . . . in hopes that one day the baby would find its way 
back or, at the very least, the baby would know how hard she tried?" Gilbert 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Call replied that he would try to get such a birth mother to explore the fears 
that led to her use of publicity.

TRESTLE'S LEGACY HAUNTS A FATHER

<P>
The northbound passenger train came almost silently onto the wood-and-steel 
bridge, its fierce breath blowing Henry Ruley aside like an afterthought as it 
whooshed by at 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
There was no telltale clackety-clack of the rails announcing its approach. Just 
that shuddering rush of turbulent wind that brushed him aside and then abruptly 
pulled him toward the speeding train's wake. And the whistle that finally blew 
when the train was upon him. 
</P>
<P>
For three days now, at precisely the same moment, the 70-year-old Washington 
man has come to this spot on the legendary railroad bridge just south of San 
Clemente, known simply as the Trestle. 
</P>
<P>
He's there to meet the northbound Amtrak train that passes through San Onofre 
State Park each day at 12:50 p.m., passing within a few yards of one of the 
most popular beaches for Orange County surfers. 
</P>
<P>
Ruley wants to see the behemoth that killed his son, feel the fury of its 
passing. And he wants to stop other youths from being run over on the trestle 
that has become a shortcut for hundreds of board-laden surfers heading toward 
the sandy beach below. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 4, 22-year-old Adam James Ruley was struck by the train as he and two 
friends crossed the venerable span while taking a shortcut from adjacent 
Trestles Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While his friends walked directly on the tracks, the north San Diego County 
grocery clerk carried his bicycle along a protected catwalk on the opposite 
side of a steel-girder wall that runs a third of the way along the 
250-foot-long bridge, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
But as he came around the wall at the end of the catwalk, he was suddenly met 
by the train he never saw as it swept by. It hooked Ruley's bike, breaking his 
neck as it dragged him for more than 40 yards along the tracks. He died at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Ruley's parents arrived from the Seattle area to lay their son 
to rest in a private ceremony in which his cremated remains were spread across 
San Diego Bay. But Henry Ruley says he doesn't want the issue of what he calls 
a dangerous train crossing to die along with Adam. 
</P>
<P>
"My son has died a terrible death here," Ruley said Wednesday afternoon as he 
stood at the exact spot where his son was struck. "I grieve for my son terribly 
but I can't do anything for him now. But I can do something for the living." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the northbound train passed, Ruley walked along the bridge to a 
dark spot near the tracks, holding onto the wooden rail to steady himself. 
"See, this is where my boy finally lay," he concluded softly. 
</P>
<P>
It was the boy Ruley had introduced to surfing lessons at age 12, who grew up 
loving the sport and the clean, crisp atmosphere of the Southern California 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
It was the boy who called his father long-distance from his home in Vista only 
a few days before just to say he loved him. And to tell him of a job interview 
that was to take place the afternoon he died. 
</P>
<P>
But those are just memories now for Henry Ruley. 
</P>
<P>
"God, Adam," he said, standing on the bridge. "I'm not going to let you die in 
vain." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ruley had already begun to make good on his promise. He called the 
office of San Diego County Supervisor John McDonald to investigate which state 
agency would be responsible for making changes at the trestle. 
</P>
<P>
Ruley, a retired structural engineer who worked for Orange County and the state 
of California, believes that, at the very least, a trip switch should be 
installed to alert people walking along the bridge, which is posted by two "No 
Trespassing" signs. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, he says, the bridge should be permanently fenced off. Also, an 
adjacent walkway should be built for the surfers -- many of whom prefer to run 
the bridge's 250-yard gauntlet across the mouth of a marshy estuary rather than 
trudge in the nearby sand with their bulky surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
Ruley, who moved to the Seattle area from Carlsbad four months ago, is 
disappointed not to have heard from either Amtrak or the Santa Fe railroad -- 
which operates the tracks -- since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a nice gesture," he said. "I guess to them, my son is just 
another statistic. But not to me." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, a spokesman for the Santa Fe, said that at least two or three 
pedestrians die each year from being struck on the tracks between San Diego and 
San Clemente. But the trestle at San Onofre State Beach has not been cited as a 
particular problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, those tracks are a dangerous place," Martin said. "Sixteen Amtrak trains 
pass over them each day -- eight in each direction. They're going at 90 miles 
an hour, 135 feet per second. 
</P>
<P>
"And with the quarter-mile strips of continuously welded rail we've installed 
this year, they run pretty silent. You don't hear the clackety-clack anymore. 
But still, you've got people sleeping on the tracks or jogging on them while 
wearing a Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't keep people off the tracks. And a fence isn't practical because 
we haven't got the manpower to patrol it. They'd tear it down as soon as we put 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he was open to suggestions on how to close the trestle to 
pedestrian traffic. "I don't know if we would consider putting warning lights 
or sirens in there, but we would like to see the county or the state build a 
pedestrian bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Booth would like that idea just fine. The lifeguard at San Onofre State 
Beach says he long ago stopped scolding the 300 to 400 surfers he sees on the 
trestle during weekend patrols. "They don't do it on a dare -- they just want 
to use the bridge as a 10-minute shortcut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The surfers use the span to cross the marshy estuary to Lower Trestles Beach, 
just to the south, as well as a vantage point to scope out the surf, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the surfers aren't aware of the train schedules and walk precariously 
along the tracks, waiting to duck down onto a lower culvert that runs along the 
tracks, grab onto the rail and hang on for dear life -- if they see a train 
approach, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these kids aren't afraid of anything," he said. "I've seen some run 
along the tracks right in front of the train. When it catches up with them, 
they finally leap down to cling onto the wooden rail. Or they make the 25-foot 
jump off the side of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might break a leg or an arm. But their attitude is 'Hey, at least I 
didn't damage my board.' Most wouldn't think of saving themselves first." 
</P>
<P>
Booth said he was first at the scene when Ruley was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"That kid had everything going against him," he said. "The wind was blowing 
hard, so he probably didn't hear the train whistle. After he died, all his 
friends could keep saying to themselves at the scene was, 'Why do we do this? 
Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
The bridge, Booth said, is the last obstacle of a long trek surfers face to 
reach picturesque Trestles Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the beach was closed to surfers. Now, hundreds of youths park their 
cars east of Interstate 5 and make their way along the 1 1/2-mile walkway that 
was opened in 1972 when former First Lady Pat Nixon developed a fondness for 
the sweeping stretches of beach within view of her San Clemente home. 
</P>
<P>
Though it saves them time, some surfers say they still avoid the dangerous 
trestle. "It's just a foolish thing to do," said Jesse Henry, 19, of Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One day four years ago, Henry recalled, he was the last of five surfers to 
reach the safety of the catwalk area where Ruley met his death -- a 
split-second before the train rushed past them. 
</P>
<P>
"Those trains are just a lot faster and quieter now," he said. "They stalk you 
on that bridge if you're not careful. So I just stay away from there." 
</P>
<P>
Henry was just one of the surfers who offered their condolences to Henry Ruley 
as he walked along the path to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Along the walkway, other surfers had written graffiti messages to the young 
surfer known to his friends as "Kirby" because he used to hit the curb so often 
while learning to drive a car. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks Adam," one message said. Another: "Remember Kirby." 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the bridge, just beneath the spot where Adam Ruley died, friends 
have posted a bronze memorial plaque. His mother and father -- who have three 
older children -- have brought flowers to the site, tenderly setting them on 
the arched wooden support beams. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a frightening place," Ruley said of the bridge as he lay more flowers 
at the memorial. "I cringe at the thought of that train and I don't even like 
to get close to it. But I have this anger. 
</P>
<P>
"As an engineer, we called places like these an attractive nuisance because 
they attracted people to danger. Well, this is an attractive deathtrap. It's a 
hazard that's been neglected by Amtrak and the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's obvious more kids will lose out while playing out their odds on this 
bridge." 
</P>

CANDIDATES FOCUS ON CITY'S FISCAL WOES 
</P>

<P>
By BUENA PARK CITY COUNCIL These are the candidates running for three seats on 
the Buena Park City Council in the Nov. 6 election. Incumbent Kenneth B. Jones 
is not seeking reelection. Arthur Brown Age: 53 Occupation: Retired sheriff's

<TEXT>
<P>
The city's ailing budget is taking center stage this election among the eight 
candidates vying for a spot on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Six challengers and two incumbents are squaring off for three open seats. 
Councilman Kenneth B. Jones is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Although they disagree on how, all candidates list getting the city back on 
sound financial footing as their top priority. During the past two years the 
city has begun the new budget season with a deficit and projections show the 
picture only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, by the 1993-94 budget year the city could be in 
debt by as much as $4 million. To help close the gap, the City Council has 
increased the local bed tax and implemented some "fee for service" measures, 
the most recent being a paramedic assessment fee. While some candidates propose 
internal belt tightening, others are looking for outside resources. Once again 
the idea of an amusement tax, which would add an additional tax on local 
attractions, is being offered as a means to cure the budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Arthur Brown and Max R. Schulman are coming out in favor of the 
often controversial amusement tax suggestion. "It is a ready source of revenue 
that hasn't been tapped into," said Brown, a retired deputy sheriff. "What else 
is there?" said Schulman, who making his third attempt for a seat on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time the proposal has been suggested. Although it has been 
studied, prior councils have never taken action on it. The exact terms are not 
known, but the general concept is to tax people attending events that require 
any type of admission fee. This percentage would go directly to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Zanville, head of public relations for Knott's Berry Farm, the city's 
biggest attraction, said it would place an unfair burden on the park's ability 
to compete. "A tax like that would have to be passed on to the consumer as a 
price increase . . . putting us at a disadvantage with other parks." He added 
that the park already pays more than $1 million in sales tax and fees to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it "biting the hand that feeds us," several of the other candidates 
firmly oppose the tax, including incumbent Donna L. Chessen. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather see us increasing tourism and bringing businesses into the 
city," she said. Chessen suggests tapping into grants and other monies made 
available and also supports implementing a "fee for services" policy. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Rhonda J. McCune, the city's first female mayor, said she has been 
open to looking at the suggestion but does not support it at this time. If 
implemented, it could affect development of the Entertainment Corridor project, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, the city has been busy luring attractions to the 
corridor along a one-mile stretch of Beach Boulevard. Several businesses have 
opened and others are planned for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Also not willing to disturb the redevelopment plan is candidate Larry Wieck. He 
suggests several internal changes to help the budget including cutting back on 
the number of outside contractors hired. He also wants to make the Recreation 
Department self-sustaining. The remaining candidates, Robert Roefs, Alfred 
Whitmore and Gerald N. Sigler call for long-term planning and study of the 
situation. Sigler, a member of the Planning Commission, said there are many 
wasteful practices that could be eliminated. "I don't think we should spend 
money on projects, then wait before they are approved," Sigler said. BUENA PARK

<P>
RIVER WATER TO BE TESTED FOR HEPATITIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Surfrider Foundation announced this week that it plans to test water dumped 
from the San Gabriel River into the ocean for the virus that causes hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Labedz, a foundation member and physician, said the group decided to do 
the tests because some surfers have complained about getting ill after being in 
the water at the mouth of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the illnesses are minor sinus and stomach infections, but group members 
also say they have heard about dozens of undocumented infectious hepatitis 
cases. Doctors handling such cases are required to report them to the county 
health department. 
</P>
<P>
County health records show only two infectious hepatitis cases in Seal Beach 
last year. Also, the County Health Care Agency, which samples ocean waters off 
the coast weekly, has never had a documented case of any serious illness from 
swimming in the ocean off Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The water that empties from the San Gabriel River comes from three sewage 
treatment plants upstream and is tested by the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
District. Labedz said the foundation wants to work with the sanitation 
district, which tests for bacteria, but not viruses, at the river mouth. 
Testing and an attempt to document cases will begin sometime this winter, he 
added. SHANNON SANDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROTH LIKELY TO CHAIR TRAIN COMMISSION

<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Don R. Roth is expected today to be elected chairman of a 
commission that is guiding the creation of a super-speed train linking Anaheim 
with Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Roth currently is vice chairman of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission, which has approved an international consortium's plans to privately 
build and operate a 265-m.p.h. magnetic levitation train. 
</P>
<P>
The rail service, which could begin in 1997, will link Anaheim with Las Vegas 
in a 75-minute, one-way trip. 
</P>
<P>
Roth has said that the $5-billion train will "thrust both states into the 21st 
Century," reducing traffic congestion and attracting tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Roth also supports the project because he has been pushing for construction of 
a regional airport at George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, which 
would be considered too remote without high-speed rail service. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 members of the commission will vote on the chairmanship, which changes 
annually, this afternoon at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach. The current 
chairman is Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city councilman. MARLA CONE

WHEELCHAIR TENNIS WHIZ A REAL FIGHTER 
</P>

<P>
A full day had passed since Donna Miller upset the No. 3 seeded women's player 
at the U.S. Open Wheelchair Tennis Championships in Irvine, but fellow players 
still congratulated her when they passed by. 
</P>
<P>
"That a girl, Donna," said one. "Go get 'em," said another. And the smile on 
Miller's face grew brighter with each compliment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hungry for this one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is one of 262 players from 14 countries competing at the Racquet Club of 
Irvine through Sunday. She is the first player in five years to beat out 
Monique Van Den Bosch of Holland in the first round of play. 
</P>
<P>
The players, many with custom-made wheelchairs and tennis racquets, compete 
nationally and internationally each year, starting in April and culminating 
with the Irvine tournament. Over the last 10 years, the circuit has grown from 
the original 75 players. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a small percentage of people who play wheelchair tennis," said 
Brad Parks, 33, who founded the National Foundation for Wheelchair Tennis in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
While recuperating in the hospital from a skiing accident in 1976, Parks 
wondered what sport he could take up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never heard of it (wheelchair tennis)," he said. But then he got on the 
court in his set of wheels from the hospital and hit a few balls to his 
parents. "I couldn't move very well and I knew there was only one way to go, 
and that was up." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very aerobic," said Rich Rosenbaum of Ft. Lee, N.J., who is completing 
his fourth season on the circuit. "It's also one of the few wheelchair sports 
that you can do with able-bodied people." 
</P>
<P>
For Miller, it's the competitiveness that drew her in. 
</P>
<P>
At 28, she is the executive director of a referral service for the handicapped 
in Middletown, N.Y. Her staff encourages disabled people to live as 
independently as possible, focusing on their abilities instead of their 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
She trains for several hours every day, playing tennis, swimming, lifting 
weights and pushing a specially designed wheelchair up and down the streets of 
her neighborhood. She has a coach whom she credits with teaching her to 
outthink her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Before her multiple sclerosis was diagnosed five years ago, Miller was a 
nationally ranked swimmer. After she became wheelchair-bound, she tried road 
racing and basketball, but neither sport pushed her competitive spirit the way 
tennis did. She is now ranked third nationally. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament at the Racquet Club of Irvine, 5 Sandburg Way, is open to the 
public. Admission is free. MARY ANNE PEREZ

HOMELESS SWEEPS ACCORD REPORTED NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD BLOCK POLICE FROM TARGETING STREET PEOPLE 
IS EXPECTED TO BE ADOPTED, A LEGAL AID LAWYER SAID.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legal Aid attorneys said Thursday that they are nearing a settlement in a 
lawsuit to block Santa Ana police from conducting sweeps that specifically 
target homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"There really are no disagreements on this case now," said Robert Cohen, 
executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, which filed the 
class-action suit on behalf of the homeless in September. After negotiating 
aspects of the suit with city officials, Cohen said, "nothing has been left 
unaddressed. We expect the city to agree to the terms." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said, however, that no agreement has been reached. 
He said any proposal will have to be approved by the City Council before the 
suit can be settled. Cooper said that city officials were still looking over 
terms of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Legal Aid is jumping the gun on this one," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid lawsuit stems from two police actions in August in which 90 
homeless people were cited for minor municipal code infractions -- mostly 
public drunkenness, littering and urinating in public -- during sweeps at the 
Civic Center. Seven of them were arrested on outstanding criminal warrants. 
</P>
<P>
In the first sweep, 64 homeless people were rounded up and transported to Santa 
Ana Stadium where police officers scrawled numbers on their arms for 
identification and then shackled them to benches for several hours before 
handing out citations. In the second sweep, suspects were just cited and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid suit charged that the sweeps, particularly the one that took 
place on Aug. 15, violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights to equal 
protection and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Legal Aid lawyers 
charged that the sweeps were part of a citywide campaign initiated in 1988 to 
"drive the homeless from the city of Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
A court document filed Thursday outlined the proposed settlement, in which 
police would agree not to write identifying numbers on the arms of suspects 
cited for city code infractions or misdemeanors, and not detain them for an 
excessive amount of time. The proposal also calls for police to stop using 
Santa Ana Stadium as a temporary holding facility for homeless suspects, and 
not handcuff and shackle homeless people who are accused of misdemeanors or 
minor infractions. 
</P>
<P>
In numerous interviews, Police Chief Paul M. Walters has said that the sweeps 
were aimed at criminals and did not target the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the proposed accord does not settle the criminal proceedings for the 
homeless who were arrested. They still face hearings on misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
The city would still be allowed to conduct sweeps at the Civic Center, Cohen 
said, as long as they are not a "concerted effort to drive the homeless from 
Santa Ana."

COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF EDISON CO. OVER 5 CITIES; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: ANAHEIM AND FOUR OTHER CITIES LOST THE 12-YEAR-OLD SUIT. THEY 
CLAIMED THE UTILITY OVERCHARGED THEM FOR ELECTRICITY AND VIOLATED ANTITRUST 
LAWS. 
</P>

<P>
Southern California Edison Co. has won a 12-year-old lawsuit filed by Anaheim 
and four other cities which sought $300 million in damages, claiming that the 
utility overcharged them for electricity and violated antitrust laws by denying 
them access to transmission lines, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The draft decision by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzerin Los Angeles was 
issued Tuesday and ruled in favor of Edison on all counts in the lawsuit filed 
by Anaheim, Riverside, Banning, Colton and Azusa. The five cities own their own 
utilities, purchase power wholesale through Edison and resell it retail to 
their municipal customers, an Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim had the largest interest in the lawsuit, which was filed in 1978 and 
reached trial in 1986. If the cities had prevailed, Anaheim's share of the 
award would have been about $150 million, said Ray Merchant, communications 
officer for Anaheim's Public Utility Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly disappointed in the decision," Merchant said. "We've been 
waiting quite a while for a decision. It's certainly fair to say we're 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials, however, hailed the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge's ruling emphasizes that Edison has acted to protect the interests 
of its customers, that Edison has not sought to restrict competition and that 
Edison's dealings with the cities have been proper in regard to access to its 
major electrical transmission lines to the Pacific Northwest," said Edison 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John E. Bryson in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-page draft decision is expected to be issued in final form next week, 
and Merchant said the city's attorneys need to study it before deciding what 
the next step will be. Anaheim continues to be interested in using Edison's 
transmission lines to deliver electricity purchased from generating plants in 
the Northwest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit addressed two issues. One was an allegation that Edison "price 
squeezed" the five municipal utilities by charging them more at wholesale rates 
than Edison charged some of its customers, such as large industries, at retail 
rates, Merchant said. He did not know how much the alleged overcharges totaled 
because the prices varied according to a complex schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The second issue involved the cities' allegations that Edison violated federal 
antitrust laws by denying them access to transmission lines, which would have 
enabled them to buy power from hydroelectric generating plants in the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Merchant said Anaheim had arranged to buy power directly from a utility in the 
Northwest and transmit it as far as Southern California. "But we couldn't get 
it the rest of the way home" because Edison denied the city access to its 
network of transmission lines, called the Pacific Intertie. 
</P>
<P>
"We said no because we needed the capacity for the needs of all of our 
customers, not just a few," said Edison spokesman Lewis M. Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
The judge found that Edison had acted properly and that in serving the 
interests of its own customers, Edison had not violated antitrust laws, Phelps 
said. If Edison had given the cities the access they requested, costs would 
have risen for other customers, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's public utility was established in 1894 and began operating in 1895, 
buying its power from outside sources and distributing it to city customers, 
which number 100,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1975, Anaheim's utility purchased 100% of its power from Edison, but in 
the early 1970s began looking elsewhere when Edison began increasing its rates, 
Merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Anaheim has obtained its power from a variety of sources, 
concentrating on nuclear, coal and hydroelectric, and not relying much on oil. 
Only 2% of Anaheim's power now is purchased from Edison.

Ortega Highway has earned a reputation as one of the state's most treacherous 
highways, yet the prime cause of accidents is the motorist, not the road, 
officials from various state and county agencies maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody likes to blame Ortega Highway . . . but it's not the road's fault," 
said Ken Daily, a California Highway Patrol spokesman at the CHP's office here. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a host of reasons for accidents, including drivers who are inattentive 
or drunk; more traffic than the road was built to handle, and daredevil drivers 
who foolishly test their skills on the winding mountain route. 
</P>
<P>
A crash on Ortega Highway Wednesday claimed three lives, pushing to five the 
number of traffic fatalities this year. A man suspected of drunk driving lost 
control of his pickup truck on the winding, two-lane road. The truck flipped 
several times and all five passengers were thrown from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours earlier, a tractor-trailer jackknifed and tipped over on another 
stretch of Ortega Highway, forcing officials to partially close the road. There 
were no injuries in that accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is these highways are filled with twists and turns, in addition to 
the higher volume of cars because people are using them more as alternative 
routes," said state Department of Transportation spokesman Albert Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the winding character of rural roads has made them popular with 
sports car and motorcycle enthusiasts, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Daily said the CHP has received complaints from residents in the rural 
community of El Cariso on Ortega Highway in Riverside County about a group of 
reckless motorcyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"They were holding time trials . . . racing against the clock along the entire 
32-mile stretch of highway," Daily said. "We decided to raid the area to stop 
the racing, but word leaked out after we invited the media. It's only a matter 
of time before one of them ends up in an accident." 
</P>
<P>
On some highways, the state recommends that motorists turn their headlights on 
for greater visibility. Daily said this is mandatory for both Ortega Highway 
and Laguna Canyon Road, and along Santiago Canyon Road near Irvine Lake in 
Orange, although state studies have not supported the program's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Linda Burris, citing accident investigation reports, has found that 
motorists who use Santiago Canyon Road are not accustomed to driving on a 
two-lane highway. So when they start using such a road as a shortcut, they are 
not as attentive and alert as they need to be. 
</P>
<P>
Daily added: "Ortega has always had a reputation and the state is in the 
process of widening the road. But it was never meant to be a big highway. It's 
over 50 years old and it's being used as a main artery. Until we get something 
better, we're stuck with it."

VICTIM WAS HOOKED ON BEAUTY OF ORTEGA HIGHWAY

Forrest Harper and his pals often hopped in a pickup truck and drove down 
rustic Ortega Highway to take in the scenery, sun and fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a nature lover and loved the area," Harper's father, Walt, said 
Thursday. "The last thing he told us was he wanted to go out there and watch 
the sun go down." 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after 20-year-old Forrest Harper spoke those words to his father, 
he and two companions were dead, victims of a traffic accident on Ortega 
Highway. The truck they were riding in spun out of control on the two-lane 
highway, flipped and skidded to a stop 175 yards from where it first left the 
road, California Highway Patrol Officer Ken Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other passengers were hospitalized for various injuries suffered in the 
Wednesday evening accident. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Jose Juan Perez, 22, of San Juan Capistrano, was the only person in 
the truck to escape injury, Daily said. Perez, a carpet cleaner, was arrested 
and booked into Orange County Central Jail, where he is being held on $25,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
He faces arraignment today in South County Municipal Court on felony drunk 
driving and gross vehicular manslaughter charges, Orange County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Daily said Perez was driving toward San Juan Capistrano about three miles east 
of Interstate 5 at an undetermined rate of speed when the truck veered across 
the highway, struck a steep dirt embankment and tumbled to a stop. There were 
no skid marks that would indicate Perez was trying to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
All five passengers were thrown from the truck, Daily said, but the three young 
men sitting in the truck bed were the ones to die. 
</P>
<P>
The other passengers had been sitting in the cab, which had been customized and 
did not have a roof. The driver was the only person wearing a seat belt, Daily 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of two of the dead men remained unconfirmed Thursday. They had 
been pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, Miguel Angel Rodriguez Perez, 26, and Rafael Granados Gomes, 22, were 
taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center for treatment of injuries. 
Harper died an hour later of massive head injuries, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was treated for moderate cuts and abrasions and released, hospital 
spokeswoman Nancy Gasho said. Granados was admitted with a head injury with 
concussion and lacerations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Daily said that officers found empty beer cans in Perez's truck but that they 
did not appear to have been opened recently. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Harper said the truck belonged to one of the unidentified dead men. That 
man, whom Walt Harper knew only as Jose, was his son's best friend and business 
partner. The pair had been doing odd jobs together for several months in the 
San Juan Capistrano area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were building themselves quite a business," said Dianne Harper, Forrest's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in their neat Del Obispo Street apartment, Dianne Harper choked back 
tears as she talked about Forrest, the couple's only son, who came late in 
their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited 18 years for that boy," she said. "I still can't believe he's gone."

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTES / MARTIN BECK;

CHAPMAN IS A PAIN IN THE NET TO RIVERSIDE'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM

<P>
Regardless of its national ranking, the UC Riverside women's volleyball team 
seems to have trouble when it plays Chapman in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Chapman defeated Riverside -- then ranked No. 1 in the NCAA's 
Division II -- in five games at the Hutton Center. Later in the season, the 
Panthers lost twice at Riverside, including a match that decided a playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Chapman did it again, winning at home over second-ranked 
Riverside in five games. The victory came almost a week after Chapman opened 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season by getting swept at home by No. 
5 Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But defeating two National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics teams -- The 
Master's College and Cal Baptist -- last weekend apparently recharged the 
Panthers, who are 16-9, 1-1 in the conference and ranked 13th in the latest 
NCAA poll. Chapman was led by Debi Waller, who had 30 kills and 17 digs, and 
Rena Strange, who had 18 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that we were a much better team than that," Chapman Coach Mary Cahill 
said, referring to the loss to Cal Poly Pomona. "This helps a lot. It will give 
the girls a little more confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they can play together and beat a good team." 
</P>
<P>
No one got a hole-in-one at the Chapman Athletic Foundation Golf Tournament 
Monday, so no one went home with a Honda or Dodge from the Goodwin car 
dealership in Fullerton or $10,000 from Orange National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the event raised a big chunk of money for the college's athletic 
scholarship fund, Chapman Athletic Director Dave Currey said. The final figure 
has not been totaled, he said, but the major sponsor, First American Title 
Insurance Co., presented $10,000 and 19 other corporate sponsors gave $1,500 
each so the figure may be close to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big victory, as we say," Currey said. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was won by the foursome of Chapman baseball coach Mike Weathers 
and boosters Jack Brushert, John Baker and Craig Kuhsc, which shot 59 on the 
Newport Beach Country Club course. A group which included former Dallas Cowboy 
kicker Efren Herrera finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Conference championship: Southern California College cross-country runner 
Sherri Hall, a 39-year-old mother of two, will attempt to win her second Golden 
State Athletic Conference championship in three years Saturday at Bonelli Park 
in Pomona. 
</P>

HE'S PACIFIC'S CENTER OF MEDICAL ATTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CURT CRANDALL, WHO WILL SNAP THE BALL AGAINST CAL STATE 
FULLERTON SATURDAY, HAS HAD SURGERY SEVEN TIMES SINCE SPRING OF 1988. 
</P>

<P>
Curt Crandall has bounced around the University of the Pacific's depth chart 
for 2 1/2 years, but he has been No. 1 on the Tigers' medical charts throughout 
his college football career. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall, who will start at center when Pacific plays Cal State Fullerton in 
Santa Ana Stadium Saturday, has been under the knife more than a linen napkin. 
</P>
<P>
Since the spring of 1988, the former Estancia High School and Orange Coast 
College lineman has had surgery seven times to repair a variety of ailments. He 
has been a fixture in the Pacific training room, much like the whirlpool tub. 
</P>
<P>
"He's given our doctoral staff a lot of reps," Tiger Coach Walt Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
When Crandall says he has been fairly healthy this season, he's not knocking on 
wood -- he's pounding it with both fists. He knows that, at any time, those 
knee ligaments could snap or that shoulder could pop out of the socket. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he makes it through this season without adding to his classic scar 
collection, he'll probably be back on the cutting edge in December, undergoing 
one more operation to repair a nagging shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
Eight is enough as far as Crandall is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how many times you go through surgery, it always gets worse," said 
Crandall, an All-Sea View League center at Estancia in 1985. "I feel a little 
more comfortable with it, but I hate needles and I hate going under 
(anesthesia). When you wake up, you're shaking in pain." 
</P>
<P>
For 12 years, through Junior All-American leagues, junior high school, high 
school and junior college, Crandall played football with little pain. He had 
never suffered a serious injury or had an operation until he transferred to 
Pacific in the spring of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Crandall has been the sultan of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
It started when school doctors, conducting a routine physical, discovered a 
hernia in Crandall's abdominal region. He underwent surgery to repair the 
hernia and couldn't train for several weeks before spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall was fit enough to earn a starting offensive tackle position, but in 
the last scrimmage of the spring, he twisted his left knee. Crandall didn't 
think the injury was serious, but the knee swelled during the summer, and a 
Newport Beach doctor discovered torn cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery No. 2 caused Crandall to miss the first two weeks of practice for the 
1988 season, but he was able to regain his starting job. Three weeks into the 
season, though, Crandall twisted the knee again and tore more cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery No. 3 knocked him out for the remainder of the season, and Crandall 
used 1988 as a redshirt year. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall, who was switched to center when Harris took over the program in 1989, 
made it through spring practice unscathed and almost made it through the 1989 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 11th game of a 12-game season, Crandall fell on the artificial turf 
at Hawaii and tore ligaments in his right thumb. Surgery No. 4 put his hand in 
a cast for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the thumb surgery, doctors performed arthroscopic surgery on 
Crandall's left shoulder to repair torn cartilage and on his right shoulder to 
scrape inflammation off a joint. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as Crandall was preparing for practice last spring, doctors discovered 
torn cartilage in his right knee and performed surgery No. 7. That knocked 
Crandall out of spring drills and back to third on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall spent the summer in Stockton rehabilitating his knee, and recaptured 
his starting job in the third game of this season. The Tigers are struggling at 
1-4, but if Crandall can make it through the season in one piece, he'll 
consider the year a success. 
</P>
<P>
"After about the fourth surgery, the coaches started getting frustrated and I 
was getting frustrated with myself," said Crandall, a 6-foot-2, 245-pound 
senior. "It really was getting a little old. But it's nice to play a season 
without too many problems." 
</P>
<P>
Crandall believes all the injuries have made him mentally tougher because he 
has learned to play with pain. Last season, his shoulder popped out of joint 
almost every week, but Crandall remained on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"You just grit your teeth and bide your time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, none of the injuries has been career threatening, and Crandall 
doesn't believe he'll have problems walking or getting out of bed when he turns 
35. All of his knee injuries involved lateral meniscus cartilage, not the more 
critical anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little worried about what will happen later in life, but I don't think 
there will be any major effects," Crandall said. "Tearing cartilage isn't too 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
But one might wonder about Crandall's priorities. He's 22, he'll graduate with 
a degree in business next spring and he's engaged to be married next fall. He 
admits he has virtually no chance of playing professional football and is more 
concerned about cracking the work force, not the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Is playing this sport worth all the pain, the injuries, the surgeries and the 
rehabilitations? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," Crandall said. "I love football. It's in my blood." 
</P>
<P>
And vice versa.

SURVEY SHOWS LACK OF BEGINNERS WITH BASIC WORK SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Employers in Orange County's blue-collar and service industries are having 
difficulty attracting experienced workers and are finding that many entry-level 
job applicants lack basic work and education skills. 
</P>
<P>
That was the conclusion of a countywide job survey released Thursday by the 
Orange County, Santa Ana and Anaheim Private Industry councils and the state 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
The survey said employers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire 
beginning workers with computer knowledge and with the ability to speak and 
write clearly and follow written instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 325 employers in 25 job categories showed that the number of 
unskilled and semi-skilled positions in those businesses is expected to 
increase in the county through 1992, despite growing evidence of a national 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
While the survey covered occupations as divergent as auto mechanics and medical 
assistants, desk clerks and plumbers, it found that most of the growth will be 
in business and personal service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for restaurant cooks is expected to have the highest percentage growth 
of any job category -- up 25% for an increase of 1,588 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Employers have "great difficulty" finding experienced auto mechanics and auto 
body repair workers and report a shortage of people willing to work as 
nighttime hotel desk clerks, retail cashiers and security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Employers said they had at least "some difficulty" finding experienced and 
inexperienced dental and medical assistants, licensed vocational nurses and 
pest control technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs that are relatively easy to fill, respondents said, include those for 
electronic assemblers, shipping clerks and draftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
One of the county's slowest-growing job categories, the survey found, is for 
electronics assemblers. While consumer electronics makers projected some growth 
in hiring, computer and defense firms generally projected flat hiring or even 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The findings came as no surprise to those who follow the county's job trends. 
The county's manufacturing industry has been shrinking for years while the 
service industry is growing. 
</P>
<P>
"We found, as expected, that it backed up our intuitive understanding of the 
market," said Margo West, senior analyst for the project and manager of 
planning for the Orange County Private Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
The survey is considered a valuable planning tool -- its primary use will be to 
assist private and government-financed job training programs in determining 
what types of classes to offer and what skills to stress. 
</P>
<P>
"And private employers want it for the wage information and the job growth 
predictions," West said. "They are the most current and most localized figures 
now available." 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, which queried both large and small employers, the 
fastest-growing job categories in the county for the next two years will 
include retail sales, with 5,159 new jobs by 1992, up 13.4%; cashiers, 4,015 
new jobs, up 21.2%; bookkeeping and accounting clerks, 2,769 jobs, up 11.3%; 
sales representatives, excluding those for manufacturers of scientific material 
and equipment, 2,162 new jobs, up 19.9%, and private security guards and 
watchmen, 1,594 jobs, up 20.6%.

Gilbert P. Hyatt battled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for 20 years and 
built up a case history of more than 10,000 pages before the agency finally 
gave him a patent in July for inventing the computer on a chip. 
</P>
<P>
And now they've lost part of his patent application file. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Weidenfeld, director of public affairs for the patent office, said Thursday 
the office is searching for three thick files containing hundreds of pages 
related to the processing of Hyatt's seven applications for a patent on the 
computer on a chip, or microprocessor, which made possible a wide range of 
electronic gadgets -- from personal computers to VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
The patent office has a case history accompanying the application which led to 
the patent issuance, but the missing files contain information from previous 
related applications which would be needed in case Hyatt's patent is challenged 
in court, Weidenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the missing files is Hyatt's original application, Serial No. 101,881, 
filed on Dec. 28, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no serious damage at all," said Hyatt, who has kept a complete copy of 
the litigation. "It adds a little to the romance of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks, the agency has been conducting an office-by-office search 
for the files, which have been missing for two months, Weidenfeld said. The 
files could be in the main record room or in one of several warehouses that the 
patent office maintains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not at all unusual for the patent office to lose files from time to time, 
especially those for cases that have been at the patent office for many years," 
said Gary Hecker, a patent lawyer with Hecker &amp; Harriman in Los Angeles. 
"My guess is it will make it troublesome for people who want to evaluate the 
patent's validity." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ladra, a patent attorney with the firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich 
&amp; Rosati in Palo Alto, said he has been attempting to get the entire file 
for several weeks without success. Ladra represents computer company clients 
who are interested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This couldn't hurt Hyatt because under law anything missing is presumed to go 
in his favor," Ladra said. "It's not good news for anyone who wants to 
challenge the patent." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the patent office has received 30 written requests for the complete 
file history, Weidenfeld said. Patent search service firms also report a 
backlog of orders for the case.

KEATING'S LAWYERS ASK FEDERAL COURT TO REDUCE BAIL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: ATTORNEYS FOR THE FORMER HEAD OF LINCOLN S&amp;L'S PARENT FIRM SAY THE 
$5-MILLION BAIL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>

<P>
Former thrift owner Charles H. Keating Jr., after exhausting appeals in the 
state courts, sought a court order Thursday in federal court here to reduce or 
lift the $5-million bail that is keeping him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Keating, who was indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud, 
said in the petition that the high bail set at a Sept. 18 hearing violates the 
U.S. Constitution's ban on excessive bail. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that the Los Angeles Superior Court's decision to keep 
Keating's bail at $5 million was not supported by any evidence and that two of 
three co-defendants "charged with identical crimes received bail 50 times lower 
than Keating's." 
</P>
<P>
They contend that Keating is not a flight risk, poses no danger to public 
safety, cannot meet the bail and cannot exercise his constitutional rights to 
due process and right to counsel while in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The case was assigned to U.S. District Court Judge John G. Davies, who had not 
set a hearing or made any decision by 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, 66, is the former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, 
which owned Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. The company filed for 
bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, and regulators seized Lincoln the next 
day. Regulators estimate that Lincoln's failure will cost U.S. taxpayers more 
than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the others are accused of defrauding more than 17,000 people out of 
nearly $200 million through the sale of American Continental debt securities at 
Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches during a two-year period ending in 
early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the small investors were Lincoln depositors who claim they bought the 
bonds because of representations that the securities were safe and insured by 
the federal government. Those bonds are now worthless. Both the company and the 
S&amp;L are in the process of being liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the co-defendants -- Judy J. Wischer, former American Continental 
president, and Robin S. Symes and Ray C. Fidel, both former Lincoln presidents 
-- have pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment against Keating and his co-defendants is the first criminal 
action to be filed in the wake of the collapse of Keating's financial empire. 
</P>
<P>
When the charges were unsealed last month, Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner 
set the high bail on Keating and $1-million bail each on the co-defendants. 
Klausner later reduced Wischer's bail to $200,000 and Symes and Fidel's bail to 
$100,000 each, and they posted bonds and were released. 
</P>
<P>
But Klausner said the seriousness of the charges -- the defendants face a 
maximum of 10 years in jail -- and the fear that Keating might flee warranted 
the continued high bail on Keating. Both the state Court of Appeal and the 
state Supreme Court refused to review the ruling.

GRADCO SYSTEMS, PLENUM INC. PREPARE FOR PROXY FIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of a shareholders' proxy fight, officials from Gradco Systems Inc. 
and a New York City publishing company that is trying to oust Gradco's 
management prepared to wage a last-minute battle of the hotel hospitality 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum Publishing Inc. and Gradco entertained shareholders Thursday in separate 
hospitality suites on the ninth floor of the Panache Club at the Hotel Le 
Meridien in Newport Beach. At 10 a.m. today, the two sides will take their 
proxy battle downstairs for Gradco's annual shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco is an Irvine-based manufacturer of sorters for office copiers and 
computer printer products. Plenum is a small New York publisher of technical 
journals that owns 9.4% of Gradco's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum Chairman Martin E. Tash arrived in Newport Beach Wednesday with a 
contingent of supporters to meet with shareholders and seek support for 
Plenum's proposed slate of candidates for Gradco's board. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a long day tomorrow," Tash said, "the culmination of a very 
hectic fight." 
</P>
<P>
Keith B. Stewart, Gradco's chairman, is also wooing supporters for the 
company's proposed slate of directors, including reserving a VIP suite at the 
hotel. Newton Lee, Gradco's corporate secretary, wouldn't comment on 
management's strategy for the annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum went public with its proxy fight in August after Stewart abruptly 
postponed Gradco's annual meeting on learning that Tash and Plenum had planned 
to nominate their own slate of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum filed a lawsuit in August alleging that Stewart and management tried to 
misappropriate company assets by awarding themselves warrants to buy shares in 
the company's profitable Gradco Japan subsidiary at below-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Stewart has written letters to shareholders contending that the 
transaction was necessary to persuade Japanese financiers to invest in the 
subsidiary. He has also offered to boost the value of Gradco's stock by 
spinning off the company's unprofitable printer systems subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco officials have contended that the company is better run by its current 
management, arguing that Tash is unfamiliar with the company's technology. 
</P>
<P>
Tash, in turn, has said that the directors he has chosen are experienced 
managers who would run the company responsibly and enhance shareholders' value.

<P>
EECO Inc., the computer parts manufacturer that filed for bankruptcy protection 
earlier this year, reported Thursday that two of its shareholders have filed a 
class-action lawsuit against company directors and certain past and present 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleges that EECO published false and 
misleading reports concerning the company's operating and financial problems 
between Dec. 21, 1987, and May 2, 1990, EECO said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the suit alleges that the company's published 
reports violated federal securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
The statement did not name the shareholders who filed the suit. EECO officials 
did not return phone calls. Attorneys for the plaintiffs also could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement, EECO Chairman Robert B. Bonney said that the lawsuit "is 
without merit and that the defendants intend to vigorously contest the suit." 
The Santa Ana company was not named as a defendant in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
EECO, a maker of electronic key pads, electromechanical switches and hotel 
computer systems, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in May.

If you've been in the vicinity of the South Coast Plaza mall lately, you've 
probably noticed banners hanging from light poles on all borders, proclaiming 
the "Festival of Britain." 
</P>
<P>
And well may you may wonder: "What is this Festival of Britain? A travel-agency 
promotion, a fish-and-chips sale at the mall or what?" 
</P>
<P>
If, however, you are one of more than 300,000 Southlanders on the festival 
mailing list, by now you have received a festival program and ticket 
information booklet, and have read that numerous arts and entertainment events 
and assorted amusements constitute this Festival of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
But that first impression wasn't incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
A good portion of the festival -- and in fact its raison d'etre -- is indeed a 
mall fish-and-chips sale to the nth power, to wit, "the largest British 
consumer goods promotion ever staged in the United States," according to the 
organizers. And the retail promotion is based exclusively at South Coast Plaza, 
whose idea the whole thing was in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa City Council members were so impressed at the revenue-generating 
potential of this two-week event -- which officially begins today (though some 
of the arts events already are finished, and others won't start for a while 
yet) -- that they voted in June to kick in $400,000 to help promote it. 
</P>
<P>
Their reasoning: South Coast Plaza officials are targeting for $20 million in 
sales per week at the mall during this event, a projected 50% increase over 
average weekly sales during 1989. And via the city's percentage of those 
millions of Andrew Jacksons passing over sales counters, council members hope 
to recoup all or more of their contribution. 
</P>
<P>
BritFest organizers are worried, though, that the arts and entertainment 
component is not receiving enough attention on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
They note that they've set up a separate nonprofit agency to support and 
promote these programs, which range from performances by the reconstituted 
D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to a weekend of readings in Fullerton featuring the 
tiny but ambitious Poets Reading Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they are doling out nearly $300,000 in grants to the various 
presenting and performing groups to help pay for many events that clearly would 
not have existed otherwise. And, the festival is fostering a greater degree of 
interaction among a wider variety of local arts groups than has been seen 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the question nags: 
</P>
<P>
Do these events signal a new era of sophistication for Orange County arts, or 
are they the '90s marketing equivalent of the organ grinder's monkey, who 
delights passersby with his antics, all the while collecting dimes for his 
master? 
</P>
<P>
Officials argue that there is a complete division between the commercial and 
artistic aspects of the Festival of Britain. Yet the program lists exhibits 
taking place in the mall itself -- conveniently located within a credit card's 
throw of many fine participating merchants -- right next to those at the 
Performing Arts Center, South Coast Repertory, Muckenthaler Cultural Center and 
other actual arts venues. 
</P>
<P>
The not-so-subtle invitation to the public? After you've gone to the Center or 
SCR, stop into the mall for the "Robes of the Realm" show or the "British 
Design 1790-1990" exhibition. And as long as you're there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Let's make one thing clear. There's nothing objectionable to commercial 
sponsorship of arts events. Such underwriting can help expose more people to 
theater, music, art and dance than those who can afford to pay $10, $20, $30 or 
more for tickets to independently organized events. But there's a line between 
sponsorship of a true arts festival -- where, in my book, the primary 
motivating force is support and promotion of the arts -- and hucksterism, where 
entertainment is tacked on to a retail promotion as a lure for shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it's not all that important -- though it's certainly true -- that 
many of the key events included under the Festival of Britain umbrella would 
have taken place anyway, festival or not. (Among them: Newport Harbor Art 
Museum's retrospective on British sculptor Tony Cragg, the D'Oyly Carte 
engagement, SCR's West Coast premiere of David Hare's "The Secret Rapture," the 
Grove Shakespeare Festival production of Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being 
Earnest," the Laguna Art Museum's "Pursuit of the Marvelous" exhibit, and the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society's London Classical Players concert. 
Officials at those organizations all said the programs were under consideration 
and would have taken place -- if, perhaps, not at precisely the same time of 
year -- had South Coast Plaza mall officials never dreamed up the Festival of 
Britain.) 
</P>
<P>
What is important to the public at large is that a healthy number of British 
arts and entertainment offerings will be available essentially at the same 
time. Another positive side effect: smaller groups that normally have to 
promote themselves with cheaply printed flyers slipped under windshield wipers 
now are beneficiaries of a major marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our name and our picture in the program -- our whole gig is being read 
all over Southern California," beamed Michael Logue, founder of Poets Reading 
Inc. "We are on mailing lists that we would have no chance of acquiring on our 
own. This is gold for (our and similar) organizations." 
</P>
<P>
But would there even have been an arts festival without the mutton sale at 
South Coast Plaza? (And, make no mistake, this is South Coast Plaza's game. One 
arts participant, not based in Costa Mesa, said he asked festival officials 
about including merchants in his city in the retail promotion, and was told 
that South Coast Plaza has exclusive rights to all commercial activities. Why? 
Is it because South Coast Plaza is owned by C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, the 
company and family that, having been the prime forces behind the construction 
of the Performing Arts Center and South Coast Rep, has the best connections 
with the highest-profile Orange County arts groups?) 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, the city of Costa Mesa never would have voted $400,000 -- nearly 
half the arts component's total budget of $850,000 to $900,000 -- if the only 
thing going on was arts. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: At the same meeting that the council approved money for the Festival of 
Britain, it effectively killed a plan to form a new agency to provide millions 
of dollars for arts and tourism within the city. 
</P>
<P>
Plus: The council recently voted down a request (introduced, by the way, by one 
of the council members) for $20,000 to pay the Pacific Symphony to perform for 
county supervisors and various VIPs at black-tie opening ceremonies for the new 
John Wayne Airport terminal. Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis condemned the 
expenditure as being too elitist before siding with the majority to can it. 
</P>
<P>
But along comes South Coast Plaza and the Festival of Britain and -- BING! -- 
the Pacific Symphony gets $20,000 to support its "Royal Gala Concert" and 
black-tie dinner, for which tickets are $250 per person. 
</P>
<P>
BritFest officials say it's important that all the art events be recognized 
collectively -- and hailed as a festival -- rather than individually because 
these two weeks mark an important step forward in the development of the 
still-young Orange County arts scene, and without a festival imprimatur, the 
impact of all this might be considerably lessened. 
</P>
<P>
In other words: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to lump together a bunch of 
mostly exciting entertainments, even though they add to the outrageous fortune 
of only one landlord, or to take arms against a sea of haughty boasts, and by 
opposing, risk ending them? 
</P>
<P>
I'll be looking forward to many of the events coming our way in the days and 
weeks ahead. But as to launching a cheer for Orange County's first great arts 
festival? I'll keep waiting, thanks, for one that's not stamped "Made 
exclusively for South Coast Plaza."

A PERFECTLY FRIGHTFUL PRODUCTION OF A HALLOWEEN CLASSIC

The mood is set even before the show begins. 
</P>
<P>
In the darkened theater, on shadowy multilevel tiers, stand leafless trees with 
grasping, claw-like branches. Storytellers in 19th-Century dress weave their 
way into the audience and regale wide-eyed young theatergoers with scary tales 
of "Old Scratch" and ghostly doings. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a mist creeps over the trees, the theater goes dark and the stage 
resounds with crashing thunder and screams of fright. 
</P>
<P>
At the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach, the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre is 
presenting its spirited production of the Halloween classic, Washington 
Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." It's an auspicious start for Joe 
Lauderdale, the Youth Theatre's new director. 
</P>
<P>
The self-assured cast, ages 13 to 19, does a pleasing job with the comedic 
thriller, adroitly delivering both dialogue and choreography. David Edwards' 
sound design and Robert L. Smith's moody set and lighting inspire shivers. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Stauffacher, 19, the pompous, greedy and cowardly Ichabod Crane, 
comically makes up for his handsome face with eccentric mannerisms in movement 
and speech. Costume designer Brigitte Harper helps with a too-short black suit 
and frock coat to create illusory gawkiness. 
</P>
<P>
The other principals -- Peter Kreder as Ichabod's rival, Brom, and Bronwen 
Bitetti as vain Katrina, who toys with their affections -- provide humorous 
moments. The storytellers, who serve as both narrators-in-concert and 
villagers, handle their multiple roles with confidence and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
A word of warning: A chase through the audience -- with Ichabod pursued by the 
pumpkin-toting Headless Horseman (sans horse) -- may seem tame to adult eyes, 
but it and other moments during this ghost story are too intense for some 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
At an early performance, there were periodic bouts of tears, and at least one 
anxious child had to take frequent lobby breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 At 606 Laguna Canyon Road tonight at 7:30; Saturday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; and 
Sunday at 2 p.m. Admission: $6 for adults, $4 for children 13 and under.

Three comedians, including local-boys-made-good Jerry Miner and Chris Verwiel, 
perform tonight at 8 at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center in a benefit for the 
Irvine-based Community Service Programs. 
</P>
<P>
Tom McGillen, an Improvisation favorite, headlines the event, which is to raise 
money for programs targeting child abuse, drug abuse, homeless youths and 
victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Once a doorman at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach, Miner now headlines comedy 
clubs nationwide and took first place at a recent comedy contest at the Irvine 
Improv. His observational material focuses on everyday experience, like the 
predatory instincts aroused when a group of friends confronts the last piece of 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Miner, thinking out loud: "Joe's already fat. Why's he looking at it?" 
</P>
<P>
Verwiel, a former Fullerton resident, also tours nationally. McGillen boasts 
extensive television credits. 
</P>
<P>
Community Services Programs is a nonprofit agency serving Orange County. Among 
other things, it provides shelter for troubled and runaway youth; assistance to 
victims and witnesses of crime; professional child abuse intervention, and 
cross-cultural education for Vietnamese families. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to tonight's show are $15 and can be purchased at the door.

Wary of giving the impression that they're flush with money now that private 
contributors have salvaged their season, officials of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival are beating the bushes for people to enter a fund-raising 
"walk-a-thon" on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-kilometer "Walk for William" is being sponsored by the GSF Guild along 
with a closet sale of costumes and props from various productions in the hope 
of raising about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
A similar combined event last year raised nearly $4,000, Grove artistic 
director Thomas F. Bradac said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The walk, which requires an entry fee of $20 for each participant, consists of 
four 2 1/2-mile laps. The route winds through the city; participants will 
receive a "Walk for William" T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also encouraging walkers to sign up sponsors to give money for each 
kilometer they walk," Grove spokeswoman Dede Ginter said. "People who do not 
wish to walk but want to show their support are urged to sponsor Tom. He's 
going to do the full 16 kilometers." 
</P>
<P>
After the walk, which steps off at 8 a.m. from the Festival Amphitheatre at 
12852 Main St., "we'll clean out Shakespeare's closet," Ginter said. "We'll be 
selling off handmade, one-of-a-kind costumes, props, masks and puppets." 
</P>
<P>
The closet sale is to last until 6 p.m. or until the closet is bare, whichever 
comes first, she said.

The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate campaign-contribution limits for 
California's gubernatorial election and other political contests next month. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment or recorded dissent, let stand a federal judge's 
ruling that threw out contribution limits imposed by California voters in 
Proposition 73 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling lets candidates for governor, other statewide posts and some 
local offices accept, until election day Nov. 6, contributions greater than the 
limits created in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73 barred anyone from contributing more than $1,000 to a particular 
candidate in a fiscal year.

SHOTS FIRED AT WEST HILLS COUPLE ON VENTURA FWY.; NEITHER INJURED

A West Hills couple escaped injury early today when their car was hit twice by 
gunshots fired from another vehicle on the westbound Ventura Freeway in 
Woodland Hills, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Rodriguez, 30, and her husband, Alex, 31, were heading home after 
visiting friends about 3 a.m. when they spotted two vehicles apparently racing 
each other near the Shoup Avenue off-ramp, Detective Joel Price said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the vehicles, described as a late-model red Ford Bronco, pulled in front 
of the couple's car and abruptly slowed, Price said. At the same time, the 
second vehicle, a late-model black Chevrolet Corvette, drove up next to the 
driver's side of the Rodriguezes' car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the two cars had boxed in the couple's car, the driver of the Corvette 
began shouting obscenities at Theresa Rodriguez, who was driving, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
As the couple tried to escape by getting off the freeway at Shoup, they saw a 
passenger in the Corvette fire a gun at them, police said. The couple also 
heard what they described as "a pop and a bang," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
The left rear tire began to go flat, and the couple pulled into a gasoline 
station to call police. Investigators found bullet holes in the driver's side 
and in one tire of the car but did not know what kind of gun the assailant 
used, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shots were fired, the two vehicles continued westbound on the freeway 
at high speed. Police said there were two men in each vehicle.

Five Japanese-American centenarians, who were interned during World War II, 
received $20,000 redress checks and a written apology from President Bush today 
during a ceremony in Little Tokyo.

<P>
"I feel very happy, and this is the happiest moment of my life," said Teru 
Noda, 100, of Lake View Terrace, who spoke through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Noda, who was "excluded" to the Manzanar camp during the war years, said she

funeral expenses.

"I don't know how to describe it, but I'm very, very happy about it," said Iwa 
Nishimura, 101, who also spoke through an interpreter. The other recipients 
were Tamaki Maruyama, 102, Toyosaburo Katayama, 100, and Uno Taketa, 100. 
</P>

John Dunne, U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division,

A motorist was killed by an accidental shot fired by a companion on the 
Foothill Freeway today less than an hour after another couple's car was 
peppered with gunfire in an attack on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The slain 19-year-old from Pomona at first was thought to have been killed in a 
random freeway shooting, as reported by his five Vietnamese companions, who had 
said they were asleep at the time of the 3:50 a.m. incident. 
</P>
<P>
But sheriffs said evidence later showed that the fatal bullet was fired through 
the rear of the driver's seat. The gun was not found. 
</P>
<P>
In the other incident, Theresa Rodriguez and her husband, Alex, were fired on 
about 3 a.m. by a passenger in one of two cars racing on the Ventura Freeway in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Rodriguez was driving north when one of the two cars, each containing 
two men, pulled in front of her car and suddenly slowed. One car then pulled 
alongside the couple's car, and its driver began yelling obscenities at the 
woman. As she attempted to drive off the freeway, the car's passenger fired 
gunshots at her auto. Neither of the Rodriguezes was hit.

Foreign Minister Ali Bozer resigned today in an apparent rift over his virtual 
exclusion by President Turgut Ozal from Turkey's policy over the Persian Gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I have resigned because I could not have continued my job with speculation 
about myself," Bozer told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said he handed in his resignation two weeks ago after returning from a visit 
to Washington and New York with Ozal. 
</P>
<P>
Bozer was known to have been dismayed when he was excluded from Ozal's White 
House meeting with President Bush last month. Foreign Ministry officials noted 
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III attended the talks, during which 
Ozal vowed to honor the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq.

Two former East German espionage agents have been charged with being the case

scandal, officials said today.

The public prosecutor said Stefan E., 36, and Guenther N., 54, were arrested 
Wednesday and charged Thursday with directing the work of double agent Klaus 
Kuron. 
</P>
<P>
Ten suspected spies have been arrested this week after Kuron, a senior Bonn 
counterintelligence officer, admitted that he had passed secrets to East 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said in a statement that Stefan and Guenther worked for the 
foreign espionage section of East Berlin's Ministry for State Security, or 
Stasi.

The government said today it is lifting night curfews clamped on black 
townships around Johannesburg last month to curb factional fighting that 
claimed almost 800 lives. 
</P>
<P>
But Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok warned the restrictions could be 
re-imposed if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The government imposed the curfews and sent army and police reinforcements into 
seven townships Sept. 25 in operation "Iron Fist" after weeks of clashes, 
mainly between supporters of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and of 
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party.

A dog named after a fictional British flying ace, Biggles, narrowly escaped 
death in the Persian Gulf crisis when he was trapped in a stranded airliner, 
rescued by flight attendants and smuggled to safety in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The West Highland terrier was recovering at London's Heathrow Airport today 
after flying in from Amman on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"He must be one of the luckiest dogs alive. He seems like a natural survivor," 
a British Airways spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Biggles was on his way to Malaysia to join his British owner when a jumbo jet 
was stranded in Kuwait by the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers and crew were ordered off the plane, but Biggles was left inside 
the cargo hold in a cage. 
</P>
<P>
The crew found him three days later, and two flight attendants took him to 
their hotel, naming him Biggles after the flying ace in a series of British 
boys' books. 
</P>
<P>
But Biggles' adventures were not over. The crew took the dog with them overland 
to Baghdad and eventually smuggled him to Jordan with a group of refugees.

Rebels have launched a two-pronged attack on Kabul, and Afghan government 
troops are fighting back with air and artillery strikes, officials and 
diplomats said today. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas belonging to the Hezb-i-Islami party of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar were 
spearheading the assault on the capital from two directions, a government 
statement said, adding that so far 70 rebels have been killed.

Aircraft were streaking across the Kabul skies and loud explosions shook 
buildings, witnesses said.

Moujahedeen sources in Pakistan said the Kabul fighting began Thursday morning 
and was concentrated 10 to 13 miles southeast of the city between Chahar Wazgai 
and Sarighar.

Japan's Asahi Breweries, faced with a steep drop in the share price of Elders 
IXL, today revised a $787-million deal to buy a major slice of the world's 
fourth-largest brewer. 
</P>
<P>
Asahi, Japan's second-largest brewer, still plans to buy 19.9% of Elders, but 
it will not buy all the shares from Elders' debt-laden parent, Harlin Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Asahi still intends to acquire 19.9% of Elders, it plans to acquire 
fewer shares from Harlin and to buy the balance on the market in due course," 
Harlin, which owns 56% of Elders, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic structure of the original transaction will be preserved," Harlin 
said. "In particular, the transaction will have the effect of stabilizing 
Harlin's financial position." 
</P>
<P>
A sharp rally in Elders' share price today to $1 on a large turnover of almost 
4 million shares prompted speculation that Asahi may already have been 
accumulating in the open market.

BOND PRICES PULL DOW UP 32.92 POINTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street stocks closed sharply higher today, buoyed by rising bond prices, 
lower oil prices and bargain-hunting by investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.92 points to end the week at 2,398.02, 
cutting its loss for the week to 112.62 points. 
</P>
<P>
The rally reversed a three-day trend in which the 30-share average fell more 
than 150 points. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a heavy 187.94 million shares, 
against 180.06 million Thursday. Leading issues outgained losers by 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were encouraged by Treasury bond prices that rose by more than a 
point with yields falling to around 8.97%, and by oil prices that dipped below 
$40 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the technical rally, brokers said the economic and financial news 
offered little evidence of lasting relief from the recession worries that have 
plagued the market for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in early trading today amid further negative reports on the 
nation's economy and unconfirmed reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
said he may pull out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which plunged $9, was up $4.43 per 
$1,000 in face value at midday. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, fell 
to 8.97% from 9.06% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the wholesale price index of finished goods 
jumped 1.6% in September, propelled by surging energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
Negative news had been widely anticipated from the index, which provides a 
measure of inflationary pressures in the distribution pipelines of the economy. 
Still, brokers said, the figure served as a damper on whatever hopes existed 
for a relaxation of the Federal Reserve's credit policy any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.1% in September 
but cautioned that the sales were artificially inflated by the soaring cost of 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the inflation outbreak, coupled with a relatively positive report 
on retail sales, deepens the dilemma facing the Federal Reserve. The central 
bank has been under pressure to lower interest rates to spur the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Any indication the Fed might ease rates tends to spur the bond market, since 
lower interest rates translate to higher prices for fixed-income securities.

The machinists' union at Northwest Airlines said today it is considering a 
proposal by Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi that it choose between laying off 
workers or taking a 10% pay cut for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi, whose airline faces soaring fuel costs, made the proposal Wednesday 
night to Guy Cook, president of the 24,400-member International Assn. of 
Machinists at Northwest, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Cook generally confirmed the report but said the number of layoffs is "up in 
the air." He said figures of "10%, 15% and 20% were all mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
"Another possible scenario is management paying attention to some areas to cut 
costs," Cook said. "I have mentioned that to Checchi." 
</P>
<P>
Northwest employs about 44,000 workers, about 16,500 in Minnesota. A 15% cut 
would amount to 6,600 jobs.

A former Citibank manager pleaded guilty to embezzling $3 million by writing 
165 unauthorized bank checks to buy items ranging from a country home to rare 
artwork and expensive jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Schafer, 29, who managed the corporate trust services department at the 
bank's Wall Street office, entered the plea Thursday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Schafer, who began her job at Citibank three years ago, admitted in court to 
embezzling the funds between December, 1987, and last June. Many of the 
unauthorized checks were made payable to businesses where Schafer went on 
spending sprees to buy a BMW car, an expensive house in Kansas City, Mo., and 
other luxuries. 
</P>

She faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine or twice

Unseeded New Zealand kept the upsets rolling in the Dunhill Cup today and Japan 
ousted the French team that had earlier knocked the defending champion 
Americans out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese blanked France 3-0 as the French team of Marc Farry, Emmanuel 
Dussart and Jean Van de Velde never showed the kind of play that helped them 
eliminate the top-seeded United States in Thursday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Owen and Greg Turner won bogey battles at the notorious 17th of the Old 
Course, the Road Hole, helping lead New Zealand to a 2-1 victory over 
seventh-seeded Wales. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Ireland reached the semifinals for the third year in a row with a 
2-1 victory over sixth-seeded Spain. 
</P>
<P>
British bookmakers made Ireland the favorite to win the cup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Satoshi Higashi, Yoshinori Kaneko and Hajime Meshiai, last year's 
runners-up and seeded eighth, play fifth-seeded England in Saturday's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Even without top-ranked Nick Faldo, sitting out the tournament with an injury, 
the English beat fourth-seeded Scotland 2-1, as Mark James edged Sam Torrance 
by one stroke in the day's final match. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, which eliminated second-seeded Australia in the first round, next 
plays Ireland, the highest-seeded squad left in the $1 million medal-match play 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese trio, which calls itself "Team Jumbo" after fellow golfer and 
mentor Jumbo Ozaki, never was in trouble against France on a warm, breezy day. 
</P>
<P>
Higashi beat Farry 71-80, the Frenchman taking a triple-bogey 7 on the second 
hole and falling from there. Kaneko beat Dussart 71-75, taking the lead for 
good with a birdie-3 on the third. And Meshiai completed the sweep with a 70-72 
victory over Van de Velde, wrapping it up with two birdies on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
At Cely, France, Cathy Gerring shot a second straight 69 today and held the 
lead after two rounds of the LPGA World Championship, while Japan's Ayako 
Okamoto surged into contention with a 6-under-par 66. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring, one of 13 U.S. golfers in the 16-woman field, was at 138, 6-under-par 
and one stroke ahead of Okamoto. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Americans, Betsy King and Danielle Ammaccapane, were tied for third 
at 141.

<P>
Three players on the No. 5 Tennessee football team were suspended indefinitely 
today after allegations they sexually assaulted a female student in the 
athletic dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Johnny Majors identified the three players as starting defensive end Kacy 
Rodgers, reserve linebacker Dewayne Dotson and reserve running back Keith 
Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Phil Scheurer said the complaint was filed 
this morning alleging that the sexual assault took place sometime between 10:30 
p.m. Thursday and 2 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure due process and protect the rights of both the complainant 
and the accused, details of the incident are not being released," Scheurer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is, however, considerable disagreement among the students about what 
actually occurred," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Scheurer said no criminal charges have been lodged. He said the woman has made 
a statement to campus police, as have the three players. 
</P>
<P>
Majors said he was embarrassed but was not suspending the players based on any 
judgment of their guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
They were suspended, he said, because of the seriousness of the allegations and 
"because there was a clear violation of team rules." 
</P>
<P>
The rule violated involves visitation hours by females in the dormitory. 
Visitation is allowed but not on Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
University President Lamar Alexander said the university "deeply regrets this." 
</P>
<P>
"We want the students and the state to know we take this very seriously," he 
said. "The second point, and this is very important, is that the students 
disagree considerably about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee plays No. 9 Florida on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
This is the latest in a string of off-field incidents involving Volunteer 
football players this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, four players -- starting cornerbacks Jeremy Lincoln and Floyd 
Miley and second-stringers defensive end Chris Mims and offensive guard Bernard 
Dafney -- allegedly confronted a fellow student who was in an argument with 
Lincoln's girlfriend. Mims allegedly broke the student's jaw, but no charges 
were filed.

Australia's Davis Cup captain said today that the clay court surface the United 
States plans to use in next month's final may not comply with the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The United States Tennis Assn. announced Thursday that it would use a red 
brick-dust surface to be imported from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But Australia's Neale Fraser said he is not satisfied the surface falls within 
the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The latest move follows the setting of disputed times for the matches to start 
and delays in announcing a surface, both of which Neale said exceeded 
International Tennis Federation deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the United States has gone for the trifecta," Fraser said. 
"First, they delayed announcing the surface. Secondly, they selected 
controversial starting times, and now thirdly they have to import the court 
surface from Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Davis Cup rules provide that the court surface must have been used in at least 
three tournaments in the 1990 men's Grand Prix circuit and be "in general use 
for tennis in the country where and when the match is held," according to 
Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser has asked Tennis Australia President Geoff Pollard to seek confirmation 
from the ITF that the nominated surface satisfies the "general use" 
requirement, given that it needs to be imported from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Australia said today that technically, American-style clay is different 
from European-style clay, but did not specify in which areas.

China has adopted a new ploy to recoup costs of the Asian Games held in Beijing 
-- require schoolchildren to buy the wilting flower displays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to buy them," said a student as he and his school friends took bunches 
of flowers home. 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren are required to buy pots of chrysanthemums, daisies and dahlias 
at the cost of about 30 cents. The flowers are sold on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million pots of flowers decorated Beijing during the games. 
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese were forced to buy bonds to pay for the games and some complained 
that police stopped cars outside the northern city of Tianjin to touch drivers 
for $1 contributions.

GERRY FAUST FINDS SERENITY AT AKRON; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING TENURE AT NOTRE DAME, THE 
COACH DISCOVERS THAT THE CROWDS ARE SMALLER, BUT THE REWARDS ARE GREATER, WITH 
THE DIVISION I-A ZIPS.

<P>
At Moeller High School in Cincinnati, Coach Gerry Faust and his players drew 
thousands of people to home games to watch the nation's most dominant prep 
football team play. Later, when Faust was at Notre Dame, a stadium crowd of at 
least 59,000 was guaranteed -- regardless of the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays Faust is lucky if he can get one-third of the seats filled at the 
Rubber Bowl, home to his University of Akron Zips. Although Faust probably 
couldn't fill the stadium's 35,000 seats if he gave tickets away, he finally is 
finding serenity as a college football coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great group of kids with a super attitude," said Faust, who takes his 
Zips (3-2-1) to Annapolis, Md., on Saturday to face the Naval Academy (2-3). 
"I'm really enjoying myself now." 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere surrounding Faust, in his fifth year at Akron, has not always 
been pleasant. When he left Moeller after the 1980 season to coach Notre Dame, 
Faust was supposed to carry the winning tradition to South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time he resigned after five years, Faust had the most losses of any 
football coach in school history, with a 30-26-1 record. After the Irish lost, 
58-7, to Miami in his last game there, a Sports Illustrated article described 
Faust as the man who left "Notre Dame's football program . . . in shambles." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't like to read or hear the things you hear about the coaching, but you 
have to learn to accept that," Faust said of the media attacks. "I wanted to 
win. Not because people were upset. I wanted to do it because I believed in the 
university and what it stood for." 
</P>
<P>
What Notre Dame followers could not accept were the two 5-6 seasons under 
Faust. In that time Notre Dame lost four straight times to Air Force -- its 
only losses to a service academy since dropping a game to Navy in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of success at Notre Dame, Faust received nine job offers after 
he left. He settled on Akron, a Division I-AA school that was looking for a 
well-known coach to engineer its transition to Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked forward to the challenge," he said. "After taking the job at Notre 
Dame, I realized I had a lot to learn. Looking back, I wasn't ready. I know how 
to deal with college kids now. Ten years ago, I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Zips -- Zippy the kangaroo is the mascot -- are 25-23-2 under Faust. Last 
year, in just its third year of I-A ball, Akron had a 6-4-1 record after two 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing better than we thought we would be doing. We have a long way to 
go, but we're pleased with the progress we've made," Faust said. "We eventually 
would like to get to the level of the Naval Academy, Syracuse, West Point and 
Boston College. The transition to I-A has been really tough." 
</P>
<P>
After coaching at an institution that pretty much sold itself, Faust has had to 
become a salesman to attract players. 
</P>
<P>
"We made great strides over the last couple of years, and the enthusiasm is a 
lot better in the community," he said. "You have to really work hard to get 
kids here, and I'm always out recruiting. But the work is paying off. Our kids 
have a great belief in each other."

Italian Formula One driver Alessandro Nannini lost part of his arm today in a 
helicopter crash near his family villa. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old driver for the Benetton-Ford team was taken to a hospital in 
Florence for emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Nannini lost his right forearm in the accident and doctors were trying to 
re-attach it, a spokesman at the CTO Hospital of Careggio said. 
</P>
<P>
Nannini's life was not in danger, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the helicopter crashed while preparing to land near the Nanninis' 
villa at Belriguardo, on the outskirts of Siena. 
</P>
<P>
Three others who were aboard the helicopter, including the pilot, were also 
injured. Their conditions were not serious, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA said the helicopter plunged to the ground from a 
height of about 75 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Nannini finished third, behind Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell, in the last 
championship race at Jerez, in Spain, moving to seventh place in the 
championship standings. 
</P>
<P>
Nannini has one victory in the 77 Grand Prix races he has entered since 1986.

In the world designed by Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti, there are no 
smoky rooms or steps to climb off stage. The decor is in jewel tones and there 
is a king-size bed, a large television screen, a videocassette recorder and 
Italian movie tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Those are among the particulars the famously particular tenor made with his 
reservations at the Blakely Hotel, where he will stay while here for a 
performance Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all his musical heart desires. Pavarotti also wants humidifiers in 
his room to keep his voice clear, large chairs with footstools in his dressing 
room and an electric golf cart to take him from the plane to the limousine and 
his dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
Pavarotti chose the Blakely from photographs his secretary made last summer.

2 LIVE CREW MEMBERS CITED FOR CONTEMPT;

Members of the controversial Miami rap group 2 Live Crew were cited for 
contempt of court today after all three of them showed up late for their 
obscenity trial. 
</P>
<P>
Luther Campbell was about 30 minutes late, and Christopher Wongwon showed up 
after him. When Mark Ross was not in court by 10 a.m., Broward County Circuit 
Judge June L. Johnson issued a bench warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
She then admonished Campbell and Wongwon to show up on time and cited them for 
contempt of court. Ross arrived about 10:30 a.m., about 90 minutes late -- 
before police could execute the bench warrant against him -- and told the judge 
that he had trouble organizing a car pool with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also cited him for contempt of court and told all three that their 
sentences for contempt will be withheld until after their trial, which has been 
in the jury selection phase since Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The three rappers are charged with giving an obscene performance at a 
Hollywood, Fla., nightclub in June, when they performed songs from their album 
"As Nasty as They Wanna Be," which a Broward County federal judge ruled was 
obscene. If convicted of the misdemeanor obscenity charge, each of the 
defendants faces a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
After the contempt issue, Johnson then went back to conducting a hearing into 
charges Thursday by the defense that Assistant State Atty. Pedro Dijols had 
used one of his peremptory challenges to illegally strike a young black man 
from the jury pool. 
</P>
<P>
Six people and three alternates must be selected to hear the case against the 
group. None has been selected, and Johnson has said she may sequester the jury 
because of pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
There were three blacks in the original 25 potential jurors who were being 
considered for jury duty in the case against the black rap group, and one had 
been excused for family reasons. 
</P>
<P>
When Dijols challenged Vernard Kinnel, defense lawyer Bruce Rogow cited a 
statute that prohibits the striking of a juror solely on the basis of race and 
demanded a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Dijols, a black Puerto Rican, said he wanted to strike Kinnel because he had 
said during questioning that he was a 2 Live Crew fan. 
</P>
<P>
Rogow said Kinnel, a truck driver who is in his late 20s, said he was not 
really a fan but that he had listened to the group on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent was obvious," Rogow said later. "He's young, black. He knows this 
kind of music, and he has an earring in his ear."

An unfinished piece of music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has been played, 
possibly for the first time, after a relative decided to auction off the work 
composed about 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Five students at the Royal College of Music on Thursday performed the 35 bars 
of the "Quintet in B Flat Major" for piano and wind instruments -- oboe, 
clarinet, basset horn and bassoon. 
</P>
<P>
"They are an unusual group of instruments, and I think the work might not have 
been completed because Mozart may have found it difficult to find musicians to 
play them," said Stephen Roe, director of manuscripts at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
The firm will auction the music Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The fragment took 1 1/4 minutes to perform and sounded complete, although it 
was only the opening of a work. 
</P>
<P>
Roe said the single sheet of music was on the same kind of paper Mozart was 
using in 1783. He said it was brought to one of their offices on the European 
continent by a member of the family who had preserved it and who asked not to 
be identified.

Actor Hume Cronyn got permission to build an apartment for live-in help after 
arguing that his wife, Oscar-winning actress Jessica Tandy, is ailing and that 
his eyesight is failing. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy, 81, and Cronyn, 79, were turned down in August for a zoning waiver but 
were approved Tuesday by the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"Old age is a hardship," Cronyn told the panel. "One that you'll be dealing 
with over the years." 
</P>
<P>
The apartment on their property would be for a driver or attendant, Cronyn 
said. He said the need had become more urgent since Tandy was hospitalized for 
a heart condition after surgery. Cronyn did not disclose the nature of her 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy, who won an Oscar for her role as an elderly woman who needed a chauffeur 
in "Driving Miss Daisy," has suffered from angina for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cronyn also said a driver may become necessary because his eyesight is failing. 
"I don't know how long we'll go on driving or looking after our place," he told 
the board.

PLAN TO PUT EATERY IN PICO HOUSE DRAWS FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: CHICANO ACTIVISTS AND OLVERA STREET MERCHANTS SAY $15-MILLION 
PROJECT THAT INCLUDES RESTAURANT WILL DISRUPT THE MEXICAN FLAVOR OF EL PUEBLO 
DE LOS ANGELES PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The southern portion of El Pueblo de Los Angeles park -- where the last Mexican 
governor of California built the city's first hotel -- is targeted for a 
$15-million revitalization program to upgrade an area that has been mostly 
unused for the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the ambitious project, which faces a final decision by the Los 
Angeles City Council within a month, is a French restaurant to be built in the 
Romanesque-style Pico House. The luxurious hotel was built in 1869 in what is 
now the northern end of downtown by Pio de Jesus Pico, who was governor of Alta 
California when it joined the Union after the Mexican War. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant -- intended to duplicate the opulent French eatery that was once 
in the hotel -- is seen as an anchor to the proposed collection of office 
space, shops and cultural exhibits designed to attract visitors to the place 
where Los Angeles was founded in 1781. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a terrific project where we can blend the commercial (use) with 
the culture of the area," said Bruce Phillips, president of the Santa 
Monica-based development firm that has proposed the project. 
</P>
<P>
But, when it comes to L.A.'s birthplace, things just aren't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of Chicano historians, activists and merchants on nearby Olvera 
Street has formed to oppose the project, arguing that it threatens to disrupt 
the Mexican flavor of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we allow commercial interests to run rampant in a publicly declared 
historical site?" asked Dr. Marta Lopez-Garza, a sociology professor. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents have promised to take their case to the public, beginning with a 
news conference today. On Sunday, they plan a petition-signing rally in front 
of the Pico House. 
</P>
<P>
The group opposes a restaurant in the Pico House, whether it be French, Mexican 
or something else. Instead, the historic building should be used as a museum of 
Mexican culture and art, the coalition says. A Mexican art gallery already is 
on the building's main floor. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents also contend that the four investors backing the project -- a 
group known as Old L.A. -- obtained extremely low rents through a lease 
agreement approved by the city's Parks and Recreation Commission. The lease 
provides for rents starting at $100,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants on Olvera Street pay much higher rentals, they say, adding that their 
tab is nearly $1 million paid annually to the city. "I think it's a sweetheart 
deal," said Vivien Bonzo, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The issues in the looming battle over the proposal, commonly referred to as the 
Pico-Garnier project, are similar to the outcries over the proposed upgrading 
of Olvera Street, across the Pueblo Plaza from the Pico-Garnier project. 
</P>
<P>
Some Latino insiders fear that the acrimonious public fight over Olvera Street, 
which has quieted down for the moment, could be repeated over the Pico-Garnier 
project. The fight over Olvera got so emotional at one point that Councilman 
Richard Alatorre and fellow council member Gloria Molina, who represented the 
area while in the state Assembly, got into a shouting match in a committee 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to do anybody any good to get into a bloodbath type of thing," 
said Deputy Mayor Ed Avila. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the southern portion of El Pueblo park, consisting principally 
of the Pico House, the Garnier Building, the Merced Theatre and the Masonic 
Hall, has been largely dormant while Olvera Street, the Mexican marketplace 
that was created out of an alley in 1930, flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, several renovation efforts failed either because of lack of 
financing or the maze of government agencies with jurisdiction over the park. 
Until last February, the park was governed by the city, the county and the 
state of California under a joint-powers agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But the arrangement proved cumbersome and the city agreed to take over control 
of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Some government efforts to upgrade the buildings were never completed. For 
example, the Garnier Building still awaits completion of major seismic 
rehabilitation work begun almost a decade ago. 
</P>

In 1984, the Old L.A. investors signed a 25-year lease with a 10-year option to 
develop the block. But the 1986 federal tax reform act took away some of the 
group's incentives and prompted new negotiations. Those talks resulted in an 
agreement earlier this year that gave Old L.A. a 25-year lease with an extended 
option of another 25 years. That agreement must be approved by the City Council 
for the project to move forward.

Phillips, head of the Santa Monica-based Grand American development firm, has 
met with project opponents over their concerns in recent months, but that did 
little to convince them that the project is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're premature," he said of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the Old L.A. group, headed by businessmen Albert T. Ehringer and 
Robert J. Morris, is willing to change the French restaurant to another type of 
eatery. But it will not give up the space for a Mexican museum or art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a prime (restaurant) location and I think that should be its use," 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rodolfo Acuna, a Chicano studies professor who is chair of the Mexican 
Conservancy, countered: "An art gallery would eventually pay for itself. They 
(the city's Establishment) pour a lot of money into the Music Center. Why 
shouldn't some of that money be poured into an arts center for Mexican 
culture?" 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has offered to build a 3,000-square-foot wing of the Garnier Building 
for such a purpose, but opponents say that offer is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear which city panel will oversee the project. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre and Molina have agreed to support the creation of the seven-member 
"authority" to oversee the park to end the heated wrangling over Olvera Street, 
which had been under the control of the parks commission. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna would like the new authority to oversee the project. But Alatorre, 
mindful that Old L.A. already has a lease, is not so sure. He says parks 
commission approval should stand as long as more cultural exhibition space is 
included in the project.
