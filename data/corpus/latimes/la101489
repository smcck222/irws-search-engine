CARMEN CAVALLARO, 76; AMONG BEST OF CAFE-SOCIETY PIANISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carmen Cavallaro, considered among the best of the cafe-society pianists who 
led big bands in the 1940s, died Thursday night in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He was 76. United Press International reported that he had suffered from cancer 
and died at Mt. Carmel East Hospital, where he had been since Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Cavallaro may best be remembered for his sound track 
recordings on "The Eddy Duchin Story," a 1956 film about the life of another 
highly successful society pianist. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Cavallaro was heard playing as Tyrone Power in the title role ran 
synchronized fingers over the keys. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, points out George Simon in his book "The Big Bands," Duchin had 
been twitted years earlier by members of his own orchestra for not being 
Cavallaro's equal on the piano. "Carmen," as he was known in the early 1930s, 
was at the time playing in the relief band at New York's Central Park Casino, 
where the Duchin band was featured. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Poet of the Piano, Cavallaro started with the Abe Lyman, Rudy 
Vallee and Al Kavelin bands in the 1930s and formed his own orchestra in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
He made several recordings over the years, among them "Warsaw Concerto," "The 
More I See You," "Full Moon and Empty Arms" and, with Bing Crosby, "I Can't 
Believe That You're in Love With Me." 
</P>
<P>
His other films included "Hollywood Canteen," "Diamond Horseshoe" and "The 
Time, the Place and the Girl."

RICHARD ZACHARIAS; MADE THE DOVE BAR INTO HOUSEHOLD NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Zacharias, a businessman who fell in love with the Dove ice cream bar 
when one was served to him at his country club years ago and in 1984 acquired a 
half interest in the firm and brought it to national attention, died Wednesday 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, Nancy Freedman, at whose home he died, said her father had been 
battling cancer for two years. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
Owner of hospitals and manufacturing and clothing firms in the Chicago area, 
Zacharias brought his business and production acumen to the Dove bar after 
buying 50% of the firm from the Stefanos family. The family had concocted the 
ice cream bar in 1939 to keep their own children from chasing after the 
neighborhood ice cream truck. 
</P>
<P>
Zacharias stepped in and transformed the company in less than a year from a 
back-room operation that hand-dipped 500 bars a day in a pot of warm chocolate 
into a $2-million ice cream plant with a capacity of 72,000 bars a day. 
</P>
<P>
A year later the company was sold to the M&amp;M Mars candy company with 
Zacharias remaining as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
His success was written about in publications ranging from the New York Times 
to People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Owner of Precision Plating Co. of Chicago, he became a president of the 
National Assn. of Metal Finishers. His philanthropies included the Chicago 
Hearing Society. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Beverly, his daughter, sons Steven and Daniel and 
six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services will be held in Glencoe, Ill.

AKIRA KIKUKAWA; FOUNDER OF JAPANESE PHILHARMONIC IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Akira Kikukawa, founder and music director of the 29-year-old Japanese 
Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles, has died, family members said Friday. He 
was 57. The cause of death was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
The 85-member orchestra, which Kikukawa founded in 1961, presents standard 
symphonic works as well as more recent compositions by Asian composers writing 
in the Western style. The orchestra often uses Japanese music and instruments 
and about half of its members are of Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Kikukawa was the first one in history . . . to create this kind of 
community orchestra for Japanese people, to create this kind of organization 
outside of Japan," said Masatoshi Mitsumoto, founder and director of Los 
Angeles' Concordia Orchestra, who was Kikukawa's principal cellist 
intermittently for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He is responsible for introducing many, many Japanese works and artists to the 
Los Angeles audience and made people aware of Japanese musical contributions to 
the world," Mitsumoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Kikukawa's family would not comment on the cause of death, which 
occurred Thursday at Gardena Memorial Hospital. But Mitsumoto said the late 
conductor had been fighting a kidney ailment and had been using a dialysis 
machine for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Osaka, Japan, Kikukawa was a cellist in Japan before he came to the 
United States to study with cellist Gabor Rejto and conducting instructor 
Ingolf Dahl at USC, he told The Times in a 1988 interview. 
</P>
<P>
Future plans for the orchestra, which presents about six concerts annually, 
were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Kikukawa was to have led the Gardena-based group in a program with the Roger 
Wagner Chorale at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa on 
Sunday. The concert will go ahead as scheduled, but a guest conductor will take 
Kikukawa's place and the program will be altered slightly.

MAJOR MISTAKE IN ARGENTINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Argentina's President Carlos Saul Menem made a mistake this past weekend when 
he issued a blanket pardon for the military men and political terrorists 
responsible for most of that country's recent political turmoil. The move also 
gambles that democracy has deep enough roots that Argentines can resist if 
their military leaders decide to take over the government again. 
</P>
<P>
The move was not unexpected. During the campaign that preceded his election, 
Menem hinted that he might issue such pardons in an effort to "heal the wounds" 
still left from one of the darkest eras of modern Argentine history -- the 
terrorist campaigns waged by urban guerrillas in the 1970s which led, in turn, 
to a "dirty war" by a military government determined to wipe out all traces of 
subversion. Thousands of innocent people were killed in those terrible times, 
most of them by the military's security apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 beneficiaries of Menem's forgiveness are former military 
officers, including three former junta members who led Argentina to military 
defeat by Great Britain in a war over the Falkland Islands. Also forgiven are 
39 officers accused of human-rights violations during the dirty war, and 164 
military men alleged to have taken part in armed uprisings against Menem's 
predecessor, Raul Alfonsin. 
</P>
<P>
The pardons are troubling because they weaken a legal precedent set under 
Alfonsin that military leaders could be held responsible for crimes committed 
during military rule. Considering the history of military juntas in Latin 
America, that was an important precedent for the region. 
</P>
<P>
Menem's decision to forgive the men who plotted against Alfonsin is especially 
worrisome. They are much younger than the generals and admirals who staged the 
1976 coup, oversaw the dirty war and the futile South Atlantic war. The fact 
that they challenged an elected president indicates that they share attitudes 
that made older offices think they could dictate Argentine policy with guns. 
</P>
<P>
Such thinking has permeated Argentina's military caste for too long. When 
Alfonsin stepped aside for Menem, it marked the first time in 60 years that one 
democratically elected civilian president had succeeded another. Some of 
Menem's advisers argue that he granted the pardons so that he can focus his 
energies on the economic problems that are an even greater challenge for 
Argentina. In some cases, that would be a practical reason for trying to excise 
a divisive and emotional, but largely symbolic, political issue. But if the 
dramatic economic changes Menem is trying to bring about in Argentina don't 
work out as quickly or easily as his supporters hope, the pardons could work 
the other way -- as invitations to the military to intervene to do things the 
way the generals think they should be done. One can only hope that democracy in 
Argentina has gotten strong enough in recent years that Menem's pardons will 
not tempt the military to assert its influence again.

IT'S A NATIONAL DISGRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too often the talk about the need for health insurance for everyone, better 
child care or improved education is not correlated with real-life consequences. 
But a report of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families has 
given us an update on one of the most horrible consequences: the astounding 
number of desperately poor children in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of all children, 50% of black children and one-fourth of all 
preschoolers live in poverty. Children remain the largest group of poor people 
in the country. This slide is continuing a worrisome trend noted in 1983 and 
1987. From 1970 to 1987, the median income of children living in single-parent 
families declined by 19%. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the numbers are no better; from 1970 to 1988, the number of 
children living in poverty jumped 66%, according to the advocacy group Children 
Now. To put that in perspective: If the 1.6 million poor children in this state 
were in one place, they would make up the third largest city behind Los Angeles 
and San Diego. And these are not children deprived of mere niceties. They are 
from families making less than $10,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Poor children are four times more likely to become teen-age parents and more 
likely to drop out of school. And so the cycle continues. 
</P>
<P>
It does not have to continue. A comprehensive child-care bill that helps 
working parents and provides quality care for preschool-age children would help 
to make a difference. So would health insurance that would cover the 37 million 
who do not have it. Legislators can make these things happen. But citizens have 
to demand it first.

A WISE DECISION ON STRIP SEARCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court has ruled unconstitutional any strip search by police 
unless they have reason to suspect that a person in custody is hiding drugs or 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In any other circumstance, the court ruled, body-cavity searches are simply 
"dehumanizing and humiliating," a judgment we applaud. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved a woman, Karen Kennedy, who hid as security a television set 
and two chairs belonging to a roommate who walked out, leaving $694 worth of 
rent and utility bills in dispute. Kennedy was arrested, booked on suspicion of 
grand theft -- a felony because the property was valued at $400 or more -- and 
subjected to a body-cavity search by Los Angeles police at a Van Nuys jail. She 
filed suit against the officers and the city, won the case and was awarded 
$39,000. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision upheld that verdict. 
</P>
<P>
As 9th Circuit Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall pointed out, "No weapons, no drugs, 
no contraband, no violent acts of any kind were involved." 
</P>
<P>
California law allows body-cavity searches on felony charges, but limits the 
practice on misdemeanors to charges involving weapons, drugs or violence. In 
the wake of the ruling, the state Legislature will want to consider extending 
that limit to felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
In drafting new policies to conform to the ruling, police in Los Angeles and 
other parts of the state will want to consider the New York Police Department's 
guidelines, which authorize strip searches only when an arresting officer has 
probable cause to suspect that a person is hiding weapons, contraband or 
evidence that may not be discovered by frisking or emptying pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Strip searches are certainly a legitimate police practice as authorities try to 
stem the increasing flow of drugs, particularly when the drugs are flowing into 
jails. Body-cavity searches are also warranted to protect police and other 
prisoners. But, in many cases the searches are unnecessary, and, as the federal 
appeals court has affirmed, unconstitutional.

THE PERESTROISHCHIKI SPEAK OUT; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: FOUR PEOPLE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE GORBACHEV REFORMS GIVE A 
CANDID APPRAISAL OF WHAT LIES AHEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By 1989 by Stephen F. Cohen and Katrina vanden Heuvel. Reprinted from Voices of 
Glasnost, with permission of W.W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between June, 1987, and this past May, two Americans with longstanding 
interests in Soviet affairs conducted a series of interviews with 14 of those 
Soviets who have come to be known as perestroishchiki -- outspoken proponents 
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's most radical reforms. From that work has come a new 
book, "Voices of Glasnost," by Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of politics and 
director of the Russian Studies Program at Princeton University, and Katrina 
vanden Heuvel, an editor at The Nation. Following are excerpts from four 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Shmelyov is a vivid example of people brought into the limelight by the 
politics of perestroika and the possibilities of glasnost. A noted economist, 
he has also become a major Soviet literary figure. 
</P>
<P>
Question: If the situation in the countryside is so dire, why didn't Gorbachev 
begin his economic reforms in agriculture, as the Chinese did when they 
undertook their own perestroika in the late 1970s, rather than in industry? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I think there were two reasons. It is less risky to make changes in 
industry because it is not so painful if production declines for a while during 
the transition. The risks in agriculture are much greater because if total 
output falls even for only a year or so, it is very painful. In addition, to 
begin radical reforms in the countryside, Gorbachev would have needed the full 
support of the entire party structure, and I doubt that he had it. Major 
economic reforms aren't possible unless the party gives up its economic 
functions. Here, too, it is easier in industry, where the party has fewer 
functions than it does in agriculture. In the countryside, the power and 
influence of every district party secretary is based on his economic authority, 
which makes him 100% master of the district. If he gives up that authority, he 
may still be master, but not a 100% one. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, in 1986, at the 27th Party Congress, Gorbachev announced that 
state and collective farms could market freely about 30% of their produce, as 
they saw fit. Well, that reform was never implemented. There is an enormous 
administrative-bureaucratic pyramid in the countryside that exists solely for 
the purpose of extracting obligatory deliveries. There may be 3 million of 
these rural administrators. They are stifling reform because it would topple 
their pyramid. They're blocking the transition to family leasing and market 
relations. They ought to be punished and an example made of them. 
</P>
<P>
But whether we are speaking of agriculture or industry, the whole problem is 
peeling all the layers of state bureaucratic administration off the economy. 
The state has an important role to play in the economy, but it should play it 
through economic means such as prices, interest rates and taxes, not by using 
its fists and commands. If you look closely at the existing administrative 
system, with all its bureaucratic layers, you'll see that the top layers are 
completely irresponsible economically, whatever incentives exist have nothing 
to do with the actual productivity of enterprises or workers, and nobody knows 
what anything is worth or costs because of the administered system of distorted 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
But when we talk about dismantling the administrative system, do you know what 
many of our economic officials say? They say it will cause economic anarchy and 
the growth rate will fall. Except in some areas of consumer goods and service, 
it would be healthy if our growth rate fell. The main problem isn't quantity 
but quality and marketing. The Soviet Union isn't a backward country in 
production. We produce more shoes than any country in the world, but they 
aren't any good and nobody wants them. We produce twice as much steel as the 
United States and just as many machine tools. We produce many more farm 
tractors and combines than you do, but we buy grain from you. Even in 
agriculture, the most pressing problem is not producing more but using what we 
actually produce: 20% of the grain and well over 50% of the fruit and potatoes 
never reach any consumer. We lose more food than we import. Again, layers of 
bureaucracy and administrative tyranny are responsible for this mess. 
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Zaslavskaya is an economist turned sociologist who today heads the 
newly formed Center for the Study of Public Opinion in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Do you see a special role for women in perestroika? On several 
occasions you have complained that your male colleagues in the social sciences 
are too often passive and lacking in civic courage. And as we watch the 
unusually prominent role played by Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, in Soviet public 
life, we get the impression that he and she are consciously encouraging Soviet 
women to be much more active participants in public affairs than they were in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I have personally heard Gorbachev say that he hopes women will play an 
important role in perestroika, but I do not see a special role for them. It is 
certainly true that women drink less and are more stable than men. It is also 
true that women are generally under- utilized in our society, even though 94% 
of them are in the work force. Few of them rise to the top in their 
professions. In the Academy of Sciences, for example, it is rare to find women 
serving as section or department heads at institutes. Nor have I yet to see 
women playing an active role in perestroika. At the many meetings I've 
attended, it's always men, men, men. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not only the system that holds a woman back, it's also life itself 
the moment she starts a family. Take my own case. I have two daughters, which 
made things very difficult. But I would have been a very unhappy person without 
a family and children. There was a time when life was hard. I had to write my 
dissertation, and the four of us were living in a cramped communal apartment. 
Even together, our salaries, mine and my husband's, were meager. Constantly I 
was taking one daughter to kindergarten and the other to the doctor. It was 
only because I was irresistibly drawn to scholarship that I was able to do so 
much. So it is not surprising that many Soviet women would like to leave the 
work force if their husbands' salaries were large enough. And this may not be a 
bad thing. We have a generation of children raised without mothers who were all 
out working -- an abandoned generation. These children have a lot of problems, 
including a sharp drop in morality among them. No one can replace a mother. 
</P>
<P>
But whether we are talking about men or women, perestroika has to give people 
faith in its goals and the freedom to be active and creative. Otherwise there 
will be no social revolution in our country. Working people are watching and 
waiting to see if the changes are really going to affect their lives. They've 
grown accustomed to a discrepancy between words and deeds. The greatest danger 
is that we will disappoint them again and lose their support. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Bovin, a specialist at Isvestia in the field of international 
affairs, has long been one of the most popular journalists in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Are you now free to write about and say whatever you want? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I can't, not yet, but you have to understand the special problem here. 
We ought to have full glasnost in our coverage of Soviet foreign policy and 
world affairs, but we still are limited by concerns of the Foreign Ministry and 
the government. We can criticize what happened before 1985 -- the deployment of 
the SS-20 missiles in Europe and the invasion of Afghanistan, for example -- 
but I can't disagree with what Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said today, 
yesterday or last year. And the reason is the old habit, yours and ours, of 
associating everything that appears in Soviet newspapers with the Kremlin. We 
don't have a tradition of journalists expressing their own personal views on 
foreign affairs. So if I write something sharp or critical or new, foreign 
governments and observers say it is the opinion of the Kremlin. Similarly, I 
can't write critically about things I don't like in Eastern Europe or elsewhere 
in the world Communist movement. Leaders of those countries and parties 
immediately complain to Moscow. Or they say the Soviet Union is interfering in 
their affairs. It's also why it is not easy for me to write my opinion of (the 
late Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini or Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
We have to establish a tradition that enables journalists to speak only for 
themselves and express what is clearly their own personal opinions, so that 
nobody will identify them with the Soviet Foreign Ministry or the Kremlin. 
Everybody agrees that this is sensible, that we should do it, and we have made 
some progress. But there still are problems. It is a matter of perceptions and 
reactions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There's a much worse example. When Ayatollah Khomeini sentenced Salman Rushdie 
to death for his novel "The Satanic Verses" in February, the Soviet government, 
unlike many others, did not publicly protest. It feared that a protest would 
jeopardize the government's diplomatic relations with Iran. Though I wrote a 
protest in Moscow News, most of our journalists were silent. I was ashamed that 
Moscow was silent. Politics prevails over morals. And glasnost again came only 
in dribbles. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Yakovlev is widely considered to be the staunchest Politburo 
supporter of Gorbachev's radical reforms and the "architect of glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
Question: Let us assume, for the sake of discussion, that all these political 
reforms will actually be enacted and that a democratized Soviet political 
system emerges sometime in the future. Will such a Soviet democratic system be 
like the American democratic system or will it be different? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Certainly it will be different. After all, democracies with the same 
kind of social and economic system -- the United States, England and France, 
for example -- are different. Since we have a different kind of social and 
economic system, it is logical to expect that our democracy will be different. 
Of course, there will be some common aspects -- pluralism of opinions, 
multicandidate elections, nominations and voting and other technical aspects of 
democracy. But the differences will be more substantive, though I don't rule 
out the possibility that we can learn from each other. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, in our socialist country, democracy will be at the disposal of 
the people as a means to solve its problems and achieve its goals. So far as I 
can judge, this is not a primary task of American democracy. Secondly, we 
interpret democracy more broadly than you do. We don't limit it to 
participation in elections. We want to put it into practice in our everyday 
life, including at the workplace. For us, it is the way to overcome people's 
centuries-old alienation from political and economic power -- and this 
alienation still exists in our socialist system -- and to give people the 
chance to make their opinions felt in all kinds of decision-making. Of course, 
this is a future perspective, but we intend to move precisely in this 
direction. Finally, I think that as our reforms develop and as we continue to 
put our socialist principles and values into practice, the constitutional 
aspects of our democracy will be more dynamic than they are in America. Our 
constitution will be developing and changing, along with our society. I think 
that some of those changes will bring us closer, for example, in the area of 
human rights. But for the foreseeable future, yes, we will be very different.

BOYARSKY ON L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having known Bill Boyarsky for a good many years, I was disappointed in his 
first effort as columnist in the Metro section ("Government by Five Soloists," 
Sept. 29). His column read as though he has been in hibernation for perhaps 8 
or 9 years. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of power on the Board of Supervisors has moved among the members 
according to each particular issue. For example, the debate over contracting 
out county services was settle in 1978 when nearly two-thirds of the voters of 
Los Angeles County voted in support of this kind of government economy and 
efficiency. Supervisors Deane Dana, Pete Schabarum and I supported the voters' 
decision. It was opposed by Supervisors Kenny Hahn and Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was with the support of Dana and Edelman that I was able to push 
forward with the construction of the new Olive View Medical Center. Schabarum 
opposed this critically needed facility. 
</P>
<P>
Dana, Schabarum and I opposed the distribution of bleach kits and so-called 
clean needles in the fight against AIDS because we believe money is better 
spent on drug education for our young people and in helping get addicts off of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding my interests in promoting healthy diets, the board acted unanimously 
in 1981 with an order that improved the type of foods served in our probation 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The board has seen various alliances form and dissolve from time to time, and 
this accrues to the benefit of all our citizens. Admittedly, we are five very 
different individuals. At the same time, each of us was elected by a different 
constituency and each of us has particular obligations to our district. 
</P>
<P>
But the record would bear out the fact that we are extremely successful in 
attaining a high degree of teamwork. For your information (and Boyarsky's), the 
board is unanimous on approximately 95% of each weekly calendar.

COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GEN. NORIEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Bush Takes Residence in an Indecisive House of Halfway 
Measures," by Charles Krauthammer, Op-Ed Page, Oct. 6: 
</P>
<P>
This column claims that the United States government should have intervened in 
the failed Panamanian coup. It viciously slashed at President Bush's lack of 
action in what appeared to be an attempt to overthrow Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
I would just like to point out that the rebels were not freedom-loving 
democratic white knights. They were a bunch of power-hungry Noriega wanna-bes 
who wished to " . . . help him retire quietly." This was not a coup. Rather, it 
was a feeble attempt to wrest power away from Noriega by his own followers. 
This is clearly illustrated by the fact that they neglected to eliminate 
Noriega when they had the chance. These rebels did not want to change 
Panamanian society for the better; nor did they want to right the social 
injustices and cruel inhumanities wrought by Noriega's regime. They wanted 
power for themselves. They were motivated purely by greed. 
</P>
<P>
Now I ask Krauthammer: Why should the U.S. involve itself in the petty internal 
affairs of some Latin American nation, when the involvement could only hinder 
American foreign policy objectives in Central America? Is it worth it to get 
rid of one "two-bit drug-runner?"

COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GEN. NORIEGA

<TEXT>
<P>
Another day, another congressional outcry. On Oct. 4, the day after the failed 
military revolt against Noriega, senators and representative like Sen. David 
Boren (D-Okla.) and Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), respectfully blasted the Bush 
Administration for doing too little to help the insurgents (Part I). Boren, a 
usual opponent of covert action against Noriega, said Bush should have ordered 
U.S. military intervention while the rebels held the headquarters of the 
Panamanian Defense Forces. Likewise, Hyde thought the U.S. missed a perfect 
opportunity to resolve the Noriega problem. 
</P>
<P>
While these senators and representatives talk about blown chances, they fail to 
see the most powerful weapon in front of them. This weapon is patience. By 
being patient, the United States will eventually capture Noriega. Noriega can 
escape bullets, rockets, and coups but he cannot escape time.

REPARATIONS FOR JAPANESE INTERNEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to applaud The Times for its advocacy on behalf of the 117,000 Japanese 
Americans who were forcibly interned by the American government during World 
War II (editorial, "For Redress at Last," Oct. 3). In August, 1988, when 
President Reagan signed the act into law to provide speedy monetary 
compensation and an apology to the Japanese American citizens unjustly 
imprisoned, the former internees finally felt that this stain of injustice 
would soon be purged away. 
</P>
<P>
But, one year later, no monies have been appropriated and more than 2,400 
internees have died, separated from final justice by a barbed-wire fence of 
promises made, promises broken, promises unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
I urge Congress, on behalf of the American people, to keep its word. Justice 
delayed is justice denied. As the leader of the free world, America can exhort 
other nations to guarantee human rights, but only when it fulfills its own 
moral and legal obligations at home.

RESEARCHERS TAKE NEW LOOK AT CREATIVITY AND MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The excellent articles on creativity (by Anne C. Roark, Part I, Sept. 29 and 
30) must be considered in parallel with those on the "educational summit" and 
the joint pledge of our President and governors to set national educational 
goals for the first time. Jerome Bruner, in "Play" (1976), noted that it is 
fair to say that creativity not only defies explanation but that it defies 
description, too. The same might be said for intelligence -- whatever that is 
-- and for establishment of standardized tests to measure educational 
accomplishment. This nation was founded upon faith in individuals. It became a 
leader among nations because of creative citizens. Development of individual 
capabilities and of the self-confidence to take risks should be high among the 
goals of our educational systems at all levels. There is no indication of this 
in the reports of the governors' conference or in the statement of support by 
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. 
</P>
<P>
As a professor of child development at San Diego State University, I teach a 
course called Development of Creative Behavior in Young Children. One of the 
basic distinctions that I expect students to make is between "convergent" and 
"divergent" thinking. In the former, it is assumed that there is only one 
correct answer. Students are expected to respond that Columbus discovered 
America in 1492, for instance -- and ignore voyages of the Vikings, ancient 
Chinese or others. This is neat, because anyone with a different response is 
wrong. It's easy to grade exams -- and this is the sort of thing that I fear 
will become even more horrendous with federal goals for education. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, schools described in the articles on creativity not only are 
expecting basic skills but are encouraging divergent thinking, encouraging 
children to have unpredictable ideas and to risk failure. This is the basis of 
science, arts, the humanities and such mundane pursuits as repairing plumbing 
or carburetors. It is also part of the standard negotiating process, whether it 
is done between two ordinary citizens or between nations. This is not just a 
matter of making daily life more interesting. It isn't even a matter of 
maintaining a high level of economic success and technical advancement. 
Survival of the human species depends upon divergent creative thinking. I am 
concerned that the establishment of measurable goals will again take the easy 
way out with tests of convergent answers to tests of reading, writing, and 
arithmetic to further frustrate children and their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's perspective cannot be ignored. We know from accounts 
of past nations that creativity flourishes in cultures valuing it and that it 
declines in nations that ignore or are afraid of it.

GRETZKY'S THIRD POINT HELPS KINGS TO 6-5 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky's third point -- an assist -- was a big one Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
He passed to Steve Kasper, who scored a last-second goal that gave the Kings a 
6-5 victory over the Vancouver Canucks in front of 16,123 at the Pacific 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
As seconds ticked away, the winning goal was set up when Gretzky carried the 
puck into the Canucks' zone -- acting as a magnet to two defenders who couldn't 
help but give chase. 
</P>
<P>
Kasper, who used to lead the Boston Bruins' checking line, liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see both Vancouver guys going at Wayne, and I started yelling for the 
puck," he said. "I probably didn't need to be yelling, because he sees 
everything. He doesn't miss anything. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked for the shot, which I think went between (Kirk McLean's) pads, I 
knew time was running short. But I didn't know it was just one second." 
</P>
<P>
Kasper gave the Kings their third victory in five games and helped Gretzky 
close the gap on the National Hockey League points record. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew from my years in Boston what was going to happen," Kasper said. "That's 
why we used to designate one guy to go with him and say, hey, that's his 
responsibility, let's not get caught trying to do everybody else's job. Because 
when he draws two men, somebody's open." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has made a career of setting up the open man. 
</P>
<P>
All three points Friday night were assists. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky needs two to break the points record of 1,850 that Gordie Howe set over 
the course of a 26-year National Hockey League career. 
</P>
<P>
Howe and several league officials were on hand in case Gretzky set the record, 
but it really was not expected to happen Friday night. Not even Howe thought 
so. He quipped before the game: "If I thought he was going to get it, I'd have 
worn my suit." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's parents didn't even make the game. They were figuring they could show 
up at Sunday's game in Edmonton without missing the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
They were right about that. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has said he would like to break the record at the Forum and, failing 
that, his second choice would be to break in Edmonton. But Gretzky did not hold 
back against the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks held him back, perhaps, limiting him to one shot on goal. But he 
didn't duck ice time. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky skated with his own line of John Tonelli and Bob Kudelski and took 
turns with Bernie Nicholls centering a line with Hubie McDonough and Jim Fox. 
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky did his share of penalty killing and skating on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Canucks know how to play him. Vancouver Coach Bob McCammon, who was an 
assistant coach at Edmonton during Gretzky's reign there, said before Friday's 
game that he knew what it took to slow -- if not stop -- Gretzky, including 
using two lines to check him. Gretzky's stamina is such that he can wear down 
one line. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the Canucks defend against Gretzky pretty well. He was shut out 
here in one game last season. 
</P>
<P>
In the first period, the Canuck defense stopped all the Kings, holding them to 
three shots on goal -- none for Gretzky -- to 14 for the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver took a 1-0 lead in the first period, on a play initiated when Trevor 
Linden, one of the league's best rookies last season, blew past King defenseman 
Petr Prajsler coming up the right side. That drew goalie Kelly Hrudey out and 
he then passed through the crease to center Greg Adams, who scored in the open 
net behind Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
Adams scored another power-play goal to put the Canucks ahead, 2-0, early in 
the second period. But the Kings took control in the period, outscoring the 
Canucks by three goals to take a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings started to rally with a power-play goal by Kudelski from defenseman 
Steve Duchesne and Gretzky. Less than a minute later, Craig Duncanson's goal 
tied it. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks' Soviet tandem stepped forward, with Igor Larionov scoring off a 
pass from Vladimir Krutov on the power play for a brief lead before the Kings 
scored the last three goals of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Taylor scored twice in that run, beating McLean to tie it at 14:36 and 
again to make it 5-3 on the second goal of a four-minute power play that 
resulted from a fight between Canuck defenseman Larry Melnyk and King 
defenseman Keith Crowder. 
</P>
<P>
They both received five minutes for fighting, but Melnyk also got two minutes 
for charging and two minutes for instigating. 
</P>
<P>
Kudelski scored first for the Kings on that power play off a centering pass 
from Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Petri Skriko and Larionov scored early in the third period to tie the score 
again, and the game remained a standoff until Kasper and Gretzky won it with 
one second left. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mikael Lindholm, the young Swedish player who has been on Wayne Gretzky's line 
since the first day of training camp, was scratched Friday night. John Tonelli 
was moved into his spot to play opposite Bob Kudelski, who now leads the Kings 
with four goals. . . . Left winger Jay Miller was scratched to let a bruised 
lower leg heal. . . . Since joining the Kings, goalie Kelly Hrudey is 3-0 
against the Canucks. . . . The Canucks outshot the Kings in six of eight games 
last season, and did it again Friday night.

KEVIN COPELAND WAS A MODEL HUMAN BEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My friend Kevin Copeland was the epitome of the perfect young man. Not only was 
he an outstanding and personable athlete in football and track, but he was a 
true gentleman off the field as well. 
</P>
<P>
His untimely death not only stunned his family, school and myself, but also 
many fellow prep football players who heard of him and played against him. He 
had a bright future, since he virtually had his choice of any college he wanted 
to attend (i.e. Notre Dame, Michigan). Academically and physically he was a 
prize pick for any university. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for showing the proper respect for him on the front page, and not 
using the story as some tiny footnote in the back. He would have made the top 
story anyway by scoring five touchdowns in a 4-A championship game, but 
unfortunately it ended up like this. 
</P>
<P>
We'll all miss you, Kev.

SANTA ANITA, HOLLYPARK ARE GETTING OFF TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Mar's recent emergence as the leading race track in average daily handle, 
surpassing Santa Anita, serves as an important lesson for the two local 
thoroughbred venues. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar offers simulcast wagering at both its competitors' facilities. 
Thoroughbred racing is therefore more accessible to Southlanders during the Del 
Mar season than it is during the Santa Anita and Hollywood Park meets. 
</P>
<P>
As the freeways become more and more congested, on-track attendance at both 
these facilities has steadily declined. So far, the managements' response has 
been to try to make up for this lost patronage by expanding the inter-track 
wagering system to increasingly far-flung locations, such as Indio and 
Lancaster. Wake up! Cactus plants and cows don't go to the races. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it about time Hollypark and Santa Anita worked out a reciprocal 
simulcasting agreement, and started offering some form of true off-track (as 
opposed to inter-track) betting?

Like a pitcher carrying a no-hitter into the latter innings of a game, the 
University of San Diego's football team does not want to question its success. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is working, go with it. Just bear down and go after the next hitter. 
</P>
<P>
And to USD, the game at 7:30 tonight at Occidental College represents the 
cleanup guy, the perennial masher. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros (5-0) have mowed down three line-drive hitters and a couple of 
Punch-and-Judy types. 
</P>
<P>
It's now time for Occidental, the Whammer of California Division III football. 
</P>
<P>
USD has not beaten Occidental since 1981. They tied them, 13-13, to open the 
1987 season but lost last year, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, the Toreros had fourth and six on the Occidental seven with 15 
seconds left but failed to score when Brendan Murphy's pass into the end zone 
was trapped by Ken Zampese. Two plays earlier, Ken Jones appeared to have 
caught a winning touchdown pass, but the ball was knocked loose by a Tiger 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's Tony Werbelow, who has returned as a graduate student for his 
final season, completed 17 of 22 passes for 176 yards. Most of those statistics 
came in the first half when the Tigers built a 20-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"He shot our eyes out," said USD Coach Brian Fogarty, who is 0-4-1 against 
Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
But this may the Toreros' year. Earlier this week, USA Today listed USD as one 
of the biggest surprises of the year. The NCAA has ranked USD No. 4 in the West 
Region of Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental (3-1) has lost two games on the field but was awarded a victory 
because Azusa Pacific used an ineligible player. USD defeated Azusa, 24-6. 
</P>
<P>
USD is limiting opponents to 217 yards and 8.4 points per game. The offense is 
averaging 321 yards (220 rushing and 25.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Lenny Territo leads the team with 42 tackles; nose tackle Dave Dunn 
has 33 and a team-high five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Todd Jackson is averaging 113 yards per game.

Cal State Fullerton, winless on the road in four games this season, will play 
the University of the Pacific in a Big West Conference game at 2 p.m. today in 
Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (2-3-1) will be trying to balance its offense after last week's 34-23 
loss to Utah State in which quarterback Dan Speltz passed for 481 yards and the 
Titans were held to 29 yards rushing. Fullerton is 1-1 in the Big West.

Pacific is 1-5 overall, 1-3 in the conference, with the only victory coming

CS LONG BEACH SEEKS SECOND CONSECUTIVE WIN

Cal State Long Beach will play a San Diego State football team that is missing 
its leading rusher and scorer tonight at 7 in a nonconference game at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Darrin Wagner, a redshirt freshman who leads the Aztecs (1-3-1) 
with 424 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, was ruled out of the game by Coach Al 
Luginbill after missing practices this week without permission. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Wagner could dull an offense that is one of the most potent in the 
country. The Aztecs, led by 6-foot-8 quarterback Dan McGwire, are averaging 
511.4 yards and 32.8 points a game. Wagner will be replaced in the Aztecs' 
one-back offense by Ron Slack, a senior from Pasadena Muir High School. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (3-3) are coming off last Saturday's 55-48 Big West Conference 
victory over New Mexico State, their first win over a Division I-A team this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Jeff Fassett, who last week became the first Long Beach player in 
12 years to rush for 100 yards in consecutive games, will try to extend his 
streak. Fassett has gained 249 yards in 27 carries in the last two games. CURT

BOXING;

FOR THIS CHAMPION, IT'S ALL A MATTER OF LIP SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
For the second time this month, Juan Jose Estrada, the World Boxing Assn. 
junior featherweight champion, has been denied the chance to defend his title 
at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
No debate. Just read his lips. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada was originally scheduled to fight Jesus Salud (25-3, 21 knockouts) of 
San Diego last Tuesday. When Estrada (37-7, 31 knockouts) suffered a split lip 
in a sparring session, the fight was rescheduled for Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
But when Estrada, who lives in Tijuana, attempted to get medical clearance this 
week to come north for the bout, he was turned down because the lip has not yet 
healed. 
</P>
<P>
So the match has been rescheduled again, for Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The new Forum main event for Oct. 23 will match Raul Perez (45-1-1, 30 
knockouts), the World Boxing Council bantamweight champion who is also from 
Tijuana, against challenger Diego Avila (42-11-1, 15 knockouts) of Mexico City 
in a 12-rounder. Avila is ranked No. 6 by the WBC. 
</P>
<P>
Postponed II: The first world championship bout scheduled for the Soviet Union 
has been delayed three weeks. Orlando Canizales, the International Boxing 
Federation bantamweight champion, was supposed to defend his title Oct. 29 
against Alessandro Desantis of Italy, but will have to wait until Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by questions over television rights and the site. The 
fight, originally set for Yerevan in the republic of Armenia, was considered 
for Leningrad, but is now back in remote Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight: Razor Ruddock is in Atlantic City, N.J., training for his title 
fight against champion Mike Tyson Nov. 18 in Edmonton, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy weight: Roberto Duran, training for his super-middleweight match against 
Sugar Ray Leonard Dec. 7 at Las Vegas, has reportedly dropped from 208 pounds 
to 171. 
</P>
<P>
Duran's handlers say he will be down to 162 by early November and will step on 
the scales at the weigh-in between 158 and 159. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he'd consider a winner-take-all format for the multimillion-dollar 
fight, Duran replied, "I can't because I need to pay the IRS." 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweights of the future: Ray Mercer, winner of the Olympic gold medal at 
Seoul last year, will put his unbeaten record (9-0, eight knockouts) on the 
line against Eddie Richardson Tuesday night at Phoenix in an eight-rounder as 
part of an ESPN card. 
</P>
<P>
On the line is probably not the best term in this case since Richardson is only 
16-15. If Mercer really plans on fighting Tyson some time next year, as he 
claims, a good first step might be to pick up the pace and stop fighting guys 
whose big goal is to stay above .500. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the card will be the 1988 Olympic silver medalist in the 
light-flyweight division, Michael Carbajal (8-0, six knockouts), who will meet 
Jose Manuel Diaz in another eight-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweights of the past: The San Pedro Peninsula Hospital Women's Guild will 
auction off a boxing glove autographed by five former heavyweight champions at 
its dinner next Saturday night at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodlines: Joining Mercer and Carbajal on the Phoenix card will be heavyweight 
Tommy (the Duke) Morrison (17-0, 15 knockouts) of Kansas City, who gets his 
nickname from his great grand uncle, John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
So is Wayne the boxer's all-time screen favorite? No way. Morrison says his 
hero, Elvis Presley, was "the greatest actor ever." 
</P>
<P>
Bloodlines II: Jim Tunney of Simi Valley, who claims former heavyweight 
champion Gene Tunney as his great grand uncle, will make his pro debut in a 
five-rounder on the next Reseda Country Club card Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Tunney is being trained by former heavyweight contender Jerry Quarry. 
</P>
<P>
Quarry is also scheduled to sing the national anthem that night.

JIMENEZ'S STRONG EFFORT LEADS GLENDALE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KIRBY LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicole Jimenez's third-place finish in the small-college division of the Mt. 
San Antonio College Invitational on Friday paced the Glendale College women's 
cross-country team in its last race before a pivotal Western State Conference 
meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez covered the hilly, three-mile course in 19 minutes, 15 seconds, an 
improvement of more than a minute over last year's time as a Burbank High 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Fuller took 10th (20:28) and Tricia Mathiesen finished 16th (20:45) to 
guide Moorpark to a second-place finish with 99 points. Rancho Santiago won 
with 76. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Sophia Hill took 12th in 20:34. The Vaqueros, however, competed with 
less than the necessary five runners and failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's invitational portion, James Moore, a freshman from Verdugo Hills 
High, took 27th overall, clocking 20:42 for four miles, as Glendale took 13th 
with 299 points. 
</P>
<P>
Central Arizona placed three runners in the top 10 to win the men's meet with 
78 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's small-college division, Moorpark placed fourth with 109 points. 
Tom Biggs and Efrain Robles placed eighth and 11th in 21:44 and 22:10, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's small-college race, Gillian Evans of Porterville and Jimenez led 
from the gun, passing through the relatively flat first mile in 5:45 with a 
25-meter lead over the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
The duo continued to lead for the next half-mile until Bruni Oonagh of San 
Diego City overtook both on the steep switchback portion of the course. Oonagh 
opened up a large margin and ran unchallenged the remainder of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Oonagh finished in 18:38, followed by Evans in 19:06. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of scared at first," Jimenez said. "I like to run on the flat. I'm 
not much of a hill runner. I think if I maintained contact, I might have been 
able to catch the second girl (Evans). But I'm still very happy with my time." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale held out its Nos. 2 and 3 runners, Hedieh Nourbik and Linda Matsuoka, 
who are injured. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy where we are at this point of the season. It's good for us to 
get familiar with this course," Glendale assistant Coach Ed Lopez said. The 
Southern California championships will be held at Mt. SAC in November. "But 
with the conference meets coming up, it didn't make any sense to risk any 
further injuries." 
</P>
<P>
The WSC format calls for all conference members to compete in two meets -- the 
second of which is Friday -- before the championships are run Nov. 3. A team's 
finish in the championships counts double toward final standings. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's race, Moore ran among the top 20 for most of the race before 
fading in the last mile. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out kind of hard," Moore said. "I felt extremely tired from the second 
mile on. Those hills caught up with me toward the end." 
</P>
<P>
Sal Garfias, the Vaqueros' No. 1 runner early in the season, finished 57th in 
21:35 despite being hampered by shin splints. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal's been (training) on the bike for the past two weeks and hasn't been able 
to run much," Lopez said. "I don't think we'll have any problems winning the 
conference. If we can get our five guys under 21 minutes at (the Southern 
California championships), we have a good chance to make it to the state meet."

Cal State Northridge won its 50th consecutive California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. home volleyball match by sweeping Cal State Los Angeles, 15-1, 15-6, 
15-11, in less than an hour.

Dixon led Northridge with seven kills each. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Northridge Coach Walt Ker cleared his bench after the first game, and reserves

<P>
Birmingham (3-1, 1-1) scored on its first five possessions. The only time

MEET AT CAL POLY SLO COULD CLARIFY RANKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most coaches swear that they are not concerned with rankings, but Cal State 
Northridge cross-country Coach Don Strametz is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Although Strametz realizes that his team's performance is more important than 
its ranking, he always wants to know where Northridge stands in the NCAA 
Division II polls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm curious to see how other people view us," Strametz said. "That's always 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
In this week's poll, the Northridge men are ranked sixth, the Lady Matadors 
fifth. And although Strametz was pleased with the men's ranking -- their 
highest during his 11-year tenure -- he said that the CSUN women were ranked 
too highly. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Lady Matadors were two places ahead of California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. rival Cal State Los Angeles, even though the Golden Eagles 
easily defeated them for the UC Riverside Invitational title two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what they're basing it on, but they're off base right now," 
Strametz said. "We're not that good." 
</P>
<P>
The picture could be clearer today when several of the top Division II teams 
meet in the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo, Air Force and UC Davis, the top three ranked teams, will meet 
in the women's race, and five of the top 12 ranked teams, including 
second-ranked San Luis Obispo, will battle in the men's race. 
</P>
<P>
The others are Northridge, UC Riverside (ninth), UC Davis (11th) and Cal State 
L. A. (12th). 
</P>
<P>
Best defense: The Occidental football team is in first place in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, partly because of its 
topsy-turvy defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, 3-1 overall and 2-0 in SCIAC play, lead the conference in total 
defense, allowing 268.8 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is first in rushing defense, allowing just 107.5 yards a game. 
However, the Tigers are last in passing defense (161.3 average). 
</P>
<P>
Opportunity knocks: A rough road to the Western State Conference football title 
might be a little smoother for the Glendale football team as a result of 
Saturday's 17-17 tie between Bakersfield and Los Angeles Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, the defending national champion, also tied Glendale, 19-19. The 
two ties are equivalent to a loss in the WSC standings. That leaves the door 
open for teams such as Glendale and Moorpark, both of which are unbeaten in 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (2-1-1 overall, 2-0-1 in the WSC) will meet Santa Monica today before 
opening division play against L. A. Southwest next week. 
</P>
<P>
Things change: In 1971, Cal Lutheran defeated Westminster (Pa.), 30-14, to win 
the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Division II football title. The 
championship was the only NAIA football game to be nationally televised and 
marked the pinnacle of Cal Lutheran's football fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Still a strong NAIA team, Westminster (5-0) is ranked No. 1 in Division II this 
week. Cal Lutheran joined the NCAA Division II in 1984 and will drop to 
Division III when its scholarship players have exhausted their eligibility. The 
Kingsmen are currently 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tank: Moorpark's Freddie Bradley, named the Western State Conference 
offensive co-player of the week, has moved up in state and conference 
statistical rankings on the strength of his 191-yard, five-touchdown 
performance against Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is the second-leading rusher in the WSC and 15th in the state with 417 
yards. He has scored 60 points to lead state players, averages 50.7 yards a 
kickoff return and leads the WSC in combined rushing, receiving and return 
yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Road overkill: In its first year of existence, the Moorpark women's soccer team 
opened on the road with two tournaments and then kicked off its South Coast 
Conference schedule with seven consecutive home matches. 
</P>
<P>
Fine, but now Moorpark (10-1-1, 4-1-1 in league play) must go on the road for 
eight consecutive conference matches before ending the season with a home match 
against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fairly upset about that," said Coach Daniel Ohayon, whose team won't play 
at home for more than a month. "The league screwed us up. It builds too much 
confidence, and then when we go into strange grounds, the players are lost." 
</P>
<P>
Day off: A Cal Lutheran men's soccer game at Christian Heritage scheduled for 
today was canceled because Christian Heritage dropped its program to the club 
level. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen can use the time to regroup after a shocking 2-2 tie Wednesday 
against Southern California College, which had the worst record of the 10 teams 
in the NAIA District 3. Tuesday, Cal Lutheran will meet Westmont, which is tied 
for No. 1 in the NAIA poll.

San Gabriel 14, Burbank 7 -- Burbank quarterback Jeremy Sparks' pass with three 
seconds remaining in the game was incomplete in the game at San Gabriel. 
Burbank's Nelson Randin had carried the ball into the end zone three plays 
earlier on a 10-yard run, but the play was nullified because of a holding 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel took a 6-0 lead on Christian Estrada's eight-yard touchdown run and 
boosted its lead to 14-0 early in the second half when Jerry Vasquez caught a 
21-yard pass from Todd Davidson. The pair also combined for the two-point 
conversion. Burbank scored on Chris Pene's one-yard run with 5:04 left in the 
game. Sparks completed 10 of 21 passes for 104 yards. KIRBY LEE

Crescenta Valley 31, Hoover 7 -- Javier Pimentel scored two touchdowns and Pat 
Kennelly had a 75-yard interception return for a touchdown as Crescenta Valley 
rolled at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Pimentel (15 carries for 50 yards) opened the scoring for Crescenta Valley 
(5-1, 1-0) on a 10-yard run midway through the second quarter, and Kennelly 
swiped a halfback option pass by Curtis Kang and returned it for his score less 
than five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
With 26 seconds left in the second quarter, Damon Martin kicked a 32-yard field 
goal to give Crescenta Valley a 17-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Stanley Baires caught a nine-yard pass from quarterback James 
Cottrell to bring Hoover (2-4, 0-1) to within 17-7 in the third quarter, but 
Crescenta Valley countered with a one-yard touchdown run by Pimentel and a 
42-yard touchdown reception by Damon Morey from Ryan Kadletz, who completed 
five of 13 for 179 yards. NAOMI TWARD

Ronnie Cruz returned the opening kickoff of the second half 73 yards for a 
touchdown to break open a scoreless Marmonte League game Friday night and lead 
Thousand Oaks to a 21-0 victory over host Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was the third of the season for the Lancers (5-0-1, 3-0 in league 
play). 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Dave Acosta recovered a muffed punt at the Camarillo 35-yard line to 
set up another Lancer score in the third quarter. Thousand Oaks quarterback 
Scott Peterson, who completed only one of nine passes, tossed a 35-yard 
touchdown pass to Jim Magallanes on a fourth-and-10 play. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve fullback Brian Sturges gained 56 of the 59 yards on a seven-play 
Thousand Oaks drive and scored on a four-yard run midway through the fourth 
quarter for the last touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In a defensive battle, Thousand Oaks had 133 yards in offense and Camarillo 
(2-4, 1-2) gained 75 total yards. Camarillo linebacker Scott Foster registered 
four solo sacks for minus-25 yards to lead the Scorpion defense. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks fullback Chris Foster (24 yards in three carries) left the game 
after less than three minutes with an injury to his left knee and did not 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo running back Tim Cornish led the Scorpions in rushing with 28 yards 
in eight carries. PAUL OLSON

RELENTLESS GRANADA HILLS OVERPOWERS TAFT, 34-7

<P>
Great Scots! Isn't it about time somebody came up with a nickname for the 
Granada Hills High defensive unit? 
</P>
<P>
How does the Fearsome Elevensome grab you? 
</P>
<P>
The Mean Green Wrecking Machine? 
</P>
<P>
Tartan Curtain? 
</P>
<P>
"Just call us relentless for now," Highlander linebacker Kirk Langer said. 
</P>
<P>
That'll do. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, the Valley area's top-ranked team, was relentless and then some 
in defeating Taft, 34-7, Friday night in a Northwest Valley Conference game at 
Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-charging Highlanders (5-0, 2-0 in conference play), who have allowed 
just 34 points in five games, did not give up an offensive touchdown for the 
second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (2-2, 1-1) scored when Highlander quarterback Bryan Martin ran into 
running back Leon Glasgow on a broken play, fumbled and Bernard Gregory 
recovered the ball in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
By then, however, Granada Hills had already scored 27 points and was 
comfortably ahead in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders picked off three passes, returning one for a touchdown, and 
forced a fourth turnover on a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback-linebacker Brett Washington led Granada Hills on both sides of the 
line, scoring touchdowns on runs of 59 and seven yards, and making key 
defensive stops. He finished with 172 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Martin completed eight of 12 for 141 yards and two touchdowns to William 
Moringlane.

MOORPARK, ON THE RISE, DOWNS OAK PARK, 27-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Oak Park High got a look at the future. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
Playing Friday night against perennial doormat Moorpark High, the visiting 
Eagles were beaten, 27-10, in a Tri-Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising Moorpark is 5-1 overall, 1-0 in league play. Oak Park, which 
finished second in league play last season, fell to 4-2, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles can probably expect more of the same in years to come. Moorpark is 
growing as a community, the high school is getting bigger and its football team 
is likely to keep getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our first game last week and people doubted we had the talent to play 
with good teams," Moorpark quarterback Robert Hernandez said. "This was a big 
game for us." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez led a balanced attack as he ran 16 times for 61 yards and completed 
six of 10 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Running back Tony Upshaw rushed 
15 times for 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle quarterback Mike Stern completed seven of 14 passes for 105 yards but 
threw two interceptions. The remainder of Oak Park's offense was provided by 
Kent Richter, who rushed 19 times for 69 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles drove 50 yards early in the first quarter and Stern kicked a 27-yard 
field goal for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the first half resembled a track meet as Moorpark raced to 
three scores. 
</P>
<P>
First, Victor Magdaleno kicked a 32-yard field goal to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Hernandez drove the Musketeers 66 yards, completing passes of 28 and 17 
yards. Jeff Cox, who finished with 10 rushes for 65 yards, scored on a one-yard 
dive. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park couldn't move the ball, and on Moorpark's next possession, Cox broke 
around right end for 26 yards. A few plays later, he scored again and Moorpark 
led, 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
A Hernandez interception in the third quarter led to Oak Park's only touchdown. 
Stern ran six yards for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno kicked a 27-yard field goal and, on the ensuing possession, Oak Park 
tried a flea-flicker that ended with wide receiver Jeff Gibbons throwing the 
Eagles' third interception. Hernandez threw 10 yards to Tom Uphoff for a 
touchdown to ice the game.

DAVE DISTEL: SO WHAT THE H IS BRINSON DOING AS THE H-BACK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Brinson is an unlikely guy. 
</P>
<P>
A what? 
</P>
<P>
Unlikely guy. 
</P>
<P>
Unlikely to what? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it had to be considered unlikely that Dana Brinson would be 
wearing a Charger uniform here in the sixth week of the regular season. After 
all, he was drafted in the eighth round, which is only a step or two above 
being the last guy selected in a playground basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, he came to camp with a gold loop and a diamond stud in his left ear 
and flapped his mouth about derailing Little Train James, only about the most 
popular guy on the roster. This earned him a few cheap shots in practice before 
he had the sense to have his words for dessert after a team meal. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing you know, James is gone and Brinson is doing the things James 
did. He is running with the ball and catching passes and returning kicks. And 
doing rather well. 
</P>
<P>
All of that was unlikely enough. 
</P>
<P>
And now we look up and find that Dana Brinson will be starting at H-back Sunday 
against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Understand that Brinson stands 5-feet-9, presumably in his cleats, and weighs 
167 with his jewelry. That's just about the right size for a kick-returner, 
point guard or busboy, but a little small for an H-back. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, today's H-back is more like a bouncer or body guard. He hardly even 
needs hands, just forearms. Joe Caravello, 6-3, 270, is an H-back. Dana Brinson 
could use Caravello's pants as a sleeping bag. As a matter of fact, when you 
see Brinson in the locker room, you wonder if maybe he fell out of someone's 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Bernstine, 6-3 and 238, is normally the starting H-back, but he is injured 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
So Dana Brinson gets the call to play a position that would seem completely 
foreign to what he does best, which is run and catch. Brinson becomes a 
blocker, which is a little like Woody Allen playing Shakespeare. He wouldn't 
seem to be into the heavy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute, Brinson argued, we're forgetting that he played his college 
football at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a wingback at Nebraska," he said, "you block. You get to run a 
reverse once in a while, but you spend a lot of time blocking linebackers and 
defensive ends . . . things of that nature." 
</P>
<P>
As Brinson sat in the locker room late one afternoon this week, he seemed a bit 
more subdued than the brash rookie I had been expecting to encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a position change," he was explaining. "I'm adding another 
position. I'm just going to go and give it an all-out effort. I'm not going to 
say I can do the same job as a bigger guy, but I'll give that kind of effort." 
</P>
<P>
Quite likely, the harsh realities of life in the NFL have toned this young man 
down a bit. In truth, the mere fact that he was able to make the team 
underscored how tenuous a football career can be. Before training camp this 
year, for example, no one imagined that Lionel James' job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
In beating James out, Brinson has come away with an understanding that he, too, 
can be beaten out. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not just competing for a job with guys on your team," he said. "You're 
competing with guys from throughout the NFL. And the Canadian league, too. If 
some team cuts some other guy, you've got to be better than him or he'll 
replace you. You can never be complacent." 
</P>
<P>
With that understanding, Brinson knows it does not hurt at all to be as 
versatile as possible. He has already played wide receiver, running back and 
returned punts, and now he gets his latest role. 
</P>
<P>
"He's developed into a guy who can fill a lot of roles," Coach Dan Henning 
said. "We liked what we were seeing in training camp, and we put him into our 
first preseason game against Dallas, and he passed muster." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's high school heroes might take note of the fact that Brinson first 
caught Henning's eye when Henning was coaching the Atlanta Falcons. Brinson was 
a kid at Valdosta High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew of him in high school," Henning said, "and he was already an 
all-around type guy then." 
</P>
<P>
When it came time for the 1989 NFL draft, Brinson's chances of going high were 
hurt by (a) Nebraska's offensive philosophy and (b) a less-than-spectacular 
senior year. But, said Henning, his name kept popping up on the Charger board 
as a backup wide receiver and punt returner. An eighth-round pick was certainly 
not a chancy place to take a guy who may or may not make it. 
</P>
<P>
"The odds were pretty much totally against me," Brinson said, "but I had my 
heart and mind set. I came here and set goals I wanted to reach." 
</P>
<P>
One, he admitted, was simply to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Another," he said, "is to be the best that I can be." 
</P>
<P>
Achieving the first has given him a shot at the second. He does not know how 
good he can be, nor does he care to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone else," he said, "can decide that." 
</P>
<P>
And so we are left with one more unlikely twist in the saga of Dana Brinson, 
wide receiver, running back, punt returner and now H-back. Not too long ago, it 
seemed very unlikely that humility would be a trait associated with the kid who 
calls himself D-Rock . . . especially now that he has made it.

EL CAMINO QUICKLY SHOCKS NO. 4 SAN PASQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Pasqual Coach Mike Dolan said he tried to simulate El Camino's quickness in 
practice this week. Immediately Friday night, Dolan realized that was a foolish 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anybody as quick as they do on our whole team," Dolan said after 
his No. 4-ranked and previously undefeated team was outscored, 27-0, and 
outgained, 330-39, at San Pasqual. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave No. 6 El Camino sole possession of first in the Avocado League 
at 3-0. San Pasqual dropped to 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual's defense never could seem to catch or find El Camino scatback 
Brian Madlangbayan (5-feet-6, 165) or quarterback Joe Malek (5-4, 160). And its 
offense could never come close to blocking El Camino's small-but-quick 
linebackers, Peau Atoe, Dwayne Webb and Dennis Duren. 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan ran for three touchdowns and 101 yards in 14 carries, and Malek 
ran for 48 yards and a touchdown in nine rushes. 
</P>
<P>
While the defense was searching high and low for them, fullback Von Robinson 
was busting up the middle for 95 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Madlangbayan said his team was playing with a little extra intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year they beat us twice; that just really stuck with me," Madlangbayan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those two losses came in the 2-A playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, Atoe and Duren spent much of their evening in the San Pasqual backfield, 
holding the vaunted San Pasqual rushing game to 30 yards in 23 carries -- more 
than 200 yards under its average. 
</P>
<P>
"You come out here, and you blink, and all of a sudden, he's doing chin-ups on 
the quarterback's face mask," Dolan said of Atoe. "Those are the three quickest 
linebackers we've seen. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino played a nearly flawless in the first half, scoring on three of its 
four drives and never punting. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino outgained San Pasqual, 179-15, in the half and held San Pasqual 
fullback Cullen Owen (100 yards a game) to four yards in four carries, one of 
which was fumble that led to Madlangbayan's second touchdown, a 19-yard run. 
Owen finished with 13 yards in five carries. San Pasqual's furthest penetration 
was the San Pasqual 38 early in the fourth quarter. DAVE McKIBBEN

THEATER: WILL 'MACBETH,' THE LAST PLAY OF THE LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE SEASON, PROVE 
TO BE A GOOD LUCK CHARM FOR THE FINANCIALLY BELEAGUERED THEATER? THE ARTISTIC 
DIRECTOR HOPES SO.

<TEXT>
<P>
Des McAnuff, the artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse, identifies with 
Macbeth. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say he has committed any murders in Scotland, or that he has his 
eyes on a throne. But "Macbeth," which McAnuff directs for a Sunday-night 
opening at the Mandell Weiss Theatre, is, by his own admission, one of his 
favorite plays. He has been reading and rereading it since he was 11, when he 
was introduced to the story via a Classic comic book. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, I remember the pose of Macduff standing with his foot over the 
body of Macbeth," McAnuff recalled outside the Mandell Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
He can't say why he has been drawn to that play ever since, but, like a gem 
that turns to show its different facets, it has presented more sides to explore 
as he himself has grown, McAnuff said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I directed it, I thought of it as a transition from pre-feudal 
to feudal society," he said. "I was also interested in the whole notion of what 
happens to a country when assassinations are unraveling a society. I grew up in 
the '60s, when the Kennedy assassinations hit close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose, at 37, you have a slightly different reaction than you did at 29. 
This is a play about two people who love each other profoundly. I think the 
difference is that I feel more for the couple." 
</P>
<P>
Six years between productions of "Macbeth" have seen much ground covered for 
McAnuff professionally as well. 
</P>
<P>
He first directed it for the Stratford (Ontario) Shakespeare Festival in 1983, 
just before he moved to San Diego to take over the artistic helm at the 
playhouse. In the ensuing seven seasons, he has directed two playhouse shows on 
Broadway: "A Walk in the Woods" and "Big River," for which he won a Tony for 
best director of a musical. 
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the La Jolla Playhouse has become one of the country's 
leading regional theaters. Since 1986, however, it has also been accumulating a 
deficit, leading to a recent public declaration that it will cancel its 1990 
season if it can't raise $500,000 by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff and the theater's business manager, Alan Levey, say the financial 
problems are due in large part to the difficulty in sharing theater space 
during the school year with UC San Diego. The arrangement means the playhouse 
has the shortest season and fewest seats per season of any League of Resident 
Theaters in its category. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem arises in doing shows at the Mandell Weiss and the smaller 
Warren Theatre, also at UCSD. The playhouse can sell only enough season tickets 
to fill the 248-seat Warren but some of the plays in the season will be shown 
at the 492-seat Mandell Weiss. That means the playhouse must rely on separate 
sales to fill shows at the larger venue. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is suggesting that the reception of "Macbeth" will make or 
break the playhouse's fund-raising drive, this couldn't be a better time for 
the theater to have a hit on its hands. "Macbeth," the final show for the 1989 
season, extends the playhouse season into November for the first time -- giving 
the theater a chance to show that San Diego audiences will support the 
playhouse as more than a summer theater. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, this may be the first time since 1986 in which the playhouse 
ends the season in the black and reduces its standing deficit. That, according 
to Levey, would be "a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, McAnuff does not want to talk about budgets, which he said 
will not affect his plans for "Macbeth." The budget for the show was set at the 
beginning of the season, so it will be performed, as planned, by 26 actors in 
the era it was written for, 11th-Century Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff just wants to talk about "Macbeth" the play, and about relationships 
that last, including his marriage to actress Susan Berman. They two have no 
children, and he said that gives him some insight into the Macbeths. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a play about two people who love each other profoundly and don't have 
a child. If you don't have a child, then the career of one of those people 
becomes the child. In 'Macbeth,' it drives them to actual murder." 
</P>
<P>
Long-term relationships with professional associates are also important to 
McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
John Vickery, who stars as Macbeth, was first hired by McAnuff to play the lead 
in his play "The Death of Von Richthofen as Witnessed From Earth" in 1980. 
Vickery had to dye his dark hair blonde for that one. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McAnuff has directed him in "Henry IV, Part 1" at the Delacorte 
Theatre in New York, and Vickery has starred in four La Jolla Playhouse 
productions: "A Mad World, My Masters," "Romeo and Juliet," "A Man's a Man" and 
"The Sea Gull." 
</P>
<P>
Both McAnuff and Vickery appreciate the shorthand in communication that comes 
from working with someone for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a relationship, it helps because you have a lot to do in five 
weeks," McAnuff said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Vickery: "Over the years, we've had several conversations which go, 'I 
think,' 'You know,' 'I know what you mean.' " 
</P>
<P>
Both men reject the theatrical notion that "Macbeth" is an unlucky play. The 
work, often referred to as "the Scottish play" by skittish actors, is supposed 
to bring bad luck to those who use what is called the "M" word in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Vickery, who comes from Scottish ancestry, has no problem with saying the word 
Macbeth in his dressing room, and has a theory on why others do. He figures 
that, because of all the sword play in "Macbeth," actors tend to get hurt and 
so they associate the work with bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
But the playhouse is definitely looking to "Macbeth" as a potential source of 
good luck. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the special agreement that allows it to use the Mandell Weiss during 
the school year, the playhouse will be using seven acting students, three 
designers, two assistant directors and a production assistant from UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Students will not only be on stage, but in the theater seats. The playhouse is 
finding a new audience in the UCSD and San Diego State University students 
whose classes are, for the first time, in full session during the playhouse 
season, Levey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that it is a good time of year to be operating because the 
schools are fully operational," he said. "We see October and November as prime 
months to be marketing theater. We've seen a strong response from the student 
body in terms of sales of student-priced tickets." 
</P>
<P>
If sales and support, in the form of contributed income, result in the 
playhouse producing at this time next year, this may be the first "Macbeth" in 
history with a happy ending.

POP BEAT: THE WRITER TURNED RAPPER: YOUNG M.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pop music world is full of professional songwriters who have stepped into 
the spotlight to star as performers in their own right: Neil Sedaka, Carole 
King and Neil Diamond are among the better-known names. 
</P>
<P>
But in rap, generally a producer's and performer's medium where there is no Tin 
Pan Alley or Brill Building tradition, there's just one: Young M.C. 
</P>
<P>
True, Marvin Young (his real name) only penned two songs for another artist 
before recording his own album. But what a pair of songs. "Wild Thing," 
recorded by Tone-Loc, stands as the first hard-core rap song ever to reach No. 
1 on Billboard's pop singles chart, and its follow-up, "Funky Cold Medina," 
rose nearly as high. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for less than two hours' work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never written for anyone before Loc," Young, 22, said, sitting in a West 
Hollywood hotel conference room as a television crew from the weekly syndicated 
"America's Top 10" TV show set up their equipment around him. The presence of 
the cameras is a testament to the fact that his own "Bust a Move" single and 
"Stone Cold Rhymin' " album are the hottest things in rap right now. Both are 
also among the year's biggest hits in the pop field. The single this week is 
No. 9, while the album is No. 22 and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
"(Producers and Delicious vinyl owners) Matt Dike and Michael Ross came to me 
with a title and an instrumental track and said write a song called 'Wild 
Thing.' I'm not lying -- I wrote it in 35 minutes. 'Funky Cold Medina' took a 
little over an hour." 
</P>
<P>
If his interest in productivity sounds like something you'd expect from an 
economics major, that's what he is. Young, born in London and raised in Hollis, 
Queens, New York, graduated from USC last spring with a B.A. in economics. 
</P>
<P>
"I was intending to get a 9-to-5 if I didn't get signed," said Young who opens 
for Boogie Down Productions on Friday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim and 
Oct. 23 at the Palace. "I probably would have gone to Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
That's also reflected in his attitude toward his album, a boisterous collection 
of breezy narratives and good-natured boasting, including "Principal's Office," 
the best teen misadventure tale since Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's 
"Parents Just Don't Understand." It's a sharp contrast with the mature, low-key 
young man present for the interview. In economic terms, Young utilizes 
distinctly laissez-faire and prime-the-pump philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"The direction I want to go in is more political, not so happy-go-lucky," he 
said. "But I have to be that way at the beginning to have people listen to me." 
</P>
<P>
On the album, only the anti-drug "Just Say No" even touches on Young's serious 
side. (For more of that, check out his two hard-hitting contributions to the 
upcoming album, "Silent Assassin," by Sly and Robbie and produced by Boogie 
Down Productions' KRS-One.) 
</P>
<P>
"Matt and Mike did the music," he said. "I have no interest in it. The less I 
know the better -- if we have a sampling (dispute), Marvin doesn't know where 
it came from. He's safe." 
</P>
<P>
But Young doesn't underestimate the impact the success of the record could have 
on the rap world. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is rap is in an early stage now," he said. "Where you've got great 
writers of pop, it's because they've written songs that have sold across the 
board. That hadn't happened in rap yet. But now with 'Funky Cold Medina' and 
'Bust a Move,' you have one entity that is behind a bunch of material." 
</P>

Amphitheatre for a six-night stand, Dec. 26-31. Tickets go on sale Sunday. . .

'MIKADO' CHOREOGRAPHER BELIEVES IN THINKING MAN'S APPROACH TO DANCE 
</P>

<P>
Most dancers learn new routines with their bodies, not their brains. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Velasco uses the thinking man's approach to dance, however, and it has 
paid dividends in his career as dancer, choreographer, and instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"I use the free-style technique. It's a very intellectual way of looking at 
dance," he said in a pre-curtain interview at Old Town Theatre. Velasco had 
just completed the choreography for United States International University's 
production of "The Mikado" at The Theatre in Old Town through Oct. 22. He 
appeared unconcerned about the way his cast -- many of whom are basically 
non-dancers -- would handle his tricky motor combinations. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they'll be fine," he said. "Dancers in musical theater have to adapt to 
many different styles, such as ballet and jazz. But you can look at an attitude 
without being trapped in any inherent style. The idea is to break it apart -- 
just break down the movement -- and forget about whether it's ballet or jazz or 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Working with actors, rather than highly trained dancers, makes choreography for 
musical theater a tricky business. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it would be great if you had gorgeous, wonderful dancers," he said, "but 
you've got to take the point of the song, and make that point in dance. That's 
really what's important in musicals." 
</P>
<P>
By ignoring labels and concentrating on the basic elements that underline all 
types of dance, Velasco has taught hundreds of aspiring dancers how to cope 
with the spectrum of movements called for in musical theater pieces. He also 
has used this free-style technique in his work as a choreographer -- to push 
his dancers beyond their limitations. 
</P>
<P>
In his first solo venture as a musical theater choreographer -- developing the 
stylish mix of dances for the '60s soap opera "Suds" -- Velasco earned top 
honors from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The show was such a hit in its first incarnation at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre that it was picked up by the Old Globe. The show also was performed in 
New York's Criterion Center, Toronto and Phoenix. And Velasco was there. 
</P>
<P>
This year he was nominated again by the local critics circle for his inventive 
dance designs in the off-beat production of "In Trousers" for Potpourri 
Productions/Two on the Aisles. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad track record for a late bloomer in the dance world. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a student of Jack Tygett's (director of the musical theater program at 
USIU) in a magnet program when I was in high school in Chula Vista," Velasco 
said. "I didn't start until I was 15, and I really had an unfortunate body for 
dance. I have bad feet, and I'm not a body-beautiful. But, because I started 
late, it was a passion with me. And the first day I started dancing, I started 
making up steps of my own." 
</P>
<P>
Tygett recognized Velasco's talent and offered to get him a scholarship at USIU 
to ensure his professional development. 
</P>
<P>
"After only two quarters, Jack asked me to teach free-style technique," Velasco 
said. "He didn't have anyone who could teach that method. The problem was, I 
couldn't continue as a student if I decided to accept the teaching job. But I 
took it anyway, and I've been teaching since about 1979 -- both at USIU and at 
the School for Creative and Performing Arts in Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Although Velasco insists his physique inhibits him as a dancer, he is still 
sought after to perform. In fact, Starlight's Don and Bonnie Ward (with whom he 
has worked on more than half a dozen shows in the past few years) snared him 
for a dance-based role in their upcoming production of "La Cage aux Folles," 
heading for a Civic Theatre run Nov. 9-19. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought of him immediately when we were casting because he did such a good 
job for us in 'Annie Get Your Gun,' " said Bonnie Ward, Starlight's co-artistic 
director. "We've used him since he was a kid, and he's a very good musical 
theater dancer, even though he misjudges himself as a dancer. He's really 
gotten into choreography now, and he has a knack for many different styles." 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, however, says he doesn't need the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm perfectly happy dancing in a room by myself," he said. "I don't need an 
audience. Not at all. It's kind of like I'm letting them watch me. I don't need 
anyone to say, you're good, and I don't need the audience to applaud." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Velasco has managed to charm audiences and critics alike with his 
performing brio and a veritable grab-bag of choreographic surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh twists incorporated in this delightful staging include an acrobatic romp 
that has audiences applauding even before the overture is over, stunning 
tableaux for the ensemble, and a fascinating combination of motional patterns 
-- all true to the Oriental mood of this Gilbert and Sullivan masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of it," Velasco said. "If things work, fine. Otherwise, the 
show is going to be over in a month, so what does it matter? People expect 
things from me. They want my personality to show through." 
</P>
<P>
Would he like a crack at a company of serious dancers to mold and shape at 
will? 
</P>
<P>
"I've toyed with the idea, but it would have to be on my terms. I feel very 
strongly about what I want to put on stage," he stressed.

THE FBI AND ITS COMPLAINT ABOUT N.W.A'S RAP LYRICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Compton Rappers Versus the Letter of the Law," by Steve Hochman (Oct. 5), is a 
disturbing article. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what Rep. Don Edwards, the ACLU and the recording industry seem to 
believe, the advocacy of violence is not protected by the U.S. Constitution. 
The FBI was correct to express its concern on behalf of law enforcement to 
Priority Records over the lyrics in N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that some people think money can be made by inciting the ignorant to 
rise up against authority. This can result only in chaos. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how Rep. Edwards would react if N.W.A expressed outrage against the 
Congress? I think he might be singing a different song.

CHUNG AND BRANDO

<TEXT>
<P>
I always knew that TV's Connie Chung was a lightweight, and her interview with 
Marlon Brando last Saturday proved it. It was like a teeny-bopper journalist 
asking questions of a rock idol. She was weak and obviously intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Brando's arrogance, his jerklike acting and his demeaning of his profession 
made him less than a riveting interviewee. But wouldn't a Mike Wallace or a Sam 
Donaldson or a Barbara Walters have challenged him -- and given us more of an 
insight into this very private and talented man?

<TEXT>
<P>
Re the Oct. 7 article on the movie "War Party": 
</P>
<P>
Let me see if I understand this. In the entire United States of American were 
there no actors other than Kevin Dillon (a white) and Billy Wirth (whose 
great-great grandmother was American Indian) qualified to play the leading 
American Indian roles in this film? 
</P>
<P>
I realize that name recognition is important to producers, but surely these 
fine young actors could have played the leading white roles. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if it has occurred to the film's producers to contribute some 
(probably tax-deductible) portion of the film's proceeds to improve the 
possibility that the people they are exploiting will survive into adulthood?

SOMBER OVERTONES WITH BEMIS AND DEJARNETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When musicians form a new group, then try out their musical departure in a 
decidedly out-of-the-limelight locale such as Long Beach's basement-room 
Beneath Broadway theater, it may not be entirely sporting to review their first 
show. But the acoustic-folk debut of singer-violinist Ann DeJarnett and 
singer-guitarist Jimmy Bemis at that venue Thursday evening easily held up to 
the early scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Bemis' previous allegiance had been with the raw, punkish Chain Gang, while 
DeJarnett, with the Falcons, had crafted some of the most distinctive and fully 
realized original rock music to have come out of Orange County (with somewhat 
watered-down examples available on two releases on Orange's Dr. Dream Records). 
Though it was a shame to see that outfit jettisoned earlier this year, the new 
music DeJarnett is making with Bemis also has the promise of becoming something 
special. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-song performance opened with three Bemis originals, which at present 
are the duo's strongest suit. Bemis writes in a somber vein, but entirely 
unlike the crop of young detached gloom coming out of England in the last few 
years. His moody lyrics and delivery seem rooted in a dark, but very present, 
landscape, recalling in a small way British folk singer Bert Jansch (who, 
incidentally, is making a rare stateside appearance at McCabe's in Santa Monica 
on Oct. 21). 
</P>
<P>
Bemis' thick, slightly mushed vocals probably won't get him on "Star Search," 
but they were ideally suited to the dusky illumination called for by such lines 
as "The night holds no mystery / The universe bears no love / And the branches 
of the hanging tree embrace the mourning dove" from the pair's opening song, 
"Traveller." 
</P>
<P>
The other great advantage to Bemis' songs was DeJarnett's supporting violin 
work. Where her electric fiddle excursions with her former band rarely took 
full advantage of her classical training, the acoustic setting allowed more 
nuance and shading to her playing, which settled a Celtic moodiness about 
Bemis' vocals. If there is one curse to her classical background, it is that 
her solo fills still followed set lines rather than relying on the spirit of 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Switching to rhythm guitar for her own songs, DeJarnett sang "Longest Day of 
the Year" from her 1988 album, "Possessions," and two unreleased songs, "Frozen 
Reasons" and "Farewell Again," each drawing on the interior emotional 
landscapes that mark much of her previous work. As with her violin, the 
acoustic backing allowed a greater range of expression in her singing -- 
particularly in the confiding tone and controlled vibrato of "Farewell Again" 
-- though one might also miss the raw fury she often achieved with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the basement of downtown Long Beach's Broadlind Hotel, Beneath 
Broadway is a venue ideally suited to introducing new things. Decidedly 
Bohemian with its subterranean location, thrift shop furniture and cushions 
spread across the floor (there are also a couple more cats slinking about than 
are found in the average nightclub), the tiny theater routinely offers 
open-mike time to aspiring poets and musicians, and a variety of music and 
drama events, not unlike the spirit at the former Huntington Beach club Safari 
Sam's.

MOZART, RACHMANINOFF PROGRAM AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The virtue of contrast as an all-sustaining program principle got a severe test 
Thursday evening at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Andre Previn and the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic paired glossy Technicolor romanticism with a sort of flat 
brown classicism. 
</P>
<P>
Not, of course, that anyone intended anything quite so drab with Mozart's 
Violin Concerto in D, K. 218. There was concertmaster Sidney Weiss giving a 
warm, solid, singing account of the solo part. There was Previn, encouraging 
brio and balance, and there was the suitably down-sized Philharmonic 
contingent, playing blithely if somewhat thickly. 
</P>
<P>
But it never quite meshed into a unified -- let alone compelling -- statement. 
In each movement there were notable divergences between Weiss and the band, and 
the fitfulness of the finale seemed more a matter of befuddlement than 
spontaneity or whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss brought a self-effacing sincerity and more than ample technical resources 
to the task. He challenged himself with a major, stylistically incongruous 
cadenza for the first movement, reduced the passage work to etude routine and 
spun out a wonderfully connected, genteel cantabile in the middle movement. 
</P>
<P>
The faceless pallor of the Mozart effort seemed more pronounced after 
intermission, when Previn and the full orchestra returned with Rachmaninoff's 
Second Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a performance with immediacy and an unanswerable rightness to it -- 
vast and vivid, yet firmly focused. Previn takes his Rachmaninoff uncut, and 
almost convinces us that past impressions of redundant sprawl in the work are 
the product of interpretive compromises. 
</P>
<P>
In allowing Rachmaninoff his full say, Previn reveals the sure if idiosyncratic 
sense of proportion under the bombast and sentiment. He also provides an 
enhancing context for the sudden emotional shifts, suggesting that all the 
sound and fury signifies much. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic responded heroically. The playing was cohesive and burnished 
throughout the orchestra, attentive to Previn's caressive phrasing and 
well-balanced other than in the finale, where the strings were submerged. 
</P>
<P>
The accomplishment was greeted by an apparently almost-unanimous standing 
ovation from the large crowd. JOHN HENKEN

JONSON'S 'ALCHEMIST' UPDATED BY A 'SCOUNDREL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You had to smile, learning that actor-playwright Gregory Mortensen had adapted 
Ben Jonson's Renaissance London comedy, "The Alchemist," into a Gold Rush-era 
San Francisco comedy called "The Scoundrel." Jonson, Shakespeare's chief rival, 
is rarely done anymore, and when he is, it's usually "Volpone." His comedy is 
caustic, mellowed only by a lilting verse style. It would be nice to hear 
actors deal with the original Jonson, but we'll take any updating with a title 
like "The Scoundrel." 
</P>
<P>
It suggests a nastier, wilder version of Jonson. Then why does everything feel 
so reined in at the Grove Shakespeare Festival's Gem Theatre? 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a new problem at this theater. Two summers ago, on its outdoor 
stage, the Grove did a very safe updating of Moliere's "The Imaginary Invalid." 
Its New Orleans setting did nothing to spark the actors, or make us think of 
Moliere in a new way. So why update it? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the suspicion is that the classics in original dress will scare away the 
crowds. You hope that you're wrong, but it's hard to find any other 
justification for doing Jonson with a soft underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Mortensen's adaptation has clever touches, beginning with the sense 
that the Barbary Coast is ripe for a farce about swindlers and those they 
hoodwink. Jonson's alchemist, Subtle, told his customers that he could make 
gold, and gold is the reason for the San Francisco boom town. Mortensen has 
changed the names -- Subtle is now Dr. Alerdyce T. Smooth (Daniel Bryan 
Cartmell), his assistant Face is now Lucien Marmott (Mortensen), partner Dol 
Common is now Cassie Spooner (Cherie Brown). The characters, vices and motives 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
The big motive is to swindle as many folks out of their gold as soon as 
possible before Lucien's master returns from the sea. Underneath, Lucien and 
Smooth have designs on each other. There is no one scoundrel in "The 
Scoundrel." In fact, Mortensen's ending one-ups Jonson for farcical cynicism, 
and it's here that we get a sense of the real Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, things are awfully tame. Stripped of the verse and the characters' 
florid visions of their own fortunes, "The Alchemist" is essentially a series 
of episodes where the con men dupe various innocents, and then the tables are 
turned on them. "The Scoundrel" is just that stripped-down version, without new 
twists. Good farce, even if it has episodes, makes us rise above them. 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen might have a better farce, though, with a production that took more 
risks. Director Thomas F. Bradac has a conservative sensibility, which is the 
right one for some plays, but not for this one. Both Cartmell and Mortensen, 
two Grove stalwarts, look and sound uninspired, despite all of their delicious 
costume changes. Their movements are too studied and careful for the farce to 
fly, which has a chain reaction effect on the ensemble. Brown's Cassie should 
be a ribald hussy, but she is anachronistically middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
A few actors loosen the reins a bit, and express themselves. We know Bud 
Leslie's perplexed shop owner is in for big trouble the second he walks in the 
door, and he's perfectly counterbalanced by Rick Tigert's fatuous Sir Egmont, 
who is the closest thing here to what Jonson had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Morales' set also looks hemmed in, missing the indulgent splendor that the 
Gold Rush winners enjoyed. But indulgence, or the dream of it, is what we have 
to see if the comedy is to work at all. The ingredients are here, but it feels 
like fool's gold. 
</P>

 At 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, on Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
Sundays, 3 and 7 p.m. Through Nov. 4. Tickets: $16-$20; (714) 636-7213.

'I, MADMAN': STYLISH HORROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For its title maniac, the stylish horror thriller "I, Madman" (citywide) has an 
apparently dead pulp writer who was prone to acting out the gruesome violence 
of his lunatic characters, and who is apparently brought back to life by the 
imagination of a young woman who finds his novels in a used book shop. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently because the script provides little in the way of reason or 
explanation for any of the weird stuff going down; the villain may be nutso, 
but the screenplay is feeling a little mad itself. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsensical and silly as "I, Madman" often is, die-hard genre fans may want to 
seek it out because Canadian director Tibor Takacs (whose only previous feature 
was "The Gate") has a real sense of style that pulls you in and makes you pay 
attention even when the story disappoints. The scenes from the bad novels that 
the heroine fantasizes herself into take place in the '50s, but even when the 
action shifts back to the '80s, her seamy Hollywood apartment building and 
other locales have the same unsettlingly nostalgic feel found in "Blue Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
Lovely Jenny Wright ("Near Dark," "Valentino Returns") is well-cast as the 
nervous young woman who sets the gore in motion; when we first see her in a 
slip, she looks remarkably like the recent blond, '50s-ish incarnation of 
Madonna. Her policeman boyfriend, Clayton Rohner, with his 5 o'clock shadow, 
looks a lot like unshaven Tom Neal in the 1945 "Detour." Together, they 
visually complement the excellent, period-style photography by Bryan England 
and production design from Ron Wilson and Matthew Jacobs, all of whom, you 
suspect, may have studied David Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five minutes, "I, Madman" (MPAA-rated R for gore, sexuality and 
language) goes really loopy, with the mad killer from one novel doing battle 
against a stop-motion animation "Jackal boy" from the other as the terrified 
lovers look on. By that point, all subtlety, sense and good taste are long 
gone, and you either go all the way with its tongue-in-cheek craziness or you 
don't, depending probably on your stomach's fortitude and your lungs' immunity 
to the dust of trashy, forgotten old novels.

'NIGHTINGALE' ON PBS DELIGHTFUL SEASON START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Masterpiece Theatre" unfurls another season in banner style Sunday with a 
delightful, passionately real, terrifically acted comedy/drama about a British 
working-class family in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted by Jack Rosenthal from C. P. Taylor's play and directed by Robert 
Knights, "And a Nightingale Sang" airs in a single 2-hour episode at 9 p.m. on 
Channels 28 and 15 and at 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Stotts are a family not easily forgotten, the air-raid sirens and whistling 
bombs that punctuate their routine in Northern England seeming to be only a 
minor inconvenience as they go about the business of living. It's not Taylor's 
intent to trivialize war, only to demonstrate, with grace and slants of 
delicious humor, our strength and resiliency in carrying on as best we can when 
faced with extreme adversity. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Stotts, they do very well, thank you. Joan Plowright is the 
beleaguered, church-going matriarch and John Woodvine her escapist, 
piano-plunking husband. Phyllis Logan is the sensible 30-year-old daughter 
whose heart is broken by a manipulative soldier. Pippa Hinchley is the young 
flirt of a daughter who marries a simpleton soldier. 
</P>
<P>
This is a household where the occupants are likable and believable and where 
misery and happiness mingle as naturally as they do in real life. In an 
understated way, this is irresistible television. 
</P>

<P>
This is arguably the most misused tree in Southern California. Just one 
example: Several years ago, a neighbor in Echo Park built a sturdy new fence 
around his modest bungalow, a fence with brick columns connected by cast-iron 
grating. Behind the cast iron, the neighbor planted many little Italian 
cypresses, two between each brick column. 
</P>
<P>
The little trees were so cute, so skinny, so short -- not even as tall as the 
fence. Three years later, the trees were way past the fence and starting to 
look distinctly crowded. Five years later, the house seems to be cowering while 
the trees loom 40 feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Don't even think about planting this tree if you have a standard-size city lot. 
It will look ridiculous, and you will look foolish. Italian cypresses were 
meant to dot or line those noble Italian Renaissance gardens, the ones that 
marched up hill and over dale, with waterfalls and parterres. They look best in 
a park-like setting and don't appear too awkward next to tall buildings, but 
they were not meant for a tract-home hedge. 
</P>
<P>
If you already have a towering column and want to cut it down to size, go right 
ahead; the tree won't die and in most cases it won't sprout unsightly lateral 
branches. But think twice before revving up the chain saw, because once topped, 
the tree will lose its unique characteristic; that tapering spire, like a 
finger impaling the sky, will be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
Italian cypresses are such gorgeous trees, such impressive, 60-foot exclamation 
points, that it's a shame we can't all have one at the front door. It's ironic 
that a tree that never seems to look right in our yards is so perfectly adapted 
to our climate, enduring waterless summers for years on end (although it needs 
some attention with the hose in its youth). 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, the inner part of the tree becomes a heavy mess of dead needles 
and dust; blasting with a hose helps clear it out, but you can't really tell a 
clean tree from a dirty one unless you're very close. 
</P>
<P>
There is a measure of hope: Cupressus sempervirens "Swane's Golden" is a 
smaller, gold-tipped version of Italian cypress that reaches a modest 20 feet 
in height. While the color wouldn't go with everything (green-and-gold 
variegation does best against a dark background), the size might. 
</P>
<P>
For those with Renaissance acreage, the standard Italian cypress is dark green, 
but there is also a blue-green version, Cupressus sempervirens "Glauca." 
Unfortunately, the tall trees are more readily available than the "Swane's 
Golden," but be persistent. After all, who wants to live in a cowering 
house?JUDITH SIMS

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
* Check bottlebrush, azaleas, gardenias and citrus for chlorosis; use 
fertilizers with chelating materials or iron chelates to bring foliage back to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
* To "harden off" subtropical and tropical plants that are subject to frost 
damage, cut back on watering; hold off pruning until new growth starts next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
* Prepare for spring right now by planting bulbs, shrubs, trees, perennials and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
* Many begonias will hang on through October if you remember to feed and water 
them. 
</P>
<P>
* Because most camellias set too many buds, thin them out now so you'll have 
bigger and better blooms later on; leave no more than one bud on a tip. 
</P>
<P>
* Cool season color can be planted now in the form of delphiniums, primroses 
and columbine.

10 WEEKEND PROJECTS: FOLLOW A SIMPLE SCHEDULE OF THINGS TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CULP, Culp is the owner of The Organization in Los Angeles, and is 
the author of How to Conquer Clutter and Hot to Get Organized When You Don't 
Have the Time (Writer's Digest Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly everyone, it seems, has a schedule that is too crammed and hectic to 
leave enough extra time to finish those undone tasks and tackle those 
still-to-do projects. Consequently, most people walk around with a vague sense 
that they haven't quite got it all "together." 
</P>
<P>
To conquer this unfinished feeling, you can start to get all of the bits and 
pieces of your life together by setting aside 10 weekends to start, finish, 
and/or complete the following projects: 
</P>
<P>
Closet commando -- Clean out and organize all of the closets in your house. Get 
rid of clothes that are too small or outdated. If you haven't worn it in more 
than a year, you probably never will, so those items can go as well. If it 
needs to be mended, send it out, or give it to charity. Get rid of shoes that 
hurt your feet or are outdated. Clean out and organize bathroom, linen, and 
kitchen cabinets as well. Give away or toss duplicates (you don't need three 
whisks), or things you never liked and never use (those purple sheets that you 
got as a gift, but hate). Tackle one closet or cabinet at a time, and work your 
way systematically through the house. 
</P>
<P>
Go for the garage -- The garage is often the last outpost for clutter and items 
that you never use. Start early in the morning and pull everything (yes, 
everything) out of the garage. Then only put back what you need to save or use. 
Throw everything else away or give it to charity. If other people are using 
your garage for storage, call and tell them to pick up their things before you 
start. Make sure you dispose of any toxics responsibly, and if you must store 
mementos in the garage, repack them in clean boxes with clearly written labels 
on all sides and store them on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Garage sale -- Now that you've cleaned out your closets, cabinets and the 
garage, have a garage sale to get rid of your cast-offs. Price everything to 
sell -- cheap! Remember this is stuff you want to get rid of. At the end of the 
day, pack up everything that is left over, and take it directly to a charity. 
Do not take it back into the house or garage. 
</P>
<P>
Car care -- If your car needs attention, now is the time to clean out the trunk 
and glove compartment, and get the car washed, waxed, and detailed. Take the 
car in for servicing and if you need new tires, get them. After that, regular 
attention and maintenance in small doses should keep your car and you, going 
for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
Fix it -- Get everything fixed. Gather up everything in the house that needs to 
be repaired and take it out to the appropriate repair facility or call a repair 
person to come in. Clothes should go to a tailor or seamstress, small 
appliances need to go to appliance repair shops, jewelry goes to the jeweler, 
and the clock to the clock repair shop. Don't waste your time or money 
repairing things you won't wear or use, and don't try to fix everything 
yourself. You probably don't have enough time or talent to fix it all, and the 
time you save will be well worth the money spent for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Sports hero -- You can be a hero to your sports equipment by taking the time 
out to clean, repair, and/or service all of your equipment. Get your bike 
repaired, wax your skis, and get the basketball and volleyball out so you can 
pump some much needed air into them. Check your fishing gear and organize the 
tackle, and take the tennis rackets out to be re-strung. Buy any new or extra 
equipment that you need to update and add to what you already have. The next 
time a sports opportunity arises, you'll be ready to jump in and take part. 
</P>
<P>
Paper patrol -- Don't wait until tax time to organize your paper work. Get all 
of your receipts for the year in order now, and when filing time rolls around, 
you'll be well ahead of the game. While you're at it, throw out all of the 
accumulated junk mail and catalogues that have been piling up. Go through any 
boxes of papers or files that you have, and purge unnecessary papers there as 
well. Put what is left in neatly labeled file folders or boxes so that the next 
time you need a particular piece of paper, you won't have to spend 20 minutes 
searching for it. 
</P>
<P>
Read -- Get rid of all of those backed-up magazines, newspapers, catalogues and 
journals that are outdated or that you simply don't have time for, because 
they've been accumulating for such a long time. If there is an article you must 
read, clip it, and throw the rest of the periodical away. Then spend the rest 
of the weekend catching up on the reading that is really important. Make sure 
you spend time reading that self-help or business book that you've been meaning 
to get to, and polish the weekend off by escaping into that romance or spy 
novel that you've been wanting to read for months. 
</P>
<P>
Drop a line -- Catch up on all of your back correspondence. Write letters, 
notes or cards to all of your friends and relatives who are always complaining 
that you never write. Stock up on stationery, cards, post cards and postage, 
and put it all in a portable basket. Once you've caught up with the 
correspondence, you can spend a few minutes each day at breakfast -- or while 
you're watching TV -- to dash off a note or card so you don't get behind again. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday plan -- The holidays are coming, so now is the time to get a good head 
start on the activities and obligations that accompany the season. Buy your 
cards, postage, and gift wrapping. Make a list of gifts to buy, and begin 
buying some gifts now. If you'll be entertaining, plan your menus or check with 
caterers now. If you'll be traveling, firm up your travel plans. The holidays 
and the attendant activities will be upon you before you know it, and your 
advance planning can mean the difference between a happy and a harried holiday 
season.

<P>
Lord and Lady Bacon may not exactly preside over the festive doings in 
Puddledumplin at this weekend's fifth annual Theatre Arts Festival for Youth 
(TAFFY), but they and about a dozen other strolling, costumed characters will 
manage to make their presence known. 
</P>
<P>
Held on the broad lawns and three stages of Peter Strauss Ranch in Agoura, 
TAFFY is one of the most ambitious children's theater events in the Southland. 
Entertaining during the two-day event will be Peter Alsop, Dan Crow, We Tell 
Stories, J. P. Nightingale, Paul Tracey and Schwartz and Chung. 
</P>
<P>
Families may bring their own picnic lunches, set out blankets and enjoy the 
entertainment. There also will be fast food (hot dogs, sodas) for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters can help decorate the 30-foot-long balloon, from Michael Mark's 
Inflatable Art, by crawling inside and taking colored markers to the side. 
Crafts workshops include puppet making, bead stringing and origami. 
</P>
<P>
Local ethnic arts groups are scheduled for the Marble Stage and include the 
Aman Folk Ensemble, Rythyms of the Village and Teatro de los Puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $8; children under 3 are free. Peter Strauss Ranch is at 30000 
Mulholland Highway. Festival hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Sunday.

BLACK MONDAY MEMORIES HELP TO AVERT PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. LA GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They sported thick skins and took deep breaths, chomped antacid tablets and 
blamed it on the date: Friday the 13th. But above all, they managed to make it 
through the second stock market crash in as many years without panic. 
</P>
<P>
For when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190.58 points Friday 
afternoon, Southland investors and brokers were fortified by experience gained 
from Black Monday -- Oct. 19, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to jump off the 26th floor of the One Wilshire Building," 
quipped Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer whose few over-the-counter 
stocks lost little ground. 
</P>
<P>
"None of our clients are panicking," said Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of 
Newport Securities in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"People should remember that, in retrospect, the best thing anyone did in that 
situation was buy," Kilpatrick said of 1987. "The investors who sold lost it 
all, and those who did nothing didn't gain much. Situations like this create 
more opportunity than problems." 
</P>
<P>
The plunge was reminiscent of another Bad Friday, this one Oct. 16, 1987. That 
day, the stock market dropped more than 100 points, rattling investors over a 
tense weekend and setting the market up for its 508-point fall three days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses throughout the Los Angeles Basin reported increased business 
and heavier-than-usual telephone traffic Friday. But, because the fall began 
late in the trading day, many investors did not hear the news until after the 
stock market closed. 
</P>
<P>
Business was up only about 10% compared to a normal Friday at Fidelity 
Investments, a Boston-based mutual fund manager and discount brokerage. And the 
mood among investors? Much less panicky than two years ago, said Neal Litvack, 
vice president of marketing, in a telephone interview from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The tone of the people calling is much less of a knee-jerk reaction," he said. 
"People are feeling that they've been there before. People are feeling OK" 
because they know the market recovered from its last bruising. 
</P>
<P>
To handle customer concern, Fidelity is opening its 53 branch offices -- four 
of which are in Southern California -- on Saturday and is putting extra 
employees on its 24-hour phone banks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Pacific Stock Exchange in downtown Los Angeles said trading 
volume was not as heavy as it was on the Black Monday. Still, shocked and 
exhausted traders trudged off the floor of the exchange comparing Friday's 
nearly 200-point decline to the stock market crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely crazy in there, just like the crash two years ago," said 
Doug Clark, an equity trader with Legend Securities. "I started out the day 
with a whole pack of Rolaids, now I'm down to one." 
</P>
<P>
Traders say they began to sense the change shortly before noon, when they were 
deluged with wave upon wave of selling orders stemming from the surprise news 
of financing problems connected with the $6.75-billion buyout of UAL Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The government released inflation figures this morning, and they didn't seem 
particularly bad," said David Barry, a securities trader. "But when that UAL 
deal ran into trouble, we went into a self-perpetuating slide." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, officials at the Pacific Exchange say orders were executed more 
efficiently than during the October crash two years ago. And they said the 
experience of the 1987 stock market tumble helped prevent the spread of a 
general market panic. 
</P>
<P>
"It went a lot smoother this time," said Keith Zambelich, a quality assurance 
analyst at the Pacific Exchange. "We really learned a lot from Black Monday." 
</P>
<P>
David Wikle, a trader with Paine Webber, was among those least rattled by 
developments on Friday: "The market's got a long way to fall before it gets 
really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Doron Kochavi was in the research room at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los 
Angeles, writing a speech with the working title of "Ten Best Ways to Invest in 
the 1990s." It was just after noon, and quote machines started showing "major 
pressure on the sell side," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kochavi is senior vice president for investments at Wedbush, and when the 
market closed, he jumped on a conference call with technician David Holt, to 
figure out what happened. Their conclusion: 1989 was vastly different than 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no panic selling at all," Kochavi said. "We immediately got on the 
phone and faxed information to our clients to calm down and hold their hands. I 
saw it as a great opportunity to position myself to do some buying, so I was 
very much involved in trying to get some terrific bargains." 
</P>
<P>
The drop was a surprise for Steve Lauck, manager for Ashfield &amp; Co., a San 
Francisco investment firm for pension funds and wealthy individuals. Still, 
Lauck said, the market's weakness is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen this before," Lauck said. "Once the selling starts, it 
intensifies. It is clearly a shakeout in the junk bond market and mergers 
financed by junk. But we view it as a short-term phenomenon. The market is 
fundamentally attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Fears concerning the recent problems takeover targets have faced with obtaining 
financing, including through the junk bond market, touched off a ripple effect 
across a broad range of stocks, whose prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody committed suicide, but I don't think today's the day," said Marilyn 
Cohen, president of Capital Insight Brokerage in Beverly Hills. "I think 
Monday's the day." 
</P>
<P>
Investors who were crushed in the 1987 crash have rebounded in the ensuing two 
years and are investing again, Cohen said. If Friday's damage expands into 
Monday, "it's really going to take a whole generation of investors out of the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
"They were burned once, and after a second time, it's 'forget it,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Knee, a Sherman Oaks dealer in contemporary art, said he spent Friday 
afternoon putting in an order to "sell everything" when the market opens on 
Monday. Knee had his money invested largely in Sotheby's, the art auction 
house, and a computer company called Safeguard Scientific. 
</P>
<P>
If he can sell at today's closing prices, Knee's portfolio will still have 
gained 13% to 14% during the year. And once he's out of the market, he said, 
he'll be hoping the drop continues so he can buy stocks at bargain prices at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Knee said, he has no one to blame but himself for his losses. Early 
Friday morning he had an "uneasy feeling" that he wished he'd heeded: "It's 
Friday the 13th," he said, "and everything's starting to get gray." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Gumport, a Los Angeles bankruptcy attorney said: "I'm glad I don't own 
any stock." Gumport grinned and opened his briefcase to reveal a book entitled 
"Boom &amp; Bust." 
</P>
<P>
"It was bound to happen," he said. 
</P>

Sanchez, Jim Schachter, Jube Shiver Jr., Ralph Vartabedian and Teresa Watanabe

BUSH TRIES TO AVOID VETO OF ABORTION EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush sought Friday to avoid vetoing a bill funding more Medicaid 
abortions, dramatically underscoring the extent to which anti-abortion 
politicians across the country have been thrown on the defensive by a 
mobilization of abortion-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for any conflict on this," Bush told a news conference in 
disclosing that aides are negotiating with congressional leaders on a funding 
provision that he staunchly opposed in last year's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bush's efforts to temper the provision met initial resistance 
from Democrats and that he might wind up vetoing the bill in the first round of 
a long fight. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a leading abortion foe in Congress, 
said that Bush still hopes to strike a deal in a subsequent round of 
negotiations on a $156.7-billion appropriations bill for the Departments of 
Labor and Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would provide public funds for abortions in cases of rape and 
incest, as long as they were "promptly reported" to police and health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bush, who until now has supported government funding of 
abortions only when the life of the mother is endangered, would support the 
rape-and-incest expansion if time limits were placed on the reporting period 
and if only reports to police are required. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers called Bush's retreat the latest evidence of a major change 
in the national political climate that has occurred since the Supreme Court 
last July upheld a Missouri law restricting access to abortion. The ruling 
seriously eroded a landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, politicians are frightened by the threat of punishment on 
the pro-choice side," said William Schneider, a fellow at the American 
Enterprise Institute and a political analyst for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Right-to-life politicians are on the defensive everywhere because the 
pro-choice constituency has become activated by the Supreme Court ruling," 
Schneider said. "The bottom line is you cannot take people's rights away in 
this country without a ferocious reaction." 
</P>
<P>
In a stunning turnabout, the House voted this week to reverse a policy enacted 
every year since 1981 limiting federal funding of abortions to cases in which 
the mother's life was endangered. The House expanded the policy to include rape 
and incest. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey and Virginia, Republican gubernatorial candidates James Courter 
and Marshall Coleman have modified their anti-abortion stances since Democratic 
opponents attacked them extensively in media advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, an ostensibly conservative Legislature speedily axed all four 
restrictive abortion measures sought by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in a 
special session this week. 
</P>
<P>
And, in recent state legislative races in California and South Carolina in 
which abortion was a burning issue, abortion rights candidates have defeated 
anti-abortion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republican Party is making a long-term mistake (in) embracing the pro-life 
position," said John Deardourff, a consultant to Republican candidates who 
describes himself as a supporter of a woman's right to choose abortion. "Our 
candidates may soon begin feeling the negative impact of that at the polls." 
</P>
<P>
Deardourff added that Bush is "between a rock and a hard place" on the Medicaid 
funding issue. "If he vetoes this bill, it may please the pro-life forces but 
it will be extremely offensive to pro-choice women in both parties." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights leader Kate Michelman, jubilant that "even George Bush is 
hearing the pro-choice majority," declared that "a new breeze is blowing." She 
said that his shift is a clear sign that "politicians are going to have to take 
heed and understand that, if they are out of touch, they may be out of office." 
</P>
<P>
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, 
declared that polls have shown "tremendous movement to our side" since the 
Supreme Court's July ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the pro-choice community (had) not really voted on this issue" before 
the ruling, she said. But now that many see a threat to their right to choose 
an abortion, "we are becoming much more of a single-issue voting bloc because 
the stakes are so high." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion leaders, scoffing at claims of a major swing in public sentiment, 
insisted that their cause will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"While the pro-abortion movement is trying to sell a hype now that they have 
great momentum, quite frankly the relative strength of the groups hasn't 
altered much this year," said David O'Steen, executive director of the National 
Right to Life Committee. "In fact, in terms of our electoral position, we have 
done quite well. Pro-lifers have won 7 out of 10 legislative races." 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a long, drawn-out battle," said Susan Smith, the group's 
associate legislative director, on "John McLaughlin's One on One" television 
program. "I'm encouraged by what's going on in Pennsylvania, where both sides 
agree that the pro-life legislation that's been introduced (in the Legislature) 
is going to sail through."

Political analyst Charlie Cook said that the future could resemble a 
checkerboard -- with abortion-rights and anti-abortion forces winning some and 
losing some -- or it could resemble falling dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
"If a couple of more states in a row go pro-choice, you really could have a 
situation where fear is thrown into the hearts of a lot of previously pro-life 
legislators, who could cut and run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cook suggested that "Democratic pro-choice candidates need to be careful. 
They risk disaffecting some members of their base. Pro-life voters tend to be 
at the lower end of the economic and educational ladder, which by definition 
means Democratic Party base." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the abortion rights issue probably would work best when a 
candidate such as Douglas Wilder, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in 
Virginia, is behind in the polls "and needs to throw a long bomb. At least for 
now, it appears to have connected." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks Wilder, an abortion-rights advocate, has attacked GOP opponent 
Coleman for his strong opposition to abortion. The strategy has been credited 
with Wilder's dramatic resurgence in public opinion polls.

MARINES TO JOIN FRONT LINES IN FIGHT ON DRUGS

In a new move to expand the military's role in fighting drug traffic, the 
Marines on Friday agreed to join the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 
conducting training and surveillance operations along the southwest border of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the agreement, which would put Marines on the front lines 
of the drug war for the first time, comes as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
ponders a U.S. Army proposal to establish a special military task force at Ft. 
Bliss, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new military organization, to be called "Joint Task Force 6," 
would help inspect cargo, conduct reconnaissance operations and ferry drug 
enforcement agents on raids along the border between the United States and 
Mexico, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although not yet approved by Cheney, the Army proposal is the work of Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has pushed for 
a rethinking of the military's role in the fight against drugs. Powell devised 
the plan while he was commander of the U.S. Forces Command, which is 
responsible for arming and training U.S.-based Army forces for the defense of 
the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
In unveiling the Army's blueprint for the coming decade Thursday, Army Chief of 
Staff Carl E. Vuono emphasized the importance of the new drug-fighting mission, 
saying that it "is not just going to be a 1990 issue." 
</P>
<P>
National Guard and Reserve forces have been used to watch border areas in the 
past but the INS-Marine Corps agreement marks the first assignment of full-time 
military personnel to such activity. 
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts will be conducted primarily along the southern borders of 
Arizona and California, a Justice Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The two agencies acknowledged the risk of an armed clash between the training 
units and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some areas designated for joint training are heavily trafficked by drug 
smugglers," the memorandum said. "Planners will endeavor to select training 
areas and observation points which minimize the opportunity of a chance armed 
engagement." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that no more than 50 Marine officers will serve on temporary 
assignment with the INS at any one time and that Marines will be barred from 
pursuing and arresting drug smugglers. The military's role is tightly 
circumscribed by the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of 
military forces for domestic law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said that under both initiatives the military's experience 
with night-vision equipment would bring a major new capability to the drug 
interdiction effort in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership between 
the INS and the Marines, the troops' primary focus will be the "training and 
advising of civilian law enforcement officials" in the detection and monitoring 
of drug trade routes in the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"During night joint training operations, emphasis will be on ground 
reconnaissance, selection and manning of observation posts and the employment 
of night observation devices," the memorandum said.

SENATE APPROVES BARE-BONES BUDGET TO MEET DEFICIT TARGET;

FUNDING: CONGRESS RACES TO HEAD OFF SWEEPING SPENDING CUTS BY WHITE HOUSE, AS 
MANDATED BY GRAMM-RUDMAN LAW.

After more than a week of fruitless maneuvering for partisan advantage over 
capital gains, Senate leaders put aside their differences long enough on Friday 
to agree on a plan to strip hundreds of special-interest provisions from a 
$14.1-billion deficit-reduction bill. 
</P>
<P>
The move postpones long-awaited showdowns between Senate Democrats and 
Republicans over such contentious issues as a capital-gains tax cut, individual 
retirement accounts and support for child care. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement led to Senate passage Friday night of a bare-bones budget 
measure, which is designed to slice the deficit for fiscal 1990 slightly below 
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law's ceiling of $110 billion. The vote was 
87 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Congress could move quickly to rescind the widespread spending 
cuts that must be imposed by the White House on Monday to comply with 
Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is absolutely the best approach," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of 
New Mexico, senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. "We get good 
government in the fair-deal sense." 
</P>
<P>
But House leaders have not agreed to modify their own deficit bill -- which 
includes a capital gains tax cut, new federal child care support and dozens of 
other added features -- to conform to the simpler Senate version. Aides to the 
House Democratic leadership said they expect to follow the normal, 
time-consuming process of convening a conference to work out the differences 
between the two versions of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) acknowledged he could 
be at a disadvantage in any bargaining with the House. The House bill remains 
full of extra provisions useful as bargaining chips, he said, and "I don't have 
any chips left." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many of the buried special-interest provisions are expected to come 
back to life in a separate bill the Senate is likely to take up before the 
month ends. Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior Republican on the Finance 
Committee, said the agreement "ensures that we will have another tax bill very 
soon -- two or three weeks" to which the capital gains reduction, expanded 
deductions for individual retirement accounts and many other provisions could 
be added. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who acknowledged they did not have the 60 votes to boost the 
capital gains measure over Democratic procedural obstacles, contended Friday 
they will be able to muster enough forces to overcome an expected filibuster by 
opponents of a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
Although it also takes 60 of the 100 senators to end a filibuster, Republicans 
argued they would win more backing once capital gains is no longer wrapped up 
with the debate over the must-pass deficit bill. "We have a much better shot at 
capital gains with this out of the way," Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, however, vowed to fight the capital gains cut down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give a damn" about objections that a filibuster on an upcoming bill to 
raise the federal debt ceiling runs the risk of shutting down the government, 
said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to dropping literally hundreds of special-interest provisions, the 
bill also strips out a number of important measures. These include a major 
reform of Medicare payments to doctors, repeal of Section 89 employee benefit 
rules and allowing Social Security recipients to earn extra outside income. 
</P>
<P>
The bill retains only the bare minimum of revenue increases necessary to meet 
its deficit targets, including a one-year extension of the airline tax, 
narrowing of tax benefits for employee stock ownership plans, a tax on 
chemicals that harm the ozone layer and a more limited speedup of the 
collection of payroll taxes than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had 60 votes," said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), 
whose party controls the Senate with a 55-45 edge, "they would have gone ahead 
already." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, officials expressed disappointment over the decision not to 
pursue an immediate capital gains vote, but they said that Bush was likely to 
support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"This gets us back to budget basics," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters during a news conference earlier in the day that he was 
willing to consider a compromise on a capital gains tax cut, one of his key 
campaign positions, and liberalized IRAs, which Democrats have pushed as a 
politically appealing alternative to cutting capital gains taxes for the 
wealthy who benefit the most from profits on investments. 
</P>
<P>
The essential parts of the deficit measure would raise taxes by about $5.3 
billion and cut spending by $8.7 billion. But as the measure worked its way 
through eight committees, it picked up hundreds of amendments to benefit 
farmers, loggers, low-income families, the poor, the sick, the oil industry and 
higher-income retirees. 
</P>
<P>
The bill became so laden with benefits for one group or another that it had to 
include $38-billion worth of tax increases over five years to have enough money 
left over to meet deficit-reduction targets.

FOR THESE BEIRUTIS, THE NAME OF THE GAME -- SOMETIMES -- IS SOFTBALL;

Every Sunday, come rain, shine or shelling, 30 or 40 young men meet at the 
seaside sandlot of the American University of Beirut to play softball. 
</P>
<P>
The players, for the most part graduates of the university, learned to love the 
game at the feet of their American professors, most of whom left Beirut in 1985 
and 1986, when kidnaping became as popular as softball on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the world the Lebanese usually deal with, on the softball field it is 
the best arm that pitches, not the guy from the "right" religion. Indeed, the 
names heard on the field -- Omar, Henry, Hassan, Vic -- confirm what one of the 
players said: Lebanon's major religious groups are all represented. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Maronite Catholics, Shiite and Sunni Muslims, Greek Orthodox, Druze and 
Armenians play ball, not politics. Even a few Palestinians who are Lebanese 
citizens join in. And the only arguments are over balls and strikes, or whether 
the runner is safe or out. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Zakhariya, an engineer from American University's class of 1960, played 
softball as a youngster as long ago as 1948. He remembers seeing sailors from 
the 6th Fleet playing here. 
</P>
<P>
"They left their bats and balls behind," he said, "so we would have decent 
equipment to play with." 
</P>
<P>
Zakhariya has passed his skills and love of the game along to his two teen-age 
sons. He also coaches their team. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the players know the lingo. The terms "foul ball," "slide," "strike 
three," "safe at home" and the like come to them naturally -- as do some others 
that are rarely heard on American sandlots. 
</P>
<P>
"Play ball!" is apt to be followed by "Yalla!," which means the same thing in 
Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
The "tenth man" on the field is Samar Kamal, a 16-year-old girl who has been 
playing softball for four years. She acquired her love of the game from Dr. 
Henry MacAdam, a professor of history and friend of her family. 
</P>
<P>
The last American faculty member to play softball here was Alann Steen, a 
professor of journalism at nearby Beirut University College. 
</P>
<P>
Steen, one of the few American men to stay on after the kidnapings began, left 
the university campus only on Sunday mornings, and he was taken from campus to 
campus by car. A Shiite and an Armenian took turns providing the 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in January, 1987, Steen was abducted, along with two other Americans. All 
three are still in the hands of their captors. 
</P>
<P>
Another friend of softball is Jean Sutherland, the wife of Thomas Sutherland, 
another hostage. Sutherland, the acting dean of agriculture at American 
University, was abducted June 9, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Sutherland brought mitts and gloves back from a trip home to the States. 
According to one student who plays right field, "finding mitts is a big 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of bats, but balls are expensive and hard to find. One 
player said they have played with some balls until they were worn down to their 
plastic cores. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, when the AUB team went to Amman, Jordan, for a regional 
tournament, they "begged 15 used balls from the teams there." 
</P>
<P>
The players would rather think about this than their performance in Amman. They 
lost all six games, including one by a score of 19-0. This was against the U.S. 
Embassy staff. 
</P>
<P>
The drubbing serves a purpose still. When the team captain wants to put 
pressure on his teammates, he shouts, "Remember the 19-to-0 in Jordan!" 
</P>
<P>
Another game that will go down in AUB's softball annals was played last May, in 
the bright sunshine that is typical of spring in Beirut. For 45 minutes, while 
the teams played doggedly on, a Syrian gunner six blocks away sent shell after 
shell toward the blockaded ports of East Beirut, 10 miles up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the months of shelling, the players' blase attitude has faltered 
only once. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a nearby Syrian gunner caught the players by surprise. When the first 
shell whooshed overhead, the team captain shouted, "Hit the deck!" 
</P>
<P>
It may not be baseball lingo, but it makes good sense in Beirut.

AT LONG LAST, SOME CLUES TO WALLENBERG'S FATE;

SOVIET UNION: A FORMER CAMP INMATE BELIEVES HE SAW THE MAN WHO SAVED THOUSANDS

<P>
The Swedish prisoner in a remote Siberian camp looked weary, his clothes were 
tattered and he seldom spoke, but he was respected by the other inmates, who 
called him "the Baron," a Leningrad biologist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The biologist was recalling a man he believes was Raoul Wallenberg who was 
alive at least two years after Soviet authorities said Wallenberg was dead. 
</P>
<P>
In meetings that are astounding just because they are held in the Soviet Union, 
a number of Soviets are offering their recollections to the Raoul Wallenberg 
Assn. The group is still trying to determine the fate of the Swedish diplomat 
credited with saving tens of thousands of Jews from the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the biologist, Alexander A. Smovsky, identified pictures of 
Wallenberg, who was arrested by Soviet authorities in January, 1945. Smovsky, 
who spent six years in Soviet prison camps, contacted the Wallenberg Assn. 
after a Soviet television news program last week asked that anyone with 
information about Wallenberg call a special number. The association is entering 
into a computer data from people who telephone with information about 
Wallenberg, whose mother was a wealthy baroness. 
</P>
<P>
It is a remarkable change for this country, which refused for 12 years even to 
acknowledge that Wallenberg had been in its custody -- and then said he had 
died of a heart attack a decade earlier in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The shift is part of a Kremlin effort to revamp its image abroad. In line with 
this effort, the KGB is scheduled for the first time to meet Monday with 
Wallenberg's brother and sister, who are traveling here from Sweden. A 
representative of the association also will attend. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of World War II, Wallenberg was assigned by the Swedish 
government, at the urging of the Americans, to its embassy in Budapest, the 
Hungarian capital, ostensibly as a diplomat. But his real mission was to help 
save Hungarian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
He saved at least 20,000 Jews -- sometimes taking them off trains waiting to go 
to death camps -- by handing out passports that placed them under the 
protection of the Swedish Embassy. These came to be known as "Wallenberg 
visas." Some reports credit him with saving as many as 100,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
In the early weeks of 1945, as the Soviet army occupied Budapest behind the 
retreating Nazi troops, Wallenberg went with his driver to see Marshal Rodion 
Malinovsky, commander of the Soviet troops, ostensibly to discuss relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
His car was confiscated, and he was never seen again in Budapest. Moscow denied 
any knowledge of him until 1957, when it said that Wallenberg had died in a 
prison cell in 1947 of an apparent heart attack and that his body had been 
cremated. The Soviet Union expressed regret but made it clear that it 
considered the case closed. 
</P>
<P>
For 32 years, Soviet officials have clung to this version despite hundreds of 
statements from former Soviet prisoners that they had seen Wallenberg after 
1947. The most recent reported sighting placed Wallenberg in a prison camp in 
Blagoveshchensk, near the Chinese border, in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Wallenberg's half-sister, Nina Lagergren, and half-brother, Guy von Dardel, say 
they believe Wallenberg is alive. They celebrated his 77th birthday in August. 
</P>
<P>
Smovsky, 61, who was in prison camps from 1949 to 1955 for anti-Soviet 
activity, recalled meeting "the Baron" twice in 1949 in the Krasnoyarsk transit 
camp in eastern Siberia, where food was meager and the barracks icy cold. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was a titled foreigner who seemed well-educated and calm in the face 
of the rigors of prison life, "everyone paid attention to him," Smovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"He seldom spoke, although he seemed to understand Russian," Smovsky said. "I 
was told he was Swedish and very important. I think he was ill and something 
had happened to his legs, because he never stood." 
</P>
<P>
Smovsky said "the Baron" looked like he was about 40 years old, was bearded and 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
Smovsky said he had never heard of Wallenberg until two months ago, when 
someone in an office where he was waiting handed him a book about the famous 
Swede. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, I realized I knew him," Smovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
He said friends tested him by putting sets of photographs before him and asking 
him to point out the man he knew as "the Baron." 
</P>
<P>
"Each time, I pointed to Wallenberg," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail I. Danilash, 67, who was a Hungarian translator for the Soviet army, 
said he was at Soviet army headquarters in Budapest the day Wallenberg was 
arrested and met him there. He said they spoke in Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't behave like someone who had been arrested," Danilash said. "He was 
very polite, confident and questioned me about where I was born, how I came to 
be in the service of the army, how the Red Army troops behaved toward Jews and 
prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
It has never been clear why the Soviet Union detained Wallenberg. Some have 
speculated that it was because the Soviets feared he was a spy for the 
Americans. But Danilash has a simpler explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"He said to me, 'Please tell your superiors that I demand the return of my car, 
and I will not accept another car as a compromise,' " Danilash recalled. "I 
think if he had been willing to drive away in another car, he might never have 
been jailed in the Soviet Union."

CHURCH HOLDS KREMLIN RITES AFTER 71 YEARS

In a dramatic sign of the Soviet leadership's increasingly relaxed attitude 
toward religion, Russian Orthodox priests Friday conducted a service in the 
Kremlin's Uspensky Cathedral, the first religious rites in the historic church 
since 1918, 71 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of church leaders from around the world came to the service, which 
celebrated the 400th anniversary of the Moscow patriarchate and honored the 
canonization of two saints, Tikhon and Iov. 
</P>
<P>
The 15th-Century cathedral, where the czars were crowned and the leaders of the 
Russian Orthodox Church were buried, was filled with the smell of incense and 
the sound of prayer for the first time since the Bolsheviks made atheism state 
doctrine and turned the Kremlin churches into museum pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer a museum. We again gave witness of our faith to the world," 
said Archpriest Gregory Coghetti, a leader of the Russian Orthodox faith in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders, however, said they have received no assurances that they will 
be allowed to hold more services in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Patriarch Pimen, the 78-year-old leader of the Russian Orthodox Church here, 
attended the hour-long service, although he is in extremely frail health and 
had to be carried to his limousine. 
</P>
<P>
The square outside the Kremlin churches usually attracts tourists, but on 
Friday, hundreds of believers gathered, and when the priests passed by, the 
people crossed themselves and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has assured Patriarch Pimen and other 
religious leaders that the state will respect the rights of believers.

This country' Communist-led labor unions staged their first demonstration 
Friday against the Solidarity-led government. 
</P>
<P>
Union leader Alfred Miodowicz and about 150 supporters demonstrated in 
drizzling rain outside Parliament to protest an "avalanche of price rises" 
under the month-old government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
Miodowicz, whose unions claim 7 million members, said supporters were tired of 
"paper protests" and wanted action. "This demonstration in the rain is one of 
the signs that we are starting protests of a new type," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the economic crisis had turned Poland into a powder keg and rough times 
were ahead that could eventually bring the end of Mazowiecki's government. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices in Poland rose 187% in August and 51% in September after the former 
Communist government lifted price controls. Officials in the present government 
fear inflation may reach 900% to 1,000% by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Miodowicz and his mainly elderly supporters staged the union protest as 
Parliament debated a bill to index wages by pegging them to increases in the 
cost-of-living. 
</P>
<P>
A delegation handed a petition calling the bill ill-prepared and inadequate to 
Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz. Most working families were having to reduce 
consumption and many were reaching the brink of poverty, the petition said. 
</P>
<P>
Miodowicz said workers should receive full compensation for price boosts, not 
just the 80% proposed in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Miodowicz, a few months ago one of Poland's rulers on the Communist Party 
Politburo, said he did not agree with recent warnings of civil war by 
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Poland was like a time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"The present situation is very difficult, we are sitting on a powder keg," 
Miodowicz said. "Who or what is going to put out the fire? It's like a time 
bomb. . . ."

Kitty Dukakis, describing herself as an alcoholic and drug addict, Friday urged 
doctors at a World Congress of Psychiatry to avoid prescribing drugs that may 
cause addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you psychiatrists not to give in to our society's urge for a quick fix, 
not to rush to identify drugs as the first solution to your patient's problem," 
said Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors' prescriptions often complicate an alcohol and drug abuse problem, 
which addicts carefully hide from their doctors, she told the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis said her long addiction to amphetamines relapsed to alcoholism after 
her husband lost the presidential elections in 1988.

Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland resigned Friday as head of her 
minority Labor government, clearing the way for a center-right coalition to 
take power. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed a loss by her Labor Party of eight Parliament seats in the 
Sept. 11 election. It was the party's worst showing since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, 50, Norway's first female prime minister, formally handed her 
resignation to King Olav V at his castle in central Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's best to have the new government sorted out quickly," Jan Syse, 
Conservative leader and prime minister-elect, told reporters as he arrived at 
the castle, where the king asked him to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland forged a reputation as an environmental champion and fighter for 
women's rights during three difficult years of government. 
</P>
<P>
She named seven other women to her Cabinet when she took power in 1986, 
claiming it as a world record. She also pushed through laws to increase 
maternity leave and build more kindergartens. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland's work since 1983 as chairman of a U.N. commission on environment 
and development helped bring her international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Norwegian media often condemned her domineering and brash manner. 
She was also criticized for being out of the country too often during her 
environmental campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have credited her government for much of the recent economic 
recovery, but the price has been record levels of unemployment.

BAKER VOWS FULL TALKS BEFORE FBI USES FOREIGN ARREST POWERS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: PRESIDENT BUSH SAYS HE IS 'EMBARRASSED' TO LEARN THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF 
THE ISSUE.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III vowed Friday that the FBI's new power to 
seize U.S. fugitives overseas without a foreign government's permission will 
not be used without "a full interagency discussion" of all foreign policy 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly displeased that he had not known about the new legal authority until it 
was disclosed Friday by The Times, Baker said that "this is a very narrow legal 
opinion based on consideration only of domestic United States law." 
</P>
<P>
"It did not take into account international law, nor did it weigh the 
President's constitutional responsibility to carry out the foreign policy of 
the United States," Baker told reporters at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, at a news conference, said he was "embarrassed" that he did not 
know about the issue, revealing what appears to be a lack of communication 
within the Administration on a matter that could vitally affect foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the White House said in a statement that "in any given case, the 
President must weigh his constitutional responsibilities for formulating and 
implementing both foreign policy and law enforcement policy." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said "there will be no arrests abroad that have not been 
considered" by an interagency process designed to ensure that Bush considers 
the full range of foreign policy and international law considerations along 
with domestic law enforcement issues raised by any specific case. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy is a June 21 legal opinion given to Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh by Assistant Atty. Gen. William P. Barr. The opinion reversed a 
ruling dating back to the Administration of former President Jimmy Carter 
denying the FBI the authority to seize fugitives overseas without the foreign 
state's permission. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion by Barr, who is Thornburgh's chief legal adviser in his capacity as 
head of the office of legal counsel, has been dubbed "the President's snatch 
authority" by some Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Barr declined to discuss his opinion or the reasoning for overturning the 1980 
ruling on grounds that he provides legal advice throughout the Administration 
on a confidential basis. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Ahlerich, assistant FBI director for public affairs, said that the FBI 
asked for the ruling "relative to its congressionally mandated investigative 
responsibilities overseas." 
</P>
<P>
"To date, no action has been taken as a direct result of this advice," said 
Ahlerich. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned, however, that the FBI first sought the expanded authority some 
weeks before Barr's opinion in connection with a plan to forcibly abduct a 
fugitive from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
A government source declined to say if the plan, which was not carried out, had 
been presented to a special National Security Council panel that reviews all 
proposed overseas operations by the FBI and other intelligence agencies. The 
source also declined to say if the opportunity to abduct the fugitive had 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1984, he noted, the bureau "was given additional extraterritorial 
investigative jurisdiction over certain violations of federal law, primarily in 
the areas of homicide, hijacking and hostage-taking affecting American 
citizens. Currently, a number of individuals facing charges in U.S. courts 
remain at large outside this country." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that top officials in the government were unaware of the new policy 
seemed to generate as much controversy within the Administration as debate over 
the merits of the broadened power. 
</P>
<P>
One Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that on 
Friday morning Baker called Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, 
and deputy national security adviser, Robert Gates, "to talk about it, like, 
'what is this stuff?' and they didn't know about it, either." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Bush was questioned about the report of the new FBI 
authority by a journalist who asked: "Perhaps (Panamanian strongman Manuel A.) 
Noriega has something to do with that since he's a fugitive. The FBI can go 
into Panama now?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush: "I'm embarrassed to say I don't (know) what it is you're. . . . I'll have 
to get back to you with the answer to your question." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, chief spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that although 
Baker did not learn of the new authority until Friday morning, the department's 
legal counsel, Abraham Sofaer, "has been involved with this, I believe he said, 
for about the last four weeks. Judge Sofaer is on top of this for the 
secretary." 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department source, however, said that Sofaer had been aware of Barr's 
opinion when it was issued nearly four months ago. 
</P>

Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and Norman Kempster contributed to this 
report.

Pope John Paul II celebrated the final Mass of his Indonesian tour and urged 
Roman Catholics to be bold in proclaiming Christian values in the predominantly 
Muslim nation. His last Mass was attended by 100,000 people in northern 
Sumatra. In a speech to the country's 42 bishops later in Jakarta, the pontiff 
acknowledged "occasional difficulties" facing his 5 million-member flock but 
reminded them that religious freedom is protected by Indonesia's constitution.

Afghanistan said it still has Soviet military advisers but that they are only 
in Kabul province and are not involved in fighting Western-backed rebels. A 
Foreign Ministry statement broadcast by official Kabul Radio denied U.S. 
charges that Soviet military personnel still seemed to be aiding government 
forces. It said the advisers are there "for technical acquaintance with 
weapons, but they do not take part in operating the weapons." Soviet troops 
pulled out of Afghanistan last February.

WHITE HOUSE URGES DRUG PRICING RESTRAINT; 
</P>
<P>
AIDS: THE DEMAND THAT PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS BE 'SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE' POINTS UP 
THE CHANGING BUSINESS CLIMATE FOR THE DRUG INDUSTRY.

<P>
The Bush Administration on Friday weighed into the growing dispute over the 
high cost of AIDS drugs as Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services 
James O. Mason urged the pharmaceutical industry to show greater restraint in 
pricing life-extending medications. 
</P>
<P>
"The societal good has to outweigh the good of one company," Mason said at a 
press conference at a national AIDS conference here. Mounting what he termed 
his "bully pulpit," Mason, who is also serving as acting Surgeon General, 
added: "The companies that manufacture these drugs have got to be socially 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Mason's comments underscore how AIDS is altering the business equation for the 
pharmaceutical industry. Long accustomed to scientific and regulatory hurdles, 
drug companies must now also confront unusual levels of scrutiny by public 
officials and an organized, vocal and increasingly sophisticated patient 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"What Mason is doing is trying to speed up the process that would normally take 
place through market forces" as competitive products are introduced, said 
Samuel D. Isaly, a New York drug industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The government's scrutiny of AIDS drug pricing is shining a spotlight on the 
question of drug pricing for all illnesses. "This is an issue that has been 
waiting for a focal point, and AIDS has provided it," said Jean McGuire, 
executive director of the AIDS Action Council in Washington. She noted that the 
Senate Select Committee on Aging recently held hearings on pricing of all 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by charges of profiteering and fearful of price controls, makers of AIDS 
drugs have responded to the new climate with price reductions, drug giveaways 
for indigent patients and other marketing and public relations programs. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists who have been crusading for lower drug prices hailed Mason's 
comments as especially significant coming from an Administration generally 
regarded as a strong proponent of the free-market. Activists continue to charge 
that the industry's pricing concessions have not been sufficient, although they 
acknowledge that they cannot know for sure because drug companies refuse to 
disclose detailed data on their costs. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, too, said the government "doesn't have the slightest idea what it costs 
to produce these drugs." Still, he added: "For some of these (drugs), it 
appears that there hasn't been a social responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Mason said the Administration is studying several mechanisms to achieve its 
goal of lower prices, including changes in the Orphan Drug Law. The law 
provides financial incentives to companies developing medications for rare 
disorders. He emphasized, however, that any changes will have to be carefully 
crafted to avoid having a chilling effect on industry research. 
</P>
<P>
Despite two price reductions of 20% each since AZT was licensed in 1987, the 
latest one coming last month after members of ACT UP disrupted trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, Burroughs Wellcome continues to charge over $6,000 a 
year for a full dose of the drug. AZT is the only antiviral agent approved for 
use against the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Another company that has been sharply criticized by activist groups is 
Lyphomed, which quadrupled the price of pentamidine to $99 a vial after the 
company began investigating the drug's effectiveness, in aerosol form, in 
warding off AIDS-related pneumonia. The drug was licensed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Both drugs were developed under the Orphan Drug Law, which provides a 
seven-year monopoly and generous tax credits to companies that develop 
medications for conditions afflicting fewer than 200,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
However, under current law, both drugs retain their "orphan" status even though 
recent studies have indicated that they should be used earlier in HIV disease 
-- before the onset of full-blown AIDS. Government officials estimate that AZT 
might be useful for 500,000 HIV-infected patients. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing, perhaps, a flaw" in the Orphan Drug Law, Mason said. "There has 
to be a provision" to modify a drug's orphan status when the size of a market 
grows unexpectedly, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeffrey C. Warren, vice president for communications of the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Assn. in Washington, warned that "it would be a very big mistake" 
to revise or modify a law "which has been so successful." Under the law, he 
said, drug companies have undertaken development of 133 drugs for 170 rare 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Makers of AIDS drugs say their prices are justified by their high expenditures 
on research. They are resorting to a number of tactics to defuse the 
controversy over drug pricing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lowering the price of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome has donated 
thousands of dollars to such groups as the National AIDS Network, the National 
Assn. of People With AIDS and the National Minority AIDS Council. 
</P>
<P>
Though there was no specific quid pro quo, all three groups refused to sign an 
August statement by 17 other AIDS organizations calling for lower AZT prices. 
Some of the organizations that signed the statement had previously turned down 
donations from Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Lyphomed unveiled a plan to donate unspecified amounts of 
pentamidine to indigent patients. Lyphomed has also hired as a consultant Jim 
Foster, a gay political activist and member of the San Francisco Health 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who could not be reached for comment, was busy pleading the company's 
case in private meetings with key AIDS leaders at the conference here this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Delaney, director of the patient advocacy group Project Inform, called 
Lyphomed's drug giveaway "a PR gesture." While a handful of patients may 
benefit, "all of society suffers when a drug is overpriced because the cost is 
borne by insurance policyholders and taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
But Brian Tambi, a Lyphomed senior vice president, insisted that Lyphomed "has 
been a very good public citizen." Lyphomed jumped into the AIDS market when 
other companies were unwilling to do so, "so why should I be crucified?" 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, at the same time some drug companies are clashing with activists 
on pricing, others are forming alliances to hasten the drug-approval process 
and bring new medicines to market faster. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney of Project Inform met last week with officials of Genelabs and the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration in an attempt to speed the development of GLQ-223, 
the U.S. version of a Chinese drug called Compound Q that Delaney's group has 
been testing. 
</P>
<P>
Members of ACT UP's New York chapter worked closely with Bristol-Myers Squibb 
to devise the "parallel track" distribution scheme for the experimental 
antiviral drug DDI. 
</P>
<P>
"The savvier companies have come to understand that the patient community can 
be their allies in moving a drug through the FDA approval process," said Jim 
Eigo, a member of ACT UP's treatment and data committee.

Two Chicago police officers who allegedly abandoned two black youngsters in a

were indicted on misconduct and battery charges. The two officers, Kathleen A. 
Moore, 31, and James J. Serio, 35, allegedly picked up the two black youths for 
curfew violations on Aug. 15 in the Bridgeport neighborhood where Mayor Richard 
M. Daley lives, slapped them around and then dropped them off in Canaryville, 
where they were beaten.

A tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico showed signs of taking on hurricane 
strength, with the threat of swamping coastal areas that are already facing 
abnormally high tides, forecasters said. Tropical Storm Jerry, which was 
spawned by a tropical depression off the coast of Mexico, had top winds of 70 
m.p.h. and was located about 580 miles from New Orleans, the National Hurricane 
Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said. Forecasters said that the high tides could 
result from the rough seas caused by the storm as well as the strong 
gravitational pull of the moon.

Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan denied a request that he commute the prison 
sentence of a 16-year-old repeat offender with terminal cancer who wanted to be 
released from a prison hospital to die at home. Alan Rogers Jr. is serving a 4- 
to 10-year sentence for robbing and assaulting a retired police officer. He 
initiated the clemency request after doctors told him he had inoperable cancer 
and probably would die within a month. Blanchard asked the state Department of 
Corrections to explore other options to allow Rogers to return to his parents' 
home to die.

Federal investigators in Pensacola are looking into allegations that inmates at 
a minimum-security prison camp for white-collar criminals paid bribes to leave 
the camp and meet their wives and girlfriends, a prosecutor said. Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Stephen Preisser confirmed the probe at Eglin Federal Prison Camp 
but would give no details. The allegations came to light when an ex-inmate 
pleaded guilty to paying a $50 bribe to an Air Force staff sergeant who 
supervised prisoners while they were on work duty at Eglin Air Force Base, 
where the camp is located.

ETHICS BOOKLET BEING ISSUED TO YOUNG SCIENTISTS

In the wake of a series of disclosures about research misconduct, the National 
Academy of Sciences issued a booklet Friday on laboratory ethics for young 
scientists and plans to circulate it on 120 college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-page publication is designed to guide graduate students in the ethical 
conduct of scientific research and addresses fundamental issues of 
data-reporting accuracy, giving proper credit for discoveries and maintaining 
integrity at the laboratory bench. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said Friday that 
the problem of misconduct in scientific research is small but that it has 
received attention recently in the media and before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a perception that it is a serious issue," Press said. "Therefore, it 
has to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
The booklet cites fraud -- the deliberate misrepresentation of research 
findings -- as the gravest violation of science ethics, and it notes that 
"there is good reason for believing the incidence of fraud in science to be 
quite low." 
</P>
<P>
"Science could not be the successful institution it is if fraud were common," 
the booklet says, noting that most research findings will be verified or 
disproved by the work of other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to give credit for previous discoveries also distorts the scientific 
process, the booklet says. It cautions young researchers that "scientists who 
fail to acknowledge the ideas of others tend to find themselves excluded from 
the fellowship of their peers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the booklet gives advice to researchers who report the misconduct 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
"Whistle-blowing is rarely an easy route" and, in the past, has hurt careers of 
accusers, the book says. It recommends that whistle-blowers confront suspects 
in private before taking the issues public. 
</P>
<P>
"Many problems can be solved in this fashion without involving a larger forum," 
the book says. 
</P>
<P>
But it says also that universities and science organizations now are 
establishing formal procedures to protect the accuser and the accused. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, accusations of misconduct have been aired in hearings before 
Congress, and at least one whistle-blower has reported that her career has been 
seriously harmed by her efforts to uncover misconduct. Two National Institutes 
of Health scientists now work as investigators on a congressional committee 
that oversees federally supported science research. 
</P>
<P>
A National Institutes investigation has resulted in one researcher's being 
accused of plagiarizing the work of another scientist. And there have been 
published reports that a number of cases of misconduct still are under 
investigation by the agency's experts.

JOGGER-CASE SUSPECTS WERE NEARLY FREED;

Teen-age youths picked up in a massive sweep through Central Park following 
reports of attacks on male joggers were almost freed before a report surfaced 
that a woman had been found beaten and unconscious, a policeman testified 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Eric Reynolds also testified that on the night of their arrest, 
"they didn't really seem to care much about it." 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were "sitting and talking" in the youth room of the Central Park 
precinct, awaiting the arrival of their parents or guardians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to go home. They wanted to hang out," Reynolds testified at a 
pre-trial hearing in state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Five youths were arrested in the hours after the attacks on April 19. Three of 
them were subsequently indicted, along with two other suspects, for the attacks 
on the woman jogger and two male joggers. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth youth arrested shortly after the attacks was not indicted. The fifth 
youth arrested is expected to testify against the others at the trial this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Police at the precinct were awaiting the arrival of the youths' relatives when 
they learned at 4 a.m. that a woman who had been brutally beaten had been found 
in a wooded section of the park, Reynolds testified. 
</P>
<P>
He said a lieutenant told him "to keep the suspects there for a while so that 
they could be questioned." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds was among the dozens of police officers who searched Central Park as 
their radios crackled with reports that a band of more than 30 youths had 
attacked a homeless man and several male joggers. 
</P>
<P>
Working undercover with his partner, Officer Robert Powell, Reynolds was 
cruising in a city parks department van on Central Park West near 101st Street 
at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He said they spotted a group of 10 to 15 youths, who began pointing at a 
uniformed officer on a scooter. Anticipating that the youths would run, he 
pulled the van to the curb, jumped out and told them to stay still. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point the group started to run, except for two," Reynolds testified. 
</P>
<P>
As Reynolds searched the teens, one of them told him he had just left his 
girlfriend's house. Another youth said he was on his way home from the movies 
after seeing a horror film with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The two claimed they did not know the other teens and feared they were about to 
be robbed by the group, Reynolds said.

WHOLESALE PRICES REBOUND, KINDLE INFLATION FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: RETAIL SALES ALSO POST A ROBUST INCREASE, AND THE TWO INDEXES TOGETHER 
MAY SIGNAL A HEATING-UP OF CONSUMPTION.

<P>
After three consecutive monthly declines, wholesale prices rebounded by a steep 
0.9% in September, pushing the producer price index back toward its May peak 
and rekindling fears of inflation, the Labor Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The index had fallen 0.1% in June and 0.4% in July and August. For the first 
nine months of 1989, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate of 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
A long-expected jump in energy prices, reversing a summer-long decline, was 
responsible for about half of September's increase. An unusual distortion in 
the seasonal adjustment for car prices converted a small decline in auto prices 
into a huge markup that accounted for another 0.2 points of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big number and it's going to scare some people," observed David Wyss of 
Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. But Wyss, who, like most analysts, took 
the news in stride, saw only gradually higher inflation in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But in financial markets, the wholesale inflation report coincided with a flood 
of sell orders provoked, in part, apparently, by news of the apparent breakdown 
in the $6.75-billion UAL Corp. buyout, and the Dow Jones industrial average 
plummeted nearly 200 points. 
</P>
<P>
That negative reaction may have been amplified by another economic report 
Friday. The Commerce Department said that retail sales increased by a 
surprisingly robust 0.5% in September, after increases of 0.5% in July and 0.7% 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
The latest retail sales increase combined with the producer price report to 
revive fears of an economy driven by strong consumption and flirting with the 
dangers of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
That is a recipe for high interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve, 
which only a week ago had been expected to let interest rates decline somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
A big factor in September's retail sales spurt was a 0.8% increase in auto 
sales, which in turn contributed to a 0.6% increase in sales of durable goods 
-- big-ticket items that last three years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The strong retail sales volume for cars was caused in part by widespread dealer 
rebates to move unsold 1989 models from sales lots to make way for 1990 models. 
But it was rebates at the wholesale level, ironically, that accounted in part 
for the apparent acceleration in inflation for finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
This year, manufacturers began their rebate campaign in August, a month earlier 
than in the recent past. Thus, an actual decline of 0.5% in wholesale auto 
prices from August to September was converted to a 3.8% increase by Labor 
Department statisticians as they compensated for the fact that expected 
discounts did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
"The auto prices were a statistical fluke, and it's all because of the timing 
of rebates, not because of any underlying inflationary surge," explained Donald 
Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Energy, the other big culprit in the September inflation story, jumped 6.5% 
after declines of 7.3% in August, 3% in July and 2.8% in June. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew energy was going to rebound after a soft summer, and the only question 
was, which month," Wyss said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratajczak noted that the jump in the wholesale price of finished energy goods 
is very unlikely to show up at the retail level for the time being because 
"dealers are getting squeezed and they're not passing all these energy price 
increases along." 
</P>
<P>
Food prices, the other big variable in monthly price moves, declined 0.6%, 
continuing a leveling off after large increases last winter caused by the 1988 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
Without food and energy prices, the "core" rate of inflation at the producer 
level was logged at 0.7%, the highest since last May. But almost all of that 
was caused by the seasonal fluke in autos. Without any seasonal adjustment, 
producer prices excluding food and energy declined 0.1% in September. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back at a rate of inflation increases about the same as we saw at the 
end of last year," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, the New York 
investment house. "We can probably live with that for now but it's not 
sustainable for the long run and it is something the Fed has to concern itself 
with. What we saw in September is not as bad as it appears, but it does mean 
that inflation is persistent." 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, producer prices increased 0.2%, reflecting a 
0.2-point increase in the producer price index to 113.5 on a scale in which the 
1982 level was 100.

WATER BOARD VOTES TO SHUT CASMALIA DUMP

The state Regional Water Quality Control Board approved a proposal Friday that 
will shut down the landfills next month at Casmalia Resources, one of two toxic 
waste dumps in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The state water board voted 6 to 2 at a meeting in Santa Maria to prohibit the 
site from accepting regular toxic waste shipments after Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The closure vote was expected because legislation passed in 1984 ordered that 
toxic landfills that did not meet new standards would be effectively prohibited 
from accepting toxic materials in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Casmalia still will be allowed to accept some waste for the specific purpose of 
drying up seepage under the landfills. The water board will give Casmalia up to 
one year to complete this process and then will not allow any more waste to be 
brought into the site. 
</P>
<P>
While the existing landfills will soon be closed, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency recently announced a controversial decision to grant draft 
permits for new toxic landfills at the site. Casmalia has applied to build two 
new toxic landfills and five "evaporation" ponds. But Casmalia's proposal must 
first complete the lengthy local, state and federal approval process.

BAIL ORDERED WHILE MILLER AWAITS NEW SPY TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
ESPIONAGE CASE: THE FORMER FBI AGENT WHOSE CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED HAS BEEN 
IN JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered a Los Angeles judge to 
hold a bail hearing for Richard W. Miller, a former FBI agent whose conviction 
on charges of spying for the Soviet Union was later overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the three-judge panel in San Francisco paves the way for 
Miller's release from prison for the first time in five years. He is being held 
at a medium-security prison in Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The court issued an order granting Miller's motion that he be released on bail 
while awaiting a new trial on espionage charges. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the same panel overturned Miller's conviction, saying he should be 
retried because jurors were allowed to hear too many details about lie detector 
tests that Miller failed. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-July, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon denied Miller's bid to be 
freed on bail pending his third trial. Kenyon said he based his decision on the 
weight of the evidence against the former FBI agent and the risk that Miller 
would flee. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate judges, however, said the government "failed to show by a 
preponderance of the evidence" that Miller constituted a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
In their opinion, 9th Circuit Judges Dorothy Nelson, Stephen Reinhardt and 
Diarmuid O'Scanlain said they were persuaded by a federal probation report 
prepared last May that if Miller were properly supervised, he would show up for 
his new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors declined to comment Friday. But Joel Levine, one of Miller's 
defense lawyers, said he is pleased by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming," Levine said. "Richard Miller has been in 
custody five years, and to date he has not received a fair trial. Finally, he 
has a chance of vindication and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said probation officials indicated that they would be satisfied if 
Miller put up as bond three pieces of property valued at $350,000 to $400,000 
that are owned by his friends. But the officials also said Miller should be 
kept under "close supervision" pending his third trial. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 52, was convicted by a Los Angeles federal court jury in June, 1986, 
for passing FBI secrets to the Soviet KGB during an adulterous affair with a 
married Russian emigre named Svetlana Ogorodnikova. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has expended enormous resources prosecuting Miller. His 
three-month trial in 1985 ended in a mistrial when jurors deadlocked after 
three weeks of deliberations. His second trial lasted four months, and Kenyon 
sentenced him to two life terms plus 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, an excommunicated Mormon and father of eight, had numerous problems as 
an FBI agent. He asserted that his relationship with Ogorodnikova and her 
husband was an attempt to become a secret double agent by penetrating a KGB spy 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors contended that Miller had agreed to pass a confidential 
intelligence document to Ogorodnikova in exchange for sex, $15,000 in cash, 
$50,000 in gold and a $675 Burberry trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court overturned the conviction because prosecutors were allowed by 
Kenyon to present evidence that Miller, during five days of rigorous 
interrogation by his FBI superiors, failed several lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal of his conviction was a significant blow to the government. It 
constituted the first time a major espionage conviction had been overturned in 
more than five dozen prosecutions since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ogorodnikova and her husband pleaded guilty to espionage charges and 
were sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office has not said whether it will appeal the reversal of 
Miller's conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Authorities arrested a fourth person in the Santa Barbara County slaying of a 
Caltrans engineer who was shot to death on a secluded stretch of sand used by 
nudists at El Capitan State Beach. Sheriff's deputies and a special weapons and 
tactics team surrounded an apartment in Roseville, near Sacramento, and 
arrested Rickey Lee Rogers, 24, in the slaying Sept. 21 of Phil Bogdanoff. 
Investigators earlier arrested Bogdanoff's wife, Diana, his stepdaughter, 
Stephanie Allen, and the young woman's boyfriend, Brian Stafford.

Debra Marie Lucas, accused of kidnaping newborn "Baby Thao" from a Sacramento 
hospital maternity ward, appeared in court Friday where her bail was raised to 
$100,000. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Scully, arguing for the bail increase from 
$15,000, said Lucas might flee because she faces a possible prison term and has 
strong ties to the Oakland area. "Her flight risk, we think, is substantial," 
Scully said. Lucas, 36, is being held in the Sacramento County Jail. If 
convicted of kidnaping, she could be sentenced to 16 years in prison. Lucas is 
charged with kidnaping Baby Thao from his mother, a Hmong immigrant from Laos, 
at Mercy General Hospital.

CONVICT WITH HOSTAGE KILLED IN NEV. PRISON

A convicted killer was slain Friday by sheriff's deputies who stormed into an 
infirmary office where he held a woman doctor hostage for 10 hours at the 
Northern Nevada Correctional Center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth James Meller, 48, was shot by deputies who tossed a "flash-and-bang" 
concussion grenade into the 12-by-12-foot office and then rushed through a door 
and broke through thin wooden wall panels. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Karen Gedney was stunned by the explosive device but otherwise unhurt. 
Meller was shot several times, at least once in the head, after he lunged at 
SWAT team deputies with a four-inch knife, prison Director Ron Angelone said. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials said that during the hostage ordeal Meller talked about 
committing suicide today, exactly 14 years after he shot and killed a Nevada 
Highway Patrol trooper after a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Angelone said Meller didn't threaten Gedney until the end. "As it was going 
downhill, he said that if anyone showed his face he would hurt her. At that 
point we decided to go in." 
</P>
<P>
The director said negotiators tried unsuccessfully for hours to get Meller to 
release the doctor and give up. Even after deputies rushed into the room, 
Angelone said the plan was to not shoot Meller unless he attacked first. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bob Miller praised Angelone and Carson City Sheriff Paul McGrath for their 
handling of the hostage incident. The governor added that Gedney "is a heroine. 
She kept her cool. She was courageous, and if she had not been able to deal 
with the situation calmly, it could have gotten out of hand very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Meller had gone into the medium-security prison's infirmary, scuffled with 
staffers and then took Gedney hostage, saying he was thinking about killing 
himself. He made no demands. 
</P>
<P>
Meller was imprisoned for killing Trooper Gary Gifford, who pulled him over 
after a $4,250 robbery of a Lake Tahoe bank in 1975. Gifford was the first 
trooper shot while on duty in the history of the Nevada Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Meller was arrested later after taking four people hostage at the north shore 
of the lake.

RECYCLING PROGRAM INVESTIGATION IS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TWO FEUDING STATE OFFICIALS HAVE ASKED A TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY 
TO CHECK INTO POSSIBLE FRAUD IN THE RETURN OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. 
</P>

<P>
A top-level law enforcement official disclosed Friday that two feuding state 
officials have separately asked for investigations of payments made to 
businesses they suspect of defrauding the California beverage container 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Whitt Murray, acting chief of the Department of Justice's bureau of 
investigations, said the investigations of suspected fraud by recyclers were 
requested by state Controller Gray Davis and Director of Conservation Randall 
M. Ward. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at all the materials gathered by both the agencies and trying to 
determine what the focus of my investigation will be," Murray said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to identify the "targets" named by Davis and Ward, and he would not 
estimate how much time the investigations would take to complete. He said, 
however, there was "some overlap" of the cases submitted to him. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he refused to say whether the cases involved businesses that Davis 
charged in an audit report had improperly received more than $12 million in 
state funds from the recycling program over the last year. Ward maintains that 
Davis provided no evidence for the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Murray indicated that while he knew both the state controller and the 
Department of Conservation have been looking into potentially improper payments 
to some recyclers in the redeemable beer and soft drink container program, 
Davis' request for an investigation came "most recently." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure that the state Justice Department, headed by Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp, has received requests for criminal investigations seemed to 
indicate an intensified resolve to root out recyclers suspected of cheating the 
22-month-old program. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually from the outset, the penny-per-container program has been the target 
of some recyclers who seek to collect the penny on beverage containers smuggled 
from out of state that are not redeemable in California. In addition to the 
penny from a special $120-million state fund, they are paid by processors for 
the scrap value of reusable glass, aluminum and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Under the self-financing program, distributors of beer and soda pop pay a penny 
into the fund for each redeemable container. That penny is, in effect, added to 
the cost of the beverage at the checkout stand. Consumers, in turn, can return 
the container to the recycler and be paid a penny for each. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a politically ambitious Democrat who is a potential gubernatorial 
candidate, called a press conference Friday to formally release the previously 
leaked audit report that accused the Department of Conservation of mismanaging 
fiscal controls and paying out funds without proper documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, while insisting that "I don't want any credit" for exposing the alleged 
abuses, demanded that Ward immediately "tighten" fiscal controls before actual 
payment to recyclers is made. The department now relies heavily on post-payment 
audits to discover wrongdoing, much as the Internal Revenue Service does with 
income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Davis charged that unless the Deukmejian Administration's department takes 
remedial action, such as beefed-up prepayment controls, the agency "will turn 
this important effort into an industrial welfare program for unscrupulous 
recyclers." 
</P>
<P>
"We do have fairly serious prepayment controls," Ward retorted at a separate 
press conference later. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that there are "fraudulent claims, absolutely. We recognize there 
is a problem." But he insisted that his agency is vigilant in guarding against 
payment of such claims and if the controller "has information regarding 
fraudulent activity, give it to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he did not understand Davis' motivations for holding a press 
conference to announce the audit report before Ward had an opportunity to 
prepare a response, but rhetorically asked, "I'm not sure, but is there an 
election year coming up here?"

JURY HOLDS DOCTOR RESPONSIBLE IN EPILEPTIC'S CAR CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE $3.14-MILLION AWARD MARKS THE FIRST TIME A PHYSICIAN HAS BEEN 
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY HIS PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE TOWARD 
SOMEONE OTHER THAN A PATIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An El Cajon Superior Court jury Friday returned a "landmark" $3.14-million 
verdict against an East County neurologist in a case that asked how accountable 
a doctor should be when an epileptic patient gets behind the wheel of a car. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict, against neurologist Mark C. Levine, was in favor of Sherril 
Altstadt, 25, of Newbury Park, who was paralyzed in an August, 1983, head-on, 
two-car crash on Coronado's Silver Strand Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Altstadt was a passenger in a car driven by Levine's patient, Trudy Stevenson, 
an 18-year-old epileptic, who lost control of her car and ripped across the 
median into another auto, killing a 90-year-old retired Navy captain and 
injuring three people. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict marked the first time a doctor has been held responsible for 
damages caused by his negligence toward someone other than his patient, said 
Altstadt's San Diego attorney, Patrick Frega. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that justice was done, and it's a landmark case," Frega said. "The most 
important thing about it is that this jury sent a message. They sent a message 
to all doctors who treat seizure patients. They told them, 'When your patient 
becomes a hazard to themselves and a menace on the highway, you must report 
them to the Department of Motor Vehicles.' " 
</P>
<P>
The key factual issue in the case was whether Stevenson suffered an epileptic 
seizure that led to the crash -- and the panel decided that a seizure did not 
occur, said Levine's attorney, Robert W. Harrison of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite that conclusion, reached by a majority of the jurors, by at least 
nine, they nevertheless concluded that Dr. Levine shared some responsibility 
for the accident by virtue of the fact she was a licensed driver on that date," 
Harrison said. "In effect, they would have imposed liability against Dr. Levine 
had she been a drunk driver, been in a drag race or had she been on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and lawyers who specialize in medical malpractice issues had watched 
the case closely. A verdict against Levine, they feared, could open the door to 
a flood of expensive cases and a greatly diminished incentive to assist 
epileptics -- and those with other disorders that may lead to blackouts, such 
as heart disease and alcoholism -- gain a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrison said that, because the jury returned a "logically inconsistent 
verdict," the real message the case may send is that "doctors have infinite 
liability. Doctors who have patients with accidents under any circumstances may 
be facing liability exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said he would ask Superior Court Judge James Malkus to set aside the 
verdict. If that request is denied, he said he planned to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, reached Friday at his home, declined comment on the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians are required under state law to report immediately to county health 
officers all disorders involving "lapses of consciousness." That information 
must be passed on to the DMV, the law says. 
</P>
<P>
That law was at the center of the suit, which was filed in August, 1984, and in 
El Cajon because Altstadt, then known by her maiden name, Sherril Romero, used 
to live in nearby Santee. She sued both Levine and Stevenson, alleging 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV had issued Stevenson a probationary license in April 1981, with 
conditions that required her to report "adverse changes" in her condition. It 
issued the license after Levine filed a report about her the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recurring Seizures 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 12, 1983, Stevenson was hospitalized with recurring seizures. Levine, 
Frega said, was required to report that "adverse change" within 10 days after 
Stevenson was released from the hospital but failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
That June, Levine told Stevenson she could drive, but only in emergencies or to 
work, Frega said. The accident occurred two months after that, on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, Levine's attorney, had contended that the January 1983 seizures were 
not any worse than previous ones but only more frequent, and thus did not 
qualify as an "adverse change." Further, Harrison said, Levine faithfully 
followed all reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Although the jury awarded Altstadt the $3.14 million in actual damages, it did 
not award the punitive damages Frega had asked for. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict also included a finding of negligence against Stevenson. She, 
however, had settled her share of the case before the verdict for $50,000, 
Frega said.

LATINOS TELL OF RISING NORTH COUNTY HARASSMENT; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANTS: SOME U.S. TEEN-AGERS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO VERBALLY AND 
PHYSICALLY ABUSE THE WORKERS AS THEY LOOK FOR DAY JOBS ALONG THE STREETS OF THE 
RAPIDLY GROWING AREA.

Incarnacion Gomez Paredes said he has become accustomed to the taunts from 
passing motorists who feel an urge to shout racial epithets and occasionally 
toss debris at the job-seeking migrant workers who man the early-morning street 
corners of northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really pay attention," Gomez said early Friday as he and other men 
from Mexico gathered in the Rancho Penasquitos area in search of day labor. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, the harassment, normally a low-level phenomenon, escalates 
and cannot be ignored, migrants say. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday a group of activists alleged that the migrants, mostly from 
Mexico, are increasingly coming under attack from American youths wielding an 
array of weapons, from fists and boards to pellet guns and real rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates also reported a rise in assaults by teen-age thieves and gangs 
that prey on the immigrant workers in North County, where thousands of mostly 
Mexican day laborers live in crude camps, often alongside prosperous suburban 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reported incidents cited in what is characterized as an escalating 
pattern of aggression: shootings, beatings, robberies, destruction of property 
and verbal harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrant advocates see the violence as an outgrowth of a growing 
anti-migrant sentiment in the fast-growing area, where tension between the 
migrants and other residents has occasionally erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids see themselves providing a public service by running (the 
migrants) out at gunpoint," said Roberto Martinez, border representative in San 
Diego for the American Friends Service Committee, the social action arm of the 
Quaker Church. 
</P>
<P>
More police patrols are needed in areas frequented by the day laborers, said 
the Rev. Rafael V. Martinez, who runs the Encinitas-based North County 
Chaplaincy, which works with migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want authorities to be aware of the seriousness of the problem, and we want 
to urge them to take some preventive measures before we have another incident 
like the one we had on Black Mountain Road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of Nov. 9, two Mexican field hands -- Hilario Castaneda Salgado, 
22, and Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, 19 -- were shot to death as they walked 
along an isolated stretch of Black Mountain Road in San Diego, which abuts a 
number of farm nurseries and migrant camps. Police said the slayings were 
racially motivated. On Wednesday, a San Diego teen-ager who authorities say was 
the triggerman pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. An alleged 
accomplice is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities contend that police investigate crimes against migrants, whether 
the migrants are in the United States legally or illegally, as thoroughly as 
they look into any reported criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly wouldn't tolerate someone harassing anybody, I don't care who they 
are," said Capt. Jay Lasuer, who commands the Sheriff's Department substation 
in Poway, which provides police protection in the city to the north and east of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Some claim there is a double standard. Roberto Martinez, the church activist, 
said a victim of recent pellet-gun shootings -- the projectiles contained paint 
-- reported the incident to a deputy in Poway more than a week ago but nothing 
was done. (Lasuer said that his office had not been informed of the pellet-gun 
incidents until the Wednesday press conference and that authorities now plan to 
investigate.) 
</P>
<P>
During the past three weeks, Martinez said, at least seven migrants have been 
hit by the paint-filled pellets in the Poway area; most were hit while walking 
on streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're demanding a thorough investigation," Martinez said. "These can no longer 
be considered isolated incidents. These kinds of things are probably occurring 
somewhere in the county on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
The Poway sheriff's office, Martinez noted, acted quickly in April, 1988, when 
an American girl reported that she had been raped by a group of migrants. More 
than 80 Latinos were detained within 24 hours of the incident; six were held 
for up to two months. All charges were ultimately dropped; the six arrestees 
have filed a multimillion-dollar wrongful-arrest suit in federal court against 
the Sheriff's Department, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Lasuer said crimes against migrants are not reported that frequently in Poway. 
He estimated that fewer than 50 have been reported in the past year. In one 
recent case, he noted, three white youths were arrested and charged with 
robbing an immigrant worker. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the crimes may go unreported, authorities acknowledge, because some 
victims are hesitant to come forward. That stems from an inherent distrust of 
police -- a feeling imported from Mexico and Central America -- as well as a 
fear among the undocumented that they may be turned over to U.S. immigration 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a number of migrants interviewed on street corners in North County 
described the harassment as usually non-threatening -- most commonly insults 
shouted from a passing vehicle, or sometimes objects tossed from a car. Many 
were quick to tell a reporter that they have never had any problems with 
Americans; others downplayed the harassment and expressed considerably more 
concern about being underpaid or being cheated out of their salaries by 
unscrupulous employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people yell things at us, but mostly it's in English, and I don't 
know what it means," Manuel Aguayo, a 44-year-old native of the Mexican state 
of Jalisco, said as he stood in a shopping center near the northern city limits 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers are troubled by the seeming equanimity that the migrants display 
toward the verbal harassment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've accepted that they get yelled at; I hope it doesn't come to the point 
where they feel it's OK to get beat up, too," said Gina Velazquez, who works 
with the immigrant community in North County. She has urged victims to report 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Alvaran, who was also interviewed while looking for work Friday, said 
he has never been physically threatened during his four years in the United 
States. But he is cautious; during the past year, he has avoided walking in the 
dark on isolated roads. He apparently has good reason: He was a good friend of 
Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, one of the two Mexican men killed in the November 
hate slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Incarnacion Gomez Paredes, 21, said he and two other migrants were robbed at 
gunpoint in August by three Americans who had given them a ride and promised 
them work -- apparently a ruse. Otherwise, Gomez said, he and others have 
become accustomed to verbal abuse, particularly in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in New York and Canada," said Gomez, who also said he has lived 
outside of Mexico for the better part of 13 years, "but San Diego is the most 
racist place that I've been. Here, everyone tries to take advantage of you if 
you're Mexican."

PARENTS SUE OVER BLEEDING DEATH AFTER TONSILLECTOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood couple whose 5-year-old son bled to death after having his 
tonsils removed in August filed a lawsuit Friday against two San Fernando 
Valley doctors and the North Hollywood hospital where the surgery was 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Burbank Superior Court, alleges negligence and infliction of 
emotional distress and seeks $1 million in general damages on behalf of Leticia 
and Dean Segal, whose son, Dean Jr., died Aug. 4, the day after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the suit are AMI-North Hollywood Medical Center, Dr. Sheldon Lipshutz, 
the Encino surgeon who performed the tonsillectomy, and Dr. Americo Riccitelli, 
a North Hollywood general practitioner who referred the child for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Both doctors are on staff at the North Hollywood hospital, which is owned by 
Beverly Hills-based American Medical International. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a surgery that should never have been done," said Bruce G. Fagel, a 
former emergency room doctor turned lawyer who filed the lawsuit for the 
Segals. "This was a normal healthy child the day before and the day after, he 
bleeds to death in front of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-page complaint also alleges that the two doctors and the hospital lost 
or destroyed medical records that could have been used as evidence against them 
in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in Lipshutz's office said he was out of town and could not be reached 
for comment, and Riccitelli did not return a reporter's phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weinstein, president of Medical Center of North Hollywood, where both 
doctors are on staff, said Segal's death is the subject of a peer review, which 
is standard procedure in all hospital deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the hospital acted according to hospital protocols and procedures and 
did everything appropriately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office listed the cause of Segal's death as 
accidental, from post-operative hemorrhaging, said Scott Carrier, a coroner's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly uncommon for a child to die from a tonsillectomy, said one ear, 
nose and throat specialist at Childrens Hospital who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
The Segal child "had a cold but had no prior history of respiratory problems," 
Fagel said. In addition, he said, it is extremely dangerous to operate on 
acutely infected tonsils because a rich network of blood vessels in the 
inflamed throat increase the risk of hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
"They operated on this kid for the wrong reason at the wrong time," Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, Leticia Segal took her son to Riccitelli on Aug. 2 
for treatment of a sore throat and fever. The doctor said a tonsillectomy was 
necessary and scheduled the child for surgery early the next day, the suit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
About four hours after the surgery was completed, Dean Jr. began vomiting 
blood, the suit alleges. Lipshutz examined the boy's throat, ordered a 
transfusion of a half unit of blood and admitted the boy to a pediatric unit 
for observation, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that Lipshutz ignored or disregarded blood tests showing 
that the boy had lost half his blood volume since the surgery and needed at 
least two units of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, while his mother held him, the child vomited almost a full 
unit of blood and went into cardiac arrest, but nurses at the hospital delayed 
10 to 15 minutes before getting emergency assistance, the lawsuit said. By the 
time Lipshutz returned and cauterized the boy's bleeding artery, the child had 
lapsed into a coma, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a true critical emergency, and they just ignored it," Fagel said. 
"They should have taken him right back to the operating room, given him three 
or four units of blood and re-operated on him." 
</P>
<P>
The boy was transferred to UCLA Medical Center where he was pronounced dead the 
next day, Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said recovery of the full amount sought in the suit may be difficult 
since the Legislature has limited the amount of recovery to $250,000 in medical 
malpractice cases. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the boy's death, his father was employed at the hospital as a 
maintenance technician. He has since quit the job and found work elsewhere 
because it was too psychologically traumatic to work there, Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonsillitis is an acute and chronic infection of the tonsils, two almond-shaped 
masses of lymphoid tissue on either side of the throat at the back of the 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Normally small, tonsils swell when infected, obstructing the throat and causing 
symptoms such as fever, difficulty swallowing and a sore throat. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said the practice of removing tonsils to cure routine respiratory ills 
has been discredited for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The American Academy of Pediatrics considers tonsillitis to be treatable with 
antibiotics and advocates a tonsillectomy only for severe, recurrent infections 
that are causing breathing problems.

2 TRY TO CROSS DEATH VALLEY ON SNOWSHOES; 
</P>
<P>
ADVENTURE: THEY WILL DARE TO TREAD ACROSS THE 8 MILES OF QUICKSAND-LIKE SALT 
BOGS EN ROUTE TO A 14,000-FOOT PEAK.

Two veteran outdoorsmen from the Antelope Valley today face a challenge they 
hope will carry them from the bottom to the top of the contiguous United States 
the hard way -- by snowshoe through the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Bergthold and Jerry Freeman planned to leave at dawn on a nine-day, 
125-mile trek through desolate terrain and dramatic extremes of desert heat and 
mountain cold from Badwater in Death Valley, the lowest point in the contiguous 
48 states, to the summit of Mt. Whitney, the highest. 
</P>
<P>
And although the trek between those two extremes has been made before, 
Bergthold and Freeman will attempt a difficult first: Walking directly across 
eight treacherous miles of salt bogs west of Badwater. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Ranger Dale Antonich of the National Park Service station at Death Valley 
National Monument said that if they succeed, the two men would be the first to 
cross the salt bogs without using paths or dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty unique and pretty challenging," Antonich said in a telephone 
interview from Death Valley, where Friday's high temperature was at least 100 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The bogs, or salt flats, are filled with muddy salt brine -- similar to 
quicksand -- topped by a crust of sunbaked dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Some hikers have died after plunging through the crust into the brine; others 
have been rescued by helicopter or forced to turn back, Antonich said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, a self-employed 47-year-old Pearblossom businessman, completed the 
Badwater-Mt. Whitney hike in 1985 but failed in an attempt to cross the salt 
flats. He fell through the crust several times and slogged through the mud for 
close to a day. 
</P>
<P>
"It really shook me up when I went clear through," Freeman said. "I went in 
clear up to my waist." 
</P>
<P>
Bergthold and Freeman will use a new technique, suggested by Antonich, in 
trying to cross the salt flats. A Vermont snowshoe company has agreed to outfit 
them with $225 snowshoes that the hikers hope will better distribute their 
weight and enable them to move gently across the delicate surface. 
</P>
<P>
The rangers said they may adopt the snowshoes for rescues if they prove 
effective, Bergthold said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergthold is 54, a Marine Corps veteran who teaches photography and survival 
backpacking classes at Antelope Valley College and looks the part of the rugged 
mountain man. 
</P>
<P>
"The life I live is rough and simple," Bergthold said. "I've been through three 
wives. They don't dig it." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, however, said he has been happily married for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
The inveterate hikers have war stories -- some described in articles written by 
Bergthold for outdoor magazines -- of bear attacks, blinding rainstorms and 
scorpion stings. 
</P>
<P>
Hardship does not deter them. They love it. 
</P>
<P>
"On any trip like this, you leave a part of yourself out there and bring a part 
of yourself back," Bergthold said. "The primitive experience is inherent, it 
lets people find themselves. It's a beneficial kind of stress." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the Badwater area, 282 feet below sea level, Bergthold said, "It's 
beautiful and scary at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the flats, several mountain ranges stand between the backpackers and 
14,495-foot Mt. Whitney. They will avoid all paths and roads, carry 55 pounds 
each in provisions and equipment and will be monitored by Freeman's brother 
Doyle, who will parallel their route by car and renew their water supply at 
three prearranged meeting places. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything goes wrong, I would hope we can get ourselves out of it or have 
our people get us out of it at worst," Bergthold said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hang my head in shame if a search-and-rescue team had to bring me out. 
I'd rather come out stiff."

SONNY LOSES STATUS IN SIMI; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITY: ONCE THE HONORED GUEST, BON VIVANT SONNY BONO IS NOW PERSONA NON 
GRATA AT A CHARITY EXTRAVAGANZA. 
</P>

<P>
The presidential suite in the city's fanciest hotel was reserved, the limo was 
arranged, and the plaque honoring Palm Springs mayor and bon vivant Sonny Bono 
was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
But the fifth annual Norka Image Awards, Simi Valley's gala charity dinner and 
public relations extravaganza, will have to carry on without Bono, who tendered 
last-minute regrets after reportedly learning that air fare from Palm Springs 
was not among his perks as an honored guest. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not give the award to him," vowed Mary McCurdy, a businesswoman who 
organizes the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Bono was to be among several entertainment figures to be honored at tonight's 
$75-per-plate dinner at the Wood Ranch Golf Club to benefit Care and Share, a 
local food bank. Although the honorees are invited to receive awards 
recognizing their show business achievements, McCurdy said their presence also 
ensures that the dinner will draw its 200 expected guests. 
</P>
<P>
"His table was selling for $5,000," McCurdy said of her now-missing celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
A miffed McCurdy said Friday that she has canceled the order for Bono's plaque. 
"It's not going to be made," she said. "Unfortunately, his name is still on the 
program. And I'm not going to read his telegram." 
</P>
<P>
McCurdy claims that Bono accepted an invitation in August, then reneged this 
week after his secretary phoned to ask whether air fare would be covered for 
Bono, his wife Mary, baby son Chesare and nanny. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to draw the line and be sure proceeds are all being given to the 
organization we are working for," said McCurdy, whose boutique is also called 
Norka Image, an appellation that she took from an exclusive clothes store in 
her native Colombia. "Norka means mink in Russian," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his office at Palm Springs City Hall, Bono apologized profusely 
Friday and called the snafu "a communications nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Time, not air fare, was the issue, he said. For some reason, he said, the event 
was not on his calendar, and he didn't hear about it until he returned this 
week from a three-week trip to Hawaii. By then, it was too late to commit the 
time needed to attend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bono, who was criticized earlier this year when he failed to take part in an 
AIDS walk in Palm Springs, said: "It's difficult to get there, by air or land. 
It's a time-consumer from Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only assure you I'm not concerned with the cost of the flight. In fact, 
I offered to send them some money for the event if that would soften it. It's 
simply a goof, and I feel terrible, but they're going to hate me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
McCurdy said she turned down Bono's offer of a $200 donation and did not 
appreciate the conciliatory telegram that arrived Friday, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have bigger celebrities at our event, and I'm very proud to say 
they're all coming," said McCurdy, who ticked off the names of television 
actors Joe Conley ("The Waltons"); James B. Sikking ("Hill Street Blues" and 
"Doogie Howser, M. D."); Jacklyn Zeman ("General Hospital"), and three-time 
Emmy nominee Susan Ruttan ("L. A. Law."). 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, I've had just about enough from this Sonny Bono," McCurdy said. "How 
many times has Sonny Bono been nominated for an Emmy?"

$20-MILLION LAGOON RESTORATION PLACED ON HOLD; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ECOLOGIC AND OCEANOGRAPHIC GROUPS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT 
THAT DREDGING BATIQUITOS WILL HAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A $20-million project to restore Carlsbad's Batiquitos Lagoon has been stalled 
by concerns of environmental groups as Carlsbad planners and consultants go 
back to the drawing board to respond to their criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing Friday, Gary Wayne, Carlsbad's principal planner, said response 
to the environmental impact report on the lagoon project will require more 
studies by the city staff and consultants to respond to "substantial issues" 
raised by concerned residents and by ecological and oceanographic groups. 
</P>
<P>
About $600,000 already has been spent in preparing state and federal 
environmental impact reports, Wayne said. He could give no cost estimate for 
the additional work, which he said will concentrate on biological issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledged by Port 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to open the landlocked lagoon to the ocean and turn it into a 
saltwater fish and wildlife sanctuary. Funds for the Batiquitos project have 
been pledged by the Port of Los Angeles to mitigate for loss of tidal wetland 
habitat because of port expansion there. 
</P>
<P>
Dredging of about 3 million cubic yards of sand and silt that have clogged the 
2.5-mile-long coastal lagoon at the south Carlsbad boundary and creation of a 
permanent ocean access by construction of jetties has been criticized as "major 
surgery" by detractors who feel that the lagoon should be left much in its 
current state with far fewer drastic changes to the brackish water habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne defended the proposed restoration project as the only long-term solution 
to the lagoon's deteriorating condition. Major surgery is needed, he said. 
Proposals to make only minor changes on a phased basis, "would be like cutting 
out a little bit of cancer at a time. It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
A three-year deadline for starting the restoration project expires in November, 
1990, Wayne said. But, he added, the city's lagoon agreement with five other 
governmental agencies allows the city to extend the deadline "if substantial 
progress is being made." 
</P>
<P>
Opening the lagoon to continuous tidal flushing and deepening it through 
dredging is the only possible way to reverse the buildup of silt threatening to 
replace the water area that is a habitat for coastal birds and marine life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held Hearings 
</P>
<P>
The city held hearings on the draft environmental plan for the lagoon and 
received no comments, but later 38 written comments were received, including 
several with "substantive questions," Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more important issues to be addressed in further studies is 
exploration of alternatives to the proposed project, including opening the 
lagoon to intermittent tidal flushing and reducing dredging to allow for 
shallow-water feeding areas, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said experience with intermittent tidal flushing at lagoons to the south 
of Batiquitos -- such as at San Elijo, San Dieguito and Penasquitos -- showed 
that the practice did not work well and that it killed the marine life in the 
lagoons each time the brackish or fresh water was replaced by salt water. 
</P>
<P>
The jetties, he said, would cause no beach erosion along the coast, according 
to engineering studies. Sand dredged from the lagoon would be placed along 
Carlsbad beaches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Los Angeles is a "passive party" to the lagoon enhancement plan and 
is "being held hostage" by the groups delaying the project, Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
The port, which requires the Batiquitos project as partial mitigation for 
wetlands destruction from expansion on its property in San Pedro, "is viewed as 
the big, bad developer," by environmental groups, Wayne said, but "that's a 
misconception."

BUILDER SUES L.A. OVER MINI-MALL REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: IRA SMEDRA SAYS THAT THE CITY'S DEMAND FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 
OF HIS STUDIO CITY CARWASH PROPERTY IS ILLEGAL, UNWARRANTED AND UNJUST. 
</P>

<P>
The developer of a proposed mini-mall that is slated to replace Studio City's 
"cultural monument" carwash filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles on 
Friday, claiming that the City Council illegally ordered him to draft a 
detailed environmental impact report on his project. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Ira Smedra said that the council's action was "unwarranted and 
unjust," and that the shopping center met zoning standards. In addition to 
delaying his project for between nine months and a year, the report would be 
"extremely costly and serves no legitimate purpose," he said. The report would 
cost him between $750,000 and $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 10 to 3 Aug. 1 to require the report on the project at 
Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards after Councilman Joel Wachs, who 
represents the area, argued that the $15-million, 53,000-square-foot mall could 
"dramatically change the character of the neighborhood by causing a serious 
negative impact. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, asks that the 
council's order be withdrawn and that the city Department of Building and 
Safety be required to issue all demolition and building permits for the 
project. The suit also asked for unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra, who had given the carwash and adjoining gasoline station until 
Wednesday to vacate the property, also said Friday that he had granted the 
businesses a 30-day extension as an expression of good will. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pat Galati, who operates the carwash and gas station for Unocal, said 
he still planned to shut down the car wash at the end of business today. He 
said the gas station would close at the end of business Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about this," Galati said. "It sounds like last-minute 
baloney to me. I don't have the staff to keep this open. Who does he think is 
going to operate this place?" 
</P>
<P>
A group of Studio City residents staged a spirited campaign to save the 
carwash, gas station and adjoining Tiny Naylor's coffee shop, which closed two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
They unsuccessfully lobbied the city to preserve the businesses as cultural 
landmarks. They argued that the carwash, which they called the "Gateway to 
Studio City," should be preserved for its architectural value because it is 
topped by a 55-foot-tall tower, a 1950s-style decoration shaped like three 
boomerangs.

SAN DIEGAN CHARGED IN $77-MILLION MAIL FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man was named Friday in a 15-count indictment that charged that he 
ran a Ponzi scheme involving solar power companies in which investors lost at 
least $77 million, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, returned in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, charged 
Ernest P. Lampert, 49, with 15 counts of mail fraud. It detailed a scheme that 
prosecutors contend promised investors federal income-tax credits and rising 
income from the sale of electricity and thermal energy created by Lampert's 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Lampert operated a Ponzi scheme, using funds from new investors to pay off 
earlier investors, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Lampert could be sentenced to a maximum of 75 years in prison and 
fined $1.2 million, U.S. Atty. Joseph P. Russoniello said. 
</P>
<P>
Lampert was president of a company named United Energy Corp., based in Foster 
City, Calif., that sold devices called "solar energy modules," prosecutors 
said. The modules were sold to provide tax credits and income from the sale of 
electricity and thermal energy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were invited to install their modules at solar farms owned by another 
Lampert company, Renewable Power Co., in Borrego Springs, Barstow and Davis, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the modules installed by United Energy worked, prosecutors said, and, 
in early 1985, the firm went bankrupt. Investors, however, were not informed of 
the firm's failures, prosecutors said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4-YEAR TERM FOR MAYOR FACES PALMDALE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palmdale City Council has tentatively approved an April ballot measure 
proposing to extend the mayor's two-year term to four years, even though voters 
overwhelmingly rejected the same plan in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
With little discussion, Palmdale lawmakers -- including Mayor William (Pete) 
Knight -- voted 5 to 0 Thursday night to put the measure before voters in the 
April 10 municipal election. The change requires a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Robert Toone Jr. said the longer term would provide more 
continuity on the council. The mayor now faces reelection every two years, but 
the four council members serve staggered four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
For years, voters in Palmdale simply elected five council members, who in turn 
picked a mayor from their ranks. But in April, 1986, voters by a 70% margin 
approved election of the mayor individually. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the same election, voters opted by a 76% margin to give the mayor a 
two-year term instead of four years. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, a record-holding former Air Force test pilot who defeated three 
challengers to become the first elected mayor in April, 1988, faces reelection 
in April. Although some council members disagreed, City Atty. William Rudell 
said the four-year term would take effect in April if approved by voters.

LOYOLA TAKES A HARD LOOK AT CAMPUS RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In eloquent, often impassioned testimony, more than a dozen Loyola Marymount 
University students and faculty members addressed a special committee on 
minority relations this week, describing frustrations among minorities, 
feelings of not being welcome and outrage over racial slurs, including a 
classroom incident involving a visiting professor. 
</P>
<P>
The problems, they said at the meeting Wednesday, extend from the classroom to 
extracurricular activities to social life on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to tell you I'm tired of insensitivity to minority issues," sophomore 
John Crocker said. "Not just to blacks -- to Asians, Latinos or anybody else. 
We just want a fair shake for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students and faculty members crowded into the auditorium of St. 
Robert's Hall for the open forum, sponsored by the Select Committee on 
Minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member committee of faculty, alumni and community leaders was appointed 
by President James N. Loughran after five students walked into his office in 
April and refused to leave until he discussed the issue of race at the private 
university. 
</P>
<P>
The administration pledged last year to investigate students' concerns, but 
some students said the racial climate has yet to improve in the new school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The average student on campus doesn't realize how frustrating this is," said 
Patricia Hudson, a freshman who said she has been stopped at least three times 
since September by security guards and asked what she was doing on campus. 
Hudson said she feels she was singled out because she is black. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Martha Arevalo cited an incident on Sept. 29 involving a visiting 
assistant professor of statistics who allegedly made ethnic and racial slurs in 
the classroom, causing many students to walk out. 
</P>
<P>
Arevalo, newly elected president of the Concerned Student Union -- the group 
that took over the president's office in April -- said about half a dozen 
students immediately complained to Seth Thompson, associate dean of liberal 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant professor -- who was employed as a temporary replacement -- was 
later fired, said university spokeswoman Leah Chester-Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"He was removed from the classroom and in fact dismissed from the university," 
Chester-Davis said. "As far as the university is concerned, they're considering 
it a personal problem." Chester-Davis did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's forum, students pointed to other incidents, including racist 
graffiti sprayed across the entrance sign to the university over the Labor Day 
weekend, and said they believe that there are insufficient numbers of 
minorities in the faculty and student body. The university said the 
undergraduate student body is about 31% minority. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran, however, said he believes he has kept his promises to improve 
attitudes on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I said I would do, I've done," Loughran said. "If anybody said I 
reneged on anything, (it's) not true, absolutely not true. 
</P>
<P>
"In general throughout last year, I was aware there were some difficulties and 
we needed to address them," Loughran said. "I take this seriously. . . . We 
have a commitment to students in general and to minority students in 
particular, and we're always looking for ways to improve it."

POMONA COUNCIL PUSSYFOOTS AROUND THE CAT PROBLEM FOR VALLEY REPLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many cats are too many? 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona City Council couldn't agree this week, so Councilwoman Nell Soto -- 
who originally proposed a limit on what she said is an out-of-control cat 
population -- is back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said that in trying to solve the cat problem, 
"we've strayed into an area we should stay out of." 
</P>
<P>
Soto said she suggested a cat limit because of complaints from residents who 
say their neighborhoods are full of felines. She originally proposed a 
three-cat-per-household limit, then raised it to five. 
</P>
<P>
But Ted Krueger, who has seven cats, says pet owners should keep their cats 
indoors or have them neutered. Establishing a cat limit, he said, "is unfair to 
pet owners who are conscientious and take care of their animals, regardless of 
the number they have." 
</P>
<P>
Another pet owner, Betty Ann Jenkins, said the problem is not the number of 
cats in caring households, but the number of strays. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the current stray program, in which residents borrow traps from the 
Pomona Valley Human Society, doesn't work. She said she heard from one man who 
"ordered a trap, but had to take it back because he kept catching skunks and 
possums." 
</P>
<P>
William C. Harford, executive director of the society, which provides animal 
control for La Verne, Diamond Bar, Chino and Montclair as well as Pomona, said 
pet limits are enforced only after a complaint, making restrictions "almost a 
tool for one neighbor to get back at another neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Harford said a limit on the number of pets a family can have is "not the answer 
to the problem," but that it is a start. He suggested that Pomona might follow 
Claremont, which limits the number of cats over 4 years old but provides a 
process for households with more cats to obtain kennel licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected Soto's proposal 4 to 1. But Soto said she will look into 
another ordinance that would impose a limit but allow families with more cats 
to apply for licenses to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning cat population is a national problem, Harford said. In the year 
ending June 30, Harford said, 4,753 unwanted cats were picked up in Pomona; 
4,010 of those were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, animal control officers pursued mostly dogs; now they are almost 
as busy catching cats. Harford said his agency handled 13,300 dogs and 12,920 
cats last year. 
</P>
<P>
People need to be educated to confine cats or have them neutered, Harford said.

AT LAST, IT'S TIME TO PLAY BALL; 
</P>
<P>
GAME 1: THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS AND OAKLAND ATHLETICS HAVE FILLED THEIR DAYS 
OFF WITH IDLE CHATTER. BUT THE TALK WILL GIVE WAY TO BASEBALL TODAY IN THE 
OAKLAND COLISEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball players bore easily, even the best of them, which is one reason 
today's World Series opener between the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco 
Giants won't be starting a minute too soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the interests of team unity and sanity, neither club can afford another day 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start taking care of business," San Francisco first baseman Will 
Clark griped Friday. "That's been the problem -- there's been no business the 
last four days." 
</P>
<P>
You know what they say about idle hands? Welcome to the devil's workshop by the 
bay, where stir-crazy Giants and stir-crazy A's discovered novel ways to while 
away the time after prematurely ending the World Series preliminaries last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell, San Francisco's 47-home run man, went AWOL, deciding it was a 
good time to close a real estate deal, and missed a day of practice. He was 
heavily fined. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco offered free World Series tickets to callers of the Jose Hotline, 
but only if they listen long enough -- $12 worth -- to hear the pick-up 
address. Canseco was chided in the papers as greedy, which prompted him to walk 
out of interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Blue Jays, continuing to harp about Oakland reliever Dennis 
Eckersley and his alleged emery board in the American League playoffs, sent a 
videotape to the commissioner's office, saying it contains graphic evidence of 
Eckersley hiding the file in his uniform pants. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa lashed out at Bobby Valentine, the Texas manager 
who doubled as a playoff broadcaster, and accused him of planting the evil seed 
about Eckersley in the Toronto dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland pitcher Dave Stewart said he liked Canseco but wondered aloud if 
Canseco would ever grow up, if he really liked himself and if he really cared 
if other people liked him. 
</P>
<P>
Clark took a shot at long-departed Giant Jeffrey Leonard, describing his former 
teammate as "a tumor" who "made my life miserable" and applauded the trade that 
sent Leonard to Milwaukee in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard responded from his new home in Seattle, calling Clark "a prejudiced 
bastard" who caused tension in the 1987 Giant clubhouse with racial remarks, 
and accused Clark of choking in the 1987 National League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Play ball, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
"All the players are (upset) because we've had to wait four days to get it 
going," Clark said Friday. "We're tired of it. I'll be happy to get it 
started." 
</P>
<P>
So will weary newspaper readers across the continent. Has this last week been 
"Waiting for the World Series" or "Waiting for Godot?" Without a doubt, 
nonsense has reigned since the Giants and the A's eliminated the Cubs and the 
Blue Jays each in five games, opening up too much time on the winners' 
pre-Series schedules. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe Chicago and Toronto are to blame, for failing to put up a long enough 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, as Clark handily suggested, there's always the press. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys have been trying to gold-dig for the last three or four days," Clark 
told reporters at the Oakland Coliseum Friday. "You've brought up stuff on 
Kevin Mitchell and now you're working on me . . . "All of this bothers us a 
lot. Everything you do during the season is taken for granted -- and now it's 
all blown out of proportion. Even my parents were called and bugged at home. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have all this time off, you guys wouldn't have time to do all 
this gold-digging." 
</P>
<P>
At last, the mind games give way to the real games today when Stewart opposes 
San Francisco's Scott Garrelts in Game 1 of the first Bay Area World Series. 
Players and managers will again get to speak of hits, runs and errors. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, however, represented a final exercise in damage control for both teams. 
And pains were taken to mend fences and close ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Clark wrapped up his running debate with Leonard tersely, saying: "I had 
something to say and got it off my chest. He had something to say and got it 
off his chest. End of story." 
</P>
<P>
And Stewart had this to say about Canseco: 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line on Jose Canseco is, if somebody asks me, that I like Jose 
Canseco as a person and a teammate. But not all the time. It's like a marriage. 
Eighty-percent of the time, you don't like your wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like my wife. I didn't like my kids every day. But, you work with 
them and you work through those times. Same thing with Jose. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I don't like him. There are times when he doesn't like 
me. That's the way the world is." 
</P>
<P>
And, apparently, that's the way this World Series is going to be. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's news conference was beginning to bog down -- someone mentioned Leonard 
and Clark declared that "those questions are over with" -- so another writer 
stepped in to keep the conversation rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"How about those A's?" the writer deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
Good question, that. 
</P>
<P>
The A's are back in the World Series, set upon rectifying the wreck of '88, 
when their 104 regular-season victories were rendered meaningless in five games 
against Orel Hershiser and the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
They are back, with Mike Moore in their starting rotation and Rickey Henderson 
at the top of the batting order. Moore won 19 games during the regular season 
and Henderson almost won the American League championship series by himself. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff MVP by acclamation, Henderson batted .400 with two home runs, five RBIs 
and a record eight stolen bases in five games against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, Rickey Henderson's the key," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "We 
have to keep him off base. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He's like Vince Coleman. He might be even better. It's almost like when you 
walk him, you're giving up a triple. He can get things started." 
</P>
<P>
Just how good a base stealer is Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the best the world has even seen," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
And after Henderson, the next five names in the Oakland batting order for Game 
1 read: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carney Lansford, who hit .336 and lost the league batting title to 
Minnesota's Kirby Puckett on the last day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Canseco, who hit 17 home runs and drove in 57 runs after missing the first 
half of the season with a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Parker, who had 22 home runs and 97 RBIs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Henderson, the postseason specialist who had 15 home runs and 80 RBIs 
during the 162-game tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark McGwire, Bash Brother II, who added 33 home runs and 95 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
It's a formidable lineup, one that makes the A's favorites to beat their Bay 
brethren, but then, they were saying similar things about the A's and the 
Dodgers last October. 
</P>
<P>
"It strikes me that they've got it won in their own minds already," Giant 
center fielder Brett Butler said. "They keep saying, 'We're going to do this, 
going to do that.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's fine. Let's go out and play." 
</P>
<P>
And the Giants do have a few cards to play. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's 1-2 punch of Clark and Mitchell may be the best in baseball. 
Mitchell led the major leagues in home runs and Clark batted a staggering .650 
with eight RBIs in the playoffs against the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants also have a power threat in third baseman Matt Williams, who hit 18 
home runs, and a baserunning threat in Butler, who stole 31 bases, but the 
bottom third of their lineup -- Terry Kennedy at .239, Candy Maldonado at .217 
and Jose Uribe at .235 -- represents a veritable cliff drop. 
</P>
<P>
If it comes down to pitching, the A's appear to have the Giants bettered, too. 
After Stewart, 21-9, Oakland can counter with Moore, 19-11, Storm Davis, 19-7, 
and Bob Welch, 17-8, with Eckersley and his 33 saves in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco has Garrelts, the National League earned-run average leader at 
2.28, and Rick Reuschel, the All-Star game starter. But after that, Craig is 
left with a hobbled Don Robinson, his scheduled Game 3 starter, and Mike 
LaCoss, who had a 9.00 ERA in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"They might have a slight edge in pitching," Craig conceded. "But in a 
seven-game series, you can throw that out." 
</P>
<P>
Another thing about this seven-game series: It's finally here. 
</P>
<P>
Time to throw baseballs instead of invective. 
</P>
<P>
Time to see which side of the bay plays as good a game as it talks.

CHIEFS' THOMAS HOPES TO MAKE IMPACT SUNDAY AGAINST RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linebacker Derrick Thomas of the Kansas City Chiefs blasted into the Raider 
backfield as soon as the ball was snapped, and quarterback Jay Schroeder never 
had a chance, Thomas knocking him to the turf like a rag doll. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also sacked Schroeder once more during the Chiefs' 24-19 victory over 
the Raiders last month in Kansas City, so the Raiders will be going all out to 
stop Thomas when they play the Chiefs again Sunday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick Thomas is a big impact player," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "He's 
such an impact player, it's scary. You watch him on film, and every week he's 
doing something to somebody. Even (Cincinnati Bengal All-Pro tackle Anthony) 
Munoz caught hell from him." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas gave Munoz problems in the Chiefs' 21-17 loss to the Bengals two weeks 
ago, beating Munoz to sack Boomer Esiason and force a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has helped rejuvenate the Chiefs' defense, which is ranked third in the 
National Football League after being last against the rush last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs used the No. 4 pick in this year's National Football League draft to 
select Thomas, an All-American at Alabama, making him the first linebacker to 
be selected in the first round in the team's 29-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Thomas has adapted quickly to the NFL despite reporting 
late after a 36-day holdout. He signed a reported $4.2-million, five-year 
contract with the Chiefs, and Kansas City is already getting a good return on 
its investment. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas leads the Chiefs in tackles with 26 and in sacks with four. Last Sunday, 
Kansas City held the Seattle Seahawks to 52 yards rushing in a 20-16 win. 
Seahawk tailback Curt Warner gained just one yard in seven carries, and 
fullback John L. Williams was held to 22 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has also made his mark on Kansas City's punt and kickoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
Is he surprised by his sudden impact on the Chiefs? 
</P>
<P>
"Nope," he said. "For me it doesn't take long to adjust. If you tell me to do 
A, B and C, I might do B, C and A the first time, but the next time I'm going 
to do A, B and C." 
</P>
<P>
A tailback during his first two years in high school, Thomas was moved to 
linebacker in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
He adjusted quickly to his new position, earning all-league honors at South 
Miami High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick was probably the best athlete we had, but we never knew where to play 
him," South Miami Coach Sam Harris said. "He decided he'd rather hit than be 
hit, so we switched him to defense." 
</P>
<P>
A good player on a mediocre team, Thomas was overshadowed by teammate Keith 
Carter, an all-state linebacker who is a fifth-year senior at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
"Before he reported to Kansas City, we had a roast for him," Harris said, "and 
one of the speakers said (in jest) that the reason we never put Derrick's 
picture in the paper was because we didn't want the police to see it and 
recognize him as the guy who was stealing all the mopeds at school." 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't receive much acclaim, Thomas attracted the attention of 
college recruiters. He wanted to attend Louisiana State but didn't qualify for 
admission because of poor grades, so he went to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
"He really wanted to go to LSU but he was a 'C' student, and the (LSU) 
recruiter said he couldn't take any more borderline kids," Harris said. "Going 
to Alabama may have been the best thing that ever happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
After succeeding All-American linebacker Cornelius Bennett in the Crimson 
Tide's starting lineup, Thomas flourished at Alabama, winning the Dick Butkus 
Award last season. 
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise that Thomas won the award, presented annually to the best 
collegiate linebacker. It would have been surprising if he hadn't won it. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had a school-record 27 sacks and made 88 tackles for Alabama last 
season. He also blocked four kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys get called great these days when they really aren't," Alabama 
Coach Bill Curry told the Kansas City Star. "A great player should be able to 
dominate at his level. If a guy can't dominate, then I don't think he's a great 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick Thomas is a great player. He was a dominant player in the Southeastern 
Conference. He blocked kicks. He sacked quarterbacks. He knocked the ball 
loose. He came up with the football. Virtually every time we needed a 
monumental play last year, Derrick is the guy who came up with it. He is the 
epitome of an impact player." 
</P>
<P>
Although he had an outstanding college football career, Thomas had one regret: 
His father never saw him play. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was 5 when his father was killed in a plane crash in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Thomas, a B-52 co-pilot, was on a bombing mission when his plane was 
shot down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told he waited until everyone else got out," Derrick Thomas said. "Then 
he attempted to eject from the plane just before it exploded. Everybody else on 
the plane came back." 
</P>
<P>
After being listed as missing in action for six years, Robert Thomas was 
declared dead in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Earlyne Thomas, his stepmother, said that she and her husband had planned to 
adopt Derrick before her husband was killed. Derrick was born out of wedlock to 
Edith Morgan when Robert Thomas was in high school. Robert Thomas later married 
Earlyne. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to adopt Derrick, and just before his dad was killed we were going 
to be coming to Miami to visit at Christmas," Earlyne Thomas said. "We were 
going to talk about adopting Derrick. His dad was crazy about him. And I always 
thought of Derrick as a son." 
</P>
<P>
After his father died, Thomas was raised by an aunt, Annie Adams, in South 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a great deal of influence on me," Thomas said. "I think I owe 
everything I have now to her. She taught me all the virtues and values of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a strong male influence in his life, Thomas struggled to find himself 
while growing up. 
</P>
<P>
A juvenile delinquent, Thomas was sent to a school for troubled teen-agers 
after several minor scrapes with the law. The school, designed to instill 
discipline and self-esteem, helped to kindle Thomas' interest in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he would like to help other wayward youths. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal justice major in college, Thomas has talked of opening a boys' home 
after he retires from pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick has had some big scars in his life," Earlyne Thomas said. "That's why 
I'm so happy for Derrick. I want to be there for him when he's through playing 
football and nobody else knows who he is." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and his stepmother have developed a close relationship in recent years. 
A St. Louis-based attorney, she helped him select an agent and is trying to 
shield him from the wolves who would fleece him of his new-found wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had long lost relatives coming out of the woodwork asking for handouts," 
she said. "I told him not to loan anybody a dime."

BANKS SAYS HE'S RECOVERED, ASKS CHARGERS TO TAKE HIM BACK

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking fit and striking a penitent tone, linebacker Chip Banks appeared at his 
first news conference since twice pleading guilty this year to drug-related 
charges and asked that the San Diego Chargers take him back. 
</P>
<P>
"My problems were mine," Banks said. "I took the necessary arrangements to take 
of care of all my legal problems and everything else necessary for my personal 
recovery. . . . I would love to be a Charger again." 
</P>
<P>
Banks, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, has not played since 1987. He sat out 
the 1988 season after failing to reach a contract agreement. At about the same 
time, his troubles with the law accelerated in his off-season residence of 
Atlanta.

Banks has twice pleaded guilty this year to marijuana and cocaine possession 
charges in Atlanta. He received five years' probation in each case. He recently 
completed a 90-day inpatient program at a private drug treatment center and is 
now living at a recovery home in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Banks said his return hinged on the approval of owner Alex Spanos, who has said 
Banks would not play for the Chargers again. Banks said that he hoped the 
Chargers would trade him by Tuesday's deadline if they do not want him. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, 30 said he first used drugs when he was at USC, where he was an 
All-American in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not a heavy drug user, that he did not use drugs during the NFL 
season and that he had never tested positive for drugs as a player. Banks said 
he has not used drugs since last April.

AFTER A WEEK OF NEAR-MISSES, LAKERS WAIVE QUINTIN DAILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quintin Dailey, the free-agent guard who apparently was reliable only in his 
unreliability, missed the Lakers' charter flight from Los Angeles to Knoxville, 
Tenn., Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, he wasn't supposed to be on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey was waived Friday morning after a first week of training camp in which 
he missed a flight from Los Angeles to Hawaii, a team meeting, a practice and 
played poorly when he did show up. 
</P>
<P>
Signed by the Lakers three months after the Clippers didn't pick the option on 
his contract in July, Dailey was told he was waived shortly after the Lakers 
arrived in Los Angeles after an overnight flight from Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will have to absorb Dailey's guaranteed contract, reportedly worth 
$400,000, if he clears waivers. Under the National Basketball Assn. salary-cap 
rules, the Lakers will only be able to use the league minimum $110,000 to 
replace Dailey. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time offender under the NBA's drug policy, Dailey, 28, would be banned 
from the league for life should he test positive for a controlled substance a 
third time. 
</P>
<P>
The club gave Dailey a drug test after he missed a Laker practice in Honolulu 
Thursday. The test was sent to a lab in Santa Monica, according to Laker 
trainer Gary Vitti. The results are not expected until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
If Dailey tests positive for drug use, the Lakers could use all of his salary 
to sign another player. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said he doubted that drug use was Dailey's problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be surprised if he tested (positive)," Riley said. "We tested him because 
that's the (league's) policy. We had already made our decision to let him go." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said signing another shooting guard is not a priority, since the Lakers 
have Byron Scott and Michael Cooper. Riley said he also has been impressed with 
rookie free-agent Steve Bucknall, and the team is still looking for another 
power forward. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had hoped to use Dailey, who averages 15.3 points a game, as a 
backup off-guard so that Cooper could play more at small forward. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey left the Lakers' first workout complaining of dizziness and a 
stomachache and later said he had not eaten in two days. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said Dailey also "begged off" several other Laker practices and was in 
poor physical condition. Riley said Dailey reported to camp weighing less than 
200 pounds but was tested at 16% body fat and could not keep up in routine 
drills. He also was bothered by sore knees. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, a former standout at the University of San Francisco, said he missed 
Thursday's practice because he overslept. Riley and Jerry West, the Lakers' 
general manager, said Dailey's absence hastened his early departure. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to move forward now," Riley said. "Maybe this will be the final 
lesson for him to get it together." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a Laker co-captain, said Dailey did not disrupt the team but added that 
he will not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers gave him the opportunity of a lifetime," Cooper said. "And he blew 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Orlando Woolridge, who worked with Dailey at a drug rehabilitation center 
in Van Nuys: "(Rehabilitation) goes a lot further than just not drinking or 
using (drugs). In our meetings, it's about meeting responsibilities. 
Unfortunately, that was something he didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
Dailey could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fleisher, his New York-based agent, said Dailey had suffered a family 
crisis in the last 10 days. Last week, Dailey said his wife was having 
complications in her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
With Dailey gone, the Lakers will have only 14 players as they start a week of 
exhibition games tonight against the New Jersey Nets at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac's second exhibition game as a Laker Thursday night in Honolulu was 
not nearly as impressive as his debut the night before. Divac, a 7-foot-1 
center, was clearly outplayed by Sacramento's Ralph Sampson in the first half 
of Los Angeles' 110-99 victory over the Kings. The former Yugoslav Olympian was 
weak on low-post defense, allowing Sampson to catch the ball and make moves 
without pressure. Divac finished with a team-high eight turnovers, but led the 
Lakers with eight rebounds in 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Orlando Woolridge, who has had fluid drained from his right knee twice 
during training camp, scored 10 points and had five rebounds in 15 minutes 
against the Kings. Afterward, Woolridge reported no swelling or stiffness in 
his knee, so it appears that exploratory arthroscopic surgery is no longer a 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from what he called the weeklong "distraction" of guard Quintin Dailey, 
who was waived Friday, Coach Pat Riley said the Lakers' seven days in Hawaii 
were productive. "I think the players played hard this week, and we are getting 
a look at everybody," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson was bothered by a stiff neck during the second half of Thursday's 
game, in which he scored 15 points, grabbed seven rebounds and made eight 
assists in 25 minutes. "It'll be OK," he said. "I've had this problem before." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers play the Seattle SuperSonics Sunday at St. Louis, then fly to 
Lincoln, Neb., to play the Phoenix Suns Tuesday night. Their exhibition tour 
concludes against the expansion Timberwolves at Minneapolis Wednesday night.

MIKE DOWNEY: NO RECORD FOR GRETZKY, BUT CANUCK FANS AREN'T LAUGHING

Wayne, Wayne, go away, come again some other day. 
</P>
<P>
You practically could hear the Canucks thinking it out loud. Welcome back to 
Vancouver, friend Gretzky, they were saying to themselves, how's Los Angeles, 
how's Princess Janet, how's it goin', eh? Now be a nice little legend and run 
along. Don't go breaking Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record against our 
poor, unloved, unknown, never-even-won-one-stinking-Stanley-Cup Canuckleheads. 
Go pick on Edmonton. Take it out on the Oilers. They're the ones who traded 
you, not us. Go light their lamps. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Gretzky did not get the record. But you think Vancouver is happy about 
that? 
</P>
<P>
Canuck, yuk, yuk -- no way. Gretz's third point of the night Friday helped make 
6-5 winners of the Kings -- with one second to play. Now if that's not the 
Wayne Gretzky we have come to know and love, what is? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to jump ahead of myself," Gretzky said afterward, unwilling to 
predict that he will erase Howe's record Sunday at Edmonton rather than waiting 
until next Tuesday's game at home against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most everybody in Edmonton wants me to do it," Gretzky added, with 
just the slightest hint of mischief in his voice. "I just think they want me to 
do it on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
A full house at the Pacific Coliseum was quite naturally pleased to see No. 99 
again. The man always puts a few extra chills in the rink. He is more of a 
hockey hero to many of these people than No. 9, The Great Gordie, ever was, 
seeing as how Vancouver wasn't even in the National Hockey League during most 
of the Ice Age, back when Howe was playing for Detroit. Was ice even invented 
then? 
</P>
<P>
There must have been more than a few British Columbians who were getting their 
first look at Gordie Howe -- through binoculars -- as he watched his rightful 
heir from King owner Bruce McNall's luxury box. Gretzky came into the game 
needing five more points to eclipse Howe's scoring record of 1,850 points. He 
got three -- all assists. Hey, a point is a point is a point. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Howe will keep tailing Gretzky from town to town until the record 
breaks, whether it be Sunday at Edmonton, or Tuesday in Inglewood, or . . . 
well, there'd better not be another "or." Nobody in hockey likes an "or," 
unless it's Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
Say, there's an idea. Let's drag Bobby Orr out of retirement. Maybe let him 
play for the Kings, too. 
</P>
<P>
You see, there's this goofy story going around that Gordie Howe is going to 
suit up with the Kings sometime soon -- at age 61! Whether this idea is 
practical or a practical joke, we can't yet tell. We also don't know for sure 
what would happen should Howe get a hat trick on his first night playing for 
McNall, then decides to work a couple of shifts every game for the rest of the 
season. What if Howe re-breaks the scoring record after Gretzky breaks it? What 
if McNall also signs Alex Delvecchio to play on his line? 
</P>
<P>
Listen, Los Angeles is such a one-of-a-kind hockey town, anything can happen. 
You think we're pulling your skate? We couldn't be more serious. Think about 
it: Who are the three greatest scorers in hockey history? Marcel Dionne, who 
played for the Kings; Wayne Gretzky, who plays for the Kings, and Gordie Howe, 
who is going to play for the Kings. Now there's a trick for you. 
</P>
<P>
We can't help but wonder -- will anybody ever break Wayne Gretzky's record, 
once he breaks the thing? Where will it rank? With Pete Rose's hits? With Nolan 
Ryan's strikeouts? With Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's points? Will Gretz be anything 
like those guys and keep playing well into his 40s? Do you have any idea when 
Wayne Gretzky will even turn 40? On Jan. 26, 2001 -- that's when he'll turn 40. 
</P>
<P>
The guy might have 3,000 points by then. Maybe he'll turn out to be just like 
Howe, his idol -- still playing at age 52, still talking comeback at 61. Or 
maybe Old Man Gretzky will be up there watching from a luxury box by then, 
watching some new kid scoring goals for the Kings, challenging his record. 
Maybe the kid's last name will be Gretzky. Maybe her first name will be 
Paulina. 
</P>
<P>
It was exactly 10 years ago Tuesday that Wayne Gretzky scored his first NHL 
point. It was exactly one year ago Oct. 6 that Gretzky scored his first Los 
Angeles point. How time flies when you're torturing goalies. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous 99 since Barbara Feldon on "Get Smart," Gretzky got a big hand 
when he first took the ice Friday -- and after that, he was strictly the enemy. 
Canuck-lovers were a lot more interested in seeing their team win than in 
seeing Gretzky score five points against them. Still, they sold out the 
building for the first time all season -- and we all know why, don't we? 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were behind by two goals, then ahead by two goals, then locked in 
mortal combat most of the third period, until the very, very end. Gretzky was 
stopped point-blank on his one clean bustout, but assisted twice on goals by 
Bob Kudelski and then on the game-winner. The record could wait. As usual, 
Gretzky was more concerned with winning. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton, you're next. 
</P>
<P>
And he isn't going away.

Rick Majerus, former Marquette University basketball coach, says he meant no 
offense with his remark on a Milwaukee radio talk-show about the prevalence of 
irregular sexual behavior in women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Majerus, now the coach at the University of Utah, had been asked about the 
pressures of winning because of the money it can produce for a school. 
</P>
<P>
Said Majerus: "I'm for these new rules of moving the season back, publishing 
graduation rates and dropping it from 28 to 25 games, but the 28-to-25 drop 
will never occur because of the economics of the situation, just like we'll 
never have a return to freshman eligibility. And people don't realize that what 
will compound that problem is women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"Men's athletics are so visible it's amazing. You know, with women's athletics, 
my experience has been that there's a great deal of, um, and I'll be frank with 
you here, there's a great deal of, uh, irregular sexual behavior, let me say. 
</P>
<P>
"And, you know, that's never brought to the forefront. If that were that 
prevalent in men's athletics, there'd be Sports Illustrated, Time magazine, 
would have exposes from now ad infinity." 
</P>
<P>
Majerus, who spent two seasons at Ball State University between his stints at 
Marquette and Utah, later refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care to get into it any further," Majerus said. "I meant nothing by 
it. Everybody knows I'm a flippant guy. I said a hundred things, kidding 
around. . . . I made a joke about sheep in Wyoming. I said something about 
passing the microphone and catching a communicable disease. The other night at 
the roast for Del Harris (coach of the Milwaukee Bucks), I'm talking about 
Del's underwear. What does that mean?"

Kevin Mitchell, who led the major leagues with 47 home runs, was selected by 
Associated Press as major league player of the year. The Giants' left fielder 
hit .291 with 100 runs scored, 34 doubles and 125 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell received 114 points in voting by writers and broadcasters to far 
outdistance teammate Will Clark, who had 20. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be recognized, but it really has been a total team effort," 
Mitchell said. "We had lots of injuries to the pitching staff, and (Manager) 
Roger (Craig) kept it all together."

Bob Quinn, vice president and general manager of the New York Yankees the last 
two seasons, resigned to sign a two-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds in 
the same position. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, 52, replaces Murray Cook. Asked whether Cook resigned or was fired, Red 
owner Marge Schott told reporters: "I don't think that needs to be said, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
Quinn's first objective is to find a new manager. He said interim manager Tommy 
Helms, who took over Aug. 24 after Pete Rose was banned from baseball because 
of alleged baseball gambling, remains a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner named Harding Peterson, a former Pittsburgh 
Pirates general manager, to replace Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry to see Bob leave," Steinbrenner said. "He was one of the most loyal 
and dedicated employees I have ever had."

GIANTS: SAN FRANCISCO LEADOFF BATTER HAS SOME FLASH AND DASH BUT IS 
OVERSHADOWED BY BRILLIANCE OF OAKLAND COUNTERPART, RICKEY HENDERSON.

<TEXT>
<P>
The other leadoff hitter in the 1989 World Series brings some of the same flash 
and dash as his illustrious counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, can jive with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, has been called arrogant. He, too, has a showman's instinct, once 
thinking he wanted to be traded to the Dodgers so that he could pursue an 
acting career in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that now, when it comes to renown, when it comes to pre-Series 
ballyhoo, Rickey Henderson of the Oakland Athletics is the Golden Gate of 
leadoff hitters and Brett Butler of the San Francisco Giants is the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
For Butler, there is nothing new in the role, only some familiar motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Once again he is the kid growing up in nearby Fremont and being told he is too 
small. 
</P>
<P>
Once again he is the college dreamer, drafted only because a scout for the 
Atlanta Braves is a close friend of his coach at Southeastern Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to be flamboyant as a kid to get noticed," the 5-foot-10, 160-pound 
Butler said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you can let Rickey have all the flamboyance and attention. He's the elite 
of what we do. Give him the spotlight and I'll be the cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I've been in these shadows before. I've been told I couldn't make it, 
that I was too small, that I couldn't do this or that. I relish the role. It's 
always been an incentive for me." 
</P>
<P>
Butler's role is that of the Giants' table setter for Robby Thompson, Will 
Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
His acquisition as a free agent in the winter of 1987 provided a dimension 
similar to what Henderson provided the A's when acquired in a June trade with 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had used 12 leadoff hitters while winning the title in the National 
League East in '87. Butler replaced the revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .287, scored 109 runs and stole 43 bases in 1988. He batted .283, 
scored 100 runs and stole 31 bases this year. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Henderson has that rare blend of power and speed, having hammered 138 
homers and stolen 871 bases, Butler has increased his on-base opportunities by 
becoming one of the major leagues' foremost exponents of bunting. 
</P>
<P>
In seven seasons, he has 37 home runs and 136 bunt singles, 43 of those in his 
two years with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey will get 25 homers a year and I'll get 25 bunt singles," Butler said. 
"You've got to know your limitations. I don't have his home run ability, but he 
doesn't have my bunting ability -- or at least he doesn't like to bunt." 
</P>
<P>
And each to his own straw. 
</P>
<P>
"Opposing pitchers know Brett will do anything to stir it up," veteran Giant 
catcher Bob Brenly said. "We've seen the third baseman play in, and he still 
bunts it in his face." 
</P>
<P>
With all acknowledged leadoff hitters, there is a sense of confidence, a belief 
they can reach base by any means, the desire to torment the opposing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
If, in Butler's case, there is also a degree of arrogance, it may have stemmed 
from that long joust with the windmills about his size. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with being confident if you can back it up," he said. 
"If arrogance plays a part, then I guess I'm arrogant, but I'd prefer to call 
it desire. No one has more. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey likes to put on a show and that's fine. For me, I've got to spark my 
club and get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
"Showmanship to me means playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
Butler batted only .211 in the five-game playoff against the Chicago Cubs, but 
of the seven times he reached base on a hit or walk, he scored six times, 
second on the club to Clark's eight. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, of course, had one of the greatest playoffs ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on our team respects him, but you can't respect him to the point 
where you're scared of him," Butler said. "He walked seven times in the 
playoffs. He uses his flamboyance as an intimidation to get in the pitcher's 
head. You've got to let him make his outs. You've got to prevent the walks. 
Rickey used his flamboyance to rattle the Toronto pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
There is more to Henderson than the showman, of course. The greatest leadoff 
hitter ever? Butler cited Henderson's power and said he always thought of 
Henderson as a No. 3 hitter who happens to bat leadoff -- Bobby Bonds being a 
similar case. 
</P>
<P>
Is the role changing then? Butler nodded and said: 
</P>
<P>
"When people talk about me as being a consummate leadoff hitter, it's a 
throwback to the days when they only used Punch and Judy hitters at the top of 
the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Butler is 32. He was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Fremont as a fan of 
both the Giants and A's. He remembers sitting in the right-field bleachers at 
the Oakland Coliseum as a member of Reggie's Regiment, providing support to 
Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
However, he idolized Pete Rose's desire and Willie Mays' defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember someone saying that Willie's glove was a place where triples went 
to die and I dreamt of someone saying the same thing about me some day," he 
said. "It was as if I grew up with the Giants, so that when I returned it was 
like coming full circle." 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Butler spent parts of three seasons in Atlanta, where he often 
felt more like Rhett than Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
The organist played "Tara's Theme" each time he came to the plate, owner Ted 
Turner called his wife Scarlett instead of Eveline and Butler often considered 
reporting to work in a white plantation hat and suit. 
</P>
<P>
After the Braves gave up Butler and Brook Jacoby for pitcher Len Barker, Butler 
spent four seasons in Cleveland, where he was frustrated by management's 
refusal to spend the money to build a winner and by recurring rumors that he 
was going to be traded to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Free agency finally represented a way out, and Butler said he signed with the 
Giants in the wake of their '87 division title because of club president Al 
Rosen's conviction that he represented the missing element. 
</P>
<P>
"Clubs like Cleveland and Seattle should sit back and ponder what Al Rosen and 
(owner) Bob Lurie and (manager) Roger Craig have done here since 1985, when 
they lost 100 games," Butler said. "Every time they've needed a player, they've 
gone out and gotten him. 
</P>
<P>
"They signed me as the leadoff hitter. They traded for Steve Bedrosian as the 
bullpen stopper. I'm sure that before next season they'll have a new right 
fielder, if that's what they deem they need. 
</P>
<P>
"When players feel that management wants to win as much as they do, it makes 
for a very positive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Craig calls Butler a team leader, the best leadoff man he has had, and a better 
defensive player than Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco center fielder has obviously come a long way from the young 
Giant fan who was so hyperactive that he would feign sickness to get out of 
class and then run through school halls, releasing his energy. 
</P>
<P>
Now Butler has it channeled in such a way that at one point in Game 5 of the 
playoffs he ran to his position in center field, shaking his fist to awaken 
fans who were displaying, in his words, an air of uncertainty, fearing the 
possibility of a comeback by the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
It may not have been Rickey Henderson dancing to the beat of the Oakland 
organist, exchanging needles with the partisan fans in the Toronto SkyDome or 
tiptoeing into second base with another successful steal, but it was an example 
of how the other leadoff man in this World Series can contribute with more than 
his bat.

MORGAN CLAIMS NATIONAL LEAGUE IS BETTER

<P>
Joe Morgan, announcer for the San Francisco Giants, has played in both leagues 
and said that the biggest factor in the Giants' favor this week is the company 
they keep. 
</P>
<P>
"The National League is definitely the harder league, no question," Morgan 
said. "If Kevin Mitchell was in the American League, he would have been chasing 
Roger Maris' home run record. The NL ballparks are bigger, and the teams play 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"How many American League teams have you seen that can manufacture runs like 
they do in the National League? How many?" 
</P>
<P>
When a bystander answered, "Oakland," Morgan replied, "There you go. They are 
the only one, and look how far they got." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said the American League's problems date to the days of former Baltimore 
Manager Earl Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
"He believed in pitching, defense and the three-run homer," Morgan said. "Since 
then, that's all anybody has tried over there. Difference was, Weaver actually 
had all three. Over there, if you don't, you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why Rickey Henderson can be the difference. The A's have all three, 
plus him. That's why he plays such a big role in that league." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan then picked on the American League pitchers, saying: "They don't throw 
inside as much as the National Leaguers. I don't know why, but they just won't 
throw inside. Again, that's why Oakland is tough, because they have some old 
National Leaguers on that pitching staff who aren't afraid to come close." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig on being a pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers in their 
1955 World Series victory, four games to three, over the New York Yankees: 
</P>
<P>
"It was a 15-cent trip from Brooklyn to the Bronx. When I came to the Dodgers 
in 1955, the Yankees and Dodgers seemed like they were always in the Series 
each season and the Yankees would always win. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize what it meant when we won until I came into the locker room 
and saw the Robinsons, the Campanellas, Reeses and Sniders and all their 
emotions, all of them were sitting there with tears in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Craig's Game 1 batting order had two surprises, Candy Maldonado starting in 
right field and designated hitter Ernest Riles batting sixth, behind No. 5 
hitter Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado started only once in the five-game National League playoffs and Riles 
usually batted ahead of Williams when both were in the lineup during the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Craig on Maldonado, who batted .217 during the regular season and went 0 for 
three in the playoffs: "He's had a number of good years for me. This season, he 
never quit. I just have a hunch he's going to have a good series." 
</P>
<P>
Craig on Williams, who batted fifth behind Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell during 
the playoffs: "I did it for psychological reasons. You guys have been 
mentioning Clark and Mitchell and Williams in the same breath and I think that 
he is starting to believe that he belongs in that same class." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' batting order: Brett Butler, cf; Robby Thompson, 2b; Clark, 1b; 
Mitchell, lf; Williams, 3b; Riles, dh; Kennedy, c; Maldonado, rf, and Jose 
Uribe, ss. The Giant pitcher, who will not bat in the American League park this 
series, will be Scott Garrelts. 
</P>
<P>
The most inexperienced of that group is Riles, who has only been a designated 
hitter once in his big league career. As the DH for Milwaukee on June 21, 1985, 
he went 0 for six against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa also had two surprises in his lineup. 
Right-handed hitting catcher Terry Steinbach will be starting in place of 
left-handed hitting Ron Hassey, despite the presence of right-handed Giant 
starter Garrelts. And Walt Weiss, the poorer fielder, will be starting at 
shortstop in place of Mike Gallego. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of shortstop, I was looking for the extra left-handed bat," La 
Russa said of Weiss. "At catcher, Steinbach has worked well with (starter Dave) 
Stewart all year long, real well, so I go with Steinbach." 
</P>
<P>
The A's batting order: Rickey Henderson, lf; Carney Lansford, 3b; Jose Canseco, 
rf; Dave Parker, dh; Dave Henderson, cf; Mark McGwire, 1b; Steinbach, C; Tony 
Phillips, 2b, and Weiss, ss. 
</P>
<P>
Does Craig believe that A's relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley doctors the ball, 
as Toronto Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston claimed in the ninth inning of Sunday's 
fifth and final playoff game? 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, somewhere along the line, someone thought he was doing something," 
Craig said. "Now it's become more magnified because it's the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, however, added that he saw no evidence of doctoring when Eckersley was 
in the National League with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Giant manager also said, that the practice is rampant, that every pitcher 
tries it at least once -- "like a kid with a new toy" -- and that the only way 
to stop it is for offenders to be suspended for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The league should give the umpires authority to check the glove of every new 
pitcher when he enters the game," Craig said. "As it is, the umpires see it but 
don't react." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said that for the first time, managers and umpires will meet to discuss 
the issue at the winter meetings in December. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commissioner's office said it would wait until after the World 
Series to review tapes of the playoff incident sent by the Blue Jays, who claim 
that they offer irrefutable evidence that Eckersley attempted to hide something 
in his pants during the ninth inning of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Eckersley Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"They're still trying to justify losing." 
</P>
<P>
Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
This being the second consecutive All-California World Series, the last World 
Series game played outside the state was on Oct. 25, 1987, in Minneapolis. . . 
. Today the Giants' Scott Garrelts becomes the first pitcher with more relief 
appearances, 258, than starts, 55, to start a Series opener since the Dodgers' 
Joe Black faced the Yankees in 1952. . . . Oakland Manager Tony La Russa 
becomes the first manager to guide clubs to consecutive Series appearances 
since the Dodgers' Tom Lasorda in 1977-78. 
</P>
<P>
Two players in this Series have fathers who also played in the World Series -- 
San Francisco's Terry Kennedy, whose father Bob played with Cleveland, and 
Oakland's Stan Javier, whose father Julian played with St. Louis. There are 10 
father-son combinations in Series history, but only two have both played on 
winning teams -- the Boones, Ray and Bob, and the Hegans, Jim and Mike. . . . 
San Francisco's Don Robinson is appearing in his first World Series in 10 
years, the longest gap between Series appearances since Boston's Bill Buckner 
played with the Dodgers in 1974 and the Boston Red Sox in 1986. Robinson 
previously played with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979.

DOW'S BIG PLUNGE ISN'T A SIGNAL THAT RECESSION IS AT HAND, ANALYSTS SAY;

ECONOMY: WORRIES ABOUT JUNK BONDS AND EARNINGS HELPED FUEL SELLOFF FEVER.

<P>
The dramatic 190-point plunge in the stock market Friday was mainly brought on 
by financial worries and did not signal investor concern about the economy or 
the onset of a recession, economists and business analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts said Friday's selloff could spark a further "adjustment" in 
the stock market during the next few days -- as well as some "psychological 
spillover" in other financial markets -- there was widespread agreement that 
the economy would emerge essentially unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as economic spillover goes, I don't see a lot of it," said William C. 
Melton, chief economist for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. Stephen H. 
Axilrod of Nikko Securities Co. in New York agreed. "I don't think it's going 
to have any effect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To support their view, economists pointed out that the huge stock market 
collapse of October, 1987, did not inflict lasting damage on the economy, 
despite predictions to the contrary. Manufacturers continued to enjoy a boom, 
despite the severe jitters that shook the financial world. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike two years ago, a time of widespread nervousness about inflation and 
recession, Friday's collapse came at a time of relative calm in the U.S. 
economy, with business executives and investors resigned to a period of 
sluggish growth and modest inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials expressed confidence that the impact would be 
minimal. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who briefed President Bush and 
other top officials on the slide late Friday afternoon, issued a statement 
predicting that there would be little, if any, economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the 
condition of the economy," Brady asserted. "The economy remains well balanced 
and the outlook is for continued moderate growth." The Federal Reserve had no 
formal statement on the slide. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House Press Secretary Alixe Glen said the Administration was not 
contemplating any special measures as a result of the decline. She said 
authorities had no plans to try to close -- or delay the opening of -- the 
stock market on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists speculated that if the decline in the stock market continues, it 
could prompt the Federal Reserve Board to nudge interest rates down slightly to 
help contain any damage. But they differed about how long it would have to 
continue for the Fed to react. 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass., said the Fed 
"will have to" loosen "if this continues" and corporations begin finding it 
difficult to attract necessary financing. "But only if it continues," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But A. Gary Shilling, a Wall Street economist, predicted that "the Fed may be 
reluctant to react this time" for fear of exacerbating inflation pressures. 
Shilling noted that Friday's news of an 0.9-percentage-point rise in producer 
prices helped trigger the stock-price decline. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also were quick to point out that there are some significant 
differences between Friday's slide and the 508-point plunge that the stock 
market took Oct. 19, 1987 -- the day of the now-famous "Black Monday" crash. 
</P>
<P>
Among others, Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in 
New York, noted that the economy is not overheating, as it appeared to be in 
1987; stock prices are not nearly as bloated; interest rates are not rising 
sharply, and the dollar is not under constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no comparison between the financial market conditions of today and 
(those of) two years ago," Roach declared. 
</P>
<P>
Along with economists from other investment advisory firms, David D. Hale, 
economist for Kemper Financial Services of Chicago, thought the slide might 
prove to have a silver lining -- at least for those investors who are seeking 
out bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could be a buying opportunity," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
Melton's IDS Financial Services agreed. The Minneapolis-based firm sent telexes 
to its clients late Friday advising that "we are going to have an opportunity 
to enter the market again as buyers" as soon as the current "correction" is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not everyone was sanguine about the likely impact of Friday's 
slide. Norman E. Mains, chief economist at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. 
in Los Angeles, said he believes that "stocks are a good predictor of 
recession" and Friday's decline suggests output will be "weak." 
</P>
<P>
"We may be in for a mild recession," he warned, stopping short of an actual 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts seemed to agree that the stock market slide stemmed almost entirely 
from financial factors. They sketched this scenario: 
</P>
<P>
* Corporate earnings have been disappointing for several quarters now, but the 
markets had ignored that because investors were distracted by leveraged buyouts 
and takeovers, frequently financed by high-risk junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
* Then, Friday's reluctance by the banks to underwrite the United Air Lines 
buyout deal signaled that the takeover spree could be over and that financing 
would be more difficult to obtain in coming months. The markets panicked, and 
stock prices began to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying fragility of the financial aspects" was exposed, Axilrod said. 
</P>
<P>
* In addition, the government reported Friday that wholesale prices rose 
sharply in September, raising some inflation concerns, but most analysts 
considered the rise to be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever individual investors may have thought, economists tended to view 
Friday's decline as a needed -- and probably very healthy -- "technical 
correction" that might very well help the economy keep its momentum up. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Chandross, chief North American economist for Lloyds Bank, said that 
although economic output is growing more slowly now than it was a few months 
ago, "that's desirable and necessary" to keep inflation pressures from 
intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there are any economics that can explain what happened today," 
he said.

2ND TIME AROUND, TRADERS JUST AS DAZED;

WALL STREET: INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, GRIM MEMORIES OF 
OCTOBER, 1987, RESURFACE.

<P>
He came out of the members' entrance of the New York Stock Exchange with a 
dazed look on his face and muttering to himself: "Two hundred points it dropped 
. . . 200 points." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to talk with the throng of reporters who had gathered on the 
street, drawn by the deepest plunge in the Dow Jones industrial index since the 
crash of 1987. What's more, after a day like this, the last thing he was going 
to give out was his name. 
</P>
<P>
Like most other brokers and specialists at the end of Friday's trading, he 
wanted to get away -- quickly and with no comment. 
</P>
<P>
What had started as a rather routine day, with many traders no doubt dreaming 
of their weekend plans, suddenly turned into a fright in the final hour as the 
Dow plummeted 190.58 points. The shock and speed of the decline raised ugly 
memories of the epic stock panic nearly two years ago to the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fun, it's not fun," a middle-age man in a trench coat mumbled as he 
emerged from the exchange building. "People were taking a little bit of a 
beating in there." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very ugly, nothing but sell, sell, sell," said another man who agreed 
to talk briefly before climbing into his limousine. Asked what caused the free 
fall, he replied: "Maybe it was overdue. Nobody knows the answers." 
</P>
<P>
"It's Friday the 13th and a full moon," said another in response to the same 
question. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Albanese, who works in purchasing sales for a Wall Street 
firm, the scene as the members left the exchange, while grim enough, did not 
compare to that on "Black Monday" two years ago. "Most people were going out 
the windows then," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
When one rosy-cheeked man came out of the entrance with a smile on his face 
instead of the stunned expression most others wore, Albanese remarked: "He 
probably owns 'puts.' The only people smiling are the people that own puts. The 
more the market goes down, the more money they make." 
</P>
<P>
(A put is an option that gives the right to sell shares of a specific stock, at 
a specific price, within a specific time period.) 
</P>
<P>
As he emerged from the exchange building, Bob Trimble said that he was only a 
"little scared." "We've been through this before," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of so many reporters and television cameras also drew many 
curiosity-seekers to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
But one young woman with corn-row braids was disappointed to learn that it was 
only the stock market that was creating so much interest. "I thought maybe 
Ronald Reagan was here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Harry's Bar, a traditional Wall Street watering hole, one 
bartender turned philosophic, saying it was "just another day in the life of 
Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
However, a customer quickly countered: "He can laugh. He's only a $2 player."

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, sworn in only 
two days ago, was holed up in his office taking conference calls Friday and 
unavailable for comment on the steep market plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines to his office were jammed. Assistants said they did not know 
whether the chairman would issue a statement. 
</P>
<P>
But the new chairman already is on record opposing SEC intervention to close 
markets in the event of a crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not consider such a step," Breeden said during his confirmation 
hearings before the Senate Banking Committee last month. 
</P>
<P>
Market regulation officers were busy trying to collect information on how well 
the markets handled the decline. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in an information-gathering mode right now. It's probably premature to 
comment right now," said Stephen Luperello, an SEC branch chief for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Asked during his confirmation hearings what he would do if the market plummeted 
500 points the day after he took office, Breeden told the Senate Banking 
Committee that, "at a minimum," he and his staff would remain in close contact 
with the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange has already adopted a "circuit breaker," in which 
trading would be temporarily halted if the Dow dropped more than 250 points in 
one day's trading.

Bond prices rocketed higher in heavy trading Friday afternoon, as investors 
fled the panicky stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates, which decline when bond prices rise, dropped to their lowest 
levels since April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond soared nearly 2 
points, or $20 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield plunged from 8.04% 
late Thursday to 7.88% -- its lowest level since it hit 7.84% in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a flight to quality," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president at Dean 
Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-income securities -- especially Treasury bonds -- often are viewed as a 
safe haven in moments of trouble on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a classic development," said Marshall Front, an economist at the Chicago 
investment firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham. "Something you absolutely would 
expect to happen at a time of extreme panic." 
</P>
<P>
Many market watchers believe that the Federal Reserve could move to pump up the 
economy in order to head off the threat of recession. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank does that by pushing interest rates lower to reduce the cost 
of borrowing and investing. Shortly after the market crash on Oct. 19, 1987, 
the Fed cut its key discount rate -- a move widely credited with helping 
contain the financial losses. As interest rates drop, bond prices rise. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed will now have an important reason to ease" rates, Front said. He 
suggested that it could move Monday to lower the federal funds rate, the 
interest on overnight loans between banks. The rate finished Friday at 8.625%, 
down from 8.813% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index plummeted about 190 points Friday afternoon in a 
wave of panic selling reminiscent of the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the drop was triggered by news that a pilot-management group 
failed to secure financing for the proposed $6.75-billion takeover of United 
Airlines' parent UAL Corp., combined with recent concern about weakness in the 
junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
While Treasury bonds jumped higher, prices of the high-risk, high-yield junk 
bonds plunged 1 point to 1 1/4 point in nervous trading. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional corporate bonds, however, were lifted on the coattails of 
Treasuries. Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total 
return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer, rose 2.39 to 336.42. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds edged up 1/16 point to 92 13/16 point. The average yield to maturity 
slipped to 7.32% from 7.33% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues rose about 1/2 point to 25/32 point, intermediate maturities jumped 
13/16 point to 1 13/16 points, and long-term issues zoomed nearly 2 points, 
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, advanced 11.69 to close at 1,196.37. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.41% as the discount dropped 52 
basis points to 7.19%. Yields on six-month bills slid to 7.63% as the discount 
retreated 39 basis points to 7.26%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.64% as 
the discount tumbled 37 basis points to 7.15%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill.

Some comments on the causes of Friday's stock market plunge and predictions for 
what will happen Monday: 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas F. Brady 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Treasury: 
</P>
<P>
"Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the 
condition of the economy. The economy remains well balanced, and the outlook is 
for continued moderate growth." 
</P>
<P>
John McGillicuddy 
</P>
<P>
Chairman, Manufacturers Hanover: 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have the market drop 190 points and you're not concerned, there's 
something wrong with you." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth R. French 
</P>
<P>
Finance professor, University of Chicago business school: 
</P>
<P>
"My view is the market is taking (the failure of the proposed buyout of United 
Airlines' parent) as a strong signal about the prospects about future LBOs and 
takeovers. That's what we're seeing -- a revaluation based on that lower 
probability. The market didn't have a lot of time to think this one out. My 
belief is when it reacts, it gives us an unbiased estimate. It's as likely to 
have a correction upward as a correction downward Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave their best shot, and now they're going to go home and sit back and 
think about it over the weekend. Sometimes when they do that they discover 
they've overestimated, and sometimes they go home and discover they've 
underestimated. I'm quite surprised by the magnitude of the response." 
</P>
<P>
James M. Benham 
</P>
<P>
Chairman, Benham Capital Management Group: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a huge calendar of junk bonds that want to come to market before 
year-end. And the marketplace has been very cool to recent offerings of junk 
bonds. A lot of stocks in the stock market have been bid up in price in 
anticipation of buyouts. When they stopped trading the ones that were in play 
for merger, it caused a selloff in everything. I think that's what caused the 
widespread panic in the last hour. People knowing they were going to get margin 
calls had to sell something." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Poulakakos 
</P>
<P>
Owner of Harry's Bar, a favorite of Wall Streeters: 
</P>
<P>
"When the market went down 500 points, we were full at 4:30 and it kept going 
until two o'clock in the morning. Last time at this time, we had 10 television 
stations here already. Today everybody took it a little bit easier." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Peroni 
</P>
<P>
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott: 
</P>
<P>
"It's total emotional and psychological chaos. People are dumping everything. . 
. . A great deal of money is being lost." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry L. Jordan 
</P>
<P>
Chief economist, First Interstate Bank, and member of President's Council of 
Economic Advisers 1981-82: 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a succession of things in recent weeks. The Campeau deal came 
unraveled, several of the (leveraged buyout) deals are now in trouble, the 
MGM/United Artists thing came unraveled, and now United Airlines. And people 
are seeing that the arithmetic necessary to justify these deals isn't there. 
And the arithmetic is you've got to have either high inflation, raise the price 
of your products, or you've got to have real volume increases or you'd better 
be able to sell a bunch of assets to somebody and get your debt down. And if 
you have a weak economy, you can't sell your subsidiaries and things and get 
your debt down -- there are no buyers out there. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll all be watching Monday morning. . . . What happened two years ago was 
Friday, we got hit in New York, and then Monday, Tokyo opened very weak and 
started falling all day. And then it hit Frankfurt, Paris and London. New York 
just continued the process, and at the end of the day, 28 stock markets around 
the world all got hit. So if this is a localized phenomenon, people changing 
their view about the U.S. economy, or if it's strictly UAL, then there's no 
spillover Monday morning. But if it was strictly UAL, there's no reason why the 
bond market should rally or the dollar should fall. It's these sympathy moves 
that you want to try to interpret for additional information, rather than 
merely the stock market slump. I would not be surprised to see (a further 
decline on Monday.)"

Southern California stocks were hammered Friday along with the rest of the 
market, with Hilton Hotels Corp. receiving the worst battering. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton dropped $21.50 a share, to $85, a drop of 20% for the Beverly Hills 
hotel chain. Hilton's percentage decline was the second-largest on the New York 
Stock Exchange, behind only troubled Western Union's 23% drop. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton is one of several takeover stocks that dropped in the wake of the 
announcement Friday that the financing had unraveled for the proposed 
$6.75-billion buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines. Investors, stock 
analysts say, are increasingly nervous that it may be an indicator that 
financing for other takeover deals may fall through as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Hilton's case, Chief Executive Barron Hilton put the company up for sale 
this summer. William C. Lebo Jr., the company's general counsel, said the 
plunge in Hilton's stock price would not affect the company's plans to shop 
itself around to buyers, but said the UAL announcement clearly triggered the 
selling in Hilton's stock. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the stock market virus," said Lebo, making light of the so-called 
computer virus that had been touted as a threat on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Another Southern California takeover-related issue, AMI Inc., fell nearly 16%. 
The hospital chain's stock closed at $20 a share, down $3.75. The Beverly Hills 
hospital chain is the subject of a $1.67-billion buyout bid, and disclosed 
earlier this week that another two suitors are interested. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California executives largely attributed their stock declines Friday 
to being swept up in the overall market plunge rather than to any industry 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment issues that fell sharply included Burbank-based Walt Disney, 
which dropped $7.25 to $123 a share. In fact, trading in Disney shares were 
halted late in the day because of an imbalance in orders. MCA, the Universal 
City entertainment firm, fell $6.63 to $62. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks in large California banks also dropped sharply. BankAmerica in San 
Francisco closed down $2.75 at $32; Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles fell 
$3 to $45; Wells Fargo in San Francisco fell $3.75 to $83 a share, and First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles dropped $4.38 to $57.25. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts fared better. H. F. Ahmanson, the Los Angeles-based parent of Home 
Savings of America, fell only 87.5 cents a share to $23. Great Western 
Financial in Beverly Hills dropped $1.75 a share to $21.88. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace issues were down in varying degrees. Litton Industries in Beverly 
Hills was down $6.87 1/2 to $85 a share. Rockwell International in El Segundo 
fell $2.12 1/2 to $22.38. Calabasas-based Lockheed, however, fell only $1 a 
share to $48. Los Angeles-based Northrop, whose stock has already fallen with 
the company's legal and other troubles, was down 62.5 cents to $21.50. 
</P>
<P>
Oil issues were hit hard. Atlantic Richfield in Los Angeles fell $6 a share to 
$98.25. Unocal in Los Angeles was down $4.13 to $52.50, while Occidental 
Petroleum in Westwood fell $2.63 to $27. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive Corp., the Beverly Hills insurance firm with a large portfolio 
of junk bonds, fell $2 a share to $10.25, making it one of the biggest losers 
in over-the-counter trading. The junk bond market has been in turmoil lately as 
a result of several troubled issues, such as Resorts International and Campeau. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Beverly Hills, a family-controlled company with 
a thinly traded stock, fell just 25 cents a share to $7.13, even though Moody's 
Investors Service downgraded its rating on Columbia Savings debt because of its 
extensive junk-bond portfolio.

U.S. JOINS EMPLOYEES' SUIT ON NORTHROP MX CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department has intervened in a civil fraud suit against Northrop 
Corp. that alleges overcharges on MX missile equipment, according to federal 
sources and private attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon issued an order late Thursday unsealing the 
Justice Department's amended complaint in the lawsuit, originally filed two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Due to a variety of bureaucratic snafus, the Justice Department complaint was 
not available Friday, but reliable sources said the department had intervened 
in the case on three issues: The department is alleging that there was some 
overcharges on MX contracts, improper use of unauthorized testing equipment and 
unapproved use of subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department complaint against the Los Angeles aerospace company is 
less extensive than the original suit brought under the federal False Claims 
Act by two former Northrop employees, David Peterson and Jeff Kroll. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, Peterson testified before Congress that Northrop instituted 
several shell companies to circumvent its normally labyrinthine procurement 
system and speed the MX project. Northrop has acknowledged setting up a 
separate company to buy parts but has contended its actions fell within 
Pentagon guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Hafif, a Claremont attorney representing Peterson and Kroll, said the 
Justice Department's decision to intervene means that Northrop has "a very 
serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Greg Waskul declined to comment on the Justice Department 
complaint, saying that the company had not been served yet. However, he said 
that the suit doesn't "deal with an issue of quality" of the company's work on 
the MX. 
</P>
<P>
"The reliability and accuracy of the parts made for the MX by Northrop continue 
to be better than planned, as has been the case throughout the program," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported on Sept. 9 that congressional sources said Northrop is under 
federal investigation for building a $1.2-million machine to test a key 
component of the MX missile guidance system and for billing the government for 
the expense even though the Air Force had not given prior authorization for the 
equipment. The charges reportedly are the focus of criminal and civil 
investigations being conducted by Justice Department officials in connection 
with a broader probe of Northrop's activities in the MX missile guidance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The machine in question, called a dry integration test station, is intended to 
assess all parts of the guidance system component before it is fully assembled. 
The guidance device, called an inertial measurement unit, is the size of a 
basketball and is designed to float in a special fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers tried to persuade Judge Kenyon to keep the civil 
suit under seal until the criminal probe has been completed, but they were 
unsuccessful, according to sources close to the case. However, Kenyon's order 
unsealing the case prohibits any discovery proceedings by lawyers on the dry 
integration station for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Under the False Claims Act, the Justice Department has 60 days to tell a 
federal district court whether it wants to join in litigation brought by 
whistle-blowers, such as Peterson and Kroll. In some instances, the department 
can gain an extension, and it got a lengthy one in this case. The 
whistle-blower can garner between 15% and 25% of any damages recovered in a 
suit of this kind if the Justice Department intervenes.

WARNER VS. SONY -- A TALENT HUNT GROWS NASTIER; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: LAWSUITS FLY AMID A BATTLE ROYAL FOR THE MOVIE-MAKING SKILLS OF 
PETER GUBER AND JON PETERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tug-of-war between Sony Corp. and Warner Bros. for the movie-making talents 
of Peter Guber and Jon Peters turned nastier Friday as Warner filed a 
$1-billion lawsuit accusing Sony of unlawfully recruiting the producers to run 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment while under contract to Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the Warner suit, lawyers for Guber and Peters sued Warner in 
the same Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that Warner is trying to 
"sabotage" Sony's acquisitions of Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co., 
among other things. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle throws into question not only Columbia's future management but 
also Hollywood's receptiveness to the first foreign buyer of a major motion 
picture studio. In a chilly statement, the co-chief executive of Time Warner 
Inc. issued a thinly veiled warning that Sony's conduct "will not be condoned." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Warner and Time executives played upon nationalistic 
sympathies in Congress to promote their merger as necessary to compete in a 
global marketplace against Japanese and European entities. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sony's $3.4-billion tender offer for Columbia won't expire until Oct. 
31, it already has an option to buy 52% from the biggest shareholders, and 
Columbia's top two executives have said they'll leave. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks of negotiations apparently reached an impasse earlier this week 
after Sony declared it would buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 
million -- regardless of whether Warner released the two principals from their 
five-year deal with Warner. According to one industry source, Sony's stance 
hardened under the fiery leadership of Walter Yetnikoff, the CBS Records 
president who will oversee Sony's businesses in recorded music and movie 
companies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Guber and Peters, in their 26-page complaint, claim that Warner has falsely 
asserted that they have an exclusive deal with Warner that prevents them from 
accepting senior management positions at Columbia. The two men contend that 
high-ranking Warner officials, including Time Warner Co-Chairman Steven J. Ross 
and Warner Bros. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert A. Daly, "previously 
acknowledged several times" that the two producers would be free to pursue 
executive opportunities at other studios. 
</P>
<P>
But Warner has a much different view. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most flagrant case of inducement to breach a contract in corporate 
history," declared Daly, the Warner studio chief, in a telephone interview. 
"Guber and Peters did not have the right to terminate their contract with 
Warner Bros.; this was recognized by Sony when it originally required Guber and 
Peters to obtain a release from their exclusive contract with Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
"Sony then dropped this requirement and indemnified Guber and Peters against 
damages because of their breach of the Warner Bros. contract," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
Warner's 17-page complaint essentially accuses Sony and the Guber-Peters 
defendants of "secrecy, treachery and fraud." 
</P>
<P>
In his icy prepared statement, Time Warner's Ross said: "We regret that Sony 
has attempted to enter the U.S. motion picture industry by illegally and 
willfully raiding key talent under exclusive contract to a competitor. This 
conduct cannot, must not and will not be condoned." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Farrow, Sony U.S.A.'s senior vice president of corporate communications, 
said, "As a company policy, we don't make any comment on matters under 
litigation." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Guber-Peters said the company had no comment.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: BUYING LIFE INSURANCE RIGHT FROM THE SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's face it, buying life insurance can be a drag. Most consumers assume they 
must buy it through an insurance agent -- and prefer to do so anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are willing to bear the extra burden of shopping for yourself and 
buying directly from an insurance company, you could save big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
A small but growing number of insurance companies are offering so-called 
"low-load" insurance policies that carry lower sales commissions than policies 
bought through agents -- if you buy the policies directly from the companies. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of direct marketing has also reached auto and homeowners' 
insurance. Firms such as 20th Century, which bypass sales forces and sell 
directly to the public, have saved consumers hundreds of dollars through 
reduced commission fees. Buying a no-load or low-load mutual fund can also save 
you hundreds of dollars in commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Similar savings can be had in life insurance, particularly if you are buying 
universal life, whole life or another type of cash-value policy that has a 
savings component as well as a death benefit. Those are the types of policies 
on which sales commissions are the greatest. 
</P>
<P>
With low-load policies, you will usually save in the form of a lower surrender 
charge -- the part of your premium that you forfeit if you cancel the policy. 
With agent-sold policies, you'll usually forfeit most or all of your premium if 
you cancel in the first one or two years. But with a low-load policy, you'll 
likely get most or all of your premium back, says James H. Hunt, a director of 
the National Insurance Consumer Organization. 
</P>
<P>
For example, for a policy where you pay a $2,000 annual premium (not unusual 
for someone age 45 on a policy with a $100,000 death benefit), you may get as 
much as $1,800 back on a low-load policy that you cancel within the first year, 
Hunt says. But if you cancel an agent-sold policy, you may get little or 
nothing back, he says. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the cost of changing your mind is much lower with a low-load policy. 
</P>
<P>
Further, a low-load annuity -- an investment contract that allows you to 
receive future payments, presumably after you retire -- might give you a better 
investment performance in the form of a higher interest rate because fees will 
be lower. 
</P>
<P>
Low-load annuities can earn as much as 75 basis points more in a year (100 
basis points equals 1 percentage point) than standard plans, says Glenn Daily, 
an independent insurance consultant in New York and author of an upcoming book, 
"The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Insurance Products." 
</P>
<P>
So, even if you eventually go through an agent, at least inquiring about 
low-load policies can be helpful. "It will give you some starting point, some 
basis for comparison," Daily says. 
</P>
<P>
But beware: Low-loads have potential drawbacks, too. 
</P>
<P>
For one, not all low-load products perform better or are less expensive than 
conventional policies. In the case of term insurance -- the type that offers a 
death benefit only, with no investment or cash-value component -- the savings 
can be negligible. You may be able to find agent-sold policies that are 
cheaper, Daily says. 
</P>
<P>
Some low-load policies also are available only through financial planners. The 
policy may be less expensive, but you may have to pay a big fee to the planner. 
</P>
<P>
Also, remember that buying on your own means you must do research yourself. You 
won't have an agent do a lot of the shopping, product comparison and 
hand-holding for you. 
</P>
<P>
And you will have fewer choices. Daily says he has identified only eight 
companies that offer low-load plans, far fewer than the several hundred 
offering full-commission policies. 
</P>
<P>
Having considered these drawbacks, where can you go for a low-load plan? 
</P>
<P>
For cash-value life insurance, analyst Hunt recommends USAA, at (800) 531-8000, 
and Ameritas, (800) 255-9678. Other firms offering low-load, cash-value 
policies include: American Life of New York, (212) 581-1200; Colonial Penn, 
(215) 988-8000; Essex (201) 325-3655; John Alden through Fee for Service, (813) 
874-5662, and Lincoln Benefit, (800) 525-9287. 
</P>
<P>
For annuities, Hunt suggests starting with USAA. This company has shown some of 
the highest and most consistent investment returns on its annuities, Hunt says. 
</P>
<P>
Other firms also offering low-load annuities, Daily says, are Essex, John Alden 
and Lincoln Benefit. 
</P>
<P>
For term insurance, try American Life, Lincoln Benefit or USAA. The latter 
tends to offer the best rates of the three, although generally for younger 
customers, Hunt says. 
</P>
<P>
When shopping for these, specify that you are interested in their low-load 
products, because some also sell full-commission plans as well. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Hillebrand, an attorney in the San Francisco office of Consumers Union, 
publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, suggests asking several questions: Is 
there a load? What are the surrender charges? If I only keep the policy for one 
or two years, how much of the premium will I get back? This is especially 
important if you are looking for whole or universal life policies, because 
commission fees can be so huge in the early years, she notes. 
</P>
<P>
If you need more help, consider the booklet "How to Save Money on Life 
Insurance" ($11.95; National Insurance Consumer Organization, 121 N. Payne St., 
Alexandria, Va., 22314.)

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW THE IRS TREATS SALE OF SECOND HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: How does the Internal Revenue Service treat the capital gain or loss 
on a second home? I have a second home that I plan to sell. May I purchase 
another house as my second home and apply the gain from the sale to it to defer 
taxation on the gain? -- N. R. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No. The sale of a second home is not treated the same as the sale of a 
primary residence, and you may not simply defer taxation on your gain by 
purchasing another vacation house of equal or greater value. However, if your 
second home is a piece of investment property that generates rental income or 
is specifically held to realize appreciation, it can -- and this is an 
all-important word -- qualify for a tax-deferred exchange upon sale. 
</P>
<P>
When is a second house an investment and not a vacation retreat? Well, if you 
bought the property solely with the intent of letting it appreciate in value 
and used it sparingly as a vacation retreat, your claim would probably 
withstand scrutiny from the IRS, our experts say. The IRS requires that 
personal use be no more than 14 days a year, or 10% of the time if the house is 
rented. So, if you don't rent the second home at all, you may use it up to 14 
days annually and retain its investment property status. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you have deducted mortgage interest on your second home as 
"personal mortgage interest," as is allowed by law, you have little chance of 
passing it off as an investment. (But if you deducted mortgage interest 
payments as investment interest to the extent allowed, your claim that the 
property is an investment would be strengthened.) 
</P>
<P>
The law outlining the requirements for tax-deferred exchanges of investment 
property is contained in Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is 
why these transactions are sometimes referred to as "1031 exchanges." Under 
current law, a seller has 45 days after closing on the sale of his initial 
property to identify the real estate he wishes to acquire through a 
tax-deferred exchange. He must complete the acquisition of that property within 
180 days of the closing of the first sale. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the strict regulations surrounding tax-deferred exchanges, you 
should get help from a qualified third-party "accommodator" before attempting 
one of these transactions. Your real estate broker, escrow officer or family 
attorney should be able to steer you to an independent professional who has 
been trained to act as an accommodator. For additional information, see 
Internal Revenue Service publications No. 17, "Your Federal Income Tax," or No. 
544, "Sales and Other Dispositions of Property." 
</P>
<P>
One additional note: Current law permits tax-deferred exchanges among a broad 
variety of investment properties. For example, you may now exchange an 
apartment house for a shopping center, or a piece of vacant land for an office 
building. However, a bill pending in Congress would limit exchanges to 
properties of similar use: office building for office building or shopping 
center for shopping center, for example. Under current versions of this 
proposed legislation, the restriction would be retroactive to July 11, 1989. 
But there is no reason to panic. These provisions are included in the same 
legislation with the proposed new capital gains tax, and, as you well know, the 
outcome of that bill is still very much uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income Averaging and Pension Money 
</P>
<P>
Q: In February, 1986, I quit my job and took a lump sum distribution of my 
pension account. At that time, I rolled it over into a four-year individual 
retirement account. This account is now about to mature and I would like to 
take the principal, which was the lump sum pension distribution, and treat it 
to 10-year averaging on my income taxes. I know I meet the age qualification to 
take advantage of the averaging, so may I do it? -- P. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: It depends. By depositing your pension distribution in an IRA account, you 
basically lost your right to take advantage of the 10-year income averaging 
allowed pension distributions. However, our experts say there may be a way 
around your problem. 
</P>
<P>
First, we have to find out if your IRA is "pure" -- that is, it doesn't contain 
any funds other than your pension distribution and the interest earned on that 
amount. If it is pure, then you could roll the account back into a qualified 
pension plan, take a distribution from it and then take advantage of the 
10-year income averaging. 
</P>
<P>
If you are still employed, find out if you can make a contribution to your 
personal account in the pension fund your company operates. Or, if you want, 
you could start a consulting business, open a Keogh account and transfer your 
pension funds into it. The bottom line is that your funds must be withdrawn 
from a qualified pension plan in order to take advantage of the income 
averaging. 
</P>
<P>
There is one caveat, however: You may be required to keep your funds in the 
second pension or Keogh account for five years to qualify for the income 
averaging. Consult your accountant for advice, because there has been no 
official ruling from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax-Free Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Q: I purchased three California municipal bonds earlier this year and paid 
"accrued interest" of $325 to the seller. Is this interest deductible as an 
interest expense on my income taxes? And, if so, what section of the form do I 
use? I normally use the standard deduction method of filing my taxes. -- R. W. 
E. 
</P>
<P>
A: Although accrued interest payments made in conjunction with bond purchases 
are usually deductible, your $325 payment is not. Why? Because you purchased 
municipal bonds whose interest is tax free to you. So, in instances where your 
interest income is tax free, any interest payments are not tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
However, in cases where the bond interest is taxable, you would simply deduct 
the accrued interest you paid when you purchased the bond from any interest you 
receive during the year, and enter that "net" figure on Schedule B of your tax 
return as your bond interest income for the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Converted AT&amp;T Stock 
</P>
<P>
Q: We owned shares in American Telephone &amp; Telegraph at the time of the 
breakup in 1984 and were given shares in the regional telephone operating 
companies in exchange for our AT&amp;T stock. The stock of some of these "baby 
bells" has since split a few times, and we do not know how to figure our gain 
of the shares if we should ever decide to sell them. Can you please help us? -- 
A. J. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your situation is a common one and the IRS has issued guidelines on how to 
handle it. The guidelines, as well as a worksheet on how to figure your gain, 
are contained in IRS notice No. 86-8, which should be available from your local 
IRS office.

FOREST OFFICIALS SEEK MANAGER FOR GUN RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angeles National Forest officials, concerned about safety among firearms 
enthusiasts, were in the process of selecting someone to supervise a shooting 
range this week when a double slaying was discovered there, bringing to four 
the number of killings at the untended range over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been concerned about safety out there," said Christine Rose, district 
ranger for the forest's Tujunga District, which includes the so-called Middle 
Shooting Area in Upper Big Tujunga Canyon, west of Angeles Forest Highway. 
"We're looking forward to having someone there to manage the range within the 
next six months." 
</P>
<P>
An off-duty Los Angeles police officer who went to the shooting range for 
target practice Wednesday evening discovered the bodies of Clayton Blasingame, 
29, of El Monte and Ernesto Banegas Jr., 30, of Arcadia, authorities said. 
Blasingame died of multiple gunshot wounds; Banegas was hit once in the upper 
torso. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deartment homicide detectives said Blasingame and 
Banegas probably died between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Wednesday. Two semiautomatic 
rifles and an antique flintlock rifle, registered to the victims, were found 
near the bodies, said homicide bureau chief Lt. Gil Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
The two men frequently traveled to the shooting range for target practice, said 
Blasingame's mother, Marjorie. Blasingame owned Clayton's Carpet Cleaning and 
also ran a home maintenance business with Banegas, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were two good friends," she added. "It wasn't between the two boys. 
Police have ruled that out. There was no quarrel between them." 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not know of any enemies of either man. "It had to be 
intentional. I don't know if it was a drive-by," she said. "I think they were 
just in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 shooting areas in the national forest have been the subject of 
controversy for years. Forest officials say they are caught between the demands 
of shooting groups and environmentalists. Marksmen want a place to shoot at 
targets of their own making away from restricted ranges. But critics have said 
the areas can pose hazards both for shooters and for other forest visitors. 
They also have noted that fires have been a problem in the shooting areas. 
</P>
<P>
Recreational shooting has ranked with hiking and camping among the most popular 
forest activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle Shooting Area is in a steep, narrow ravine strewn with bullet 
fragments and shell casings. Hundreds of people crowd the place on weekends. 
The rules are simple: No alcoholic beverages. Targets must be biodegradable. 
Weapons must be legal. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers come through on patrol to check that regulations are being followed, 
but no one is on the site full time. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed by stray bullets there in separate incidents in 1987, 
Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a manager was appointed to run a shooting concession in the forest's 
Saugus District, said Larry Marlow, acting recreation officer. The manager 
charges a $6 admission fee, keeps set hours and "organizes what's going on 
there a little bit," Marlow said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK TRIAL OF JUANITA ST. 
JOHN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Friday denied the latest attempt by 
lawyers for Juanita St. John to head off a trial of the embattled head of a 
city-funded Africa trade task force. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald Swearinger denied an appeal by St. John that sought to throw out 
an earlier court ruling that St. John stand trial on a misdemeanor charge of 
violating a city subpoena. The subpoena seeks records and information on how 
St. John spent $180,000 in city funds. A pretrial hearing has been set for Oct. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the alleged subpoena violation, St. John, a business associate 
of Mayor Tom Bradley, and the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, 
which is run by St. John, are under investigation by Los Angeles police and the 
district attorney's major fraud unit. Investigators are trying to determine if 
city funds were misused. 
</P>
<P>
St. John and her attorneys have said the funds were spent properly.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ENROLLMENT SPURT PUSHES SCHOOL TOTAL TO 
610,149 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confirming predictions of a major growth spurt, Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials said 15,347 new students enrolled this fall, bringing the 
total enrollment to 610,149. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Jones, the district's budget services administrator, said the new figures 
suggest that "the grace period of slow enrollment has ended, and that we can 
expect significant growth throughout the district in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
Jones also said that the big enrollment jump meant more problems for the 
district in finding adequate classroom space. On Monday, the Board of Education 
is scheduled to begin discussing solutions to the overcrowding problem at a 
special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment districtwide had dropped during the previous two years. But this 
year it grew in all areas of the Los Angeles school district, the nation's 
second largest. New York City has the largest district. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the greatest growth occurred in schools on the Westside and in 
the San Fernando Valley, in part because of increased busing from overcrowded 
downtown and southeast region schools.

DETECTIVE'S GRAB PREVENTS FREEWAY SUICIDE OF GIRL, 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police detective saved the life of a suicidal 17-year-old girl by grabbing 
her arm as she stepped off a 40-foot-high freeway overpass in Burbank, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lucky grab," said Rich Bison, a 17-year veteran of the Burbank Police 
Department. Bison said the girl dangled from his hands for several seconds 
before his partner, Detective Eric Rosoff, and California Highway Patrol 
Officer Mike Clarke grabbed her right arm and pulled her to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Bison said he had been trying to talk the girl out of jumping for about 40 
minutes when she suddenly pushed away from the railing, looking downward. "It 
was obvious in her face she was at that point where she was going to let go," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Highway Patrol officers closed the Ventura Freeway in both directions about 
10:50 a.m., just after the girl was first seen on the edge of the Olive Avenue 
overpass. The incident caused a massive traffic tie-up in both directions, said 
Highway Patrol spokeswoman Linda Powell. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, a Burbank resident who attends Monterey Continuation School in 
that city, was not injured. She was taken to Olive View Medical Center for 
psychiatric evaluation, Bison said. She told police she was despondent after 
breaking up with her boyfriend, who had begun dating another girl. 
</P>
<P>
The drama began after the girl and her ex-boyfriend, who lives in Sun Valley, 
began arguing about his new girlfriend while they walked near the freeway, 
Burbank Sgt. Don Goldberg said. Distraught, the girl fled from her boyfriend, 
who belittled her threats of suicide, and climbed over a 3 1/2-foot railing, 
Goldberg said.

<P>
DISCRIMINATION: COUNCILMAN WOO CALLS THE PRACTICE 'RELIGIOUS RED-LINING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH and JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Nancy Wilson, pastor of the homosexual-oriented Metropolitan Community 
Church of Los Angeles, appeared at a City Hall press conference Friday to press 
her protest against banks and other financial institutions for what she called 
discriminatory lending policies toward churches. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson -- now in the 25th day of a fast to draw attention to her protest -- was 
accompanied by other clergy and Councilman Michael Woo, who called the practice 
"religious red-lining." She complained her church has been denied $600,000 in 
loans by 20 different lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said the Metropolitan Community Church has "outstanding references and an 
excellent credit rating. (But it) has two strikes against it, both being a 
church and being a gay and lesbian church. It's clear that this is a case of 
arbitrary discrimination that should not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Woo said, Wilson's church was turned down by the Anaheim-based 
Evangelical Christian Credit Union on "moral grounds" because the parishioners 
are largely gay and lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Holbrook, the credit union president, said by telephone that the church 
had inquired, through a second party, about joining the credit union. Holbrook 
said the representative was told that "they would not qualify because their 
doctrinal beliefs are fundamentally different from ours. We are chartered to 
serve a fairly narrowly defined group of churches." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's congregation bought its present Culver City site in 1987 for $1.25 
million with a $600,000 down payment, but Richard Davis, the church's 
treasurer, said the mortgage ultimately had to be refinanced under unfavorable 
terms. The church, once located in downtown Los Angeles, is the "mother church" 
of more than 250 similar congregations in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said lending institutions are generally reluctant to lend to churches 
because they fear bad press if they have to foreclose on the loans. He called 
for an investigation by the state superintendent of banks and the state savings 
and loan commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
A Bank of America corporate spokesman said Friday, however, that his bank does 
not discriminate against churches. "Our decision on loans to individuals or 
organizations are based on risk and the willingness and ability of a borrower 
to repay the loan," said spokesman Ron Owens. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference were the Rev. Thomas Griffith of the Crescent 
Heights United Methodist Church of West Los Angeles, the Rev. Carl Bean of the 
Unity Fellowship Church and Rabbi Janet Marder of Reform Judaism's Union of 
American Hebrew Congregations. 
</P>

"Getting a loan for a church is indeed difficult under the best of 
circumstances," Griffith said. "Many lenders are quite willing to make a loan 
if a church can put up collateral in the entire amount of the loan. If 
(lenders) can possibly get out of it, it won't happen."

71 YEARS AFTER BEING WOUNDED, WWI VETERAN GETS SOME GLORY

A quiet man, 94-year-old Bill Martin rarely talked about the four days he spent 
during World War I in the Battle of the Argonne Forest, when shrapnel from an 
exploding artillery shell tore off his left heel and left him disabled for the 
next 71 years. 
</P>
<P>
Martin never received the Purple Heart to which he was entitled for injury in 
battle, or a ribbon for the Army campaign. And he never joined a veteran's 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, the former North Dakota farm boy raised his right hand and in a 
tremulous voice pledged loyalty to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Post No. 
10560. 
</P>
<P>
While a dozen post members gathered around him -- veterans of World War II and 
the Korean and Vietnam conflicts -- Martin received belated recognition as one 
of the nation's few remaining World War I military survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 4.7 million American soldiers mustered into action in the 
"Great War," only 111,000 were still alive earlier this year, according to 
statistics from the Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's ceremony for Martin was conducted in front of a veterans memorial 
plaque on a busy Altadena street corner where cars gunning their engines and 
trucks rumbling by at times drowned out Martin's words. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, I always wanted to be in the Army," Martin recalled after 
the ceremony. "They used to show how they rode on the horses in the (movie) 
shows." 
</P>
<P>
But the cavalry was not for Martin. Instead, when he was called to duty at age 
23 in April, 1918, he joined the 137th Infantry. 
</P>
<P>
After only a month of training at Camp Dodge, Iowa, Martin was shipped out of 
Hoboken, N.J., on a cattle ship bound for England. 
</P>
<P>
A farmer's son used to aiming his shotgun only at pheasants, Martin was 
carrying a military rifle into battle. But he was not worried, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was just my duty to fight for the best country in the world," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By September, he found himself in the trenches of the Argonne Forest, the scene 
of a major U.S. offensive that began Sept. 26 and eventually involved 1.2 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed for further recollections Friday, Martin suddenly stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I better quit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An acquaintance, Duane Merrill, filled in the rest of Martin's story. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 29, 1918, Martin volunteered with three other soldiers to search for 
battle survivors. While returning with a wounded soldier that the three others 
were carrying on a makeshift stretcher, Martin was hit by an exploding shell 
and fell wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Details on what happened next are fuzzy, but Merrill said Martin remained on 
the ground for 26 hours until he was discovered by two Americans laying barbed 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was hospitalized for nearly two years before he was discharged in June, 
1920, his left heel encased in a brace. He went on to work for 41 years as a 
hospital orderly in Bismarck, N.D. Four years after the death of his wife in 
1977, he moved to Altadena to live with his son. But he kept his war tale to 
himself as he puttered in his garden, an elderly man on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
Not until members of the Altadena VFW Post, newly created in June, began to 
look for veterans did Martin and his story become known through his friend 
Merrill, who told members of the chapter about the reclusive veteran. 
</P>
<P>
And despite almost 70 years of modesty, Martin may still get the medals he 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody had ever talked to him about joining a veteran's organization, and he 
never was issued his Purple Heart," said post Cmdr. Joe Seif. "So, we're going 
to apply (for one) for him, and a campaign ribbon, too."

A SCARY BOX OFFICE PUTS FEAR INTO 'HALLOWEEN 5' PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moustapha Akkad, producer of "Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers," is 
accustomed to instilling fear into his audiences. Now, his audience is 
frightening him. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween 5" opened Friday, just a couple months after two other horror 
sequels, New Line's "Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child" and 
Paramount's "Friday the 13th Part VIII -- Jason Takes Manhattan," opened to 
disappointing ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this nervousness," says Akkad. The producer is crossing his fingers 
that the reason for these results is not audience boredom with the genre. Maybe 
it was the quality of the films, he says, or the fact that both opened during 
one of the most competitive summers in recent movie history. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it's one of these reasons," says Akkad. He'll find out in the coming 
weeks, as the box-office results for "Halloween 5" roll in. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-born Akkad is on his own with "Halloween 5": He doesn't have a big 
studio, like Paramount, or even a major independent movie company, like New 
Line, behind him. Two years ago, Akkad bought the rights to the film from his 
original partners -- including the first film's director, John Carpenter; its 
co-writer, Debra Hill; and its executive producer, Irwin Yablans. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the partners were squabbling about the future of the "Halloween" 
series, in part because of the disappointing box-office take of "Halloween 3," 
which adopted a completely different story line than its predecessors. 
According to Entertainment Data Inc., "Halloween 3" sold $14.4 million worth of 
tickets in 1982, while "Halloween 2" had taken in $25.5 million at U.S. 
theaters the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"After 'Halloween 3,' we couldn't agree on how to proceed," says Yablans. "We 
had become rich and comfortable, and suddenly everyone was an artist." 
</P>
<P>
The rights to "Halloween" went on the auction block, but no major studio bid, 
not even Universal, which had distributed the second and third installments. 
Akkad came in and topped bids by several independent companies. 
</P>
<P>
"For four years, we didn't do any 'Halloweens,' " says Akkad. "But I believed 
in it. It's not a genius creation or anything. But whenever Halloween season 
comes around, audiences want something like this." 
</P>
<P>
The first "Halloween," and the only one directed by Carpenter, was one of the 
most financially successful independent movies ever made. The production budget 
was only $300,000 and it grossed about $47 million at American theaters alone. 
</P>
<P>
The villain of "Halloween" is Michael Myers, who as an 8-year-old murdered his 
sister after catching her in bed with her boyfriend. Much of the first 
"Halloween" takes place 15 years later, after Myers has grown into a murderous 
figure known as the Shape. The film starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a virginal high 
school girl that Myers pursues, and Donald Pleasence as Myers' psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
The first "Halloween" was so popular that it spawned competitors, two of which 
have consistently drawn larger audiences. New Line's "A Nightmare on Elm 
Street" series, with the increasingly famous Freddy Krueger as its central 
villain, began in 1984 to ticket sales of $25.5 million, according to 
Entertainment Data. Its audience peaked in 1988, when the fourth installment 
grossed $49.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's "A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child" grossed $21.6 
million, which -- because of the low cost of production -- is disappointing 
only when compared to the previous installments. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been scratching our heads (about the ticket sales)," says Mitch Goldman, 
president of New Line's distribution arm, "and the bottom line is: We think 
that it may have been released too soon after the last one. I don't think it 
was the picture, the concept, or the advertising." New Line is already moving 
ahead on the next installment of "Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's "Friday the 13th" series opened in 1980 to ticket sales of nearly 
$40 million, according to Entertainment Data. The eighth sequel, which also 
opened last summer, grossed only $14.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount executives could not be reached for comment about the film's 
box-office results. A studio spokeswoman said no decision had been made about 
whether Paramount will produce another "Friday the 13th." 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters for "Halloween" is Akkad's tiny company, Trancas 
International, run out of a suite of offices on Sunset Boulevard. The budget 
for the film has grown to $5.5 million, still less than a third what the 
average Hollywood movie costs. "Halloween 5" is directed by a film maker from 
Switzerland, Dominique Othenin-Girard, and stars Pleasence and Danielle Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Akkad came to the United States in 1954 at 19, graduating from the theater arts 
program at UCLA and earning a masters degree from USC. Since then he has 
directed, as well as financed, films. Among his credits is the 1981 "Lion of 
the Desert," starring Anthony Quinn and Oliver Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween gives me the financial independence" to make and direct big-budget 
epics, says Akkad.

WILL SAJAK PLEASE MORE OF THE PEOPLE LESS OF THE TIME? 
</P>

On the heels of taking legal action to shorten his name, Patrick Leonard Sajdak 
had his low-rated TV program shortened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Oct. 30, CBS said, "The Pat Sajak Show" will be cut back from 90 
minutes to one hour, airing 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated action, the host of "Wheel of Fortune" also petitioned Los 
Angeles Superior Court this week to drop the d from the name with which he was 
born, explaining in his legal papers that Sajak is the name he has always used 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Though a spokeswoman for CBS late-night programming chief Rod Perth said he was 
"in meetings behind closed doors" and unreachable Friday, a prepared statement 
he released clearly indicated that he hoped a shorter program hosted by the man 
with the shorter name would result in larger ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to shorten 'The Pat Sajak Show' to strengthen the format and 
tighten the flow," Perth said. Like producers for Sajak's chief rival, "The 
Tonight Show's" Johnny Carson, and for Arsenio Hall, Perth said CBS had learned 
after nine months of 90-minute Sajak shows that the hourlong format in a 
late-night time slot is "much more conducive to a livelier, faster-paced 
broadcast. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Since its debut last January, Sajak's show has consistently run well behind NBC 
and ABC in its time period, averaging a 3.1 rating to NBC's 4.8 and ABC's 4.7. 
The show has not even been doing that well recently, averaging a 2.7 rating 
since Sept. 18 and a 2.5 for the week of Oct. 2-6. One rating point is equal to 
921,000 homes, according to Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
At this point last year, CBS' roster of old dramatic series and movies in its 
late-night slot was pulling a 3.3 rating, compared to 5.2 for NBC and 5 for 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The action shows and movies that CBS has been airing when "Sajak" ended at 1 
a.m. will begin at 12:30 a.m. when the show is shortened.

LAMA'S 'PILGRIMAGE FOR ACTIVE PEACE.'

Witness the Buddhist blessing of the mountain: monks chanting, shrill Tibetan 
horns splitting the quiet morning with peals of goose-like blats and green 
juniper branches burning with a sweet, white pungent smoke that dissolves into 
the blue skies above San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It was a perfect setting for mantra to meet media, bodhisattva to meet show biz 
and the Dalai Lama to meet the movie actor. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gere, the Buddhist, sat quietly in his three-piece suit, as gray and 
inconspicuous as his perfectly coiffed hair. He went unrecognized by the dozens 
of reporters on hand for the Dalai Lama's first Lhasang, or mountain blessing, 
since the Tibetan god/king won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
While reporters raced up and down the aisles, straining for celebrities to 
interview, the celebrated star of "An Officer and a Gentleman," "American 
Gigolo" and a half-dozen other movies that touched on the rough-hewn 
situational ethics that characterized much of the 1980s, shut his eyes behind a 
pair of eyeglasses. Gere's personal publicist and several other members of his 
entourage sat alongside him, where he was joined by an invited Times reporter 
-- ninth row back behind the press corps and 10 yards from the stage where the 
hourlong tea-and-meditation ceremony took place. 
</P>
<P>
But nary a microphone was stuck in his face. Gere didn't mind. He didn't come 
seeking exposure. His hands were clasped together in prayer throughout most of 
the ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The media did find beat poet Allen Ginsberg ("That's A-L-L-E-N and 'berg' with 
an 'e,' not a 'u,' " Ginsberg told a pair of reporters) and LSD guru Richard 
(Baba Ram Dass) Alpert ("Dass is spelled with two 's'es," Alpert explained to a 
photographer scribbling down his name). 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the glasses or the stockbroker's suit or the premature silver in 
his naturally curly locks. But, for some reason, one of the Dalai Lama's 
biggest and best-known fans went undetected by the roving TV crews who wanted 
to know how the Nobel laureate beat out the other Nobel nominees, where he was 
going next on his whirlwind, worldwide "Pilgrimage for Active Peace" and what 
he was going to buy with his $469,000 in Peace Prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Gere listened with quiet tolerance. To him, the 54-year-old Dalai Lama is 
addressed only as "His Holiness" and such questions completely missed the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
But Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama in a line dating back six centuries, 
seemed mildly bemused by it all. He giggled as he answered the press, speaking 
of love and compassion and something Gere knows about firsthand: promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"How to promote love and compassion is the thing," the exiled god/king of Tibet 
told the curious army of journalists. "Education, this is the thing. I have no 
such qualifications (to be such an educator/promoter). I am a simple Buddhist 
monk." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the little man in saffron and maroon robes was simple. Perhaps he was 
unacquainted with the ways of promotion and publicity. But he took full 
advantage of the hoards of minicams and shotgun microphones aimed at him 
Tuesday during the first U.S. stop in his "Pilgrimage for Active Peace," 
organized by Buddhist leader Tai Situpa XII. (On Sunday, this leg of the Dalai 
Lama's pilgrimage will end with a similar mountaintop ceremony at Mt. Shasta, 
200 miles northeast of San Francisco.) 
</P>
<P>
When a handful of cynics sang "Hello Dalai" to the tune of "Hello, Dolly!" upon 
his arrival by helicopter for the Lhasang ceremony, the pacific grin never left 
the Nobel laureate's face. When an NBC cameraman stepped on the sacrosanct red 
carpet leading from the Dalai Lama's helicopter pad to the Lhasang ceremonial 
site, the Buddhist leader's advance men got much more worked up about the faux 
pas than the god/king himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It is best to be an optimist because, if you are a pessimist, you will only be 
depressed and no one wants this depression," he said in one of many homilies he 
punctuated with the tinkle of his trademark laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Since his elevation by the Nobel Committee and, subsequently, the media, to the 
instant international status of Peace Prize winner, he has become a very 
different kind of god/king. Like it or not, the Dalai Lama is now a media hero. 
And the perennially smiling prelate from Tibet seems to like it. He has lost no 
opportunity during the last week to promote his favorite subject: freeing his 2 
million countrymen from 40 years of Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
And Gere, who normally spurns the press, says that he stands ready to help him 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese have acted like barbarians," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year without a movie in release, Gere is coming out in two 
starring roles this winter: "3000," a Pygmalion-type tale directed by Garry 
("Happy Days") Marshall for Touchstone, and "Internal Affairs," a cop drama for 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
But he really doesn't care to talk about either one very much. That's something 
he does for money and career and the Hollywood machine with which he made a 
Faustian deal more than a decade ago. A man who rarely does interviews, Gere 
cringes at the thought of making the talk show rounds or submitting himself to 
gossip columnists. It isn't that he doesn't know how to promote his films. In 
an odd show-biz paradox that smacks of Zen, his well-known refusal to publicize 
often creates its own publicity. On the way to not talking about this movie or 
that movie, he talks instead about promoting something he considers more 
worthwhile, like the religious philosophy of the Dalai Lama. The movie winds up 
with a plug, but almost by default. 
</P>
<P>
"One is required to explore everything that is being said as one tests a 
precious metal to find out if it's real," he said, offering a quick course in 
the Eastern religion that he took up 10 years ago, after his first visit to 
Nepal. "There's a very deep and strict philosophical and logical basis to the 
system that this extraordinary man, Gotama Buddha, came up with." 
</P>
<P>
When he agreed to take a break from filming at Disney studios and accompany the 
new Nobel laureate on his pilgrimage, Gere had planned to use his celebrity to 
help the Dalai Lama past the worst of the predatory press. It would not have 
been the first time the actor has sought out "quality" publicity for his 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
He is an outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy in Central America and an 
active environmentalist. His chief cause remains the freeing of Tibet, however. 
Two years ago, he helped establish Tibet House in New York -- a museum and 
research facility dedicated to promoting Tibetan culture sanctioned by the 
Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
But the "simple Buddhist monk," as the Tibetan leader calls himself, seems to 
have learned the lessons of promotion in Western culture as well as Gere. If 
the Dalai Lama is unsophisticated, it is the simpleness of the late Sen. Sam 
Ervin, who liked to characterize himself as a "simple country lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
After the Lhamansa ceremony atop Mt. Tamalpais, Gere joined the Dalai Lama in 
one of the helicopters heading for the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill, 30 miles to 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dalai Lama delivered a noontime speech at the hotel, Gere agreed to 
emerge from anonymity and do what he rarely does: join in a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before the Dalai Lama hammed it up a bit for the Western press. He 
flew in helicopters. He laughed his disarming, infectious laugh. He donned a 
tennis hat to keep the sun off his shaven skull and waved happily to the 
predatory press. 
</P>
<P>
"Gee, he's cute!" remarked one veteran photographer. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Dalai Lama chuckled, finessed and breezed his way through the press 
conference without inviting Gere to the dais, the Dalai Lama's own public 
relations firm, Daniel J. Edelman Inc., thought there might be some hurt 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, Richard, I hope you don't mind not being up there," said Edelman account 
supervisor Mara Brazer. "We were going to bring you up but he just. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Gere bowed slightly and waved off the rest of her sentence with his hand. He 
smiled as enigmatically, if not as broadly, as the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right," he said. "I am here to serve."

HITTING THE DESERT TRAIL; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: DESERT OUTINGS ALLOW WOULD-BE COWBOYS AND COWGIRLS TO EXPERIENCE 
THE WILDERNESS, AND GIVE TRAIL-RIDING CLUBS A CHANCE TO RAISE FUNDS.

It's 6:15 on a chilly morning in the desert. The smell of coffee brewing and 
sausage cooking on an open grill wafts through the camp as the horses chomp on 
a breakfast of hay and grain. The rising sun exaggerates the desert's colorful 
face, turning rocks red and the hills orange, creating a multitoned earth. 
</P>
<P>
Yup, this is the life: snake holes, pricker bushes and the smell of fly spray. 
Camp Med for the Wild Bills and Calamity Janes at heart. And you don't have to 
be familiar with the desert or the mountains to experience it. That's what 
trail guides and trail riding clubs are for. 
</P>
<P>
This particularly isolated campsite belongs to the Happy Hoofers. The Blythe, 
Calif.-based equestrian group sponsors a three-day trail ride each year to 
raise funds for its rodeo performances. 
</P>
<P>
The campsite is on a private ranch just over the Arizona border in the high 
desert. Though the ranch is only about 240 acres, the surrounding government 
land -- taking in the Bill Williams River and Buckskin Mountains -- is 
accessible to horses and riders and offers seemingly infinite views of red-rock 
mountains and wide-open desert. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see things you can't see from a car," trail guide Ralph Goleman says. 
"There's no civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Goleman and his wife, Billie, of Blythe were hired to lead one ride each day 
for the Hoofers. Their group takes a four-hour excursion across the Bill 
Williams River (in an area where water is scarce and neighboring towns have 
long battled for the rights to the river) up into the Buckskin Mountains, where 
mountain lions and bobcats share the wilderness with the monarch butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The rules of the trail are simple: Stay behind the trail boss; faster horses to 
the front, and no running (the terrain is the challenge, not the speed). 
</P>
<P>
It's important because of the rugged terrain, says Billie Goleman, who rides 
"drag" behind the group, to "make sure you don't get yourself in a position 
where you get hurt or get your horse hurt." 
</P>
<P>
While the riders are a mix of veterans and novices, most of the horses seem to 
take the adventure in stride -- at least until the first obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Just 15 minutes into the ride, the narrow Bill Williams River literally 
separates the true trail horses from nags that are strictly show-ring material. 
After most of the horses stomp ungracefully, though confidently, through the 
shallow water, one horse refuses to take the plunge, reacting as though he's 
been asked to jump Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
After numerous tries and as many suggestions on how to coax the animal, the 
horse is finally led across by a halter, trotting on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Following trails forged by wild burros which make their way from the mountain 
grazing grounds to the river, the riders navigate narrow ledges on the steep 
slopes of the canyons, the ground sometimes crumbling under the horses' hoofs. 
So the guides don't get lost, Goleman says a trail boss "picks certain 
landmarks and keeps them in view so you know where you are." 
</P>
<P>
But on this ride, rarely does there seem to be a "trail" visible. The horses 
trudge along nevertheless, through river beds thick with dust, over the winding 
burro paths through the rocky canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of life along the trail are limited to the inevitable vultures circling, 
though snake holes and feathers and other signs of wildlife are everywhere. The 
only sign of humans, however, is the skeleton of an abandoned mine shaft 
clutching the side of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"You never litter -- whatever you take in, you pack it in the saddlebag and 
bring out," says Ruth Harness, a veteran trail rider. "We all like to see a 
clean desert, so we want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Whether riding in the desert or mountains, it's a challenge -- and a historical 
experience. Riding the trails with nothing more than a horse and the supplies 
that will fit in a saddlebag, riders get a feel for the Wild West that pioneers 
confronted a century or more ago. But part of the thrill of trail riding is 
discovering parts of that era that still exist. 
</P>
<P>
"People who ride trails are out to enjoy the unblemished scenery, the country 
and the companionship of animals," Ralph Goleman says. "It's a challenge to 
find different areas like this to ride." 
</P>
<P>
At the halfway point, the group stops for lunch in a canyon lined by shade 
trees. The canyon floor is covered with rocks which settled as the rushing 
waters disappeared decades ago. The riders tie their mounts to trees, but 
veteran trail horses will stay put with nothing more than a rein secured under 
a rock the size of a basketball. After settling in the shade with their 
lunches, the riders trade stories of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, Bonnie Ghianni of Alpine, a member of San Diego's Las Damas 
riding club, makes a six-hour drive to Wickenburg, Ariz., for the monthly ride 
sponsored by the Phoenix Las Damas. 
</P>
<P>
"I go over on Wednesday, ride Thursday and go home on Friday," she says. "And 
when we're not riding, we shop." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than haul her horse and trailer along for a one-day ride, Ghianni rents 
a horse from a Wickenburg stable. It costs about $35, "and that includes tack 
and bringing the horse out to wherever the ride is." There's no charge for the 
ride itself, just for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Why drive all the way to Wickenburg to ride? 
</P>
<P>
"Just to see everybody," Ghianni says. "After you start going on the weeklong 
rides, you meet so many new friends. . . . It's more than getting out on a 
horse, it's the camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
Harness, 69, has been trail riding for 38 years. A dedicated horsewoman, she is 
also a member of Las Damas and of the Desert Saddle Bags, a women's group in 
Phoenix, and Saddle Mountain Riders, a couples' group she belongs to with her 
husband, Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
What keeps her back in the saddle is her love of the animals and the relaxation 
she finds in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute I load my horse and drive out of the driveway, I forget about 
work," says Harness, who owns a real-estate business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all drawn here by a common bond -- the horse," Harness says. "You have 
this in common with other people and you talk the language. You rarely talk 
business -- you don't even think of business." 
</P>
<P>
Though the rides are relaxing, not all are uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
Harness recalls a run-in with a swarm of wasps. The lead riders had stirred 
them up, she says, and by the time the other riders came through, the wasps 
were out for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"If a horsefly or something gets after the horse, their instinct is to run and 
buck and try to get away -- we had about five of us on bucking horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a phobia about wasps." 
</P>
<P>
By the time lunch ends, the desert sun is beating down. A tan is not an 
objective for trail riders, so veteran riders wear long-sleeved shirts, long 
pants and hats to guard not only against the sun, but also wayward branches and 
nature's pests. 
</P>
<P>
Heading for home, the riders clomp through a dried riverbed, near scattered, 
sun-bleached animal bones and decaying branches and ragged trees -- it's good 
to know the camp is just around the next hill. 
</P>
<P>
But trail rides aren't necessarily all beans, dust and discomfort. In fact, the 
Happy Hoofers serve pancakes, eggs, sausage, hot biscuits and fresh-squeezed 
orange juice for breakfast; for dinner, riders feast on steak and lobster, 
complete with salad bar. (There's more than one use for a horse trough.) 
Certainly not the kind of "vittles" one might expect in a chuck wagon out on 
the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Dehydration isn't a problem either, even as the temperature crawls toward 100 
degrees. A beverage truck parked next to the food tent is the first sign of 
camp on the return trip from the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes lots of preplanning," says Geneil Wilson, head Hoofer. "We brought 
out the equipment (including a custom-built trailer -- two-thirds kitchen, 
one-third shower room), the tent and the port-a-potties a week ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Other Hoofers say Wilson's experience as a campground owner is the reason they 
are well-prepared trail-ride hosts -- although, Wilson chuckles, "I left the 
butter at home once . . . the riders were vicious." 
</P>
<P>
The supplies for the Hoofers' three-day ride include 60 pounds of potatoes, 100 
pounds of steak, 90 pounds of lobster, 140 pounds of turkey (for a 
Thanksgiving-themed dinner) and 20 gallons of milk -- not to mention more than 
12,000 pounds of hay. 
</P>
<P>
Equestrian Trails Inc. has 66 groups, called "corrals," in California. Created 
in 1944, the nonprofit organization says it is "dedicated to the acquisition 
and preservation of trails, good horsemanship and equine legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Corral 22, based in San Fernando Valley, hosts two rides a month -- a day ride 
and a weekend ride. 
</P>
<P>
"There's usually no charge, unless we stay overnight or provide food," says 
Gwen Allen, Corral 22 president. 
</P>
<P>
Destinations range from Griffith Park (where horse and equipment rentals are 
available) to Yosemite National Park. Most riders have their own horses and 
equipment. Coming up in November, Equestrian Trails hosts its annual 
five-and-a-half-day ride through Death Valley. For information, call Allen at 
(818) 367-1401. For information on other corrals, call the ETI office in 
Sylmar, (818) 362-6819. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in ETI is $25 per year, $35 for a family. Most individual rides are 
free (unless catered). The Death Valley ride is $280, but this includes all 
food for riders and their horses, Allen says, in addition to transportation of 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Norco Mounted Posse will lead a weeklong ride (open to the public) across 
the Mojave Desert the first week in April. The group, with assistance from the 
Bureau of Land Management, follows the path of old mail runs. Riders will cover 
20-25 miles a day and camp at historical points along the way. Call trail boss 
Bob Wright at (714) 734-5566. Cost of $275-$300 includes food for rider and 
horse, and transportation of camping gear.

Car Sales Skid: A plunge in General Motors Corp.'s car sales led a 12.6% 
decline in early October auto sales by domestic makers over the same period in 
1988, the companies said. It was the first sales period of the 1990 model year 
and the first in what analysts have said will be a soft three-month period. The 
decline was led by a 24.3% fall in GM's car sales and a 28.7% decline in the 
company's truck sales. Overall, the industry leader's car and truck sales were 
off 25.7% for the period. Ford Motor Co.'s total vehicle sales were down 0.3% 
in early October, and Chrysler Corp.'s were off 2.3%. The eight major companies 
making vehicles in North America said their cars and light trucks sold at an 
average daily rate of 30,734 during the Oct. 1 to 10 period this year, compared 
to 34,867 a year ago.

DOW FALLS 190; DROP IS WORST SINCE '87 CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
STOCK MARKET: THE SELLOFF IS FUELED BY FEARS THAT TAKEOVER FEVER IS COOLING, 
AND THAT RECORD PRICES WILL MODERATE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evoking chilling memories of the stock market crash almost exactly two years 
ago, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 190.58 points on Friday amid fear 
of an end to the takeover fever that had driven stock prices to record heights. 
</P>
<P>
The drop was the largest since the 508-point crash on Oct. 19, 1987. Market 
analysts predicted a further fall, but few committed themselves to predicting a 
full-fledged crash when trading resumes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of panic selling at the end of the trading day was triggered by 
disclosure that the investor group seeking to buy UAL Corp., United Airlines' 
parent company, had failed to get financing for the $6.75-billion buyout. That 
capped weeks of bad news from companies attempting to arrange junk bond and 
other financing for takeovers or restructuring. It fueled fears that many 
possible takeovers that speculators were betting on may not take place. The 
drop, on Friday the 13th, erased $189.5 billion from the value of investors' 
stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Peroni, an analyst at the securities firm Janney Montgomery Scott in 
Philadelphia, said: "There is a fear that some of the bigger deals can't get 
financed, and that sent a ripple effect across a broad range of key stocks, 
many of which had risen sharply on takeover or restructuring speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Peroni described the trading late Friday as "total emotional and psychological 
chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the slide in stock prices came in the last hour of trading. The 
free-fall, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling to 2,569.26, 
was ended only by the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said initial panic selling touched off heavy computerized program 
trading. Program trading, in which market conditions may trigger computerized 
selling of huge volumes of stock, was one factor implicated in the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted frightening parallels between what happened Friday and 
the events that began on a Friday two years ago. A drop of 108.35 points on 
Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, presaged the crash that came the following Monday. This 
time, analysts said there is some risk that investors' fear may coalesce over 
the weekend, and that investors in Japan, most of whom were asleep when the New 
York markets began to slide, will be big sellers on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But traders and analysts said there were major differences both in the stock 
market and the overall economy between today and 1987, including fewer signs 
that stocks are overvalued. While another big plunge is certainly possible, the 
market could also rebound on Monday, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market fall and its related effect on stock futures trading prompted 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to use its new emergency "circuit breakers" 
procedures. Trading in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index futures was 
halted twice by the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Invoking a new emergency procedure designed to control program trading, the New 
York Stock Exchange also halted trading in the stock of Walt Disney Co. Shares 
of six other companies traded on the Big Board were halted under normal 
exchange procedures because of large imbalances between buy and sell orders 
late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, which is the 
subject of a takeover attempt by real estate developer Donald J. Trump. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush declined to comment on the market's fall. But Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady said it should be viewed in the context of the Dow Jones 
average's 591-point rise since the beginning of the year. Brady said in a 
statement that "today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental 
change in the condition of the economy. The economy remains well balanced, and 
the outlook is for continued moderate growth." 
</P>
<P>
The market had reached a record high of 2,791.41 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Broad Street in Manhattan, just outside the New York Stock Exchange, an 
electrician who had been working on the exchange floor Friday installing cables 
said there had been a sudden frenzy of activity on the floor in mid-afternoon. 
"People were going crazy, running back and forth, trying to call people, and 
people weren't picking up the phone," he said. "They were cursing and yelling 
at each other." 
</P>
<P>
The investment community had been heartened following the 1987 crash because no 
recession materialized and the market not only rebounded but, beyond all 
expectations, soared to new heights less than two years later. But the 
surprising setback on Friday, following a week in which stock prices had slowly 
drifted lower, discouraged many of the floor traders and specialists who 
emerged from the Big Board's trading floor at the end of the day on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many seemed dazed and shaken, angrily brushing past the crush of reporters and 
spectators who had gathered outside the exchange. "I don't want to talk about 
it," said one man. Another, asked for his reactions to the day's activities, 
managed to jest: "I'm going into the restaurant business." 
</P>
<P>
But an executive on the trading floor of one of the largest Wall Street firms 
said traders and brokers so far seem to be taking the bad news in stride. 
"People weren't as stunned this time," he said. "'87 was an anchor for this 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Grasso, president of the NYSE, said that the exchange's new 
emergency procedures are in place and that he expects a continued smooth 
functioning of the exchange regardless of the volume of shares traded Monday. 
The new procedures also include a series of temporary halts of all trading on 
the exchange beginning if the market drops 250 points in one day. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Grasso said, "We've done a lot of work getting the 
system ready to handle whatever may happen." He said other improvements include 
better communications with other exchanges. Grasso said the New York exchange 
had made "a sweep" by phone of brokerage firms and found no signs of liquidity 
problems that caused a crisis at many securities firms in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's fall in the Dow index was the second-largest ever in terms of points, 
but only the 12th largest in percentage declines. The drop represented a 6.9% 
fall for the Dow, compared to the 22.6% plunge on Oct. 19, 1987. Friday's 
volume was 251.17 million shares, up considerably from 160.12 million the 
preceding day. The fall in the Dow index was matched by drops in broader 
measures of stock market activity. The NYSE composite index closed at 185.56, 
down 11.42. On the Big Board, 1,597 stocks declined, only 141 issues rose, and 
234 were unchanged. Stocks on the American Stock Exchange and those traded over 
the counter also sharply declined. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market drop also touched off a "flight to quality" as investors 
frantically sought the haven of more secure investments. Prices of U.S. 
Treasury bonds surged. Prices of some bonds ended as much as 2 points higher 
than on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the junk bond market, in a severe decline for weeks, sagged again. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators for the most part adopted a wait-and-see attitude. A 
spokesman for the Federal Reserve in Washington said: "We have nothing to say." 
This contrasts with the Fed's actions immediately after the 1987 crash, when 
the nation's central bank publicly promised to assure liquidity in the 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Securities and Exchange Commission said the agency "is 
monitoring the situation" but would have no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, according to Suresh Birud, chief investment strategist at 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, part of the reason for the market's 
pessimism had to do with recent signs that the U.S. economy may be stronger 
than expected. Retail sales figures were surprisingly strong, and some 
indicators showed the possibility of renewed inflation. "It gave the message 
that the Federal Reserve is not likely to ease interest rates soon." 
</P>
<P>
Experts said several factors distinguish the current situation from two years 
ago. In terms of measures such as the ratio of stock prices to companies' 
earnings, stocks aren't nearly as overvalued as they were in 1987. And Amar 
Bhide, a professor at Harvard Business School who is a speculator in both the 
stock and futures markets, said the level of computer-driven "portfolio 
insurance" has declined substantially since immediately before the 1987 crash. 
Portfolio insurance, which triggers automatic selling when stocks drop a 
certain amount, also received a big part of the blame for the crash two years 
ago.

THE DOW'S BIGGEST LOSSES

The Dow Jones industrial average's percentage fall Friday was the 12th worst

worst days for the average, including the point change.

O.C. ATHLETES' LOVE AFFAIR BECAME A FATAL ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from the warm embrace of his family, Thomas White was alone in the world. 
A standout high school athlete in Europe, where his father was stationed in the 
Army, he was a nobody when the family moved to Orange County in 1986, a young 
man mostly without friends. 
</P>
<P>
Then he met Krisden Yoshiko Tanabe, a statuesque high school basketball star 
from Huntington Beach. The attention White once focused on his jumpshot and 
major-league fastball was turned toward his new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
That love, family members said Friday, eventually became an obsession. When 
Tanabe broke off the relationship a few months ago, the bespectacled 
21-year-old grew so troubled that he committed himself in September to a Long 
Beach psychiatric hospital. He was released earlier this week, and family 
members said he seemed renewed, ready to move on without Krisden. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, just days after his release, White confronted Tanabe in front 
of a friend's Westminster house. He was carrying a shotgun that family members 
say he had just purchased with money borrowed from a friend. Tanabe, 18, was 
shot and killed as she tried to flee, then White turned the gun on himself and 
took his own life, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, friends and family of the young couple are trying to sort out the pieces, 
to put the terrible tragedy into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the last person on Earth I would expect to do this," said Dr. Mark 
Kopit, a veterinarian at Stanton Pet Hospital, where White worked until earlier 
this year. "It must have happened in the heat of the moment. I guess he was 
just very much in love and very hurt. It's a sad thing, very tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe's teammates at Golden West College, where she was about to begin her 
first season of college basketball, talked long and deeply Friday about the 
friend many of them were just beginning to know, agreeing to dedicate their 
season to her. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's mother, Anita Tanabe, knew White like a member of the family. He 
was, she recalls, a good person. There was never any trouble, Krisden was 
always home on time. But he became "obsessed" with her daughter and fell apart 
emotionally when she tried to break off their romance, the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart I forgive him," she said. "I know at the time that Thomas shot my 
daughter that wasn't Thomas. That was someone who was very sick and 
distraught." 
</P>
<P>
White's family, meanwhile, is grappling with grief and dismay. For them, it all 
seems improbable, impossible. How could Thomas, so quiet and friendly, commit 
so violent an act? 
</P>
<P>
"She was like his Madonna. She was everything to him," said Greg White, a 
younger brother. "He was addicted to loving her. It was kind of a fatal 
attraction. . . . We all know someone who would do anything for love. And this 
is an example." 
</P>
<P>
The eldest child of Cherry and Wallace White, Thomas was described as a great 
athlete, a good son and brother. Friends and family say he didn't smoke, he 
didn't abuse alcohol. Though he took care of many of his own bills, he lived at 
the family's comfortable stucco-and-wood house in a sedate corner of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quiet, sincere, serious," recalled Greg White, 19, a college sophomore. 
"If he said he needed to get something done, he'd get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Although only an average student, garnering mostly Cs in class, White was 
A-plus when it came to athletics, his brother said. His stage, however, was not 
the home field of some Orange County sports power, but rather the ball fields 
and basketball courts of West Germany, where his father, an Army major, was 
stationed. 
</P>
<P>
When the family moved to Orange County after White graduated from high school, 
it hardly mattered that the 6-foot, 1-inch, 190-pounder was selected to the 
All-Europe high school squad in baseball, football and basketball, his brother 
said. He was a newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have any friends, he didn't know anyone," Greg White said. 
</P>
<P>
But that void was soon filled. In 1987, Greg and Thomas White went to a 
regional championship basketball game to watch a friend play. White met Tanabe. 
They talked, and later started seeing each other, Greg recalled. Within a month 
or so, they were an inseparable couple. 
</P>
<P>
"That was her first serious boyfriend, and it was his first serious 
girlfriend," the brother said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair spent most of their free moments together. They often played 
basketball together, always on the same team, at some neighborhood courts. 
Tanabe was frequently around the pet hospital, and the couple seemed happy, 
deeply in love, Kopit said. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed interested in pursuing a long-term relationship with her," the 
doctor recalled. "He talked about getting married. He was very dedicated. I 
knew he loved her very much, and cared very much, but he never seemed obsessed. 
Their relationship seemed normal, typical for a couple of that age." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, though Tanabe considered athletic scholarship offers from schools 
including Columbia and Arizona, she ultimately chose to pass them up this year 
because she wasn't ready to leave home. 
</P>
<P>
As graduation neared for Tanabe, however, there were signs of trouble, White's 
brother said. Tanabe told a girlfriend that she wanted to date other people, 
and the girlfriend told Greg White. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe even tried to force a breakup by making White angry, his brother said. 
But the tactic never worked with White. He pursued her despite the coolness. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the couple split up about four months ago, they still saw each other, 
their friendship seemingly surviving the rocks that shattered their romance. 
</P>
<P>
But for White, it wasn't enough. Friends of Krisden's say he continually 
called, asking where Krisden was, what Krisden was doing. The unwanted 
attention bothered Tanabe, they said. 
</P>
<P>
White also began contemplating suicide, his brother said. "At first, I think he 
was saying it to get her back, to get attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, White decided last month to sign himself into Los Altos Hospital 
and Mental Health Center in Long Beach. He stayed nearly a month, his brother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived home at the beginning of the week, White seemed better, the 
brother said. His singular focus on Tanabe had apparently dissipated. Just 
weeks before, White called up a coach at San Jose State and talked about 
playing basketball for the Northern California college, Greg White said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seemed to be OK," the brother said. "We went out and played some 
basketball when he got back. She seemed out of his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, White remained a close family friend with the Tanabes. He was 
planning to move into an apartment with Tanabe's brother in a week, according 
to Anita Tanabe. It was Krisden Tanabe who talked him into getting help. She 
had driven him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept telling her he was going to kill himself. She was quite concerned," 
Tanabe's mother said. "She kept saying, 'I can help him.' " 
</P>
<P>
After he checked himself out of the hospital on Tuesday, White came by to talk 
to Tanabe's mother about his obsession with her daughter. By the end of the 
conversation, White seemed to have accepted a life without Krisden. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, White confronted Tanabe at her friend's house and 
accused her of giving her phone number to another guy, Tanabe's friends said. 
The verbal sparring quickly escalated into a violent slapping and shoving match 
in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Thursday afternoon. White's mother was at home watching the local 
news when word of a murder-suicide in Westminster flashed across the screen. 
She saw her son's car and two bodies draped with yellow covers. She knew, even 
before authorities could come knocking on the door, what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I never pictured something like this happening to this family," said Greg 
White. "It was like the ideal Cosby family. We laughed a lot, we cracked jokes. 
My parents were always very understanding with us." 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen of her Fountain Valley home Friday, Krisden Tanabe's mother 
clutched a pink Kleenex in her hand and seemed to have trouble following what a 
woman from her church was saying. The woman promised to help her get through 
the excruciating arrangements of burying her daughter. Together they would pick 
out nice psalms and music that Krisden would have liked for the funeral Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's hit us yet that we won't be seeing her anymore," Krisden's 
mother said. "She gave me so much joy and so much laughter -- everything a 
mother could want out of a child. She was so full of life. She needs to be 
remembered like that." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Tanabe family started coming home early Friday morning. 
Her sister, Kim, 24, an Air Force navigator, flew in from Washington. Her 
brother, Mike, 19, had come home from college. A funeral Mass is to be 
celebrated Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Saints Simon &amp; Jude Catholic Church in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tamie, 16, the youngest, sat in the middle of the living room and looked 
through her big sister's yearbook and cried. There seemed to be picture after 
picture of Krisden Tanabe, wide-eyed and bubbly, a popular, pretty high school 
basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
"She loves her sister," Anita Tanabe said. "She's so proud of her sister. 
Krisden did leave her mark behind." 
</P>
<P>
Family members said Friday they felt the system had failed both young people. 
They wondered why White, so obviously distraught, had left the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We just assumed that the professionals were taking care of him," Lisa Barros, 
Tanabe's aunt, said. "He just got out of a mental hospital and he was able to 
walk in and buy a firearm. That, to me, seems criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were still trying to determine how White obtained the gun. 
Greg White said his brother had borrowed money from a friend, saying he needed 
it to pay some bills, then apparently purchased the shotgun sometime during the 
days after he left the hospital.

<P>
WATER CONSERVATION SESSION PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Point, which was mildly hit by a South Orange County water shortage last 
summer, will be co-host of a session Wednesday to help educate the public on 
how to conserve water through wise landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The Xeriscape Conference will start at 7 p.m. at the Dana Hills Tennis Center, 
24911 Calle de Tennis. The conference, also hosted by the Capistrano Bay Parks 
and Recreation Department, is free and open to the public. Free brochures will 
be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers will be Cal Poly Pomona professor Robert Perry, a landscape 
specialist in the university's architecture department. 
</P>
<P>
"Water in South Orange County is a precious resource," said City Councilwoman 
Ingrid McGuire. "In Dana Point, all of our water is imported. This conference 
will pull together all the thoughts and ideas on using less water in gardens or 
parks or landscapes. It's certainly the way more water can be saved because in 
most households, more than 50% of the water that is used is water outside of 
the house, for such things as gardens and washing the car and hosing down the 
driveway." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point felt a water shortage that hit Tri-Cities Municipal Water District 
in July and August. The district provides water to all of San Clemente and to 
the Capistrano Beach area of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente imposed voluntary water cutbacks during the water shortage, but 
Dana Point did not have to restrict water usage.

POTENTIAL TOLLWAY USERS TO BE SURVEYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worried that toll revenue may be insufficient to build two planned tollways at 
their fully designed width, the agency overseeing the projects will ask 
congestion-weary motorists how much they are willing to pay to use them. The 
Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency voted Thursday to conduct the 
new survey after a study by Wilbur Smith Associates showed that ridership will 
drop if tolls on the two new highways exceed $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
Tolls of about $1 had been envisioned by transportation planners for both the 
Eastern and Foothill tollways. Construction of the projects is scheduled to 
begin in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, projected revenue from anticipated traffic volumes on both highways 
are about 30% below what is needed to pay for building both toll projects as 
they currently are designed, Loretta Sanchez, a financial analyst with 
Irvine-based Fieldman &amp; Rolapp, said Friday. The firm has been hired by the 
tollway agencies to monitor the financial viability of the Eastern, Foothill 
and San Joaquin Hills tollway projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We've said for quite awhile now that there needs to be a better look at 
revenues versus the cost of the projects," Sanchez said. "The numbers don't 
work right now. The engineers are looking at reducing the scope of the 
projects, which probably means that you would build all of the (roads) but 
downsize them to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the problem is not that there won't be sufficient funds to build 
the tollways, but that big construction bills arrive before toll revenues 
accumulate sufficiently to pay off the bonds that must be sold to help finance 
the projects. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, chairman of the Foothill/Eastern 
board, said targets of the new survey will be commuters from Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties who work in the Irvine area. He hopes the survey will show 
that such drivers are willing to pay $2 or $3 to use the tollways as an 
alternative to the already jammed Riverside, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have not included those commuters, focusing instead on the 
travel behavior of Orange County residents along Interstate 5 and the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know what . . . level of frustration would cause (people) to 
pay to move more quickly around Southern California or Orange County," 
Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
No firm has been selected yet to conduct a new study. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern tollway would connect with the Riverside Freeway at Weir Canyon and 
run to the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine. The Foothill tollway would extend from 
the Eastern tollway near Irvine Lake through Rancho Santa Margarita to 
Interstate 5 near San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which is expected to have tolls of $1 to $1.25, 
would extend from the John Wayne Airport area to San Juan Capistrano through 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The three projects are expected to cost at least $2 billion, with 48.5% paid by 
developer fees and the rest by toll revenue, state and federal funds. JEFFREY

JUDGE POSTPONES KRAFT SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin agreed Friday, over prosecution 
objections, to postpone sentencing for convicted serial killer Randy Steven 
Kraft to Nov. 29 at the request of defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, whose jury returned a death verdict in August, had been scheduled for 
sentencing Oct. 27. But his lawyers told the court they simply were not ready 
with a variety of motions they expect to present, primarily in an attempt to 
win Kraft a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown objected to any delay. The district 
attorney's office has repeatedly objected over the past several years to 
numerous delays in the proceedings in the Kraft case. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, who was a Long Beach computer consultant, is considered by 
prosecutors perhaps the worst serial killer in the United States. They have 
accused him of 45 murders in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan. But they 
say the number could be greater than 60. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has the authority to reduce the verdict from death to life without 
parole. However, no Orange County judge has reduced a verdict since the new 
capital punishment law was enacted in 1977. McCartin has already sentenced six 
other men to Death Row, all of them now awaiting appeals on their cases.

FRATERNITY GRANTED SUSPENSION REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chapman College's largest fraternity, suspended by the school earlier this 
month after two of its members threw a party with a topless stripper, has been 
granted a reprieve while a student panel reviews the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Sigma Phi Epsilon men held the party at their off-campus apartment Sept. 
28, according to fraternity president Dean Cooper. About 50 students -- many of 
them fraternity members -- attended the party, prompting the school to slap the 
organization with a one-year suspension and a second year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at the 1,100-student college in Orange reconsidered their 
ruling, however, and decided to let a student "Greek Judicial Board" review the 
incident and make recommendations, which the administration pledged to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Hunter Hancock, the school's vice president for student life, said she 
and Jeff Quick, director of college activities, withdrew the yearlong 
suspension so students could weigh the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"While we both believe that the original sanction is justified, we also believe 
that significant learning can take place in the resolution of this matter," 
Hancock said in an Oct. 10 memo to the campus. "If the administration imposes a 
sanction, that learning process can be short-circuited." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hancock's memo reaffirmed the administration's belief that the 
incident was "offensive and demeaning," fraternity officers welcomed at least 
the temporary withdrawal of their suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that for some reason the school admitted they were wrong," Cooper 
said. "Sigma Phi Epsilon does not feel that it is correct to portray a woman in 
that light, but the fraternity didn't pay for this event. There weren't (Greek) 
letters hanging up or anything. . . . This was a couple individuals, not the 
fraternity." JIM NEWTON

CONSERVATION CORPS TO WORK ON PARKS

<P>
City parks will get $50,000 in fire safety improvements and environmental 
planting, courtesy of the California Conservation Corps, city and corps 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great for us, since it will pay for some work we have already started 
at Wilderness Glen Park," said Wayne A. Lowery, the city's parks and recreation 
director. "It's also working out well for the corps. It gives them an 
opportunity to help teach their people about the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who said the corps notified him last week of its intention to donate 
the work to the city, added that the same project may pay for improvements at 
Oso Viejo Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Glen Park has already received help from the corps, but that 
work, valued at $10,000, was paid for by the city. The additional improvements 
will come out of the corps' public service budget. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Hughes, district director for the Pomona Service District, said the 
corps had chosen the project because it met all three criteria used to guide 
corps work: The project serves a public benefit, is related to conservation and 
provides valuable education for corps members, he said. JIM NEWTON

HOMES DEVELOPMENT VOTE PLANNED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a special meeting today to vote on plans for a 
355-home development on a portion of the old Hellman Ranch, the site of a 
former wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is at 3:30 p.m. at Seal Beach City Hall, 211 8th St. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the local Wetlands Restoration Society want development banned from 
portions of the site, located north of Pacific Coast Highway and west of Seal 
Beach Boulevard, where they hope 100 acres of former wetlands will be restored. 
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, the Newport Beach-based Mola Development Co. promises to 
restore 26 acres of degraded wetlands on the property and expand them to 36 
acres. As part of the restoration, Mola will return tidal flow to the wetlands 
and replant native flora, making it again a viable habitat for local and 
migratory birds, the company has said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the society disputes such claims, saying the wetlands will be spurned 
by birds because of the close proximity of homes. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the project, the plan would go to the state Coastal 
Commission, the final authority. The commission is scheduled to hear the 
proposal during the week of Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the commission rejected Mola's previous plan for 770 homes and a golf 
course on the property because it infringed on six acres of wetlands.

LAID-OFF WORKERS TO GET COUNSELING HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will be managing a new federal program to help local workers who have 
been notified they will be laid off because of work-force reductions or plant 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously this week to approve a list of agencies that 
will counsel workers about to be laid off on how to write resumes, handle 
interview techniques and search for new jobs. The program is part of the 
federal Plant Closure Act approved by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get these people out of the doldrums and into gainful employment as 
quickly as possible," said Al McCord, Anaheim's director of economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be offered to Anaheim workers who are laid off in groups of 50 
or more. The last layoff of that size in Anaheim was at Laura Scudder last 
year, McCord said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the local service agencies handling the program are the North Orange 
County Community College District and the UAW-Labor Employment and Training 
Corp. The agencies were selected by the Anaheim Private Industry Council.

Disneyland said the ambassador, accompanied by Disney characters, travels the 
world to bring the message of happiness to children of all ages in hospitals 
and care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be announced Oct. 27 during ceremonies celebrating the 
Ambassador Silver Jubilee 25th Anniversary in the forecourt of the Sleeping 
Beauty Castle at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The Saddleback/Irvine Valley forensics team, composed largely of new members 
competing in their first contest, won 16 awards at the recent Pacific Southwest 
Collegiate Forensics Assn. tournament, according to coach Bob Bornemann. Team 
captain Jennifer Huss of Irvine was awarded two superiors for extemporaneous 
and impromptu speaking.

<P>
James Faith, drug-awareness chairman of Mission Viejo/Saddleback Valley Elks 
Lodge 2444, was presented a special citation for his work in promoting the 
perils of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Faith has carried his message on radio and television in Southern California as 
well as distributing drug-awareness pamphlets to students, law enforcement 
agencies, drug rehabilitation clinics and service organizations.

created and operated a computerized information clearing center to coordinate 
the dispatch of aid with those who needed it. 
</P>
<P>
A bank of 30 phones and volunteer operators was also established with a 
toll-free number for people to call for assistance or for those making 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said his company's effort is an excellent example of a local company 
mobilizing its resources to respond to a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
A check for $1,069, the amount raised from a chili cook-off at the Starting 
Gate restaurant in Los Alamitos, was presented to Casa Youth Shelter, a

PANEL RAPPED ON OUT-OF-TOWN VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TRUSTEES, UNDER FIRE FOR VOTING IN PALM 
SPRINGS TO CHANGE SCHOOL BOUNDARIES, WILL CONSIDER BARRING AWAY-FROM-HOME 
VOTES.

<P>
Stung by criticism over a vote taken in Palm Springs to change school 
attendance boundaries, Orange Unified School District trustees have decided to 
consider a measure that would bar them from voting at future out-of-town 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees also proposed Thursday night a wide-ranging study of the impact of 
boundary changes on the ethnic makeup at district schools in response to 
charges that shifting boundaries for the Linda Vista and Esplanade elementary 
schools creates racially segregated schools. But they did not rescind the 
boundary change, which took effect this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial 4-3 vote came during a district retreat in Palm Springs on 
Aug. 15 and 16, a meeting that many of the board's critics said few members of 
the public could have known about. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. John Ikerd, however, said the board complied with requirements of the 
state's open-meeting law by posting a notice on the front door of the district 
offices on Glassell Street 72 hours before the retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The change allowed about 40 Anglo students to transfer from Esplanade, which is 
49% Latino, to Linda Vista, which is 90% Anglo when school began this fall. The 
two schools are less than a mile from each other. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday night's board meeting, the board still was under attack for the way 
it conducted the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"You should never discuss business where you and your taxpayers are not eyeball 
to eyeball," chided Bob Bennyhoff, a resident of Orange Park Acres and 
crusading political writer for the community newspaper, Common Talk. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dumb thing to do," he said. "The thought crosses my mind that you 
didn't want anyone to hear you. Communications is one of this board's biggest 
weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
Bennyhoff said he learned of the vote days later, when he ran into one of the 
parents who had lobbied for the change. He said he then went to the school 
district offices to ask for the tape of the Palm Springs meeting, because all 
other board meetings are tape recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"Lo and behold, there's no tape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Ikerd, Dorothy Gibson, another resident critical of the boundary 
decision, said at Thursday night's regular meeting that she was "outraged that 
the board would have the audacity to remove a public board meeting from the 
confines of their school district." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, William G. Vasquez, asked trustees and the superintendent to 
demonstrate that families affected by the proposed boundary change were 
notified in advance that such a plan would be discussed and decided at the 
August meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the district sends agendas of regular board meetings to about 100 
individuals or organizations, such as PTA chapters and the news media, Ikerd 
said. In this case, a notice was posted only on the front door of the district 
offices. But that apparently meets the legal requirements of the state's 
open-meeting law, the Brown Act, according to Patricia McGinnis, assistant to 
the chief legal counsel for the California Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Several critics, however, say such an action smacks of the board trying to hide 
its involvement in the controversial change. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Sandy G. Englander, who proposed limiting future board votes to 
meetings held within the district, said it is the perception of wrongdoing that 
bothers her. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently there's been some concern raised (about) whether or not we were 
within the Brown Act," Englander said. She said that while district officials 
have no doubt that they acted within the law, "sometimes perception seems to be 
a little different than reality." 
</P>
<P>
Of that perception, she added, "If there is ever any question of doubt, we need 
to clarify it." 
</P>
<P>
The board will consider the proposal at its next meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson also requested that public notices of meetings be posted on the side 
doors as well as the front door of the administrative office. She said that 
would make the notices more accessible to people who drive into the district 
office parking lot looking for such notices. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members balked at the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a limit," said trustee Jeff Holstein. "I know we want to be good 
people and all that. But fair is fair and right is right. I don't see why we 
have to jump at everything just when somebody brings it up." 
</P>
<P>
Englander and trustee Russ Barrios also proposed forming a committee of 
trustees and community members to examine the ethnic balance of each of the 
district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios, one of three trustees who voted against the boundary change, has said 
he was concerned about the motives of the parents who wanted their children to 
attend Linda Vista instead of Esplanade, which was named a Distinguished School 
last year, a recognition by the state of its academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier in the week, Barrios said he was not going to go as far 
as calling the parents' motives racist, but he said he could find no good 
reason for parents not to want their children to attend a school that was about 
the same distance from their home, and had no record of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't look into another individual's heart," he said. "But I can look at 
what's presented to me. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck . . . to 
my recollection, every single board member told me, 'Hmmm, we know exactly 
what's going on here.' But when the vote came, that was cast aside. I was 
really disappointed and took it as a slight. I thought it was just plain 
shameful." 
</P>
<P>
Englander, who voted in favor of the boundary change, said the idea of forming 
a committee to study the ethnic breakdowns is not meant to be a retreat on the 
boundary issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Without discussing how anyone voted or the position that anyone took. . . , I 
think that if anybody feels there is a concern (about the ethnic balance), then 
we should address this," she said. "I don't think this is an easy one to deal 
with."

Jimmy Swaggart controversies over the past 2 1/2 years, the Tustin-based 
Trinity Broadcasting Network has emerged virtually unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this period, Trinity's founder and president, Paul Crouch, quietly 
has been changing the shape of the family-controlled network and 24-hour-a-day 
Christian programming service. While Robert H. Schuller, of Garden Grove's 
Crystal Cathedral, and Oral Roberts have announced sharp cutbacks in their 
organizations during this period, Trinity has continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Trinity's donations are up slightly, a radio network has been started and 
Crouch recently has sold off two of Trinity's smaller stations in order to 
purchase larger ones. Three companies to which Trinity has given extensive 
financial support actually have added five affiliated stations to the network. 
These transactions -- involving Crouch's son and several people who receive 
free air time on Trinity -- "raise some interesting questions" regarding 
Trinity's expansion, an FCC attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
But Crouch's attorney, Colby M. May, said that Trinity's "loans made to other 
tax-exempt, nonprofit Christian ministries are negotiated at arm's length" and 
are not improper. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch, who is out of the country, has steadfastly refused to criticize Bakker 
or Swaggart, who buys time on Trinity, along with Schuller and Roberts. On his 
Oct. 5 broadcast, Crouch simply asked viewers to pray for the Bakkers. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of this year, Crouch wrote in his August newsletter, the 
tax-exempt network has experienced "the most explosive growth in our 16-year 
history -- 165 stations on the air, worldwide." The network, already the 
largest owner of television stations in the nation, has expanded at a rate of 
one new low-power station per week in 1989, Crouch told viewers in a recent 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous family members are now employed at Trinity, but Crouch's son, Paul 
Jr., has not been a full-time employee of Trinity since 1980. However, Paul 
Jr.'s tax-exempt Sonlight Broadcasting System of Tustin has announced the 
purchase of three television stations, outlets in Holly Springs, Miss., Mobile, 
Ala., and Hendersonville, Tenn., for a total of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
While none of the three stations are now on the air (two are not even built 
yet), all will be Christian and affiliated with TBN, Paul Jr. said in an 
interview from his Tustin production company. The purchase was made possible 
with his own money, Paul Jr. said, as well as with support from his partner, 
Jay Sekulow, an attorney who appears regularly on TBN. A critical factor in the 
company's financial viability, Paul Jr. said, was the advance purchase of air 
time on the new stations by Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's financed us to this point," Paul Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
May, Crouch's attorney, said that this arrangement was not unusual, since 
"throughout the years the major (commercial) networks have made advance time 
purchases and loaned money to other broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch announced the sale of two of his full-power commercial television 
stations this year -- both of which he said were not producing enough revenue 
-- enabling him to buy two stations in larger markets and remain within 
ownership limits of the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stations, in Albuquerque, N.M., is being sold for $2.5 million to a 
tax-exempt company called All American TV of the City of Commerce, according to 
documents filed Sept. 6 with the FCC. That company, which has four other 
religious stations affiliated with Trinity, was set up with the assistance of 
loans from Trinity, said All American's president, Sonny Arguinzoni, a Puerto 
Rican evangelist who has a weekly program on Trinity for which he does not pay. 
According to IRS documents, All American had an outstanding loan from Trinity 
of $5.29 million in 1988, up from $3.75 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Another religious broadcasting company, Tri-State Christian TV Inc. of Marion, 
Ill., which was set up with the help of loan guarantees from Trinity, announced 
recently that it has purchased WNYB Channel 49 in Buffalo, N.Y., from the 
Buffalo Sabres hockey team for $2.5 million. It will also be affiliated with 
TBN. Trinity has an outstanding loan to Tri-State of $1.45 million, according 
to federal documents. Arguinzoni and All American Director Nicky Cruz -- both 
former Tri-State board members -- began their company by buying four stations 
from Tri-State, using money borrowed from Trinity, Arguinzoni said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Glasser, an FCC attorney, said that Trinity's relationships with these 
other companies "raise some interesting questions" with regard to its expanding 
influence but that the loans, in and of themselves, "would not really indicate 
there is a common thread of ownership and control" that extends beyond the 
stations Trinity owns. 
</P>
<P>
Trinity is also branching out into radio. With the acquisition of two 
commercial radio stations in Washington state and a public FM station in 
Barstow, Calif., the network has begun building a complementary radio network. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our chance," Crouch wrote in the newsletter, "possibly our last chance 
to capture another great voice for God -- a radio voice! Let's reach our youth 
and all America with our programming -- in their cars, at home, even on 
portable Walkman radios with the truth about the Bible, creation and the love 
of God." 
</P>
<P>
Financially, the network appears to be doing well. 
</P>
<P>
In documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service, Trinity reported a 10% 
increase in donations from 1987 to 1988, the most recent year for which figures 
are available. Trinity reported more than $22 million in direct public support, 
up from 1987 but less than half of Trinity's announced pledge totals for the 
network's twice-yearly "Praise-a-Thons." 
</P>
<P>
The network's net worth -- book value rather than market value -- was listed in 
federal documents at just over $90 million. A year earlier, that figure was 
about $75 million. Crouch has said on numerous occasions that the network's 
market value exceeds $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expansion and increase in revenues, the network has suffered some 
setbacks in 1988 and 1989, which Crouch called in his newsletter "the year all 
hell broke loose!" These included: 
</P>
<P>
* A previously announced plan to take over a frequency of the South African 
Broadcasting Co. has been stalled in the face of a competing application from a 
South African religious broadcasting group. 
</P>
<P>
* A public dispute with the publisher of a Costa Mesa newsletter over charges 
that Trinity has been selling air time to the American Freedom Coalition, a 
group that has acknowledged substantial financial backing from the Rev. Sun 
Myung Moon's Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious challenge facing Trinity is a long-simmering dispute with the 
National Religious Broadcasters over ethics and financial accountability, 
including an investigation by the NRB's Ethics Committee, which is looking into 
Crouch's business practices and the treatment of network employees. Although 
Crouch told congressional investigators in October, 1987, that he would join 
the NRB's Ethics and Financial Integrity Commission, Trinity has failed to 
submit an application, according to the organization's administrator, Arthur C. 
Borden. Membership in the commission is mandatory for continued membership in 
the NRB. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, some of the best-known American televangelists have 
stumbled, fallen or temporarily left the airwaves: Jim Bakker and Jimmy 
Swaggart over sex, Pat Robertson for politics, Oral Roberts as a result of dire 
appeals for money. Other religious broadcasters, like Jerry Falwell and Garden 
Grove's Robert Schuller, acknowledge losing viewers and income as a result of 
the continuing distrust of all evangelists.

8-FOOT TIDE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is an unusual weekend. Not only did it start with Friday the 13th, it is 
continuing tonight with a full moon that is an astronomical oddity: a Hunter's 
Moon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the typical beach-goer probably would not notice, the tide off Orange 
County is unusually high this weekend, about eight feet, as opposed to the more 
typical five to six feet. 
</P>
<P>
High tides today will be at 9:05 a.m. and 9:54 p.m. Low tides will be 2:54 a.m. 
and 3:41 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The high tide is produced by the full moon. The moon Saturday night is known as 
the Hunter's Moon because at this time of year it rises soon after sunset, 
making the day seem longer and giving hunters more hours of light to catch 
their prey. 
</P>
<P>
During a full moon the Earth, sun and moon are aligned, with the sun and moon 
on opposite sides of the Earth, explained Cal State Fullerton physics professor 
Fred M. Johnson. When all three are aligned, Johnson said, they create an 
"additive" effect in which the gravitational attraction of the sun and the moon 
on the earth are combined, creating the high tides. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards at Newport Beach said the tide was two or three feet higher than 
normal Friday, but that would not be dangerous unless accompanied by heavy 
surf.

O'NEIL SPARKS MATER DEI WITH PASSING, DEFENSE

Happy? 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rollinson, Mater Dei High School football coach, slapped a bear hug on 
everything that wasn't nailed down Friday after his team defeated St. Paul, 
34-24, in the Angelus League opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Most deserving of Rollinson's affection was quarterback Danny O'Neil, who 
completed 19 of 27 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns. O'Neil also 
played the entire game at free safety, saving a couple of touchdowns, one with 
a one-arm tackle, another by batting a pass away. 
</P>
<P>
And he punted. 
</P>
<P>
Tired? 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, who has led Mater Dei to three straight victories, looked as if he 
could go for an overtime period or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too pumped to be tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was O'Neil who led the Mater Dei second-half charge that saw the Monarchs 
(3-3, 1-0) score 17 consecutive points in 13 minutes that bridged the third and 
fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
On its first possession of the second half, Mater Dei drove from its 26 to St. 
Paul's 23, where the drive stalled. Cliff Roberts kicked a 41-yard field goal 
to give Mater Dei a 20-17 lead. The drive consumed close to six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Paul offense gained only 13 yards on its next two possessions, and a 
tired Swordsmen defense was picked apart by O'Neil, who drove his team from its 
own 37. O'Neil hit receivers on passes of 14, 9 and 13 yards, before completing 
a 31-yard touchdown pass to Rick Ellis. Ellis simply ran by a sagging St. Paul 
defense and caught O'Neil's perfectly thrown pass at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"My offensive line was incredible tonight," O'Neil said. "No one got close. 
When you have that kind of time, you better be able to complete passes." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei would score again on an 8-yard CaeliiClifford run to make the score, 
34-17, with 4:52 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul scored on a 16-yard pass play from quarterback Albert Borunda to 
running back Sean McKinney with 2:26 left for the game's final score. 
</P>
<P>
It was McKinney's 73-yard run midway through the second quarter that tied the 
game at 17. 
</P>
<P>
That was St. Paul's second big play of the half. Receiver Steve Corpus had 
caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Borunda early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I got really frustrated at the big plays they were making in the first half," 
Rollinson said. "I was afraid of them making another one. You know, with high 
school kids, their heads can get down and they never get up." 
</P>
<P>
But the next big St. Paul play never came. That was left to O'Neil &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil opened the game's scoring with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Tino Chavez 
with 7:15 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez had another big game, catching eight passes for 129 yards and two 
touchdowns.

Bobby Hubbard passed for one touchdown and ran for another to lead Cypress High 
School to a 13-0 victory over El Dorado Friday in the Empire League opener for 
both teams at Western High School. 
</P>
<P>
After a fumble recovery on the El Dorado 27-yard line by Richard Parsons, 
Cypress (3-3, 1-0) took seven plays before Hubbard scored on a one-yard run 
with 7 minutes 15 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, who completed 15 of 26 passes for 141 yards, connected on a 10-yard 
scoring pass to tight end Sean Gibson with three seconds remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress held El Dorado (0-1, 0-6) to 54 yards in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson caught six passes for 70 yards, and running back Brian Dawson had 49 
yards in 15 carries to lead all rushers.

LA HABRA DEFENSE REGROUPS AND PACES 21-17 VICTORY

<P>
La Habra High School's defensive unit bounced back from last week's 55-14 loss 
to Perris, leading the Highlanders to a 21-17 Freeway League victory over Buena 
Park at La Habra Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra's defense, which gave up 555 yards to Perris last week, held Buena 
Park to 57 yards in the second half to preserve the victory. La Habra is 3-3 
overall and 1-0 in league play. Buena Park is 1-5 overall and 0-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra broke a 14-14 tie on a four-yard touchdown pass from Mark Moreno to 
Mark Brown on the last play of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno was 10 of 14 for 89 yards and one touchdown. Brown was La Habra's 
leading rusher with 116 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
After a 24-yard field goal by Hugo Melendez cut the La Habra lead to 21-17 in 
the third quarter, Buena Park had the ball in La Habra territory three more 
times but failed to score.

FULLERTON STARTS QUICKLY, WINS BIG

<P>
Fullerton High School returned the opening kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown and 
rolled to a 37-7 rout of Sonora Friday night in front of 2,100 fans in 
Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
David Chacon raced untouched to the end zone on the first play of the game and 
Fullerton opened with 21 points in the first quarter -- its biggest offensive 
outburst of the season -- in the Freeway League opener for both schools. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (5-1, 1-0) already had scored 21 points with 3:44 remaining in the 
first quarter despite totaling only 42 yards. Fullerton, which scored only 
three points in a loss to Western last week, had plenty of offense, but the 
outcome didn't please Coach Steve Nishimoto. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy," said Nishimoto. "We won by 30 points, but we were sloppy. The 
touchdown on the opening kickoff really got us off to a good start, but all 
those penalties hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was penalized 12 times for 125 yards, most of the infractions coming 
on holding calls or late hits. The erratic play came only a week after 
Fullerton lost five fumbles in a 9-3 loss to Western. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue to play like this against good teams and win," Nishimoto 
said. "I'm concerned about some bad habits we've fallen into." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Sonora (2-4, 0-1) wasn't much opposition, despite fielding what 
many think is its best football team in the 1980s. Quarterback Ryan Lewis 
fumbled twice and was intercepted once as Sonora mounted only one scoring 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis completed only four of 17 pass attempts as Fullerton's defense, led by 
junior linebacker D.C. Olsen, continually pressured him. Fullback Scott Tibbets 
scored Sonora's only touchdown on a 40-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's reluctant receiver, John Bailey, had quite a night. He caught 
touchdown passes of 18 and 36 yards and had another touchdown play of 53 yards 
nullified by a penalty. Bailey also kicked a 28-yard field goal, was successful 
on four conversion kicks and was named the senior prince in homecoming 
ceremonies at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a guy who once quit the team. Bailey had decided to concentrate on 
baseball in his senior year, but changed his mind and joined the team four 
weeks ago. He has caught 18 passes for 278 yards in only four games since.

<P>
Momentum did an about-face Friday night at Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster, which had staggered to an 0-5 nonleague record, built a 9-0 lead 
at halftime, then held on to beat Marina, 9-7, in the Sunset League opener for 
both teams. Marina had won its previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
But Westminster might still be winless if not for two first-half boots: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first came courtesy of Marina's Christin McLemore, who fumbled a punt 
at his own one-yard line in the first quarter. Westminster's Bruce Tran 
recovered, and halfback Vance Senteno pounded across from there to give the 
Lions a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The second boot came from Westminster kicker Ken Scott, whose towering 
35-yard field goal in the second quarter proved to be the difference in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (2-4, 0-1) came back in the third quarter, driving 74 yards on its first 
possession of the half. Tailback Chris Evenson punched across right tackle from 
the four to cut Westminster's lead to two. 
</P>
<P>
On its next possession, Marina drove to the Westminster 18, but on third down, 
defensive end Vince Tauanuu nailed Marina quarterback David Schultz with a 
blind-side sack for a seven-yard loss. Eric Mifflin's 42-yard field goal 
attempt fell short. STUART MATTHEWS

In a Pacific Coast League opener, Orange High School (4-1-1) barely escaped its 
homecoming night with a 7-6 victory over Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly win, but we'll take it," Orange coach Tom Meiss said. "Maybe we 
all underestimated Laguna Beach." The Artists (0-6) took the lead on the 
opening possession of the second half when Sean Mallett caught a 10-yard 
touchdown pass from Aaron Scheid. 
</P>
<P>
After drawing two delay of game penalties while deciding whether to try for one 
or two points, Laguna Beach's conversion kick sailed wide. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers took the ensuing kickoff and marched to the Laguna Beach 20. On 
4th and 12, Gregg Campbell made a diving catch of Chris Thompson's pass in the 
corner of the end zone to tie the game, and kicker David Knorr made the 
conversion to give the Panthers the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We only made one mistake tonight," Laguna Beach Coach Lyman Olney said , "and 
it cost us the game." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

<P>
To determine the outcome of Friday night's Sunset League opener between Ocean 
View High School and Fountain Valley, you had to follow the bouncing ball. 
</P>
<P>
Two Fountain Valley pass plays in the fourth quarter provided the thrills -- 
each time, the intended receiver wasn't the one holding the ball when the play 
was completed. Only when the second play was completed with less than a minute 
remaining and Ocean View's Sean Rogers gripped his interception tightly was it 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View had defeated Fountain Valley, the defending league and Southern 
Section Division I champions, 17-16, at Huntington Beach High School. Only then 
could Ocean View Coach Howard Isom savor his school's first-ever victory over 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It got a little hairy at the end," Isom said, moments before his players 
carried him off the field on their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big win for Ocean View (4-2, 1-0), which finished fourth in the league 
last year, missing the Southern Section playoffs. Now it is in position to take 
on the rest of the league with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
But it could have easily gone the other way, what with the ball bouncing as it 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the fourth quarter, trailing 17-10, Fountain Valley quarterback 
Willy Puga threw a short pass over the middle to his tight end, Kameron 
McCluskey. McCluskey could only tip the ball, and it somehow ended up in the 
hands of teammate Doug Weaver, who ran the final few yards to finish the 
25-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
The extra point attempt failed, but the Barons got another chance when Rogers 
missed a 45-yard field goal attempt with less than two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Puga seemed to have completed a long pass to McCluskey that would 
have put the Barons close to field-goal range. But McCluskey never pulled the 
ball in, and the ball wound up in the hands of Rogers for his fifth 
interception of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last pass for Puga -- who completed 16 of 26 passes for 226 yards 
and two interceptions -- and the last gasp for the Barons, who had led, 10-0, 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But the tide may have turned in the last minutes of the first half when Rogers 
kicked a 49-yard field goal.

Junior halfback MawanSaba led the running attack and the defense forced three 
turnovers as Laguna Hills High School shut out Woodbridge, 29-0, in the Pacific 
Coast League opener for both teams Friday at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills (3-3, 1-0) discovered early it could run on Woodbridge (2-4, 0-1). 
Saba, who carried 27 times for 103 yards, scored on a two-yard run with 5 
minutes 57 seconds left in the first quarter. Senior quarterback Mark Wells 
passed to senior tight end AricRoman for the two-point conversion to make it 
8-0. 
</P>
<P>
While Saba did most of his damage inside, Wells broke loose outside, gaining 72 
yards in six carries in the first half. He also scored on runs of one and 19 
yards, as the Hawks led at halftime, 22-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been running the ball a lot all year and I think we are becoming a good 
running team, especially when our line gets off like it did tonight," Laguna 
Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said. LEN HALL

RANCHO SANTIAGO SOPHOMORE RAISES HAVOC ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas was talking about his defensive unit recently. 
He said he really liked some of the players because of that certain look they 
had in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the look a player gets when he enjoys contact a little too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Ogas didn't mention any names, but there is no doubt one of the players he was 
talking about is Fred Soares. 
</P>
<P>
Soares, an inside linebacker from Villa Park High School, was a freshman 
starter last season and is starting again this season for Rancho Santiago, 
which plays Cerritos in a Mission Conference game at 7 tonight at Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Soares knows his job on defense is to attack the ball -- and whomever happens 
to have it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the best example of Soares' football personality came out when he was 
talking about an upcoming opponent. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the quarterback and said, "He's my buddy. We became friends in the 
Orange County All-Star game. But when we play them, I'm going to have to try 
and take his head off." 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, the 6-foot-3 Soares was about 215 pounds and admits there were 
times when he was a little taken aback by the size of some of the players he 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something when a 260-pound lineman was diving at my legs to block me," 
he said. "There were times when my eyes were opened pretty wide in those first 
few games. Now, the freshmen seem smaller and slower than last season." 
</P>
<P>
Soares is up to 225 pounds and is one of the Dons' team captains. He also calls 
the defensive plays, which, on at least one occasion, presented quite a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago led, 34-0, after two quarters, but Citrus started the second 
half with a long drive. The march was 14 plays and lasted almost 10 minutes 
before the Owls finally scored. Rancho Santiago won, 34-14. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't done much conditioning during the week before the game," Soares said. 
"I was so tired, I thought I was going to die. I was gasping for air and almost 
couldn't call the plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, any time we are conditioning, I think back to that moment and work extra 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
In today's Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (2-2-1, 1-2) vs. Rancho Santiago (4-0, 3-0) at Santa Ana Stadium, 7 
p.m. -- Rancho Santiago, ranked sixth in the J.C. Grid-Wire national poll, is 
undefeated despite losing quarterback Scott Wood (flu) for a game two weeks ago 
and wide receiver Paul Peters (ankle) for last week's game. Wood is healthy and 
Peters is 70% but could play, according to Coach Dave Ogas. Cerritos upset 
Fullerton, 28-23, three weeks ago, but has since lost to San Diego Mesa, 22-19, 
and Riverside, 21-16. Rancho Santiago, Riverside and El Camino are the only 
undefeated teams in the 16-team Mission Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (2-2, 1-2) vs. Grossmont (1-3, 1-2) at Grossmont High School, 1:30 
p.m. -- Jeff Andrews, Fullerton's talented sophomore running back, could become 
the college's all-time rusher with a big game today. Andrews, from Diamond Bar 
High School, needs 153 yards to pass Andrew Greer (1986-87), who had 2,036 
yards. Andrews ran for 1,520 last season. He has 364 yards so far this season 
for a career total of 1,884. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mesa (2-2, 1-2) at Orange Coast (3-1, 2-1), 1:30 p.m. -- OCC, which 
has won two in a row, must concentrate on this game and not look forward to 
next Saturday's contest with rival Saddleback. OCC running back Mike Vaez has 
rushed for 454 yards, the fourth best total in the conference. Mesa quarterback 
Scott Allen is averaging 202 yards a game but has thrown eight interceptions 
and seven touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar (1-3, 1-2) vs. Golden West (2-2, 2-1) at Orange Coast, 7 p.m. -- Golden 
West is third best in the conference against the pass, allowing 131 yards a 
game, but about all Palomar does is pass. Comet quarterback Scott Barrick is 91 
of 182 for 1,191 yards with six touchdowns and nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (1-3, 1-2) at Pasadena (3-1, 2-1), 7 p.m. -- Saddleback is trying to 
build on last Saturday's 15-14 victory over Mt. San Antonio. Before that, the 
Gauchos had lost three in a row. Saddleback's defense is allowing 292 yards a 
game and has given up only eight touchdowns.

TITANS' OLD NEMESIS HAS NEW LOOK 
</P>

<P>
So much has changed for the University of the Pacific football team this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have a new coach in Walt Harris, who has installed a new offense. 
They have abandoned the wishbone for a passing game that is being guided by 
former Mission Viejo High School quarterback Troy Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton can only hope that the peculiar phenomenon of Pacific 
football has changed as well. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific hasn't had a winning season since 1977, but for the past four seasons, 
the Tigers have given Fullerton fits. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the legacy: 
</P>
<P>
1985 -- Fullerton took a 22-0 lead in the first quarter, then collapsed. After 
three quarters, Pacific led, 30-29. It took a touchdown with less than two 
minutes left for Fullerton to win, 43-37. 
</P>
<P>
1986 -- In the final game of a season in which Fullerton had won only two 
games, the lead went back and forth. Fullerton went 98 yards for a touchdown 
with a minute to play to tie the score and made a two-point conversion to take 
a 39-38 lead. But the Titans let Pacific drive deep, and held on to win only 
after a 45-yard field goal try failed. 
</P>
<P>
1987 -- In a game that may be the most notorious in the Titan tradition of 
self-destruction, Fullerton lost, 22-14, in a game ridden with penalties and 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
1988 -- Fullerton's vaunted defense gave up two huge plays, including a 77-yard 
touchdown pass, and the Titans trailed at halftime, 10-7. A bumbling Titan 
offense couldn't score another touchdown, but Stan Lambert pulled out a 13-10 
victory with two 40-yard-plus field goals -- the second after a series in which 
the Titans managed to gain only one yard. 
</P>
<P>
As Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy takes his team into Pacific's Amos Alonzo Stagg 
Memorial Stadium at 2 p.m. today, it's difficult for him to know what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
Refer to the phrase that has become Murphy's weekly refrain: "It depends on 
which team shows up." 
</P>
<P>
Will it be the turnover-prone team of the early season, the one that just 
avoided being upset by Cal State Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
Will it be the potent offensive team that took a 27-point halftime lead over 
Nevada Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
Or will it be the confounding team that let Dan Speltz's school-record 481 
yards passing go to waste in a 34-23 loss to winless Utah State last week? 
</P>
<P>
From Fullerton's point of view, it simply needs to be a team that will win. 
</P>
<P>
With a 1-1 record in the Big West, Fullerton would almost certainly be out of 
contention for the conference title with another loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Two losses, and it's over," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pacific's Greg Koperek, a senior defensive back from Edison High School, had 
four interceptions in four games before breaking his arm against Fresno State. 
Doctors said he might be out for the year, but this week doctors gave him 
clearance to play -- only three weeks after the fracture. . . . Titan injury 
report: Defensive lineman John Bavaro, who suffered bruised ribs in the first 
quarter of the loss to Utah State last week, has not been through full 
practices this week but is expected to play. Fullerton is one of only two 
conference teams that does not have a winning series record against Pacific. 
The Titans are 7-7. New Mexico State is 4-5. . . . Fullerton and Pacific have 
one common opponent, Nevada Las Vegas. Fullerton beat the Rebels, 34-20. 
Pacific lost to the Rebels last week, 30-7.

'FRIDAY THE 13TH' ELECTRONIC VIRUS FAILS TO CAUSE DREADED HAVOC; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: ONLY A HANDFUL OF INFECTIONS ARE REPORTED FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND 
EXPERTS DISAGREE IF THOSE ARE FROM THE MUCH-HERALDED THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The much-dreaded "Friday the 13th" computer virus, packing the potential to 
wipe out caches of data stored on millions of personal computers, failed to 
wreak the havoc that some expected, with only a handful of infections reported 
around the world Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't show up and we're thankful for that," said Mary Howlett, manager of 
office automation at a Hughes Aircraft Co. defense plant in Fullerton. "We did 
a lot of preparation ahead of time and were ready. It was a very good 
experience for us." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts doubted whether those problems that did pop up were actually from 
the Friday the 13th virus strain, or similar electronic infections that plague 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no confirmed sightings of Friday the 13th," said Arthur Hill, a 
spokesman for International Business Machines, whose computers were among the 
primary targets of the virus. However, other sources claimed there were some 
certified outbreaks both in Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to one report, the virus was discovered in about 10% of the personal 
computers in the Micro Resource Center at the University of Illinois in Urbana. 
The virus was found and contained before it spread to other machines, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the virus apparently struck five or six computers at the Royal 
National Institute for the Blind before steps were taken to halt its spread. 
</P>
<P>
Winn Schwartau, owner of a computer security company in Nashville, Tenn., said 
he had been contacted by more than a dozen companies, including some with 
hundreds of PC installations, that claimed to have been struck by the virus. 
However, Schwartau, whose security products sell for upwards of $600, declined 
to name the firms and his comments could not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
Although obviously cheered by the outcome, computer security experts said they 
could not decide whether to credit the tremendous advance precautions taken by 
corporations to screen the virus, or whether to believe that the extent of 
virus' spread had been blown out of proportion by those hoping to cash in on 
the paranoia and insecurities it aroused in computer users. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dud," said John McAfee, executive director of the Computer Virus 
Industry Assn. and an outspoken critic of the latest flurry of anti-virus 
activities. "It was blown way out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
The Friday the 13th virus generated unprecedented publicity and activity since 
its discovery about six weeks ago. The virus, created in Northern Europe 
earlier this year, is considered especially pernicious because it can wipe out 
the instructions governing how information is stored on the hard disks of 
certain PC models, rendering their contents completely inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
The virus was aimed at IBM personal computers and compatible models, which 
account for about 90% of the estimated 35 million personal computers now in 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic viruses are software programs that are deliberately inserted in 
legitimate programs. In addition to containing hidden instructions that can 
cripple the operations of the computer, these rogue programs are capable of 
reproducing themselves endlessly, either through computer networks or the 
sharing of infected computer disks. 
</P>
<P>
Because rumors of the virus began circulating six weeks ago, many corporations 
and individuals were able to screen their machines well before the virus was 
set to trigger at midnight Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An IBM spokesman said the company had received more than 1,700 calls on its 
toll-free hot line set up to advise customers. Ashton-Tate, the Torrance 
software publishing house, checked all of its PC installations last week, and 
security officials at Caltech screened campus machines several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many computer users at Hughes Ground Systems Group in Fullerton, a sprawling 
defense plant with about 4,000 IBM-compatible personal computers, also took 
precautions against the virus. And the company was happy with the results, 
Howlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' computer specialists distributed copies of a virus-detecting software 
program provided by IBM to hundreds of PC users. They were also encouraged to 
make backup copies of any data stored in their PCs, Howlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Bigos, manager of microcomputer services at UC Irvine, said none of the 
campus' several thousand personal computer users reported signs of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a very laid-back approach to this," Bigos said. "Most of the 
information we read about this indicated there was a very low probability" of 
infection by the virus. 
</P>
<P>
But there's at least one fellow in New York who is still wishing he could blame 
his computer problems on the virus. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that when Charles Brimmer, the New York bureau chief for the London 
Times, turned on his spanking new IBM personal computer Friday morning, he 
discovered that its hard disk instructions had been eradicated, just as the 
Friday the 13th virus would have done. However, the virus did not leave its 
traditional tell-tale message notifying the owner that he had been zapped. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Brimmer wants to believe he was struck by the dreaded virus. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened just as I was writing a story about computer crime," he said. "It 
could be pure chance. But I kind of hope it was the virus. It makes a better 
story."

Fidelity National Financial Inc., which has acquired a 23.6% stake in the 
Hammond Co., has extended until Oct. 31 its agreement to cease buying the 
Newport Beach mortgage banking firm's common stock. Fidelity, an Irvine-based 
title insurance company, had agreed to a two-week buying halt on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond officials have expressed alarm over what they see as an attempt by 
Fidelity to acquire controlling interest in the company. Hammond said Thursday 
that while Fidelity has agreed to extend the moratorium on stock purchases 
until the end of the month, "the prospects of a mutually acceptable longer-term 
standstill agreement, or other proposals, are uncertain at this time."

VERDI REQUIEM FOR ROSSINI IS REBORN IN U.S. PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The collaborative Requiem Mass that Verdi planned for the first anniversary of 
Rossini's death suffered a death of its own, and now a resurrection more than a 
century later. 
</P>
<P>
Written in 1869 by 13 Italian composers, the "Messa per Rossini" encountered 
insurmountable obstacles that prevented its premiere as scheduled, and the work 
was never heard until German conductor Helmuth Rilling led a reconstruction 
last year in Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States premiere came Thursday as Rilling led the Stuttgart Bach 
Choir (Gachinger Kantorei), the New York Philharmonic and a quintet of 
impressive vocal soloists in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
A performance tonight will be televised at 10 p.m. (PST) on KOCE Channel 50, in 
Orange County, and at 8 p.m. on KPBS Channel 15, in San Diego. (KCET, Channel 
28, in Los Angeles, will not carry the broadcast.) 
</P>
<P>
Conducting from memory, Rilling led an incandescent first performance. But this 
is not to say that the work is a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
With 13 composers involved -- each wrote a different movement according to a 
prearranged plan, and all of them, except for Verdi, have vanished into 
obscurity -- the work is uneven and presents some glaring stylistic 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden chromaticisms and expanded orchestration (full brass section -- four 
horns, four trumpets, three trombones and tuba -- plus cymbals and gong) in 
Carlo Pedrotti's "Tuba Mirum," for instance, come as quite a jolt after the 
tamer musical idioms of Antonio Buzzola's "Requiem" and Antonio Bazzini's "Dies 
Irae." 
</P>
<P>
And who would guess that the saccharine "Lacrymosa" for unaccompanied male 
voices and the ensuing severe, academic fugal "Amen" are by the same Carlo 
Coccia, the oldest composer represented in the work? 
</P>
<P>
Even Verdi's contribution, the "Libera Me," familiar in its revised form in his 
"Manzoni" Requiem, offers disconcerting surprise. The earlier version contains 
passages edited out later, including little brass fanfares in the "Dies Irae" 
section; correspondingly, there is new material in the later version. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners also will sense something different in parts of the soprano solo, 
even if not everyone will realize that she is singing a half-tone lower than in 
the later version. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most obvious and significant difference is that the basses -- not 
the soprano -- chant the final "Libera me domine di morte," ending the work by 
encompassing mankind communally rather than from an individual point of view as 
in the revision. 
</P>
<P>
No matter who the composer or what the style, and despite the issue of whether 
or not they were first-rate, Rilling addressed them all with maximum commitment 
and insight, and without a trace of condescension. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to imagine that there is an ounce of musical expression or 
possibility that eluded his keen vision. And the results often were 
electrifying, not only in Verdi's closing section but also in Buzzola's "Kyrie" 
and Pietro Platania's "Sanctus." 
</P>
<P>
The Stuttgart chorus, augmented with 14 Americans, sang with alertness, 
full-bodied tone and responsiveness to the text. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Gabriela Benackova brought a soaring expressivity to her solo duties, 
particularly in the "Libera Me." 
</P>
<P>
Mezzo Florence Quivar sang with power, steadiness and particular urgency in 
Lauro Rossi's "Agnus Dei." (In the televised broadcast, Cornelia Kallisch is 
scheduled to be the mezzo soloist. Kallisch, a young German singer, was an 
impressive soloist in Bach's B-minor Mass led by Rilling on Tuesday at Avery 
Fisher Hall.) 
</P>
<P>
Tenor James Walker, an American who sang the first performances in Europe, 
offered an expressive "Ingemisco," marred at times by some spread tones. 
</P>
<P>
Baritone Jacob Will sang with warmth, power and sensitivity. Bass Brain 
Matthews, in relatively minor duties, offered solid, strong support. Will and 
Matthews also are young American singers. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Philharmonic responded to Rilling's leadership with prismatic 
transparency, sweetness, suavity, precision and force. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the "Messa" takes a place in the repertory, at the least Rilling 
has made a case that not all of these 19th-Century Italian composers deserve 
the oblivion into which posterity has cast them.

8 CABLE STATIONS CARRYING GAYS' 'SPECTRUM NEWS'

"Spectrum News," a 30-minute television program devoted to homosexual issues, 
is now carried on eight cable stations in 14 Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We've handled a range of things, from the Gay Pride Festival in Santa Ana to 
federal protests in favor of gay rights," said "Spectrum" producer Brad Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson said "Spectrum" has been broadcasting since February when it produced a 
10-minute show for public-access channel KYOU in Santa Ana. The expanded, 
30-minute format began in May and includes entertainment, news items and 
coverage especially related to the county but sometimes focusing on national 
and statewide issues, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of "Spectrum" is to overcome perceptions that homosexuals only "live 
in closets, lay on the beach and drive to Los Angeles for fun." 
</P>
<P>
The program can be seen in Santa Ana (KYOU Channel 26 on Tuesdays at 5 p.m.), 
Mission Viejo, San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Beach (Dimension Cable, Channel 
33 on Fridays at 10 p.m.), Irvine (Community Cablevision, Channel 3 on 
alternating Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m.), Anaheim (Multivision, Channel 22 on 
Mondays at 6 p.m.) and Costa Mesa (Copley-Colony, Channel 61 on Mondays at 7 
p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
It is also aired in Orange (Cablevision of Orange, Channel 21, Mondays at 9 
p.m. and Thursdays at 6 p.m.), Fullerton and Placentia (Channel 51 on Mondays 
and Fridays at 8:30 p.m.), Buena Park (Channel 55 on Mondays and Fridays at 
8:30 p.m.), Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster (Rogers 
Cablesystems, Channel 3, air times to be announced). 
</P>
<P>
Hudson said Spectrum is in the process of developing a steady audience. He 
added that the program, which operates on a budget of $150 per episode, is 
searching for volunteers and donations. MARK CHALON SMITH

THUNDERS TRIES TO ERASE DRUG-CLOUDED MEMORIES; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: THE FORMER NEW YORK DOLL HAS PUT HIS ADDICTIONS AND HIS ERRATIC 
PERFORMANCES BEHIND HIM AND LOOKS FOR A HIGHER PROFILE WITH THE ODDBALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of Johnny Thunders' leading claims to a place in rock history is a song 
called "You Can't Put Your Arms Round a Memory," the affecting lament of a man 
who knows that the deck in life and love is stacked against him. 
</P>
<P>
Erasing memories can be even harder than holding onto them. In Thunders' case, 
his audience's collective memory is full of images of an erratic performer 
known almost as much for his bouts with drug addiction as for the musical 
accomplishments in a career that began in the early 1970s with the influential 
glam-rock band, the New York Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I live 100 years, it's going to be there," Thunders, 37, said of his 
reputation as a walking heroin casualty. But, speaking over the phone recently 
from Philadelphia, Thunders, who once put out an album called "Too Much Junkie 
Business," said that he has been straight since 1986. He described the 
Oddballs, the five-member backing band he has been working with for the past 
two years, as "the band that, when I'm 80, I'll remember as the one that was 
the most fun." 
</P>
<P>
Thunders hopes his current series of Southern California shows (including 
performances Sunday at the Coach House and Wednesday at Bogart's) will serve 
notice that he is out of the junkie business and deserving of a higher profile 
in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think I had to take drugs to be happy and to play. I was so wrong," 
Thunders said. "I want to invite the music industry down to the shows. I'd 
really like to call 'em out. Come to a show, and I'll show you what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Over the phone, Thunders seemed like a Dead End Kid arrived at middle age as he 
spoke in a worn voice that nevertheless was ready with a quip or a freewheeling 
opinion. The New York Dolls -- something of a rock-and-roll version of the Dead 
End Kids -- were a brash bunch of New York City rockers who got together in 
1971 and gained notoriety (if not wide success) with their androgynous look and 
a sloppy but boisterous raunch-rock sound inspired mainly by the Rolling 
Stones. 
</P>
<P>
Thunders was known as John Genzale when he was growing up in Queens. "I was 
going to be a baseball player," he said. "I made the varsity baseball team as a 
freshman. I was scouted by the L.A. Dodgers." He said his baseball career ended 
when "they told me to cut my hair and I (emphatically refused). I started a 
band then." 
</P>
<P>
With their lipstick, platform shoes and feather boas, the Dolls were part of 
the glam-rock movement of the early 1970s that aimed to shock with 
gender-bending appearances and behavior (Alice Cooper, David Bowie and Marc 
Bolan were others who did it with a good deal more commercial success). 
</P>
<P>
The band's rowdy, funny songs about life on New York's seamier side proved more 
enduring than its image, and the Dolls gained significance as a precursor for 
the punk-rock movement that came later in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the New York Dolls in 1975, Thunders and Dolls drummer Jerry 
Nolan formed a band called the Heartbreakers. Thunders launched his solo career 
in 1978 with a strong album called "So Alone." By 1981, he was being 
prematurely eulogized by the Replacements, whose 1981 debut album included a 
song called "Johnny's Gonna Die" in which singer Paul Westerberg expressed 
affection for Thunders, mixed with pity and anger over what seemed to be his 
imminent fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard it," Thunders said. But a few months ago, he shared a bill 
with the Replacements and Westerberg approached him. "The singer's a nice guy. 
The rest of 'em should read some books," said Thunders. "He told me he wrote 
this song, and told me some of the words." Thunders said he didn't have much of 
a reaction to what really is a remarkable song. "I was yawning, actually," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thunders, however, sounds lively enough on "Copy Cats," a new album on which he 
shares billing with Patti Palladin, a fellow New Yorker based in London. The 
album features punchy cover versions of mostly obscure R&amp;B oldies, with 
Thunders using his thin, nasal voice to humorous effect with theatrical 
mannerisms. It's slightly reminiscent of his old Dolls partner David Johansen's 
popular new incarnation as Buster Poindexter, a comical lounge belter 
specializing in R&amp;B oldies. 
</P>
<P>
Thunders, who returned to New York City about a year ago after spending most of 
the '80s in France and Sweden, said that some of his new songs take a more 
serious, socially conscious tack. He eagerly began reciting the lyrics to a 
song he has written about homelessness. "I'm not one to lend my name to causes, 
but in justice I intercede," he began. "Hurting the hurt -- is this America? 
Tell me please." 
</P>
<P>
"I also have a new song about battered children called 'Children Are People 
Too,' " Thunders said, as well as a gospel song singing the praises of Jesse 
Jackson. "And I have one about critics called "I Tell the Truth Even When I'm 
Lying.' " A few months ago, Thunders said, an offer came through for him to 
join two other former New York Dolls, Jerry Nolan and Sylvain Sylvain, on what 
would have amounted to a nostalgia tour for the alternative-rock set. But he 
couldn't see trying to put his arms around that memory, especially with 
Johansen not involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was silly. I'd be a hypocrite if I did it. The only thing I've 
got is my music, so I can't see selling that out." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Dolls will reunite in the year 2000, Thunders said jokingly. For now, 
he just wants to follow his own relatively modest goals. "As long as I can play 
and make records, that's all I want. I play to please my band and myself. If I 
can take kids' problems away for two hours, I did my job." 
</P>
<P>

Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, with Static Action opening at 8 p.m.

PWEI'S PERSONALITY SAVES A PREFAB SHOW 
</P>

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On its album, "This Is The Day . . . This Is The Hour . . . This Is This!" Pop 
Will Eat Itself has a grand time chomping on as many different electronic 
tidbits as it can fit on one party platter. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Thursday, the pantry looked 
unpromisingly bare. No drummer to drive in the punk and metal edge that is a 
staple of the British band's sound. No disc jockey to deliver the rap-style 
record scratching that adds to PWEI's impressive abrasiveness. All of that was 
prepackaged on backing tracks that played behind PWEI's two singers and two 
guitar players. So were the audio bites that the band lifts from records and 
broadcast sources to add humor or an interesting sonic touch. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it appeared this techno approach to live performance was going to be 
a letdown. Singers Clint Mansell and Graham Crabb were capering about and 
barking and intoning with enough force to keep the show from resembling one of 
those dismissable dance-pop "track shows" where all the music -- and maybe a 
good deal of the singing -- comes in a can. But for the first few songs, it was 
a case of too much sound coming from tape, and too little coming from human 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
One of the year's best pop joke numbers, "Not Now James, We're Busy," lost 
something in translation to the stage: The rap-style song's punch line -- an 
audio snippet of James Brown -- works perfectly on record. But on stage, where 
vision reinforces sound, it is less likely that taped sound bites will come 
across well, especially amid the rapid-fire rap delivery of "Not Now James." To 
make the number work, PWEI would have needed to bring on a good J.B. 
impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, though, the instrumental team of Adam Mole and Richard March 
started to make itself felt with some good, noisy guitar grunge and driving 
bass lines that gave the show before a half-capacity house more real-time 
impact. They also punched up some riffs and rhythm effects on sampling 
keyboards, which helped diminish the aloofness inherent in the use of 
prerecorded material. With much of the sound canned, it was essential that the 
singers give vibrant, emphatic performances that would instill the show with 
sweat and immediacy. They delivered -- especially Mansell, a manic, shirtless 
figure with a tangle of long, matted hair who leaped about wildly, jabbed the 
air with his fists, and took frequent table-top excursions into the audience. 
</P>
<P>
A few more hands substituting for machines would have made the show more of a 
grabber, but all in all this fun performance was a good example of real 
personality making up for a shortage of real people. 
</P>
<P>
A half-hour opening set by Electric Cool-Aide offered garage-punk that was 
earnestly, if sloppily, played and reasonably melodic. The best song from this 
young Costa Mesa foursome was a reflection on a teen suicide that seemed honest 
and personally felt. A song about a "Do The Right Thing"-style police melee and 
race riot was less convincing. Electric Cool-Aide could be worth another look 
in a few months -- if it works hard to sharpen up.

In July the number of permits issued for multifamily housing units dropped to 
its lowest point since February. The 476 permits brought the seven-month total 
to 5,197, lowest of any of the last four years. That number is, for example, 
34% below the comparable number for last year, 55% below 1987 and 46% below 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest decrease this year has occurred in the uinincorporated 
areas, with the cities of Costa Mesa and Tustin also registering big drops. 
Among the cities with more permits this year, only Fullerton's increase is 
notable.

DISCOVERY: THE CAPISTRANO DEPOT RESTAURANT AND SALOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
If you have an appreciation of the historical and are not averse to drinking 
and reveling, the Capistrano Depot, with its feel of an old Western saloon -- 
smoky, dark -- is the place for you. 
</P>
<P>
There is history here, as one would expect from Orange County's oldest village. 
The Santa Fe Railroad Station, built in 1895, boasts handmade adobe bricks and 
mission-type tiles that reflect the Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
In recent times, the train depot has seen changes. In 1968, the Santa Fe 
Railway chose to discontinue its service to San Juan Capistrano. The old depot 
was not used by the railway for six years. But in 1974, after three years of 
negotiations with the railroad, the efforts of Pete and Jim Tyson paid off: 
They obtained a lease for the property and reopened the renovated depot as a 
rail-side restaurant, saloon and train shop. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Tysons, in May, 1974, Amtrak reinstated two train stops at 
San Juan Capistrano. Today, trains make 16 stops per day. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-minute trip from the Santa Ana train station ($5 one way; $10 round trip) 
drops a passenger off at the entrance of the Capistrano Depot. The passageway 
leads a visitor through nine interlocking railroad cars, including a caboose 
(formerly the Little Red Caboose Train Shop). The Pullman car, refurbished by 
the Tysons according to Pullman specifications, serves as a cocktail lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the cars are painted red. Their external walls bear replicas of original 
mid-'30s ads for Baby Ruth candy bars, Morton Salt, Chesterfield cigarettes, 
Red Man chewing tobacco and Tootsie Rolls. These cars house the dining room, 
the lower walls of which are paneled with wood. Slow-turning, belt-driven 
wooden fans hang from the ceiling. Tables and chairs provide the seating, as do 
actual train dining room seats, still upholstered with a faded broadloom 
fabric. A color reproduction of Franklin D. Roosevelt and route maps of the 
Atchinson, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad are displayed on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
In the saloon, the lower walls are made of oak. Antique shipping crates and 
steamer trunks are packed into baggage compartments over the bar area, and beer 
is still dispensed from an antique mechanism behind the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 5 to 9 p.m.; Saloon, 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. Address: 26701 Verdugo St., 
San Juan Capistrano

ON THE WATERFRONT: HER EYE FOR YACHTS IS NO ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Geri Conser's plane crashed into the ocean four years ago while she was 
photographing a national yacht race in Newport Beach, she thought her career as 
an aerial yachting photographer was over. Not only did she lose her cameras, 
photos and her own plane, which sank in 180 feet of water, she also broke her 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Since the crash, however, Conser's back has healed and her photography career 
has taken off like a high-flying jet. "There seems to be a mystique about 
someone who crashes in an airplane and survives. So the crash probably helped 
the business," says Conser, a licensed pilot who has been photographing boats 
from the air since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Conser often flies and shoots at the same time -- a task that is fairly simple 
when photographing a single subject, she says. 
</P>
<P>
For more complex assignments involving many boats, she hires a pilot to fly her 
Cessna while she snaps photos out the window on the passenger side. That's what 
she was doing when her plane went down in August, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day I am not sure what happened," Conser says. "We started to come out 
of a turn and the plane couldn't come out of it. The next thing I know -- bang 
-- we're in the water. The plane is filling up with water faster than anyone 
can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
The plane sank in minutes, about three miles off Newport Beach. "We were in the 
water 10 or 15 minutes, and a spectator boat came over and picked us up," says 
Conser, who suffered a compression fracture of her spine that she says caused 
her to lose two inches in height. 
</P>
<P>
Six days after getting out of the hospital, she was flying again. "I'm the type 
that if you fall off a horse, you get right back on," she says. But even though 
Conser began flying again, she was not so sure she could revive her aerial 
photography business, which she runs out of her home in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'This is totally the end of my career,' " says Conser, who was 45 
at the time of her crash. "I have crashed in a world-class regatta in my own 
home waters, in front of my yacht club people. I was really embarrassed. I 
thought I'd quit the business. I thought no one would ever call me again." 
</P>
<P>
But Conser was wrong. People did call. And eight months later, she was back in 
the air, photographing the Newport-to-Ensenada yacht race. Since then, Conser's 
yacht photography business has grown steadily. During the spring and summer, 
when most yachting regattas are held, Conser is in the air nearly every weekend 
photographing events from Santa Barbara to San Diego. Two or three times a 
year, she travels as far north as San Francisco to photograph boats there. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Conser's customers are yacht owners who want aerial photos of their 
boats under full sail. "To boat owners, boats are like children. They can never 
get enough photos of them," says Conser, who recalls that one owner hired her 
for a two-hour session that used 10 rolls of film and cost nearly $1,000. Most 
private photo shoots take much less time and cost anywhere from $300 to $500, 
Conser says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to private shoots, she often photographs yachting regattas on 
speculation, hoping that she can sell her pictures to boat owners once they see 
the final, full-color product. And often a yacht club will hire Conser to shoot 
an event. "I just did a job for the San Diego Yacht Club," she says. "They 
wanted to give every person in the race an 8-by-10 photo of their boat as a 
participation trophy. There were 57 boats, and I had to photograph them in two 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Conser says the hardest part about aerial photography is neither the flying nor 
the photographing -- it's the cataloguing and organizing of the thousands of 
photos she takes each year. "This year I've probably shot 12,000 to 15,000 
images," she says. "I may shoot 50 rolls of film at a regatta. Then I take them 
to a processor that day, get them back, sort them and put them on the board for 
the racers to see when they get back to the clubhouse for the trophy 
presentation." 
</P>
<P>
Conser's photos often end up in yachting magazines and in photo exhibits in 
Orange County. She recently had a display of prints on view at the Art-A-Fair 
in Laguna Beach. "During the last four years, my career has snowballed," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Conser is a self-taught photographer who got her first camera in the early 
1970s. When she decided to become a professional photographer, she turned to 
boats and began carving out a niche for herself. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I had been in the marine business for 20 years," she says, "so 
photographing boats seemed natural." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, Conser took her pictures the hard way -- from land or from 
other boats. She remembers perching on a navigational marker once in the middle 
of a lake and taking photos of a boat as it sailed by. And she recalls climbing 
a cliff to gain a good vantage point for another photo. "I thought there must 
be a better way of doing this," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
For Conser, the better way was flying. So in 1973 she started taking flying 
lessons. "In the air, you get a real aesthetic view. I thought this is great. 
No more taking pictures from a navigational marker." 
</P>
<P>
Conser now owns a Cessna 150, which she keeps at John Wayne Airport. Despite 
her crash, she has developed no fear of flying. "I can see myself still taking 
pictures for another 20 years. I love flying and I love being on the water."
